           EXT. WEST TEXAS – DUSK

           Night’s curtain descends on the Texas plain.  The purple 
           teeth of the Franklin Mountains but deckled brush strokes in 
           the trembling distance.

           EXT. GRASSLANDS

           Jurassic silhouettes of rusted oil pump jacks bob their heads 
           like thirsty birds.  Forlorn sentinels to miles of open scrub 
           and the silent, ranging ghosts of Kiowa and Apache.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP

           A gravel inlay somewheres off the 213 between Chaparral and 
           Fort Bliss.  Truckers asleep in the cabs of their big rigs.

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - PARKING LOT

           MIKE BUCK steps down out of his Dodge Ram.  One calloused 
           hand on his belt buckle, he worries a toothpick and studies 
           the land.  His face too young to have eyes that old.

           MEXICANS in straw cowboy hats lean against the chrome bull 
           bar of a Mack truck, beers dealt out on the hood.  Cream-
           stitched accents in their flat brimmed Brush Hogs.  The men 
           lower their voices to mark Buck’s passing.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER - NIGHT

           A worn leather strap of shop bells betrays Buck’s entrance.  
           He takes a seat next to a grizzled old timer, NED.  Buck 
           folds his elbows on the service counter and cocks a 
           construction boot on the brass foot rail.  Pats drywall dust 
           off his flannel.

           AUNT GLADYS scoops crumbs from the counter with the front of 
           her apron.  Second she lays eyes on Buck she nods her head 
           grimly, cracks a bottle of Lone Star, slides it across the 
           countertop and gets a second bottle on deck. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Swing shift?

           Mike Buck sets to work on the Lone Star like he just crawled 
           across a desert.

                                 BUCK
                        Just staying outta trouble.
                                 NED
                        Believe that when I see it.  You 
                        gonna hold this job?

           Buck nods to him, acknowledging him.

                                 BUCK
                        Ned.

           Ned slides his fifth infantry zippo across the paneled 
           counter to Gladys who lights a Pall Mall and squints as she 
           does it.

           Gladys cracks open Mike’s second beer.

                                 GLADYS
                        You'll be alright.  Just cool your 
                        hot head until probation run out.  
                        Then you can go back to being a 
                        lunatic.

           Buck drinks the second beer slower.  Gladys’ Pall Mall 
           spiraling blue smoke in a thin, slow coil.

                                 BUCK
                        Was thinking I might join reserves. 
                        Maybe get active duty again.

                                 NED
                        Shit boy, you already done two 
                        pumps.

                                 GLADYS
                        You’re like a con who wants to get 
                        back in jail for the free meals.

           Ned wags his head at Buck, goitered neck wobbling like a 
           turkey’s waddle.

                                 NED
                        When I come back from my war I had 
                        scrambled eggs for brains.

                                 GLADYS
                        Still do.

                                 NED
                        Battle will do things to a man.

                                 BUCK
                             (shrugs)
                        Man's shooting at you, easiest 
                        thing in the world to shoot back.
                                 NED
                        So what eats at you?  You were a 
                        good kid before you gone overseas.  
                        Now every time you head into a bar 
                        you come out in the back of a 
                        police car.

                                 BUCK
                        It ain’t the shooting that eats at 
                        me.

           Buck takes another inch off his beer.  Staring into the 
           bottle’s iris like a portal to his memories.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        First time I killed I was ten years 
                        old.  Mom still alive.  We come 
                        home from the doctors in Odessa and 
                        the sliding glass door to the 
                        backyard is all smashed in and 
                        blood all on the carpet. I got the 
                        shotgun out the closet while my mom 
                        called the police.  Followed the 
                        blood trail upstairs to the bedroom 
                        and pushed open the door.  And my 
                        hand on the bible, there’s a full 
                        on eight-point buck standing in my 
                        mom’s bedroom.  Beautiful rack of 
                        antlers.  He’s just standing on the 
                        area rug, right between the TV and 
                        the Nordic Track.  Panting.

           Ned and Gladys lean in on the bar, picturing the scene in 
           their minds.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        It was the October rut.  Buck musta 
                        been standing in the backyard, seen 
                        its reflection in the sliding glass 
                        door and charged.  Then couldn’t 
                        figure out where it was and howda 
                        get out.  Run upstairs and got 
                        stuck in my mom’s bedroom.

                                 NED
                        What did you do?

           Buck takes a sip off his beer.  Across the bar, TWO MEXICANS 
           in a corner booth conspire in hushed whispers.  Their black 
           bolo ties tipped with braided silver aiguilettees.

                                 BUCK
                        The buck and I looked at each other 
                        a good while.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        Him just as shocked to see me.  
                        Both of us breathing heavy and him 
                        with blood frothing off his flank 
                        and all that glass stickin outta 
                        him.  There wasn’t much else to be 
                        done about it.

           Buck takes a long pull off his Lone Star and wipes his mouth 
           with the back of his hand.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        There was a woman in Iraq I coulda 
                        saved but didn’t.  She looked at me 
                        with those same eyes.  That’s what 
                        I think about.  That’s what eats at 
                        me.

           Buck sets to peeling the label off his Lone Star, turning the 
           bottle in his hands.  Then tries to force a smile.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Venison’s good the first night.  
                        But after a month or two you start 
                        dreaming about pizza.  

           Ned shakes his head.

                                 NED
                        I got back from my war I couldn't 
                        walk in a room without looking for 
                        the exits.

                                 GLADYS
                        My late husband Ernie, you remember 
                        Ernie.  Every Fourth a July those 
                        fireworks’d pop off he'd be running 
                        for the bushes like a jackrabbit.

           Gladys' chest rattles with a chuckle that ends in a cough.  
           She spits phlegm into a napkin, appraising it with a cocked 
           eyebrow before crinkling it up.

                                 NED
                        Funny things to a man.

                                 GLADYS
                        Every time Ernie’d leave the house 
                        I’d see him checking windows and 
                        rooftops.  Just couldn’t seem to 
                        convince himself there’s no one 
                        trying to shoot him.
                                 BUCK
                        I’ll allow I’ve done that bit 
                        myself.

           Gladys leans forward on her elbows, her deep nicotined voice 
           dropping to a baritone whisper.

                                 GLADYS
                        You'll find time'll fix all that.

           Buck nods.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, son.

           Her eyes make crow’s feet as she draws deeply on the Pall 
           Mall.  She blows smoke out the side of her mouth.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        You are not the child of your past.  
                        You are the father of your future.

           Buck looks up and holds her gaze.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t help that woman in Iraq.  
                        Fine.

           Gladys leans in closer.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        Find another woman to help.

           She lets Buck chew on that a while.  From the Juke Box, Patsy 
           Cline fills in the silence with more loneliness.

           And all at once THE LIGHTS CUT OUT.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        Gaddangit.

           Darkness.

                                 GLADYS (CONT’D)
                        Happens every time Eddie runs the 
                        trash compactor.

                                 BUCK
                        Aunt Gladys, where’s your circuit 
                        breaker at?

                                 GLADYS
                        Wall outside the John.
           Buck stands, hitching up his jeans by the belt straps.

                                 BUCK
                        Hell, I’ll get it.  Heading there 
                        anyways.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Buck’s fingertips trace the wood paneling to steady his way.  
           He finds the fuse panel and flips the circuit breakers.

           LIGHT RETURNS TO THE DINER as Patsy Cline’s voice lurches 
           back into key.  The twang of the steel guitar haunting and 
           desolate.

           Buck takes his beer into the bathroom with him.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER - BATHROOM

           Buck runs a tired hand over his face.  Jaundiced in the 
           cornmeal light of the 30 Watt bulb.  

           Buck pulls a prescription bottle of Prazosin from his jeans 
           pocket.  The label reads, “Anxiety, PTSD, Panic Disorder.”  

           He palms his last two pills, downing them with a swallow of 
           beer.  Then chucks the empty bottle in the trash can.

           One last glance in the mirror.  He was handsome before he was 
           broken.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Buck returns along the panelled hallway.  Walls hung with 
           framed black and whites of Country Western singers long 
           forgotten.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Buck steps back into the diner and finds EVERYONE SHOT DEAD.

           THE TWO MEXICANS IN THE CORNER BOOTH – tagged in the 
           forehead.  One face forward in his chicken fried steak.

           NED - lying belly-down under the bar stools, an exit wound 
           spreading crimson on the vintage tooling of his scully shirt.

           AUNT GLADYS - one ankle-nyloned leg askew, jutting from 
           behind the counter.
                                 BUCK
                        Oh, dear God.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER - BUCK

           leans across the counter top.  GLADYS’ FACE CAVED IN LIKE A 
           SMASHED PUMPKIN.

           The register lying open – cash gone and change scattered 
           across the counter top.

                                 BUCK
                        God of mercy.

           BUCK’S PUPILS DILATE, his breath coming in fast and thick.

           Patsy Cline bravely soldiers on, singing of solitude and 
           heartbreak.

           OUTSIDE, A CAR DOOR SHUTS and an ENGINE TURNS.

           BUCK SQUATS LOW TO THE GROUND AND CRAWLS TO THE WINDOW.  He 
           cups his hands to peer into the night.

           EXT. SHERWOOD DINER - SAME

           A POLICE BLACK AND WHITE turns on its lights and merges onto  
           Interstate 213, GUM BALLS FLASHING.

           INT. SHERWOOD DINER - BUCK

           grabs the rotary phone by the register. HE HAMMERS THE SWITCH 
           HOOK, but the line is dead.

                                 BUCK
                        C’mon, goddamn it!

           BUCK HEARS A MOAN BEHIND HIM.  An awful, haunted sound.  Buck 
           VAULTS OVER THE COUNTER TOP to reach EDUARDO, the line cook.

           INT. KITCHEN - EDUARDO

           lies on the ground in his white apron and hair net.  He has 
           defensive wounds...a BULLET HOLE straight through both palms 
           and into his neck.  BUCK STRUGGLES TO HOLD EDUARDO’S NECK 
           TOGETHER.

                                 EDUARDO
                        He visto la cara de la muerte.  El 
                        rostro del mal.
           Eduardo is in shock.  Buck, using his whole fist to staunch 
           the wound, applying pressure, hot blood running everywhere.

                                 EDUARDO (CONT’D)
                        Tengo una botella de Cuervo debajo 
                        de la estufa.

                                 BUCK
                        Right – disinfectant!

           Buck grabs the bottle of Cuervo from under the range.  
           Unscrews it and hands it to Eduardo.

           Eduardo just drinks and drinks.

           Then relaxes.  His eyes closed.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What happened, Eddie?

           Eduardo’s eyes focus on Buck.

                                 EDUARDO
                        El policia entro.  Le disparo al 
                        hombre en la mesa de la esquina a 
                        quemaropa.  Despues le disparo a 
                        Gladys y a todos los demas. 

                                 BUCK
                        Fue un robo?

                                 EDUARDO
                        No vacio la caja hasta que le 
                        disparo a todos.  Como si le 
                        ocurrio despues.

           Eduardo is bleeding out, losing blood pressure in his head – 
           passing out.

                                 BUCK
                        Eddie, vamos a buscar ayuda.  Todo 
                        estara bien.  Que puedo hacer?

           Buck hands Eduardo a towel to staunch the wound, but it is a 
           futile gesture.

                                 EDUARDO
                        Solo encuentralo, Mike.  
                        Encuentralo y capturalo.

           Buck and Eduardo share a last look.  Eduardo’s eyes, 
           pleading.
                                 EDUARDO (CONT’D)
                        Find him.

           BUCK TURNS AND RUNS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

           BUCK RACES ACROSS THE PARKING LOT like a stone from a 
           slingshot.  He hops in his truck and pops the clutch so hard 
           he STALLS THE ENGINE.

           He starts her up again, knuckles gripping the wheel, and 
           TEARS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY.

           INT. DODGE RAM - BUCK

           SLAMMING THROUGH ALL FIVE GEARS.  He wills the Dodge faster 
           until he spots flashing blue and red sirens half-a-mile 
           ahead.  Buck’s pumping so much adrenaline he’s PUNCHING THE 
           ROOF OF HIS DODGE.

           He marks the squad car pulling off the highway into a motel 
           parking lot.

           Buck passes the lot.  Then kills his headlights, U-turns, and 
           DOUBLES BACK.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 PARKING LOT – BUCK

           on foot, low-lining through the lot.  Crouches behind a 
           screen of yucca and elderberry, a spindly deodar crowning his 
           head like a rack of antlers.

           No sound but the Argon buzz of neon lights off the vacancy 
           sign.

           BUCK’S POV ON:

           THE POLICE OFFICER standing in the Motel front office, 
           talking to the NIGHT CLERK.

           The Officer has a cold, unflinching gaze and casually rests a 
           backhand on his holster.
           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

           Buck approaches the empty squad car.  The gentle noises of 
           the engine settling.

           He squints at the plates.  TEXAS STATE EXEMPT.  No tags.

                                 BUCK
                        Who in the hell are you?

           Buck creeps around the passenger side.  Finds the window 
           rolled down a few inches.

           He pushes up his sleeve, fits an arm inside the window, and 
           POPS THE DOOR LOCK.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - BUCK

           glancing up at the Motel front office.  But the Officer’s 
           back is still to him.  Buck is sweating pretty good.

           Buck opens the door of the squad car.  He runs a thumb along 
           the door frame of the Crown Vic until he spots a VIN number.

           INT. SQUAD CAR - BUCK

           pops the glove box.  Finds paper and pen and scratches down 
           the VIN number.

           Buck grabs all the paperwork from the glove box and stuffs it 
           in his shirt pocket.  He’s about to shut the door and bolt... 

           ...When he spots a pair of LATEX GLOVES on the passenger 
           seat.  And underneath, a BLACK LEATHER SATCHEL.

           Buck grabs the satchel and quietly shuts the door.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 PARKING LOT - BUCK

           DASHES BACK TOWARD HIS TRUCK, then stops on his heels.  He 
           runs back to the patrol car and OPENS THE DOOR AGAIN.

           Buck uses the sleeve of his flannel to wipe down the door 
           handle and glove box.

           Buck looks up.  And inside the Motel Office, the Police 
           Officer is STARING DIRECTLY AT HIM.

           BUCK HITS THE DIRT AND FREEZES.
           INT. MOTEL 6 - FRONT OFFICE

           The Police Officer carefully licks his palm and parts his 
           hair.

           He sees only his reflection in the brightly lit windowpane.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - BUCK

           races back to his truck and GUNS IT OUT OF THE PARKING LOT.

           INT. DODGE RAM - NIGHT

           MIKE BUCK SPEEDS DOWN THE INTERSTATE with no lights on for a 
           mile until his heart rate settles back down.  Buck pulls onto 
           the shoulder and into a ditch and kills the engine.

                                 BUCK
                        Sonuvabitch.  Settle down, Buck.

           He smacks on the dome light and looks at the car registration 
           forms he snatched from the glove box.  They are nothing but 
           Chinese takeout receipts.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Who are you, you bastard.

           Buck holds the black satchel in his lap and unzips it.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Breath easy.

           Buck reaches inside and pulls out a plastic Ziploc bag...

           ...It contains $60,000 in machine-counted stacks of $100 
           bills.

           Buck’s breathing so quick he’s liable to fog the windshield.

           He reaches into the satchel again and pulls out a WALTHER 
           P99.  Fitted with laser unit and silencer.

           The semi-automatic is sealed in a plastic Ziploc bag, the 
           muzzle bore still warm to the touch.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        God almighty.

           Buck settles his breathing and reaches into the leather 
           satchel one last time.

           He removes a stack of papers.  Rap sheets.
           Each sheet contains a name, DMV photo, and address for a 
           different person.  There are ten sheets of paper.  Eight of 
           the names are X-ed out in red pen.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        This can’t be.

           Buck looks at the ninth page and studies the DMV photo.  He 
           recognizes the face.  The black bolo tie with silver 
           aiguilettees...  One of the MEXICAN MEN KILLED IN THE 
           SHERWOOD DINER.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You a stone cold hit man.

           Buck looks at the tenth rap sheet.  Examines the DMV photo.

           A woman.  Sooty-lashed.  Auburn and almond.  Bout as pretty 
           as a DMV photo can be.

           NAME: JANIE COLE

           ADDRESS: 47 Pinewoods Bluff, Las Cruces, NM.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Lady, you the last one standing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EL PASO POLICE DEPT – MISSION VALLEY STATION – NIGHT

           Mike Buck SLAMS OPEN THE DOUBLE DOORS.  Eduardo’s dried blood 
           on his shirt, the black satchel clutched in his fist.

           Buck cuts the entire waiting line and walks straight to the 
           Duty Chief – interrupting the report he is taking.

                                 BUCK
                        A woman is going to die – you gotta 
                        help her!

           The Duty Chief, JIM BENSON, looks up over the tops of his 
           wire frame glasses.  Grey showing in his clippered beard.

                                 JIM
                        Take a number and a seat.  These 
                        here folks been waiting on line.

           Buck just stands there, a live wire, swaying foot to foot.

                                 BUCK
                        I need to talk to someone right 
                        now.
                                 JIM
                        Sir, I ast you to take a seat and 
                        wait your turn on line.

                                 BUCK
                        The hell with that!  I just seen 
                        five people murdered at the 
                        Sherwood Diner off 213.  A 
                        goddamned cop did it!

           Officer Jim Benson gets to his feet.  He has stooped 
           shoulders and an insulin pump clipped to his belt like a 
           pager.

                                 JIM
                        You been at the Sherwood Diner?

                                 BUCK
                        What I said.  There’s a Officer on 
                        a killing spree.

           Jim takes in Buck’s bloody shirt and the shell shock written 
           on his face.  Jim eyes the civilians in the waiting room and 
           makes a judgement call.

                                 JIM
                        Son, why don’t you come back here 
                        and tell me about it.

           Jim shuts the bullet-proof glass of his service window and 
           unlocks the door for Buck to enter the station offices.

           INT. EL PASO POLICE DEPT - OFFICES

           Jim gestures Buck to a seat by his desk.

                                 JIM
                        How about you take it slow.  Tell 
                        me everything?

           Buck doesn’t sit down.  He just starts in to talking a mile a 
           minute.

                                 BUCK
                        Officer came in and shot everyone 
                        point blank.  My Aunt Gladys, Ned, 
                        and two Mexican gentlemen in the 
                        back booth.  Aunt Gladys is about 
                        the only family I got left.

           Jim Benson catches a heavy whiff of alcohol on Buck’s breath 
           and snaps his head back on reflex.
                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        The line cook told me it weren’t no 
                        robbery.  Said the officer shot 
                        everybody and only pulled out the 
                        register as he was leaving.  Like 
                        it was a afterthought.

                                 JIM
                        Easy, son.  We got officers over 
                        there now.  Had a trucker call it 
                        in on CB not 20 minutes ago.

           Jim eyes the dried blood stains spider-webbed on Buck’s arms.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Trucker saw a fellow in a 1990 
                        Dodge Ram with two-toned panelling 
                        blowing outta that diner faster 
                        than a scalded dog.

                                 BUCK
                        That’s right.  That was me.

           Buck reaches into the black satchel and pulls out the semi-
           automatic.

           JIM IS ON HIS FEET, his hand on his holster.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I chased him to the Motel 6.  
                        Stoled this gun out his squad car.

           Jim Benson is on full alert.  The blood on Buck’s flannel 
           still wet enough to stain the corner of Jim’s desk.

                                 JIM
                        I’ma radio this in real quick.  
                        Need you to just relax and sit 
                        tight.  You made a good choice 
                        coming in here.

           Buck is overwhelmed with relief.

                                 BUCK
                        Thank you.  Thank you, officer.

           INT. EL PASO POLICE DEPT - CUBICLES

           Jim moves a few cubicles down to put a call in on his radio.  
           He keeps his eyes locked on Buck.
           INT. EL PASO POLICE DEPT - OFFICES

           Buck rocks back and forth on his boots, unable to keep still.

           He picks up one of Jim’s cards from the business card holder 
           on his desk.  Runs a thumb over the gloss and tucks it in his 
           shirt pocket.

           Buck is nauseous from adrenaline.  He clutches his stomach 
           and puts his head between his legs.

           Jim returns, hand on his holster.

                                 JIM
                        The bullets at the diner are .40 
                        caliber Smith and Wesson.

                                 BUCK
                        Sounds about right.

                                 JIM
                        That a Walther P99 you got there?

                                 BUCK
                        Yessir.

                                 JIM
                        Son, I need you to stand up and put 
                        your hands against the wall.

                                 BUCK
                        Beg your pardon?

                                 JIM
                        You heard me just fine.

           Jim unholsters the speedcuffs from his utility belt.  Buck’s 
           blood starts pumping fast.

                                 BUCK
                        You got this all wrong.

           Sweat breaks out all over Buck’s body.  His breath quickens 
           and his hands begin to tremor.

                                 JIM
                        Go ahead and put that gun on my 
                        desk, there.  Turn around nice and 
                        slow for me and put your hands 
                        against the wall.

           Buck draws the handgun from the Ziplock bag.
                                 BUCK
                        I will do no such thing til you 
                        listen to me.

           Jim fumbles the leather strap on his holster.

           Buck thumbs his safety, racks the slide, and LEVELS HIS SEMI-
           AUTO AT JIM.  Boy is quick as a whip crack.

                                 JIM
                        You want to think about what you do 
                        next.

           Buck’s eyes widen exophthalmically.  His pulse showing in his 
           neck and temples.

                                 BUCK
                        Listen to me, I didn’t do this.  I 
                        come in here trying to help.  I 
                        already got two priors this year 
                        and I ain’t going back in for 
                        nothing.

           Jim radios into his shoulder mic.

                                 JIM
                        10-33, all units, requesting backup

                        You gotta listen to me!  I’m trying 
                        to help you!

                        - suspect is armed, this is Officer 
                        Jim Benson requesting backup -

           Buck loses all control.  Eyes rolling, shell-shocked.  He’s 
           screaming like he’s in combat.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re not listening to me!  I 
                        ain’t going back in!  You coulda 
                        just listened to me!

           Gripping the Walther P99, Buck shoulders the satchel and 
           backs out of the offices.

           Jim Benson, palms in the air, watches him exit.
           SECURITY CAMERAS catch Buck’s face, twisted in anguish, as he 
           shoulders the emergency exit door and takes off into the 
           night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DODGE RAM - MOVING

           BUCK PEELS OUT OF THE PARKING LOT, gravel spinning off the 
           tires.

           He PUNCHES THE STEERING WHEEL again and again.

                                 BUCK
                        What’d I get myself into!

           EXT. EL PASO - MISSION VALLEY

           A BLACK AND WHITE, coming up fast on Piedras Street, FLIPS ON 
           ITS SIRENS AND GIVES CHASE.

           A second squad car SKIDS OFF OF COPIA STREET and joins the 
           pursuit.

           INT. DODGE RAM - BUCK

           BOOKING IT UP THE 478 to Fort Bliss.  His jaw set and 
           determined.

           EXT. EL PASO - VETERAN’S PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Buck’s pickup JUMPS THE CURB at Salem Drive.

           The two cruisers pursue, SIRENS WAILING.

           BUCK OFF-ROADS ACROSS VETERAN’S PARK, swerving around park 
           benches and the nomad tents of the homeless.

           EXT. EL PASO - MISSION VALLEY STREETS

           Buck’s Dodge crashes down onto Rushing Road, SPARKS FLYING 
           OFF THE MUFFLER.

           The gap is too much for the first Ford Crown Victoria.  It 
           BOTTOMS OUT IN THE ROAD DRAINAGE and is left dragging its 
           bumper.

           The second squad car follows too close and REAR ENDS THE 
           FIRST.  The two cars spin out, SKIDDING TO A STOP.
           Their wide yellow headlights like owl’s eyes staring dumbly 
           into the empty night.

           INT. DODGE RAM

           Buck adjusts his rearview mirror.  The cops seem to be 
           alright.  He checks his breathing, wipes the sweat off his 
           face, and puts the pickup back into gear.

           EXT. EL PASO - MISSION VALLEY

           The Dodge cuts its headlights and disappears into the shadows 
           of the foothills.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Mike Buck barrels into the dark kitchen.  Horizontal blinds 
           cast tiger stripes across his body.

           He rifles through his prescription bottles on the counter, 
           reading labels in the dark, NOT FINDING HIS PRAZOSIN.

                                 BUCK
                        Damn, damn...

           Buck savagely RIPS OPEN THE FRIDGE.  Seizes the last bottle 
           of Lone Star from a cardboard six pack, twists off the cap 
           with his forearm and GUZZLES IT.

           Buck wipes his mouth with the back of his hand and licks it 
           clean.  He is sweating and his hands shaking.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon...

           Buck violently rifles through cabinets, FLINGING THEM WIDE - 
           cereal spilling onto the floor.  Rips opens the recycling and 
           pulls out an empty bottle of Lone Star.  Tips it to his lips, 
           but cannot get the very last drops.

           BUCK SMASHES THE BEER BOTTLE IN THE SINK, licking the 
           remaining alcohol from the shards of glass.

           HE SHATTERS EACH STALE BOTTLE, cradling the wet glass to his 
           lips.  Splintered fragments scattered across the counter top.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I coulda helped...
           Buck sinks to the kitchen tiles, pressing the heels of his 
           palms into his eye sockets, his mouth twisted in a silent 
           scream.  He covers his ears from a violent noise he alone is 
           privy too.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        God help me.  Please.

           SIRENS WAIL IN THE DISTANCE.  Buck’s body snaps rigid and 
           alert.

           He moves to the cloth-curtained windows of the breakfast nook 
           and listens as the SIRENS CALL FAR INTO THE NIGHT.

           Buck moves to the sink, splashing cooling water on his face.  
           Palms away the salt of sweat and tears.

           Buck pulls the rap sheets from his satchel and examines a 
           woman’s DMV photo.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Janie Cole.

           Buck breathes deeply.  Notches a finger to his pulse and 
           marks time on the kitchen wall clock.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        47 Pine Woods Bluff.

           Buck makes a decision.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN TRACT HOUSE – NIGHT

           Buck opens the front screen door and raps the door knocker.  
           He stands back to survey the neighborhood, hunching his 
           shoulders against a light rain.

           He checks the sight lines and rooftops.

           Buck BANGS LOUDER on the door with his fist.  A neighbor’s 
           dogs bark - it’s the middle of the night.

           A woman’s voice answers.

                                 JANIE [O.S.]
                        Who is it?

                                 BUCK
                        Is this Janie Cole?
                                 JANIE
                        Who’s asking?

                                 BUCK
                        My name is Mike Buck.

                                 JANIE
                        Well, Mike Buck.  If you’ve come 
                        selling something, your watch is 
                        about twelve hours fast.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m sorry to bother you in the 
                        middle of the night, ma’am.  But I 
                        gotta talk to you.

                                 JANIE
                        Why don’t you come back tomorrow 
                        when you’ve slept it off.  Matter 
                        of fact, don’t come back tomorrow 
                        when you’ve slept it off.
                             (then, cheerfully)
                        G’night, now!

           Buck squints into the drizzling rain, falling harder now.  
           This isn’t going quite how he was figuring on.

           Buck opens the screen door and KNOCKS AGAIN.

                                 BUCK
                        Ma’am, you’re in great danger.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike Buck, you mind getting off my 
                        porch ‘fore I call the police?

                                 BUCK
                        Please, I don’t want to come in.  
                        Just need to talk to you is all.

                                 JANIE
                        It is nigh on midnight!  If you’re 
                        some kinda Jehovah’s Witness, so 
                        help me I will shoot you where you 
                        stand.

           The banshee wail of a lone police siren RISES IN THE NIGHT. 

           The hairs stand up on Buck’s neck.  He loses all patience.

                                 BUCK
                        Ma’am, there is a very dangerous 
                        man out there wants to kill you!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        Shot my Aunt Gladys and four others 
                        at the Sherwood Diner outta 
                        Chaparral.  You got to let me in!

           Janie is having none of it.

                                 JANIE (O.S.)
                        I gotta shotgun with “Mike Buck” 
                        written on the muzzle.

           Buck gropes in his satchel for the ten rap sheets.  He reads 
           Janie’s.

                                 BUCK
                        Your name is Janie Cole.  You drive 
                        a white 1993 Dodge Colt Hatchback, 
                        license plate 5JBY947.  You 
                        graduated Baylor with a degree in 
                        journalism –

                                 JANIE
                        This ain’t funny!  I’m calling the 
                        police right now.

           The approaching police siren GROWS LOUDER.  Buck’s eyes widen 
           in panic.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re too late for that!

           Buck jiggles the doorknob and BANGS ON THE DOOR.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Please, just listen to me.  He’s 
                        coming!  You gotta hide yourself!

           Buck watches the RED AND BLUE STROBES gliding fast through a 
           copse of canyon maple on the approaching alameda.

           The squad car siren CUTS OFF.  There is no sound now but 
           driving rain.  The FLASHING LIGHTS CLOSING IN.

           BUCK DRIVES HIS SHOULDER INTO THE DOOR ONCE, TWICE.

           Inside, Janie screams.

                                 JANIE
                        Get on outta here!  Leave me be!

           Frantic now, Buck SHATTERS A WINDOWPANE WITH HIS ELBOW, 
           reaches through the glass, and unlocks the door.

           HE SHOVES HIS WAY INSIDE.
           INT. TRACT HOUSE - BUCK

           SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT and immediately parts the window dressing 
           to watch the approach of the squad car.

           JANIE COLE SMASHES A HEAVY LAMP OVER BUCK’S HEAD.  Shards 
           scatter across the melamine floor.

           Buck drops to his knees, clutching his head in agony.

                                 BUCK
                        Goddang-it, lady.

                                 JANIE
                        I want you out!

                                 BUCK
                        He’s coming this second!

           Janie cuts through the den to the kitchen.  

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I was at the Sherwood Diner off the 
                        213.  Police officer come right in 
                        and shot five people. 

           Buck lopes after her.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        My Aunt Gladys, Ned, the line cook - 
                        everybody...

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - DEN - CONTINUOUS

           Buck stops short.  Janie is returning from the kitchen with a 
           CHEF’S KNIFE CLUTCHED IN HER HAND.  She squares off.

           Buck collapses his arms at his sides and looks at the 
           ceiling.  He runs a tired hand across his brow.

                                 BUCK
                        Why is it so hard to help people?

           At that moment, Janie and Buck hear the creak of the SCREEN 
           DOOR OPENING.

           Both freeze and listen.

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

           A GLOVED HAND reaches through the shattered windowpane and 
           twists the dead bolt.
           The front door glides open, silent as a wafting breeze.  
           Raindrops gather on the doormat.

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - DEN

           Buck grabs Janie’s knife hand and twists it behind her back.  
           The other hand he CLAMPS OVER HER MOUTH.

                                 BUCK
                             (whispered)
                        Please.  Just keep quiet.  Please.

           Janie struggles violently.  They collapse to the ground.  
           Buck pythons his legs around her like a wrestler and HOLDS 
           HER TIGHT.

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - ENTRANCE WAY

           The standard police sidearm, the Glock 22, eases into the 
           doorway, fanning the room left to right.  But this sidearm is 
           fitted with a SOUND SUPPRESSOR.

           Two Belstaff leather tactical boots enter the house, silent 
           as tiger paws.  They carefully step over the wet and 
           scattered shards of the table lamp.

           One gloved hand quietly pushes the front door shut, locks it, 
           AND SLIDES HOME THE DEAD BOLT.

           A faint blue light shines from Janie’s open cell phone lying 
           on its side on the melamine floor tiles.  The gloved hand 
           picks it up.  Pockets it.

           The Police Officer’s vulpine eyes scan the dark.  His wet 
           mouth curls in a thin-lipped smile...

           Call him STARK.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - DEN

           Janie struggles free of Buck’s grasp, slipping his hand from 
           her mouth.

                                 JANIE
                        Help!  I’m in here!  In the den!

           Buck clamps his hand back over her mouth and Janie BITES DOWN 
           HARD.
                                 BUCK
                        Goddang it!

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - STARK

           moves quickly for the den, gun extended and shoulders flexed.  
           He pivots into the little room.  IT’S ALREADY EMPTY.  

           One exit - a doorway leading for the kitchen.

           Stark is too smart to chase.  He backs out of the den the way 
           he came.  Slipping through the living room to approach the 
           kitchen from a fresh angle.

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - KITCHEN - STARK

           steps and pivots, SWEEPING HIS GUN INTO THE KITCHEN.

           It appears empty.

           Again, JANIE SLIPS BUCK’S GRASP.  She stumbles from the 
           pantry alcove into the center of the kitchen floor.

                                 JANIE
                        Officer!  He’s right there by the 
                        pantry door!

           STARK RAISES HIS SIDEARM IN ONE FLUID MOTION AND AIMS IT 
           POINT BLANK AT JANIE’S HEART.

           A moment of confusion registers in Janie’s eyes before BUCK 
           BODY TACKLES HER TO THE GROUND.

           THREE SHOTS RING OUT – distorted by Stark’s sound suppressor.  
           Bullets SHATTER THE GLASS DOOR OF THE OVEN, ricocheting among 
           the iron heating racks.

           Buck OVERTURNS THE KITCHEN TABLE, sheltering Janie with his 
           body.

           INT. KITCHEN - BREAKFAST NOOK

           Janie and Buck tangled together on the linoleum tile floor.  
           Temporarily shielded from Stark’s line of fire.

           Janie too shocked to utter a sound.

           LIT CANDLES, upset by the kitchen table, IGNITE THE PLEATED 
           TABLECLOTH.
           Buck is transfixed by the SPREADING FIRE.  Panic and trauma 
           written in his eyes.

           INT. KITCHEN - STARK

           hears their frightened breathing from behind the breakfast 
           nook.  

                                 BUCK (O.S.)
                        I got your Walther P99!  The one 
                        you used to shoot everyone at 
                        Sherwood Diner.

           Stark steadies his underhand grip on the Glock and listens.

                                 BUCK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’d love for this to be the gun 
                        that kills you.

           Stark turns on the KITCHEN LIGHTS.

           He wraps one gloved hand around the brass curves of the 
           vintage chandelier over the kitchen table.  Then raises the 
           light closer to the ceiling.

           The chandelier casts Janie and Buck’s penumbra in bas-relief 
           onto the paneled wood of the breakfast nook.  Stark studies 
           the lie of the shadows.

           He releases the chandelier to swing in a slow ellipse, 
           carnival shadows dancing about the room.  STARK SWIVELS HIS 
           AIM on the breakfast nook and sees --

           lying on the floor, his Walther P99 rigid at arms length and

           a three shot burst – DEAFENING IN THE TINY KITCHEN.

           STARK SPINS AND DIVES, rolling into the --

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - DEN

           Stark comes up on one knee, leveling his gun back at the 
           kitchen and RETURNING FIRE but –
           INT. TRACT HOUSE - KITCHEN

           the screen door is already swinging shut, BUCK AND JANIE HIGH-
           TAILING IT ACROSS THE BACKYARD.

           INT. TRACT HOUSE - STARK

           his grey eyes narrowing to slits.  He licks his pallid lips 
           and smiles.

           Stark strides to the kitchen doorway, RISING FLAMES AT HIS 
           BACK.  He carefully scans the open yard.  Then pursues.

           EXT. TRACT HOUSE BACKYARDS - NIGHT

           Buck and Janie DASH HALF BLIND THROUGH THE POURING RAIN.

                                 JANIE
                        He was aiming right for me.  He 
                        meant to kill me!

                                 BUCK
                        You believe me now?

                                 JANIE
                        But he’s a cop!

                                 BUCK
                        You ever seen a cop with a 
                        silencer?

           Janie’s now seeing Buck for the first time.

                                 JANIE
                        Who are you?

           Buck runs as fast as Janie can keep up.  Her fluffy blue 
           house slippers suctioning in the mud.

                                 BUCK
                        Faster now, he’s coming!

           Together, they cut across neighbor’s backyards.  Buck points 
           to a big TWO STORY HOUSE - all the lights dark.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You know who live here?

                                 JANIE
                        It’s foreclosed.  Been empty for 
                        months.
           EXT. FORECLOSED HOUSE - BUCK

           no hesitation -- hoists up a wrought iron patio chair and 
           SMASHES IT THROUGH THE SLIDING GLASS DOORS.

                                 JANIE
                        You outta your mind?

                                 BUCK
                        Yes ma’am, I believe I am.

           Buck tugs Janie right into the --

           INT. FORECLOSED HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM

           Buck stomps mud off his boots and watches his back trail.  He 
           unclips his semi-automatic and counts his remaining bullets. 

           Too few.

                                 BUCK
                             (assessing)
                        I saw a baby’s crib in your den.

                                 JANIE
                        She’s at my sister’s house for the 
                        night.

           Buck nods, then gives her a look.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I had a date tonight.
                             (then)
                        Didn’t go the way I was figuring 
                        on.

           Buck takes this in.

                                 BUCK
                        Where’s your daughter’s daddy?  Is 
                        he coming home?

           Janie takes a deep breath.

                                 JANIE
                        He ain’t with us anymore.

                                 BUCK
                             (quietly)
                        Dead overseas?
           Janie nods, curtly.  Buck opens the door to the garage a 
           sliver.  Then quickly backtracks with Janie up the carpeted 
           stairs.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRACT HOUSE BACKYARDS - STARK

           crosses the neighbors’ backyards.  Rain streaking down his 
           face and dripping off his chin.

           An older NEIGHBOR opens the screen door off his kitchen.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        Everything okay, Officer?  I heard 
                        gunshots from the Cole’s house.

                                 STARK
                        Everything’s under control.  Go 
                        inside.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        This is my property, Officer, and 
                        you on it.  I gotta right to know 
                        what the heck is going on!

           STARK NO-SCOPES THE NEIGHBOR - TAGS HIM JUST ABOVE HIS RIGHT 
           EYE.

           The neighbor’s head JERKS BACK, HIS BODY SLAMMED AGAINST THE 
           PORCH RAILING and collapsing.

           Stark is not interested in the neighbor.  He keeps moving 
           steadily.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FORECLOSED HOUSE – BUCK AND JANIE

           perch by the upstairs bedroom window, watching the approach 
           across the backyards.  They whisper.

                                 BUCK
                        Can’t believe I missed him.  Point 
                        blank range.

                                 JANIE
                        Prolly on account a someone biting 
                        your hand.

           Buck looks down at his hand and flexes it.  It’s more bruised 
           than bleeding.
                                 BUCK
                        I hope you’ve had all your shots.

           Buck mops the wet hair back off his forehead.

                                 JANIE
                        When’s the last time you shot a 
                        gun?

                                 BUCK
                        Baghdad.

                                 JANIE
                        What were you, like a marine?  
                        Seal?

                                 BUCK
                        Army.

                                 JANIE
                        What rank?

           THUNDER RUMBLES down off the Franklin Mountains to the north.

                                 BUCK
                        Sorry?

                                 JANIE
                        What rank?

           Buck grins.

                                 BUCK
                        Bullet sponge.

                                 JANIE
                        You can’t hear, can you?

           Buck points to his left ear.

                                 BUCK
                        Just in this side.

                                 JANIE
                        You gotta limp on that side too, 
                        don’t-chya.  V.A. paying out for 
                        that?

                                 BUCK
                        I’ll be alright.

           Rain rivulets running down the window glass appear to cast 
           streaming tears onto Buck’s face.
                                 JANIE
                        You’re a piece a trouble, aren’t 
                        you?

                                 BUCK
                        I s’pose I am.

           Buck studies the tree line for movement.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Here he come.

           Stark’s shadow glides across the patio, quiet as a wraith.

           INT. FORECLOSED HOUSE – STARK

           his Glock to the ground, steps in through the broken sliding 
           glass door.  He stands dripping in the dark family room.

           Stark closes his eyes to put all his awareness into his ears.  
           He tilts his head back and sniffs the air, concentrating.  
           Mouth open in a silent keen.

           Stark squats low to the ground.  And then he sees it.

           MUD TRACKS ON THE CARPET.

           Leading upstairs.

           INT. FORECLOSED HOUSE - STAIRWELL

           Stark’s boots on the edges of the birch treads where they 
           join the risers.  Ascending quickly without a sound.

           INT. FORECLOSED HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM

           Stark brushes open the bedroom door with the pads of his 
           gloved fingertips.  His gun site now on a 180 degree plane 
           with his right eye.

           Empty.

           Stark crouches to the floor.  Lowers his cheek to the carpet.  
           Canted light catches every filament of the plush pile weave.

           There.  Not three meters distant.  A few crumbs of alluvial 
           soil.  Cobalt and ferric against the stitched cream piling.

           Stark glides across the room with eidolonic grace, like smoke 
           in a breeze.  He studies the closet door.  WET FINGERPRINTS 
           EVAPORATING off the cold metal door knob.
           STARK FIRES A THREE SHOT BURST INTO THE CLOSET DOOR.  High, 
           middle, and low.  He steps to the side of the door and 
           listens.

           Nothing.

           Stark opens the closet door and turns on the light.

           On the floor are only two items...

           A muddy set of construction boots.  And a pair of fluffy blue 
           house slippers.

           THE CLOSET IS EMPTY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRACT HOUSE BACKYARDS - BUCK AND JANIE

           SPRINTING THROUGH THE POURING RAIN, their socks caked with 
           mud.  Buck herding Janie toward the street.

                                 BUCK
                        We’ll take your car, police’ll be 
                        lookin for mine.

           They reach her Dodge Colt hatchback, parallel parked under 
           the maples.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        It’s better if I drive.

           Janie takes him at his word.  She hands him the keys.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DODGE COLT HATCHBACK - MOMENTS LATER

           Buck BURNS OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD with the driving lights 
           off, nearly blind in the dark of the night.  

                                 JANIE
                        Where we going?

           Janie clutches the overhead hand grip, gritting her teeth 
           against Buck’s suicidal speed.

                                 BUCK
                        North.  They’ll be looking for me 
                        back in El Paso.
           Buck careens through the residential neighborhood at 50 mph, 
           blowing a stop sign every eight seconds.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Alright, who are you and what’ve 
                        you done?

                                 JANIE
                        I got no idea what you mean.

                                 BUCK
                        Lady, you’re on the hit list of a 
                        hired assassin!  Now I’m involved 
                        in this too and I got a right to 
                        know what you done.  I stuck my 
                        neck out for you and maybe you’re 
                        not worth helping.

           Buck zig-zags through the neighborhood grid - making a course 
           impossible to track.

                                 JANIE
                        I haven’t done anything!

                                 BUCK
                        You a criminal?  Involved in drugs?

                                 JANIE
                        Of course not.  Are you?

           Buck merges onto the 25 North.  He turns on the driving 
           lights and takes his speed up to 70 mph despite the pounding 
           rain.

                                 BUCK
                        Well, what do you do?

                                 JANIE
                        I’m a journalist.  I’m part time.

                                 BUCK
                        What paper?

                                 JANIE
                        I’m freelance.

           Buck grabs the ten rap sheets from the satchel and dumps them 
           in Janie’s lap.

                                 BUCK
                        I pulled these from his squad car.  
                        The first nine are dead.  The tenth 
                        one is you.
           Janie looks through the pages, nine of them marked off with a 
           red X.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Who are these people?  What do you 
                        have in common?

                                 JANIE
                        I don’t know.  I never seen these 
                        people before in my life.

                                 BUCK
                        Why are all these folks dead?  Why 
                        does an El Paso cop want to kill 
                        you?

           Janie sees her own rap sheet and covers her mouth in shock.

                                 JANIE
                        This my DMV photo!  Who has access 
                        to DMV photos?

                                 BUCK
                        Cops do.

           Skeins of water strafed by the windshield wipers refract the 
           opalescent rays of highway lights.

                                 JANIE
                        I gotta brother-in-law who’s a cop.  
                        They don’t just haul off and kill 
                        people for money.

                                 BUCK
                        I guess there’s an exception to 
                        every rule.

                                 JANIE
                        We outta just go to the police.

                                 BUCK
                        I had that same notion.  It did not 
                        pan out for me.

                                 JANIE
                        It doesn’t seem possible.

                                 BUCK
                        Three billion dollars a year 
                        crossing the border from Juárez.  I 
                        reckon they can turn a few cops if 
                        they’ve a mind to!
                                 JANIE
                        Well then we go to the FBI, 
                        something!  We in America.  This 
                        stuff dudn’t just happen!

           Out of the rain, the STROBE OF A POLICE CRUISER appears 
           behind them.

                                 BUCK
                        Sonovabitch.

           There is no siren, just lights.  COMING UP FAST.

                                 JANIE
                        How could he do that?

                                 BUCK
                        I-25 is the only route north outta 
                        Las Cruces.  He musta known I 
                        wouldn’t go back south to El Paso.  
                        Musta read my foolish mind.

           BUCK PUNCHES THE HATCHBACK UP TO 80 mph.  Windshield wipers 
           pumping, the highway asphalt shining with rainfall.

                                 JANIE
                        You gotta plan?

           Buck watches the cruiser in his rearview mirror CLOSING THE 
           GAP AT 90 MPH IN A RAINSTORM.

                                 BUCK
                        Hope he screws up before we do.

           The police cruiser SWERVES TO RAM THEIR BUMPER.  Buck slices 
           across the two lane highway, desperate to maintain traction 
           on the slick roads.

           Buck merges onto Interstate 187.

                                 JANIE
                        We could turn ourselves in at the 
                        police station.  They can’t all be 
                        bad cops!  Just explain to ‘em what 
                        happen at that diner?

           BIG RIGS materialize out of the rainstorm.  Like lumbering 
           mastodons on the two-lane highway.  Buck swerves into the 
           oncoming lane to pass them.

           Cars FISHTAIL AND SKID as the police cruiser PASSES ON THE 
           INSIDE LANE.  The squad car CLOSES IN.
                                 BUCK
                        Police got a witness who ID’d me at 
                        the crime scene.

                                 JANIE
                        So what?

           The Black and White moves in for another swipe.  Buck pumps 
           the gas too hard, slipping into an ACCELERATION SKID.

           The little hatchback HYDROPLANES.  In jaw-clenched terror, 
           Buck SPINS THE WHEEL INTO THE TURN and regains his traction.

                                 BUCK
                        So I got two priors, is what.

                                 JANIE
                        So?

                                 BUCK
                        So I’m just crazy enough to a done 
                        it.  Walked into the damn cop 
                        station waving the murder weapon 
                        for Gods sakes!

           A highway sign emerges from the gloom: TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES, 
           NEW MEXICO.  The Caballo Lake stretches out for miles off the 
           right shoulder of the road.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        So why don’t you tell me again.  
                        What do these people have on you?

                                 JANIE
                        I got no idea.

           Highway 187 is vacant through the Caballo Lake State Park.

           LIGHTS APPEAR AHEAD IN THE STORM.  Buck peers through the 
           slapping windshield wipers.

                                 BUCK
                        Almighty.

           PICKUP TRUCKS BLOCKADE the cliff-side road ahead.  Two pairs 
           of HIGH BEAMS AND RACK LIGHTS blind Buck and Janie.

           The trucks are flanked by flint eyed Chihuahans armed with 
           automatics.  Water streaming off the brims of their cowboy 
           hats.

           And standing in front, an FBI AGENT in a flack jacket.
                                 JANIE
                        Mike, what do we do?

           Buck grips the wheel, eyes searching for options...

           The CRUISER CHASING BEHIND, the GUN BLOCKADE AHEAD.  

           A cliff face to the left...  And a sheer drop off to the 
           reservoir on the right...

           Gunmen ahead raise their weapons, as the Dodge Colt races 
           toward them.

                                 BUCK
                        Hold on, Janie.

           Buck makes up his mind and YANKS THE STEERING WHEEL.  JANIE 
           SCREAMS.

           And the hatchback SMASHES THROUGH THE HIGHWAY CRASH BARRIERS.  
           The AIRBAGS DEPLOY IN MIDAIR, blinding them –

           -- THE LITTLE CAR FLOATS THROUGH SPACE 40 FEET IN THE SKY, 
           wheels spinning freely --

           --and gracefully arcs over Caballo Lake, PLUNGING INTO THE 
           FRIGID DEEP WITH A TREMENDOUS SPLASH.

           EXT. HIGHWAY 187 - NIGHT

           Stark SKIDS HIS CRUISER TO A HALT.  Steps out with the tires 
           smoking.

           Stark nods to the FBI Agent.  They advance to the edge of the 
           cliff face and watch the surging waters below.

           The splash of the Dodge Colt subsides, a few bubbles rising 
           to the surface.  The lake returns to placid but for the 
           limpid tickles of the drizzling rain.

           EXT. HIGHWAY 187 - STARK

           rests a boot on the galvanized steel crash barrier, now 
           twisted and bent.  Stark draws a pack of Camels from his 
           shirt pocket and shucks out a cigarette.

           He lights it with a match, inhales, and blows out the match 
           with the smoke.

                                 STARK
                        Brille una luz allí abajo.
           The Mexicans three-point their jeeps to cast their high beams 
           over rolling black water.  The pallid light sulphurous in the 
           steaming rain.

           The men study the lake in silence as if finding great meaning 
           in the diluvial churnings of the stygian deep.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow we move everything.  Ya 
                        está hecho.

           One by one, the men shoulder their rifles and clamber aboard 
           the corrugated beds of the idling pickups.  The FBI Agent 
           sidles into his dark blue sedan.

           Stark is the last to leave, flicking his spent cigarette into 
           the chill breath of the night.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. DODGE COLT HATCHBACK - NIGHT

           Janie and Buck return to consciousness in the smashed car.  
           They cough in the cloud of airbag smoke.  Buck wipes his 
           bloody nose with the back of his sleeve.

                                 BUCK
                        Are you okay?

                                 JANIE
                        My ribs hurt.

                                 BUCK
                        That’s your seat belt saving your 
                        life.

           Buck elbows down the deflating airbags to see out the front 
           windshield.  The headlights puncture the gloom no more than 
           three feet.  The lake bottom is as dark as the underworld. 

           Buck punches the dome light.

           BLACK TANNIC LAKE WATER RUSHES in through the air vents.  It 
           bubbles up, covering their feet, their legs, their laps.  

           Janie can't stop coughing from the airbag smoke.  She 
           struggles with her door, her lungs seizing up from the cold.

                                 JANIE
                        Unlock the doors!

                                 BUCK
                        They are unlocked!
           Janie pushes at her door, SHOVING WITH ALL HER STRENGTH.

                                 JANIE
                        Mine won't open!

           Janie POUNDS HER FISTS on her window.  Buck leans back in his 
           seat, resigned.

                                 BUCK
                        You won't be able to smash it.  The 
                        air pressure is too great.

                                 JANIE
                        We're trapped in here!

           Water gushes in, filling the back seat.  DEAFENING in the 
           tiny car.

                                 JANIE(CONT’D)
                        What do we do?

           Buck is breathing fast, but he’s in control.

                                 BUCK
                        We gotta wait.

                                 JANIE
                        For WHAT?

                                 BUCK
                        For the water to rise.  When the 
                        car fills up the pressure equals 
                        out and we can open them doors.

           Buck and Janie sit, WATER GUSHING IN past their bellies...

                                 JANIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 BUCK
                        Well, that’s what I figure.

           Underneath the water, Janie takes Buck’s hand and squeezes 
           hard.  They wait, black lake water rushing up to their 
           chests...

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        When I was in Tikrit with the 25th 
                        someone blew up an IED and a whole 
                        neighborhood went up in flames.  I 
                        had to guard injured troops ‘til 
                        they could fly in a UH-60.  This 
                        local woman’s pointing at a burning 
                        house and screaming about her kids.  
           The rushing water climbs around their necks.  Buck’s words 
           come in short bursts, his voice choked by the freezing water.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        But I can’t leave my post.  There’s 
                        local men everywhere, and none of 
                        ‘em are helping this woman neither.  
                        So she runs inside the burning 
                        building and never comes out.  And 
                        all of us men listen to her 
                        screaming for her kids until that 
                        building come down.

           Janie is shivering violently.  Her mouth pressed up toward 
           the roof, gulping air.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to say all that I 
                        guess.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, is it time?

           Buck looks as if he might prefer drowning to living.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Mike, we gotta go now.

           Buck looks at Janie and sees the desperation written on her 
           face.

                                 BUCK
                        I know it.  Let’s get on with it.

           Buck and Janie each gulp a last lungful of air and SHOVE OPEN 
           THEIR CAR DOORS.  MUSCLES STRAINING AGAINST THE PRESSURE.

           INT. CABALLO LAKE - NIGHT

           Two bodies rise through the murky deep.  Ten feet.  Then 
           twenty feet.

           Still they rise.

           EXT. CABALLO LAKE - NIGHT

           Buck and Janie BURST THROUGH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER, 
           gasping for air.  Treading water.  Janie coughing.

           Buck shushes her, keeping her quiet as he eyes the shoreline.
                                 BUCK
                        It’s okay, hush now.  It’s okay.

           Truck engines decrescendo on the southern horizon.  Aureate 
           headlights dying into the night.

           Shaking and shivering, Buck and Janie paddle to the shore.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ECONO LODGE – NIGHT

           Janie’s soaked clothing is draped on the radiator.  She 
           emerges from shower.  A towel wrapped tightly around her 
           body, another towel for a shawl, and a third towel wrapped 
           around her head in a hair turban.

           Buck jerks open the motel door, fresh from the rain.

                                 JANIE
                        Shut that door, you’re letting in 
                        the cold air.

           Buck toes the door shut and stands in the entryway wringing 
           water out his hair with his fingers.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you go?

                                 BUCK
                        Errands.

                                 JANIE
                        You left me alone here?

                                 BUCK
                        They think we’re dead.  Better’n 
                        that.  They think we at the bottom 
                        of the lake with the murder weapon, 
                        the rap sheets, and all the money.

           Buck produces a brown paper bag from under his flannel and 
           sets it on the night stand.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Tied everything up in a nice, 
                        pretty bow for ‘em.

           Buck strips off his flannel shirt stained with Eduardo’s 
           blood and throws it in the trash can.  He lays the stack of 
           machine-counted hundred dollar bills out on the dresser.
                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I counted it.  60 thousand.
                             (then)
                        Minus a few...

           Buck pulls a liter bottle of Wild Turkey from the brown bag 
           and breaks the seal.  He stands by the hot radiator in his 
           undershirt drinking.  

                                 JANIE
                        Really?

           Janie watches Buck guzzle whiskey.  His Adam’s apple bobbing 
           up and down until he comes up for air.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how I feel about that.

                                 BUCK
                        Ain’t about how you feel about it.  
                        This the only way I sleep.

           Janie holds the towels tightly around her body.  She has no 
           dry clothes to change into.

           She lies down on the queen size bed and pulls all the covers 
           up to her chin.  She leaves the lights on and closes her 
           eyes.

                                 JANIE
                        I’m supposed to be picking my 
                        daughter up in the morning.

                                 BUCK
                        You’re s’posed to be a lot of 
                        things.  You’re s’posed to be cold 
                        and dead at the bottom of a lake.

           Buck finds a chair and sets his feet up on the radiator.  He 
           folds his arms across his chest.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Can’t ride two horses with one ass.

           Janie keeps her eyes shut and the comforter pulled tight.

                                 JANIE
                        You gonna be alright there?

                                 BUCK
                        Like a pig in mud.

           Buck takes a pull off his whiskey.
                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Got my sleep medicine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ECONO LODGE - PREDAWN

           Buck wakes to the SOUND OF HIS OWN SCREAMS.

           He lies on the floor covering his ears.  Janie kneeling 
           beside him, shaking him.

                                 JANIE
                        It’s just a dream, Mike.  Just a 
                        dream.

           Buck takes deep breaths, clearing his head.  His heart 
           pounding.

                                 BUCK
                        Was I loud?

                                 JANIE
                        You just had a bad dream is all.

                                 BUCK
                        Did I make a fool a myself?

                                 JANIE
                        You did no such of a thing.

           Janie looks him over.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Look at you.  You’re freezing and 
                        your clothes still wet.

                                 BUCK
                        Radiator must be on a timer.

           Janie pulls the comforter from her bed and drapes it over 
           Buck.  He rights his overturned chair and sets back down.

                                 JANIE
                        Can’t let you freeze to death and 
                        save that officer the trouble of 
                        shooting you.

                                 BUCK
                        You gonna be warm enough without 
                        your blanket?
                                 JANIE
                        I got so many layers I’m fixed to 
                        roast.  You’ll wake up come morning 
                        and find me cooked to a crisp.

           Buck wraps the comforter about his shoulders.

                                 BUCK
                        Well I thank you, then.

                                 JANIE
                        Don’t be silly.

           Janie sits on the edge of the bed, still swathed in her 
           towels.  She unties the turban from her head and smooths her 
           hair.

           Buck stares ahead, peering into his past.  Worry has chiseled 
           lines on his forehead, but he is still handsome.

                                 BUCK
                        It was mortar fire that blew out my 
                        ear drum.

                                 JANIE
                        I know it.

                                 BUCK
                        You get to love the sound a mortar 
                        fire.

                                 JANIE
                        I hardly believe that.

                                 BUCK
                        You hear the mortar it means you’re 
                        okay.  It’s when you don’t hear it, 
                        means you’re dead.

           Janie watches Buck uncap the Wild Turkey and take a pull.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        That one time I didn’t hear it, I 
                        thought I was gone.

           False dawn shows through the diaphanous white window 
           curtains.  The rain has stopped.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        Mortar sucks the wind out of your 
                        lungs.  Eyes burning, nose burning, 
                        ears ringing, people screaming.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You look around to see which of 
                        your guys is dead and which are 
                        going home early.

           Janie just listens.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        A man’s shooting at you, you can 
                        shoot back.  But a mortar attack, 
                        ain’t much to do about it.  Just 
                        what they taught you in boot camp: 
                        tuck your head down and grab your 
                        nuts.

           Buck remembers he is talking to a lady.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Pardon my speech.

                                 JANIE
                        You just stay warm over there and 
                        try and get some sleep.

                                 BUCK
                        Yes ma’am.  I intend to.

           Janie lies down to go to sleep.  Neither she nor Buck close 
           their eyes for a long time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ECONO LODGE – DAWN

           The Franklin Mountains but pale adumbrations in the southern 
           sky.  Buck stands in the chill wind.

           Janie hands him a Styrofoam cup of black coffee from the 
           Motel office.  Buck warms his hands around it and watches 
           dawn rise on the Texas plains.

                                 BUCK
                        This the first time I ever woke up 
                        dead.

           Janie’s voice is hollow and empty.

                                 JANIE
                        It’ll be alright.

                                 BUCK
                        They say three times in your life, 
                        everything you were expecting will 
                        turn out to be wrong.

                        And you’ll be forced to rethink 
                        your whole life.

           Crows festoon the skeletal fingers of a desiccated cottonwood 
           backlit in the grey light.

                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        I guess this makes number two for 
                        me.

           Radio towers and water towers stand limned against the 
           curdled heavens.

           Janie and Buck watch night retreat across the lowlands.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PINECREST DINER - MORNING

           Janie and Buck eat in a booth looking out on the parking lot.  
           Buck digs into his huevos rancheros.  Puncturing the yolks to 
           let them run into his Spanish rice.

                                 BUCK
                        You thought up which of your 
                        newspaper articles put you on a hit 
                        list?

                                 JANIE
                        I been thinking on that.  Could be 
                        when I covered the school board 
                        vote over new football equipment.

           Janie moves the napkin holder and creamer to spread the ten 
           rap sheets out on the table top.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        ...Or maybe the PTA meeting where 
                        they cut funding to the gifted and 
                        talented.

                                 BUCK
                        This here’s serious.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, I cover the school districts.

           Janie spots a number scrawled on the back of one of the rap 
           sheets.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s this here?
                                 BUCK
                        VIN number for the squad car.  I 
                        musta scratched it down when I 
                        stole those rap sheets.

           Buck watches Janie take a sip off her lemonade and he 
           wrinkles up his nose.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        For breakfast?

                                 JANIE
                        You can drink Wild Turkey at four 
                        A.M., I can drink lemonade at 
                        eight.

           Buck chews and sips coffee.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Besides, this is the theme today.  
                        Lemons into lemonade.

           Janie studies the rap sheets, the names and descriptions.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Nine people dead and I bet the 
                        police don’t even know they’re 
                        connected.  I think I just landed 
                        in the middle of the story that can 
                        launch my career.

           Buck scrapes the tortilla around his plate to scoop up the 
           salsa and beans.  He speaks around a mouthful.

                                 BUCK
                        Well, good luck on that.

                                 JANIE
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 BUCK
                        Me, I'm going west.  Gonna start 
                        over.

                                 JANIE
                        Where?

                                 BUCK
                        Where ever they need electricians.  
                        Phoenix.  Sedona.  Maybe L.A.

                                 JANIE
                        You got any friends out there?
           Buck pats his back pocket.

                                 BUCK
                        Hell, I got 60,000 friends.

           Janie spreads a packet of blueberry jam on her toast.  Then 
           sets her knife down with a clatter.

                                 JANIE
                             (suddenly angry)
                        Fine, go.  Go on then!

           Buck has his mouth full of eggs.

                                 BUCK
                        I done something wrong?

                                 JANIE
                        You said you're going to leave - 
                        go!

                                 BUCK
                        What you angry at me for?  I ain't 
                        cause any of this.  I just tried to 
                        help and look what it got me!

           Janie eats in silence.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What!

                                 JANIE
                             (snapping at him)
                        What about Gladys and all them what 
                        died at the diner?  You gonna let 
                        that devil just up and get away 
                        with butchering ‘em?

           Janie turns around the photos on the rap sheets so they all 
           face Buck.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        What about these other nine folks?  
                        Maybe they’re like me and Gladys 
                        and never saw it coming?  Maybe 
                        they was mothers and fathers, 
                        brothers and sisters.  What kinda 
                        man are you?

           Buck looks about the diner.  Customers in the other booths 
           are doing their best to mind their own business.
                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        You may not have much of a life to 
                        go back to.  But I ain't like you.  
                        I got friends.  Maybe not 60,000, 
                        but enough.  And I gotta little 
                        girl who depends on me.  I gotta 
                        life and I ain't walking away from 
                        it like a coward.  And if you had 
                        moren half a nut in them jeans, you 
                        wouldn't let them bastards beat 
                        you.

           Janie sidles out of the booth.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I intend to get that man if I have 
                        to do it alone.

           Janie heads for the door.  Buck gestures to the half-finished 
           food.

                                 BUCK
                        We gotta settle the bill?

           Janie calls over her shoulder.

                                 JANIE
                        Pick it up with one of your 
                        "friends."

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY 187 – DAY

           Buck chases Janie outside, stuffing change in his pocket.  
           Janie's crossing gravel toward the Pan American Highway, 
           hobbling purposefully in her socks.

           Buck calls after her.

                                 BUCK
                        You a determined lady, I see that 
                        now.

           Buck trots to catch up, his cold socks nicking on the gravel, 
           but Janie does not slow down.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You fixing to walk to Las Cruces?

                                 JANIE
                        If I have to.
                                 BUCK
                        Those boys see you on their 
                        streets, they'll kill you a second 
                        time!

           Janie wheels on him.  Shouting into the westerly and wringing 
           her hands.

                                 JANIE
                        Well what am I s’posed to do?  

           She is suddenly crying - all the tension and exhaustion 
           coming off her in waves.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Just give up and let them win?  
                        Take my life from me and I don't 
                        even know what I done?

           Buck stops by the guardrail and watches her.  LONG-HAUL 
           TRUCKS SLINGSHOT PAST on the northbound lane not eight feet 
           distant.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I gotta baby girl - Olivia.  
                        Staying with my sister who don’t 
                        even like kids.  Am I supposed to 
                        just up and leave ‘em for Sedona?  
                        Or Phoenix?  Or wherever 
                        electricians go?

           Tears run down Janie’s cheeks.  Buck’s got his hands slung in 
           his hip pockets and studying the land rolling off to the 
           east.

           A derelict farmhouse with walls buckled in.  A cattle fence 
           of cedar stakes tied with barbed wire, running along the 
           highway to its vanishing point on the horizon.  

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        What am I gonna do?

           Buck takes a tentative step and folds his arms around Janie, 
           pressing her to him.  She tenses up at first and then melts 
           into the embrace, a few silent sobs.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        No one’s on our side, Mike.  What 
                        are we gonna do?

           Over her shoulder, Buck shakes his head.  He’s got no idea.  
           The cool breeze as crisp as a bite from a winter apple.  And 
           all that great Texas sky rolling overhead to make a man feel 
           no bigger than a spec a dust.

                                 BUCK
                        We got 60,000 friends on our side, 
                        Janie.  So we gonna start by 
                        getting us some shoes and a car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CABALLO LAKE STATE PARK - DAY

           Squad cars have closed off both lanes of Highway 187.

           FIREMEN surround a monstrous AATAC Cyclone, boom extended 
           over the lake.  Hydraulic winch pumps respool steel cable as 
           the DODGE COLT BUBBLES TO THE SURFACE OF THE LAKE like a 
           submarine breaching.

           POLICE stand with their thumbs hooked in their belts, shaking 
           their heads at the black skid marks and the twisted metal 
           safety barrier.

           LIEUTENANT MILLER and Officer Jim Benson watch DIVERS 
           resurface in the lake.

                                 LIEUTENANT MILLER
                        They ain’t finding no bodies.  
                        Can’t decide if that’s good news or 
                        bad news.

           Jim reads from a stack of printouts in a manila folder.

                                 JIM
                        Buck served in 25th Division, Light 
                        Infantry.  He's got shrapnel in his 
                        sciatic nerve but the V.A. only 
                        rated him at twenty percent.  He 
                        slipped through the cracks in '07 
                        when the VA downgraded PTSD to 
                        "Adjustment Disorder."  He's failed 
                        seven hearing tests in his left ear 
                        on account of mortar fire, but the 
                        V.A. don't pay out for no hearing 
                        loss.

                                 LIEUTENANT MILLER
                        We all have a tough road to walk.

                                 JIM
                        This guy's had the shit end of the 
                        stick shoved right up his ass.
                                 LIEUTENANT MILLER
                        Jim, twelve hours ago this man was 
                        waving a gun in your face.  Now 
                        you’re fast developing a crush on 
                        him.  You got Stockholm Syndrome?

           Jim spreads his arms out defensively.

                                 JIM
                        Just trying to figure out who we’re 
                        dealing with.

           Jim’s CELL RINGS.  Lieutenant Miller nods and Jim answers.

                                 JIM [ON PHONE]
                        Yup?

                                 BUCK [ON PHONE]
                        This is Mike Buck calling for Jim 
                        Benson.  I’m the guy who messed up 
                        your night shift?

           Jim swats Lieutenant Miller on the shoulder, shushes 
           everyone, and puts the call on speaker.  Officers huddle in 
           close and listen.

                                 JIM
                        This is Jim, here.  How we doing 
                        this morning?

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - INTERCUT

           Buck thumbs the embossed lettering on Jim’s business card.  
           He chews on a toothpick.

                                 BUCK
                        Been better.  Wanted to apologize 
                        for the way I acted last night.  
                        Saw some friends die and got worked 
                        up is all.  That’s not an excuse, 
                        just an explanation.

           INTERCUT AS NEEDED

                                 JIM
                        Mike, that woman you came in 
                        hollering about.  Janie Cole.  Her 
                        neighbor’s shot dead.  Place broken 
                        into.  And your truck’s parked out 
                        front.  Ms. Cole’s gone and we’re 
                        towing her car outta lake.
                                 BUCK
                        Is there a question in there?

                                 JIM
                        She okay?

           INT. PAYPHONE BOOTH - BUCK

           cracks open the phone booth door and calls to Janie in the 
           service station parking lot.

                                 BUCK
                        Janie, you okay?

           Janie sits on the concrete wheel stop of a handicap spot, her 
           legs crossed at the ankles.

                                 JANIE
                        Who’s asking?

                                 BUCK [ON PHONE]
                        She’ll be alright.
                             (Then)
                        Ain’t gonna lie to you: she’s a 
                        handful.

           EXT. CABALLO LAKE - JIM

           looks to Lieutenant Miller who circles his fingers - keep him 
           talking.

                                 JIM
                        Mike, I know the V.A. only rated 
                        you at 20%.  Come in, we’ll talk 
                        about it.

                                 BUCK
                        Did you serve?

                                 JIM
                        Would have.  But there weren’t any 
                        wars to fight when I graduated.  My 
                        wife’s kid served in Felujah.

                                 BUCK
                        What unit?

                                 JIM
                        2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry.

                                 BUCK
                        How’s he making out?
                                 JIM
                        Died four years ago.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m sorry.

                                 JIM
                        He got home and couldn’t get work, 
                        ended up hanging out with his bad 
                        crowd from high school.  They’re 
                        all out drinking and his buddy 
                        wraps his Cutlass Ciera around a 
                        telephone pole.  Driver walks away 
                        without a scratch and my wife’s kid 
                        dies after his ninth surgery.  You 
                        believe that?  Kid survives a full 
                        pump in Felujah, comes home and 
                        lasts one month.

           Buck just listens.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Not sure what the moral is.  Person 
                        is the sum of the choices they 
                        make.

                                 BUCK
                        Jim, I didn’t do it.  Any of it.

                                 JIM
                        Well come in.  We’ll have a 
                        conversation.

                                 BUCK
                        You think I killed those people?

                                 JIM
                        Kid, you’re the only suspect.  I 
                        don’t know how else I’m supposed to 
                        see it.

           Buck works the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the 
           other.

                                 BUCK
                        That’s about how I figured it.

           Buck hangs up abruptly.

           EXT. CABALLO LAKE - JIM

                        Bupkiss.

           The Cyclone tows the Dodge Colt up onto dry ground.  Dripping 
           and steaming in the mid-morning light.  The officers shake 
           their heads: the car is completely empty.

           One officer thoughtfully drops his cigarette to the ground 
           and grinds it out with his boot.  STARK.

           Stark gets in his squad car and heads south.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - BUCK

           steps out of the phone booth off Interstate 25.  He sets a 
           brand new pair of binoculars to his brow and looks downhill 
           to Highway 187.

           He watches officers combing the accident scene and searching 
           the wet hatchback.  Janie joins Buck at his side, one hand on 
           her hip and one hand shielding her eyes from the breaking 
           sun.

                                 JANIE
                        What do we know?

                                 BUCK
                        One of your neighbors got shot.  
                        Police came and prolly spotted my 
                        pickup outside your house.  Musta 
                        got my car registration out the 
                        glove box.

           Buck chews his toothpick and watches Officer Jim Benson 
           working the crime scene far below.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Now they know my name, where I 
                        served, my V.A. rating.  Everything 
                        about me.

           Janie nods.

                                 JANIE
                        Lemme just look at my poor car for 
                        one last time.

           Buck lowers the binoculars and passes them to Janie.  He 
           pulls out a key fob and chirps the locks on a freshly washed 
           Kia Forte with rental plates.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        What else do we know?
                                 BUCK
                        We know the police in at least two 
                        states will be hunting us high and 
                        low.

           Janie squints through the binoculars until she’s had her 
           fill.

                                 JANIE
                        I know one place they won’t be 
                        looking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EL PASO POLICE STATION – CENTRAL DISTRICT - DAY

           All brick and glass and 70’s architecture.  Janie furtively 
           leads Buck down cement steps to a rear basement entrance 
           marked “ARCHIVES.”

           INT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - BASEMENT ARCHIVES

           Their eyes adjust to the dim light.  Bulging rows of metal 
           shelves sag under decades of paperwork.

                                 JANIE
                        Phyllis?  You down here?

           An alto voice emerges from the stacks.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Wish I wadn’t.

           Janie and Buck follow the voice to a desk burrowed behind 
           filing cabinets and piled high with paperwork.

           PHYLLIS wears carpal tunnel wrist braces on both hands.  She 
           appraises Buck.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        This him?

           Buck extends his hand with gentle courtesy.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m glad to meet you, Phyllis.

           Phyllis folds her arms across her chest.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Mm-hm.
                                 JANIE
                        Did you check out those names for 
                        me?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I shore did.  How’s the baby?

           Phyllis heaves herself out of her chair and waddles to a file 
           cabinet.

                                 JANIE
                        She’s staying with Charlene, today.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Charlene knows about as much about 
                        kids as I do about Martians.

                                 JANIE
                        Well, she’s cheaper than a baby 
                        sitter.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Mm-hm.  You get watcha pay for, if 
                        you ask me.

           Phyllis slides open a filing cabinet and flips through 
           hanging files.  Pulls one out and hands it to Janie.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        All eight of your names are dead or 
                        missing in the past week.  Two died 
                        in car wrecks.  Two apparent 
                        suicides.  One died when his house 
                        burnt down.

           Janie passes the file to Buck who reads it, shaking his head.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        As for your other question of the 
                        VIN number, it ain’t in our system.  
                        But I did some digging.

           Phyllis licks her fingers and flicks through pages from a 
           folder open on her desk.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        When an officer needs a new squad 
                        car, he dudn’t just call a factory 
                        in Detroit and order it like you 
                        order a pizza.  He fills out a 
                        whole mess a paperwork.

           Phyllis triumphantly pulls a pink slip from a folder and 
           rattles it in the air.
                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        Turns out, the department purchased 
                        your squad car six months ago.  The 
                        name on the requisition form is 
                        Officer Raymond Espinosa.

           Phyllis ceremoniously hands the form to Janie.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        There’s your man.

           Janie and Buck study the pink slip.

                                 JANIE
                        Can you tell us anything about 
                        Espinosa?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        I can tell you he’s dumber’n a box 
                        a rocks.

                                 JANIE
                        You can tell that just from a form?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        He’s using the old station codes on 
                        his requisitions.

           Phyllis reaches into the file and hands Janie a fat stack of 
           pink slips.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        Everything Espinosa’s ordered in 
                        the past year is being sent to the 
                        Northeast Division.  And that 
                        precinct shut down three years ago.

                                 JANIE
                        So all this equipment is being sent 
                        to a station that doesn’t exist?

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Mm-hm.  Tell them once, I tell them 
                        a thousand times.

           Phyllis curls her chubby fists on her hips and wags her head.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        You tell Espinosa to get his 
                        station codes straight.  Or Phyllis 
                        down in Archives gonna knock him 
                        into next week and kick his ass on 
                        Tuesday.
                                 BUCK
                        I’d shorely like to tell him that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHARLENE COLE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Stark steps through the front gate and surveys the yard.   
           The bald grey earth showing through clinging wisps of 
           yellowed grass.  A coyote fence of bundled piñon stockades.

           Stark pads up to the front porch.  Firewood piled chockablock 
           on the canted floorboards.  A hollow sconce where the porch 
           light should be.

           He knocks on the door frame.  CHARLENE COLE spies him from 
           the kitchen and speaks through the screen door.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Good afternoon, Officer.

                                 STARK
                        You must be Charlene Cole.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Guilty.  Can I help you?

                                 STARK
                        Well, a glass of water might be a 
                        great start if it’s not too 
                        forward.  Been driving around all 
                        day I like to die a thirst.

           She considers him closely, eyeing him from head to toe.  
           Stark flashes a badge.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Just a few questions and I’ll be on 
                        my way.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Well, c’mon then.

           INT. CHARLENE COLE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlene pushes open the screen door for him and heads into 
           the kitchen.  She grabs a glass from the drying rack and 
           fills it with ice from the freezer.

                                 CHARLENE
                        You like a pop, instead?
                                 STARK
                        More than anything.

           Stark puts a finger to his cap, saluting Charlene.

           Stark’s gaze turns to OLIVIA COLE.  Seated in a height chair 
           and wearing a bib.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        What a darling baby.  You mind if I 
                        pick her up?  I just love kids.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Help yourself.  You can keep her if 
                        you like.  I had my fill of her.

                                 STARK
                        I think I will keep her.  I believe 
                        I will.

           Charlene cracks a can of coke, fills the glass, and sets it 
           down on a plastic place mat.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        This your beautiful child?

                                 CHARLENE
                        My sister’s.

                                 STARK
                             (feigning surprise)
                        Janie’s daughter.  Is that a fact.

           The temperature changes in the room.  Charlene’s face turns 
           to stone.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Is everything okay with my sister, 
                        Officer?

           Stark ignores the question, dandling the baby.  He sets 
           Olivia on his knee where she looks at him doe-eyed, her lips 
           working on her binky.

                                 STARK
                        I believe I will keep you.

                                 CHARLENE
                        What has Janie got herself into?

           Stark looks up at Charlene.  Eyes hard as granite.  His gun 
           hand lowers to his sidearm, thumb resting on the safety strap 
           of the black leather holster.
           Stark holds Charlene’s gaze until she drops her eyes.

                                 STARK
                        Do you believe in fate?  That 
                        things happen for a reason.  Or do 
                        they just happen randomly.

           Charlene wilts onto a kitchen chair.  She glances up at his 
           unflinching gaze.

                                 CHARLENE
                        I suspect things happen for a 
                        reason.

                                 STARK
                        And what about when something awful 
                        happens.  Something senseless.  And 
                        violent.

                                 CHARLENE
                        I imagine there is a higher 
                        purpose.  The ants on my porch 
                        don’t know why they get the broom.  
                        But there’s the higher purpose of 
                        keeping my front step clean.

           Stark regards her house.  White paint flaking off the walls.

                                 STARK
                        I think people are blinded by 
                        routine.  Condemned to repeat the 
                        same mistakes.  Men born bad only 
                        get worse.

           Stark returns his gaze to Charlene.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        I believe when something truly 
                        awful happens it snaps us from our 
                        routine.  And for a few moments, we 
                        are truly alive.

           The baby stares at Stark and sucks her binky.  Charlene 
           twists a napkin in her hands.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe you made good 
                        choices in your life?

           Charlene considers her poor environment.  In the yard a 
           rusted swing set creaking with no discernible breeze.
                                 CHARLENE
                        My life ain’t been no easier than 
                        anybody else’s.

                                 STARK
                        But do you consider yourself 
                        fortunate?  Fortunate to be alive.  
                        Fortunate to have God’s grace.  
                        Fortunate to live in this country 
                        and reap its advantages.

                                 CHARLENE
                        I believe I’m more fortunate than 
                        some and less fortunate than 
                        others.

                                 STARK
                        I asked you a question.

                                 CHARLENE
                        I believe we make our own luck with 
                        our choices.

           Stark nods approvingly.  Charlene shivers from head to toe.  
           She hugs a hand to her shoulder.

                                 STARK
                        Can you keep a secret, Charlene?

                                 CHARLENE
                        Same as anybody else.

           Stark takes a sip of coke.  His thin, pale lips leave no mark 
           on the glass.

                                 STARK
                        Let’s say something valuable 
                        depended on it.

           He cuddles Olivia in one arm.  The way a wide receiver holds 
           a football.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Something truly precious to you.  
                        Could you keep a secret then?

                                 CHARLENE
                        What do you mean to do?

                                 STARK
                        I mean to know how well you hold a 
                        secret.

           She meets Stark’s gaze.
                                 CHARLENE
                        I am not a fool.

           Stark nods.

                                 STARK
                        No, I believe you are not.

           Stark stands up and leaves the house.  Olivia comfortable in 
           his arm.

           Charlene sits stock still in her kitchen chair, her posture 
           rigid.

           EXT. CHARLENE COLE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Stark settles into the police car and pulls the seat belt 
           across him and the baby sitting splay-legged in his lap.

           He drives away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EL PASO POLICE STATION - PARKING LOT - DUSK

           Jim Benson trudges to the farthest edge of the parking lot.  
           He has not slept in a good while.

           Jim fits his keys to his Buick and FREEZES.  Mike Buck 
           emerges from a comb of barren Persimmon trees, GRIPPING A 
           SEMI-AUTOMATIC.

           Jim’s hand moves instinctively to his sidearm.

                                 BUCK
                        Easy now.

                                 JIM
                        You made a fool of me last night in 
                        the precinct.

                                 BUCK
                        You’ll make a fool of yourself now 
                        if you reach for that sidearm.

           Buck’s gun is aimed at the ground.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Just come to parley is all.

           Jim turns in amazement to see Janie emerge from the trees.
                                 JIM
                        Janie Cole?

                                 JANIE
                        I’m sorry to meet you in this way, 
                        Officer.

                                 JIM
                        You okay?

                                 JANIE
                        A police officer tried to kill me 
                        last night.  Ran my hatchback into 
                        a lake.  Other than that I’m just 
                        jim dandy.

           Officer Benson scans the parking lot.  Yellowed stalks of 
           Sacaton davening in the brisk wind.  The 120 hertz hum of 
           overhead power lines the only sound.

                                 BUCK
                        We know which police officer 
                        massacred Gladys and everyone at 
                        the Sherwood.  Got the VIN number 
                        on his cruiser.

           Jim studies Buck and Janie, trying to figure out their angle.

                                 JIM
                        I’m listening.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m trusting you to do the right 
                        thing, Jim.

                                 JIM
                        I’ll do my best.

                                 BUCK
                        Raymond Espinosa.

           Jim’s face clouds over.  His jaw thrust forward.

                                 JIM
                        That’s not funny.

                                 JANIE
                        He’s probably a friend of yours and 
                        you don’t want to believe it, but -

                                 JIM
                        A damn good friend of mine.

           Buck shifts in his place, stretching the hip he limps on.
                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Officer Espinosa was killed in the 
                        line of duty three years ago.

           Buck looks to Janie in surprise.  Buck fumbles.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m sure sorry to hear that.

           Jim sets his hands on his hips, studying the two amateurs.

           Buck uncrumples a Xerox from his pocket and scratches his 
           chin, thoughtfully.  He hands the form to Jim.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        What do you s’pose Espinosa’s doing 
                        signing requisition forms last 
                        week?

           Jim snatches the Xerox from Buck.  As he reads it, Jim’s face 
           cycles through several different emotions.

                                 JIM
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 JANIE
                        Central Archives.  They get a copy 
                        from Accounts and Billing.

                                 BUCK
                        Espinosa’s been requisitioning 
                        equipment six ways til Sunday.

           Janie hands Jim a fat stack of Xeroxes.

                                 JANIE
                        I’m sorry your friend is dead.  But 
                        for a dead man, he shore has a way 
                        of keeping on top of his paperwork.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STARK’S SQUAD CAR

           Stark cruises with the baby in his lap.  Olivia eyeing Stark 
           and Stark eyeing the streets.

           Janie’s cell phone BUZZES in his pocket.  Stark pops it open 
           to check the voice mail.

                                 CHARLENE COLE [VOICE MAIL]
                        Janie, it’s Charlene.  I been 
                        trying you all day!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLENE COLE [VOICE MAIL] (CONT'D)
                        The scariest man come over and took 
                        Olivia.  I let him take her because 
                        I was so scared.  Please call me 
                        and let me know you’re alright – I 
                        don’t know what to do!

           Stark shuts Janie’s cell phone and pockets it.  He runs a 
           gloved hand through Olivia’s hair.

           The cruiser creeps through downtown El Paso, Stark’s eyes 
           scanning all streets and alleyways.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CENTRAL DISTRICT - BASEMENT ARCHIVES

           Phyllis packs her purse, ready to call it a day.  She hears 
           the basement door shut quietly.

                                 PHYLLIS
                        Hello?  Who’s there?

           Jim Benson steps from the shadows, his face grim.  Phyllis 
           sighs.

                                 PHYLLIS (CONT’D)
                        Damn if that woman ain’t brought me 
                        nothing but trouble.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. KIA FORTE RENTAL - NIGHT

           Janie and Buck stake out the abandoned Northeast Precinct 
           station.

           Buck’s halfway through a sixpack of Pilsner.

                                 BUCK
                        For a station that closed three 
                        years ago, it don’t seem 
                        particularly empty.

           He and Janie watch the last silhouette of an OFFICER shutting 
           off the lights and leaving the building.

           EXT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT - MOMENTS LATER

           Buck pops the trunk on the Kia Forte and grips a tire iron in 
           his fist.  He slams the trunk.
           Buck crosses the street, making for the alley behind the 
           precinct.  Janie trots after him.

           EXT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT – ALLEY

           Janie keeps an anxious lookout.  Buck uses his tire iron to 
           SMASH THE LOCK on a chain link enclosure behind the precinct.

                                 JANIE
                        Think this’ll work?

                                 BUCK
                        They won’t be rigged for good 
                        security.

                                 JANIE
                        How come?

                                 BUCK
                        Cause a precinct’s open 24 hours.

           Buck turns to Janie and grins.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Besides, who ever breaks into a 
                        police station?

           Buck picks his way into the chain link enclosure.

           Janie rocks back and forth on the balls of her feet.  A 
           shiver runs through her.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

                                 JANIE
                        Just got a bad feeling about my 
                        daughter is all.  Charlene must be 
                        worried sick wondering where I am.

           Buck grits his teeth, prying open the transformer box with 
           the crowbar.  He puts his shoulder into it.

                                 BUCK
                        Must be tough.  Raising a kid on 
                        your own.

           Janie tucks her hair behind her ear and shakes her head.

                                 JANIE
                        Her Daddy didn’t die overseas, you 
                        know.  He just run off.
           Buck SNAPS the utility box wide open.  He looks at Janie and 
           turns back to his work.

                                 JANIE (CONT'D)
                        I wish I was a war widow cause 
                        there’d be honor in it.  Truth is, 
                        all the men in my life just come up 
                        rotten.

           Buck squats to his knees to examine the circuit panel.

                                 BUCK
                        You believe it’s going to rain, 
                        sooner or later you’ll be right.

                                 JANIE
                        Excuse me?

           Buck tracks the copper leads to the breakers.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        What did you say?

                                 BUCK
                        A person holds an idea long enough, 
                        it has a way of proving true.

           Buck shrugs.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        A man doesn’t just happen to you, 
                        Janie. You get a vote in the 
                        matter.

                                 JANIE
                        I did not take you for a 
                        relationship expert.

                                 BUCK
                        I’m an expert in making bad 
                        choices.  World renowned.  I charge 
                        a consultation fee.

           Buck opens all the circuit breakers.  Everything in the 
           precinct AUDIBLY SHUTS DOWN.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        I’m not saying you deserve to raise 
                        a kid on your own.  Only thing you 
                        done wrong is pick the wrong man.

           Janie hugs herself against the chill.
                                 JANIE
                        They all leave in the end.

           Buck’s about to speak but says nothing.  He pulls the Pilsner 
           from his back pocket, takes a swig and lets it swish around 
           in his mouth before he swallows it down.

                                 BUCK
                        Well, that oughtta do it.

           Buck shuts the utility box and walks over to the key-swipe 
           door in back of the precinct.  He tugs the door and it swings 
           wide open.

           Buck listens for an alarm but there is none.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get on with it, then.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EL PASO POLICE HEADQUARTERS - INTERNAL AFFAIRS – NIGHT

           LIEUTENANT KILKLINE and SERGEANT HOYT sit opposite Jim Benson 
           at the conference table.

           Jim reads from a manila file folder crammed with paperwork.

                                 JIM
                        Police cruisers.  Dispatch radios 
                        and scanners.  Computers.  24 suits 
                        of body armor.  Tear gas canisters.  
                        Riot gear.  Batons -

                                 LIEUTENANT KILKLINE
                        - What police officers are ordering 
                        this equipment?

                                 JIM
                        Dead police officers.

           Hoyt and Kilkline look at Jim in amazement.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Or retired so long they might as 
                        well be.

           Hoyt and Kilkline pour over the paperwork.

                                 SERGEANT HOYT
                        All this equipment is approved by 
                        Central and sent to a station that 
                        doesn’t exist?
                                 LIEUTENANT KILKLINE
                        The Northeast Precinct was closed 
                        three years ago for redistricting.  
                        It’s s’posed to be empty.

                                 JIM
                        All these orders escalated in the 
                        past three weeks.  And here’s the 
                        thing.  We’re talking about a 
                        shitload of guns.

           Jim slides a manila folder across the table.  It is 
           overflowing with pink requisition forms.

                                 SERGEANT HOYT
                        Jesus...

                                 JIM
                        Combat shotguns, sniper rifles, 
                        Glocks, Smith & Wessons, SIG 
                        Sauers.  PS90 carbines.  Semi-
                        automatics.  This station that 
                        don’t exist got enough artillery to 
                        outfit a Army battalion.

                                 LIEUTENANT KILKLINE
                        How did you come by this 
                        information?

           Jim skims his palms across the table top.  Noting the 
           brailled divots where the particle board shows through the 
           melamine veneer.

                                 JIM
                        That’s the thing of it.  I wish I 
                        could take credit for good police 
                        work.  But it wadn’t me.

           Kilkline and Hoyt lean in close.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        It was that fugitive Mike Buck and 
                        the girl, Janie Cole.  They’re the 
                        ones tipped me off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT – NIGHT

           Janie and Buck creep through the dark station.  Carpet ripped 
           up and sheetrock dust covering everything.  Cubicles covered 
           in plastic tarpaulin weighed down with broken cinder blocks. 
           INT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT - BACK OFFICES

           Janie and Buck discover the back offices clean and filled 
           with high-tech equipment.  Monitors, laptops, police radios 
           and scanners.  A nerve center.

                                 JANIE
                             (whispered)
                        It’s not just one officer, Mike.  
                        It’s a whole department.

           Buck examines an El Paso map on the wall, freckled with push 
           pins.

                                 BUCK
                        Something’s coming in from Mexico.

           Buck studies the dispositions, his fingers tracing lines on 
           the map.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Everyone’s converging at the 
                        border.  Where I-10 meets the 85.
                             (then)
                        Janie, this is happening tonight.

           Janie joins Buck at his side and studies the map.

                                 JANIE
                        This is where the old Ewald Kipp 
                        Elementary School stood.  I was 
                        researching a story on it...

           Buck listens intently.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        The land was bought in January.  
                        Property butts up against the Rio 
                        Grande wet lands.  If the buyers 
                        were fixing on building a golf 
                        course it'd be a news event.

           Buck unpins the map from the wall and halves it until it fits 
           in his pocket.

                                 BUCK
                        Didjya find the owner?

                                 JANIE
                        I searched for months.  Shell 
                        corporations stacked like Russian 
                        dolls.

           Janie rifles through cabinets, pouring over files.
                                 BUCK
                        Well, you ruffled some feathers, 
                        looks like.

                                 JANIE
                        Seems a petty thing to land me on a 
                        hit list.

                                 BUCK
                        They killed everyone in Sherwood 
                        Diner just to get to one man.

           Janie stuffs papers into her pockets and heads for the exits.  
           Buck follows.

           EXT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT - MOMENTS LATER

           Janie and Buck step cautiously into the alleyway.

                                 BUCK
                        You get the feeling this is 
                        bigger’n just some crooked cops?

                                 JANIE
                        There’s Mexican cartels who only 
                        recruit soldiers and police.  Half 
                        the cops in Juárez belong to the 
                        cartel.  They monitor the police 
                        movement, cross check points, free 
                        prisoners, smuggle drugs in police 
                        cars...

           Buck lets the door shut quietly behind him.

                                 BUCK
                        You're saying the cartels are in 
                        Texas, now?

           Janie shakes her head.  

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, let’s get outta here.

                                 BUCK
                        Yeah.

           THUNDEROUS GUNFIRE fills the brick cavern of the alleyway.

           Buck is lifted off his feet like he’s sacked by a linebacker.  
           He finds himself on the ground, legs kicking.

           SOUND CUTS OUT.
           Buck stares up at the night sky.  Sees Janie kneeling over 
           him, SCREAMING.  Her mouth moving, but he hears nothing.

           TIME SLOWS.

           GUNFIRE RATTLES OFF THE BRICKS, sending stinging grains of 
           sand and dust burrowing into the skin.

           A SQUAD CAR speeds past the alleyway and SKIDS TO A STOP.  
           Backing up.  STARK visible behind the wheel.

           All at once, SOUND KICKS BACK IN.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, get up!  RUN!

           Somehow, miraculously, Buck rolls to his knees and gets up 
           SPRINTING.

           POLICE OFFICERS

           leap from the squad car, muzzles flaring a split second 
           before the CRACK OF GUNFIRE.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Buck and Janie sprint across the train ties, ducking under 
           the clearance of a grain hopper.  AUTOMATIC BULLETS SPARKING 
           on the four foot steel wheels of the rolling stock.

           Buck runs off balance.  His left arm not quite obeying him.  
           No time to think about that.

           EXT. SOUTH STANTON - BUCK

           racing on adrenaline.  He and Janie dash from the train yard 
           onto South Stanton.  CROWDS from the downtown nightclubs just 
           visible down the street.

           The revellers are loud, drunk, oblivious.

           GUNFIRE NOW EXPLODES FROM TWO DIRECTIONS.

           A new officer, COMANCHE, has joined the fight.  He fires a 
           GLOCK .22 continuously, reclipping without breaking rhythm.

           BUCK SPINS

           changing directions like a running back, sheltering Janie 
           with his body.  They dash into an office park.
           EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE - BUCK AND JANIE

           turn into the alleyway, backs to the brick wall.  Buck draws 
           his Walther P99 from his belt for the first time.

           MIKE BUCK 

           racks the slide and pivots out of the alleyway, FIRING a 
           single bullet into an

           ADVANCING OFFICER - AN FBI AGENT

           whose gut EXPLODES OUT THE BACK OF HIS UNIFORM.

           EXT. SERVICE ENTRANCE - BUCK

           wide-eyed in shock at the violence of his action.  
           Recognizing the FBI Agent from the blockade on Caballo Lake.

           JANIE

           tugging Buck up the alley.

           INT. LOADING DOCK - CONTINUOUS

           Buck collapses on the cement platform, his back resting 
           against the locked steel rolling gates.

           He examines his sleeve.  Blood showing through the flannel 
           and spreading fast.

           Somewhere on Stanton Street a man is SCREAMING AS HE DIES.

           INT. LOADING DOCK - BUCK’S POV

           his eyes glazing over as SOUND CUTS OUT AGAIN.  Janie is 
           shaking him, talking to him.  Buck hears only the distant 
           sound of mortar fire from the corners of his memory.

           Janie nervously checking the alleyway.

                                 JANIE
                        Come on Mike, please!  You need to 
                        deal with what’s happening right 
                        now.

           Janie takes Buck’s face in both hands so he’s forced to look 
           her in the eye.
                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        You get to choose who you are, 
                        Mike.  Every second of your life.  
                        You can be the victim of your past.  
                        Or you can snap out of it.  And 
                        choose who you want to be right 
                        now.

           Buck blinks his eyes.  Listening.  He starts breathing again.

                                 BUCK
                        You ever been deer hunting, Janie?

                                 JANIE
                        Never.

                                 BUCK
                        A buck gets injured it dudn’t just 
                        run willy nilly.

           Buck rises painfully to his feet.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        He finds high ground.  Turns and 
                        watches his back trail.

           Buck leads Janie up a metal flight of steps, to a floor of 
           vacant offices.  He KICKS A DOOR HARD WITH HIS BOOT, smashing 
           the bolt lock through the trim.

           INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

           Buck leads Janie to the corner office.  Windows overlooking 
           Stanton and Franklin.  They crouch before the windows and 
           watch the approach.

                                 BUCK
                        Hunter comes up one side of the 
                        hill, deer knows to run down the 
                        other side.

                                 JANIE
                        How do we know where they are?

                                 BUCK
                        We’ll know when they start 
                        shooting.

           Janie gently removes Buck’s flannel.  She rolls up his t-
           shirt sleeve to examine his shoulder.  She curls her lip.
           Buck covers his pain in long, slow exhalations.  He scans his 
           battlefield, a walkway wrapping around the entire second 
           story.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        If this guy was an amateur, he’d 
                        surround us.  Then his gunmen’d 
                        shoot each other in their own 
                        crossfire.

                                 JANIE
                        But he’s a pro.

           Janie finds office scissors from a desk and cuts off the 
           sleeve of Buck’s flannel.  She works quickly, tying off the 
           perforating wound on Buck’s shoulder.

                                 BUCK
                        He’ll use his dogs to flush us out.  
                        Lead us right to him.  Unless...

           Buck bites his lip, thinking.

                                 JANIE
                        Unless what?

                                 BUCK
                        Unless he baits us out.

                                 JANIE
                        How’s he gonna bait us out?

           A plaintive sound wafts up from the street.  It starts low 
           and grows louder.

           A BABY’S CRYING.

           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - STARK

           steps into view.  The Glock in his right hand is resting at 
           his side.  IN HIS LEFT ARM HE CRADLES OLIVIA.

           Stark bounces her lightly up and down, to ease her crying.  
           His eyes strafe the windows of the office building.

           INT. OFFICES - JANIE

           clamps a hand over her mouth, tears rolling down cheeks.

                                 JANIE
                        That’s my little girl.
           Buck rolls open the window crank.  He lifts his semi-
           automatic, leveling the slotted sight with his eye line.

                                 BUCK
                        I can make this shot.

           Janie violently yanks his arm down.

                                 JANIE
                        Are you crazy?  He’s holding my 
                        baby girl!

           Buck hesitates.  He believes he can make the shot.  Janie’s 
           eyes pleading through silent running tears.

           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - INTERCUT

           Stark dandles the baby.  He raises his voice to address the 
           darkened windows of the office building.

                                 STARK
                        Janie Cole.  Come out.  We just 
                        need to talk is all.

           Olivia is WAILING.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Call out to me, Janie.  Let me know 
                        where you are.

           INT. OFFICES - JANIE

           opens her mouth to shout.  Buck presses her tightly to him, 
           hugging her.

                                 BUCK
                             (fierce whisper)
                        He will kill you - that’s all he 
                        wants.

                                 JANIE
                        I gotta go out there - he’s got 
                        Olivia.

                                 BUCK
                        You get yourself killed what 
                        happens to Olivia?  Is he going to 
                        take care of her?  Drop her off at 
                        day care every day?

                                 JANIE
                        What do I do?
                                 BUCK
                        Stay alive.

                                 JANIE
                        What if he hurts her?

                                 BUCK
                        Your daughter is his bargaining 
                        chip.  He won’t hurt her.

                                 JANIE
                        Are you sure?

                                 BUCK
                        Absolutely.

           Buck surveys the scene below.  He’s not sure.  Wheels turning 
           in his mind.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Bait.

                                 JANIE
                        What?

                                 BUCK
                        He’s got us looking one direction.

           Buck spins around to scan the opposite wall of the offices.  
           And sure enough, silhouettes of TWO GUNMEN flit past the 
           shaded windows.

           Buck tracks their speed, their shapes appearing in front of 
           window blinds and disappearing behind the stucco walls.

           BUCK FIRES THROUGH THE STUCCO WALLS.  TWO DOUBLE TAPS.

           Then listens.  The sound of two bodies hitting the ground.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Get down, now.

           AUTOMATIC BULLETS rake a line through the dry wall.

           JANIE AND BUCK

           duck flat to the ground as the line of bullet holes passes 
           RIGHT OVER THEIR HEADS.  The second strafe SHATTERS THE 
           WINDOWS - covering them in falling glass.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Now!
           Buck explodes like a cannonball, hurtling across the office 
           floor with Janie in tow.  Pieces of broken window glass 
           hanging off Buck’s neck.

           He shoulders his way out the back door.

           EXT. OFFICES - BUCK

           strips two Semi-Autos off the fallen gunmen on the walkway.

           Then leads Janie spiralling down an outdoor stairway.

           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - BUCK AND JANIE

           RUNNING AS GUNFIRE ENVELOPES THEM.

           Buck races for the nightclubs.  PEDESTRIANS stand in the 
           street and gawk.  POLICE SIRENS close in from all directions.

           The gates of hell open up as --

           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - STARK

           marches through a throng of club patrons, gun level, FIRING 
           ON BUCK AND JANIE.  BAR GOERS HIT IN THE CROSSFIRE.

           A BEWILDERED YOUNG MAN and HIS GIRLFRIEND

           cross Stark’s sight line.  Stark GUT-SHOTS THE COUPLE, 
           DROPPING BOTH OF THEM.  Clearing his line of fire.

           STARK

           emptying his clip, looking for a kill shot on Buck and Janie.

           A TAMALE VENDOR

           struck in the cheek, spinning to the ground and

           A FEMALE CUSTOMER

           diving behind a mail box, hands covering her ears.

           CAR TRAFFIC

           screeching to a halt, vehicles akimbo in the street.
           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - COMANCHE

           reading hand signals from Stark and doubling down an alleyway 
           to flank Janie and Buck.

           CLUB BOUNCERS

           shove patrons to the sidewalk, ordering people inside.  
           Screaming, pointing, shoving.

           POLICE CRUISERS

           now appearing from all directions.  Mayhem.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - JANIE

           sprinting down the alley, trapped in a dead end.  No escape.

           COMANCHE

           now in a squad car, SKIDDING TO A STOP.  Janie in his 
           headlights, cornered against a brick wall.  Comanche turns to 
           open his door, already bringing up his sidearm as

           MIKE BUCK

           steps from an alcove, Glock eye level and FIRES.

           COMANCHE’S FACE CAVES IN.  Buck stands in the back-splatter 
           breathing hard.

                                 BUCK
                        Bait.

           Buck in the adrenal haze of combat.  He tries to rip Comanche 
           from the squad car but the man is buckled in. 

           POLICE SIRENS CLOSE IN

           Buck shoves his way into the squad car, sitting on Comanche’s 
           dead lap.  Janie in the passenger seat, face stricken white.

           INT. SQUAD CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Buck smacks on the sirens and SLAMS THE CROWN VICTORIA into 
           reverse.  Buck’s arm around the passenger seat and his head 
           twisted as he steers BACKWARD OUT OF THE ALLEYWAY.
           EXT. DOWNTOWN EL PASO - CONTINUOUS

           Buck and Janie’s squad car slips through the advancing wave 
           of emergency vehicles and burns north on Mesa Street, engine 
           SCREAMING ON SIX CYLINDERS.

           EXT. FRANKLIN STREET - STARK

           standing tall, a turbulent sea of people raging in chaos 
           around him.  Olivia clinging to his arm and crying.

           Real POLICE and SWAT are now rushing up and down the street.  
           Ambulances inching their way through the crowd.

           Stark turns in a full circle.  Janie and Buck gone.

           Stark strides calmly through the throng, police rushing past 
           him like jetsam on a river.  He vanishes into the crowd.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED LOT – NIGHT

           Janie and Buck sit on the curb by the stolen cop car.  
           Comanche’s body sprawled out cruciform on the pavement.

           Janie cuts gauze and tapes it to Buck’s shoulder.  Iodine, 
           scissors, and tape strewn out of a plastic drugstore bag 
           lying by her feet.

                                 BUCK
                        You supposed to go in the Army to 
                        serve others.  But when you in the 
                        shit, boy you end up serving 
                        yourself.  Just trying to survive 
                        and get home.

           He chuckles.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Get home to what?

           Buck’s eyes are wide, vacant.  His hands trembling.  Janie 
           watches him nervously.

                                 JANIE
                        We’re gonna get outta here, Mike.

           SIRENS BAY IN THE DISTANCE.  Blue neon liquor store lights 
           casts pavonine reflections on the nacreous oil-streaked 
           puddles of the alley.
                                 BUCK
                        I coulda helped that woman in the 
                        burning building, Janie.  But in 
                        that moment, I didn’t.  And I 
                        learned something about myself that 
                        day.  And I get to live with it the 
                        rest of my life.  Knowing who I 
                        really am.

           Janie removes glass from his neck with quick efficiency.  She 
           tapes over the cuts and speaks to Buck - her voice low and 
           calm.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, we’re gonna need to keep 
                        moving.

                                 BUCK
                        People who’ve never served, they 
                        never get to learn who they truly 
                        are.  But I know.  I ain’t help 
                        that woman.  That’s who I am.

           Janie tapes up the last cut.  She rinses her fingers in 
           rubbing alcohol and dries them on a strip of gauze.

                                 JANIE
                        Mike, that is not who you are.

           She places her hands gently on Buck’s shoulders.  He’s wet 
           with sweat.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        That is who you were.

           Buck looks at her, tortured eyes full of anguish.  He hears 
           her words, but he don’t believe ‘em.

           Janie moves to Comanche’s fallen body.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I never seen a dead man before.

                                 BUCK
                        You get used to it.

           Janie pulls lipstick and a receipt from the drugstore bag.  
           She smears the lipstick on Comanche’s thumb and rolls it 
           across the receipt, FINGERPRINTING HIM.

                                 JANIE
                        His watch is still ticking.
                                 BUCK
                        You think his watch’ll stop just 
                        cause his time run out?

                                 JANIE
                        I don’t know.  Just creepy is all.

           Janie clips the fingerprint to the manila files smuggled from 
           the abandoned precinct.  Janie folds them in half and 
           scribbles an address across the top.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Gimme 200 dollars.

           Buck, still dazed, pulls 200 dollars from his pocket and 
           hands it over no questions asked.

           He’s holding onto his ringing ears and rocking slowly back 
           and forth.  A ticking time bomb.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you leave me now.

           Janie marches to the street corner.

           EXT. DRUGSTORE CORNER - JANIE

           approaches two TEENAGERS lounging on the curb drinking pops.  
           Their bicycles splayed out on the sidewalk.

                                 JANIE
                        You old enough to make some money?

           The teens look at each other and look at her.

                                 TEEN
                        Depends.

           Janie holds out a c-note to one of the teens.

                                 JANIE
                        You know the Police Station on 
                        Campbell?  You deliver these files 
                        to Officer Jim Benson as fast as 
                        you can.

           The teen eyes the hundred dollar bill.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        People’s lives depend on it.

           The teen scratches his chin.
                                 TEEN
                        I think you got more money there.

           Janie pulls out her other $100 bill and hands it to the 
           second teen.

                                 OTHER TEEN
                        What’s this for?

                                 JANIE
                        If your friend don’t deliver those 
                        files, that’s for paying you to 
                        whoop his ass.

           The teens take the money and climb onto their bikes.  They 
           serpentine down the street, none too quickly.

           EXT. ABANDONED LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Janie cuts down the alleyway, returning to the hidden squad 
           car.  The dead officer sprawled in the oleaginous pavement.

           BUCK IS GONE.

           SIRENS approach.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D
                             (whispered)
                        Mike?  ...Mike?

           Buck bursts from the adjacent liquor store and rounds the 
           corner into the back alley.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh for God’s sakes, Mike.

           Buck uses his teeth to twist the cap off a one liter bottle 
           of Jose Cuervo Especial.  Turns the bottle to his lips and 
           guzzles.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        We have to go.

           SIRENS ECHO OFF THE DOWNTOWN BUILDINGS, lights flashing in 
           the distance.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        Mike, he’s got my baby!

                                 BUCK
                        It’s hopeless!  We got no one on 
                        our side, Janie.
           Buck takes a swig.

                                 JANIE
                        We know where his meeting’s 
                        happening.  It’s our one shot at 
                        finding my daughter.  He makes that 
                        drop off, we might could prove your 
                        innocence.  We have to take this 
                        shot.

                                 BUCK
                        There’s a thousand of em.  Only one 
                        of me.  I ain’t help that woman, 
                        Janie.  That’s who I am.

                                 JANIE
                        Don’t you want to do the right 
                        thing?

                                 BUCK
                        Don’t make no difference.  I’m a 
                        loser, Janie.  Always will be!

           Buck is screaming now.

                                 BUCK (CONT’D)
                        Only 26 months of my life ever made 
                        any sense was overseas and I can’t 
                        go back to that cause I’m a 20 
                        percent-rated reenlistment-code-
                        three goddamn loser!

                                 JANIE
                        Fine.  Go off and get drunk!  I 
                        knew you’d leave me!  You all do!

                                 BUCK
                        Where you going?

                                 JANIE
                        To get my daughter.

           Janie marches off.  Buck alone in the alley with the body.

           SIRENS ECHO IN FROM ALL SIDES NOW.

           Buck turns the Cuervo to his lips and starts to drinking.  
           Then, SPITS IT ALL OUT ON THE GROUND.

           It froths and bubbles on the pavement.  Buck hawks and spits 
           again.
           Then winds up and HURLS THE BOTTLE against the alley wall – 
           SMASHING IT IN A MILLION PIECES.  Buck puts his hands over 
           his ears, sinks to his knees, and SCREAMS IN PAIN AND RAGE.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT – NIGHT

           A SWAT TEAM BATTERS OPEN THE DOORS to the precinct.  Laser 
           scopes of assault rifles PIERCE THE GLOOM.

           SWAT COPS in black combat gear run point-and-follow, sweeping 
           the building.

                                 SWAT TEAM
                        Clear!  Clear!

           Jim Benson follows Lieutenant Kilkline and Sergeant Hoyt into 
           the station.

           INT. ABANDONED NORTHEAST PRECINCT - BACK OFFICES

           They are COMPLETELY EMPTY.  Sergeant Hoyt spreads his arms 
           and wheels on Jim.

                                 SERGEANT HOYT
                        Where’s your phantom precinct, Jim?

           Jim looks at the desks.  Rectangles of dust missing where 
           computers once rested.

                                 LIEUTENANT KILKLINE
                        What do you think?

           Jim spots a coffee mug on the window sill.  He dips in an 
           index finger.  It comes away warm.

                                 JIM
                        I think this was a functioning 
                        office not 30 minutes ago.

           Lieutenant Kilkline scans the room.  Dust marks clearly show 
           the missing outlines of computers and printers, recently 
           moved.

                                 SERGEANT HOYT
                        Well, where in the hell are they?

                                 JIM
                        Close.  Really close.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. EL PASO - NIGHT

           I-10 skirts the Rio Grande, cleaving the festering slums of 
           Ciudad Juárez from the tan bricked homes and tree lined 
           alamedas of El Paso.

           EXT. OVERPASS - NIGHT

           Janie stands on the 85 overpass where it dovetails with I-10.  
           She climbs over the guardrail and crosses the westbound 
           lanes, ROARING JUGGERNAUTS OF BIG RIGS inexorable as time.  

           Janie glissades down the beveled concrete face of the batter 
           wall.

           EXT. RIO GRANDE FLOODPLAIN - NIGHT

           Stark leans against his cruiser and watches Janie advance.  
           If he is surprised to see her, he don’t show it.

           CARTEL GUNMEN are loading an idling transport truck.  Engine 
           wheezing like it’s out of breath.

           Janie marches right up to Stark.  

                                 JANIE
                        This it?  This your shipment in 
                        from Mexico?

           Stark shakes his head, no.

                                 STARK
                        This is a shipment to Mexico.

           Janie stands face to face with Stark, one hand on her hip.  
           She looks in the truck bed.  PILES OF GUNS.

                                 JANIE
                        That’s it, then.  Just a bunch of 
                        guns.

           The ribbed spandrels of the overpass yawn in the echoing 
           darkness; the felled fossil ribcage of some forlorn beast, 
           long extinct.  The dull rumble of east-west traffic enough to 
           set your teeth on edge.

                                 STARK
                        10,000 Mexicans kill each other 
                        every year.  And where do you 
                        s’pose Juárez gets all of its guns?

           Janie nods.
                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        America is so busy watching what’s 
                        crossing the border from Mexico, 
                        they don’t care what’s going out.

                                 JANIE
                        You’re responsible for every person 
                        gets killed with these guns.  You 
                        know that?

           Stark’s boot is cocked up on a rusted chicken feeder.  An 
           elbow resting across his knee.

                                 STARK
                        You cannot change what men want.  
                        Nor what they will do.

           WHORES, in their teens and twenties, emerge from a shack and 
           watch Janie with interest.  They have mahogany eyes and smoke 
           hand rolled cigarettes.

           One whore in a striped tank top cuddles Janie’s baby against 
           her shoulder.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        People will always want drugs.  
                        Governments will always forbid 
                        them.

           Janie watches the young whore holding Olivia.

                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        This war will go on forever.  And 
                        no one will lose.  And no one will 
                        win.

                                 JANIE
                        And whose side are you on?  Coming 
                        after me and killing all those 
                        people?

                                 STARK
                        When the rains come too late in the 
                        year and destroy a farmer’s crops, 
                        does the farmer blame this raindrop 
                        or that raindrop?  Which raindrop 
                        is the one that killed his crops?

           Janie scans the terrain.  The abandoned elementary school, 
           incongruous across the bosque.  Windows missing.

           Cheerily painted zoo animals now sun-faded and peeling.
                                 STARK (CONT’D)
                        Or does the farmer blame the storm 
                        itself?  A force of nature that has 
                        always been and always will be?

                                 JANIE
                        You killed those people.  You did.

                                 STARK
                        It could be that fate chose me to 
                        act her will.  But if I had not 
                        killed those people, a thousand 
                        others would rise up to take my 
                        place.  So it could also be that I 
                        am just a raindrop in a storm.

                                 JANIE
                        Let me have my daughter.

           Stark stares at her for a long time.  He nods to the whore in 
           the striped tank top.

                                 STARK
                        Déjela celebrar a la muchacha la 
                        una vez pasada.

           The young whore hands Janie her daughter.

                                 WHORE
                        Nos alimentará y darle a un 
                        orfanato.

           Janie holds Olivia tightly in her arms.  She presses her 
           forehead to the child’s forehead.  Janie’s face now lined 
           with tears.

                                 STARK
                        They say they will provide for her 
                        when you are gone.

           Stark unclips the safety strap on his holster and draws his 
           gun.

           Janie hugs her child.  And then --

           GUNFIRE EXPLODES ACROSS THE MESA.

           Stark’s gunmen DIVE FOR COVER behind the transport truck.

           EXT. FLOODPLAIN - JANIE

           MAKES A BREAK FOR IT, running for the cover of the vacant 
           elementary school, clutching Olivia to her chest.
           Only Stark, unflinching does not move.  Gun ready, his eyes 
           scan the terrain for the shooter.

           EXT. BOSQUE - CONTINUOUS

           In the bosque of the Rio Grande the Tobosa grass grows belly 
           high to a horse.  Balsam-scented cottonwoods with deep-
           fissured bark stand sentinel to red Snakewood and harlequin-
           green tendrils of Indian root.

           Stark spots dust rising from the flora.  And then --

           BUCK EMERGES FROM THE SCREEN OF COTTONWOODS.

           EXT. FLOODPLAIN - STARK

           gestures to his gunmen.  Pot-bellied men with bowlegs and 
           strong shoulders.

                                 STARK
                        Matarlo.

           Stark’s gunmen OPEN FIRE ON BUCK.  Stark low-lines to the 
           school house, PURSUING JANIE.

           EXT. BOSQUE - BUCK

           ducking low and moving fast.  Tar Brush and Fire-barrel 
           Cactus pockmark the floodplain, screening his path.

           Buck picks his way along the rolling stock.  Treacherous 
           terrain of train ties and gravel.

           HE’S PINNED DOWN BY COVER FIRE.

           Buck drops his spent semi-auto.  Now a double-handed grip on 
           his Glock.  His shoulder is opened and bleeding fresh.

           EXT. FLOODPLAIN - EL PASO POLICE AND SWAT TEAM

           SURROUND THE I-10 and descend on the mesa.

           They DRAW FIRE from the Cartel Gunmen.

           EXT. BOSQUE - BUCK

           slips from the train ties and SPRINTS for the abandoned 
           school.  He scans the building, noting a second story over 
           the lunch room.
                                 BUCK
                        High ground, Janie.

           EXT. FLOODPLAIN - JIM BENSON

           trots across the mesa in a flack vest and helmet, gun drawn.  
           He surveys the battlefield and heads for the school.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - STARK

           point-and-sweeps through the empty rooms.  Faded dioramas and 
           dust-covered children’s toys eerily abandoned.

           Stark sets his cigarette to the window dressings and breathes 
           gently.  The desiccated wisps of fabric IGNITE.

           The fire spreads rapidly, ENGULFING THE ROOM IN FLAMES.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BUCK

           drops his spent Glock.  He stares in horror at the HELLISH 
           CONFLAGRATION RISING TO SPREAD ITS FIERY WINGS INTO THE 
           NIGHT.

           Color drains from Buck’s face.  He struggles to quiet his 
           breathing.

                                 BUCK
                        Janie, he means to smoke you out.

           Buck’s bullet wound is freshly seeping.  His brain POUNDING 
           WITH ANCIENT MORTAR FIRE.

           Eyes lit with terror, Buck swallows hard and makes a choice.  

           BUCK RACES INTO THE BURNING BUILDING.

           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - JIM BENSON

           picks his way carefully through a music room.  Crates of 
           rotted instruments sun-bleached and forgotten.

                                 JIM
                        Janie, Mike, can you hear me?  I 
                        got your files and the fingerprints 
                        you sent me.  We know everything 
                        now...
           INT. CAFETERIA - BUCK

           carefully walking the perimeter.  Listening with his good ear 
           over the CRACKLING ROAR OF FLAMES.

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        We got the nine rap sheets.  All 
                        those folks are dead.  A city 
                        inspector, a land surveyor.  
                        Everyone tied to this property...

           INT. MAIN OFFICE - STARK

           keen eyed and listening.  Honing in on Jim’s location.

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        They own the land on both sides of 
                        the Rio Grande, now.  They can get 
                        anything they want across the 
                        border.  This is their goldmine!

           Stark spots Jim’s shadow through the smoke.  It glides 
           upstairs behind the cafeteria.  Stark ducks low through the 
           SCORCHING HEAT, silently closing the gap.

           INT. UPSTAIRS CLASSROOMS - BUCK

           mops sweat from his eyes.  

                                 JIM (O.S.)
                        The man killed in the Sherwood 
                        Diner was a manager from the 
                        Wetlands Bureau.  Anyone who came 
                        snooping here ended up on the hit 
                        list.

           Buck studies the doorways down the hallway, trying to read 
           Janie’s thoughts.  Where is she?

                                 JIM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        We know it wasn’t you, Mike!  You 
                        can stop running!

           INT. HALLWAY - STARK

           spots Janie far down the hallway, crouched in a window seat.  
           She is huddled over Olivia, keeping her quiet.  SMOKE NOW 
           CHOKING THE HALLWAY.  Janie looks intently out the window, 
           searching for gunmen or any sign of rescue.
           Stark hears Jim Benson climbing the stairs.  Stark DRAWS A 
           SECOND GUN from his thigh holster.  Drawing a bead on Janie 
           AND ON JIM.

           He lines up both shots.  Stark’s thin-lipped smile.

           And then --

           HE FIRES.

           INT. HALLWAY - BUCK

           hurtles through the air, BODY-TACKLING STARK - SMASHING HIM 
           HARD TO THE GROUND. 

           INT. STAIRWELL - JIM BENSON

           takes a BULLET TO THE CHEST.  It lifts him off his feet and 
           sends him CRASHING DOWN THE STAIRS.

           INT. HALLWAY - BUCK AND STARK

           grapple and fight.  Boots scraping against the pinewood 
           flood.  FLAMES RACING TO FILL THE HALLWAY.

           Stark loses both guns.  Grips Buck in a double arm bar and 
           BASHES HIM HARD AGAINST THE DRYWALL.  Buck’s forearm 
           blistering in the heat of the fire - BUCK SCREAMING.

           Buck fights like an infantryman.  Hooked fists to crush 
           windpipes or gouge eyes.  In the adrenal rage of combat Buck 
           takes Stark’s head in both hands and SMASHES IT AGAINST THE 
           FLOOR.

           INT. HALLWAY - BUCK

           marine-crawls across the pinewood and REACHES INTO THE FLAMES 
           TO GRAB STARK’S GLOCK.

           STARK LURCHES TOWARD BUCK, as Buck SPINS AND FIRES.

           The bullet CATCHES STARK IN THE THROAT, his carotid artery 
           exploding in a shroud of mist.

           CLOSE ON BUCK

           who aims carefully and FIRES A SECOND TIME.
           INT. HALLWAY - STARK

           collapses to his knees, his brow furrowed as if to pose a 
           difficult question.  Stark falls face forward on the 
           hardwood.  Dead.

           INT. HALLWAY - JANIE

           rises from her crouched hiding place, cradling Olivia in her 
           arms.  She smiles bravely.

                                 JANIE
                        Bait.

           Buck nods.

           WATER HOSES POUND THE BUILDING, QUENCHING FIRE.

           Buck takes Janie in his arms, shielding her and the baby from 
           fire and water.

           Janie collapses into his arms in nervous exhaustion, sobbing, 
           holding Olivia.  

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        You came back.

           She turns Olivia’s head from Stark’s bleeding body.

           Buck safeties his gun and sets it on the ground.  He holds 
           Janie.

                                 JANIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought you’d leave me.  But you 
                        came back.

           Buck cradles the baby’s tiny hand in his blistered palm.

                                 BUCK
                        You must be Olivia.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Buck, Janie, and Olivia emerge coughing from the wet and 
           smoking building.  They are now drenched from the fire hoses.

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - JIM BENSON

           sits with EMTs who carefully remove his flak jacket and cut 
           away his shirt.  Revealing a NASTY RED WELT in the center of 
           his chest.
           Officer Jim Benson waves away the EMTs.  He labors to his 
           feet, wheezing as he approaches Janie and Buck.

                                 JIM
                        Janie, I got your note.  Led us 
                        right to you.  You solved 
                        everything.

           Jim places a tentative hand on Buck’s shoulder.  He pats it 
           in a fatherly way.

           FIREMEN AND SWAT POLICE rush in from all directions.  
           Clearing the school room by room.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        You did good, Mike.  You showed me 
                        who you really are.

           Buck wipes sweat from his forehead and collects his breath.  

           He nods.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WEST TEXAS DINER – DAY

           Buck sits in a booth wearing an electrician’s coveralls, his 
           table bathed in the lemon yellow light of morning.  His left 
           arm’s still in a sling but he looks healed from his cuts and 
           bruises.

           Buck reads a front page article in the El Paso Times.  The 
           byline says, “WRITTEN BY JANIE COLE.”  

           Janie sits opposite, making notes in her pad.  She smiles at 
           Olivia, seated next to Buck.

           A WAITRESS arrives to refill Janie’s coffee.  She turns to 
           Buck.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you something to drink?

                                 BUCK
                        Yes ma’am.  I believe I’d like to 
                        try your lemonade.

           Janie smiles.

           Underneath the table she slips her feet out of her flats and 
           rests them on Buck’s lap.  He cups a hand around the ball of 
           her foot, absently kneading it, his other hand resting 
           protectively on Olivia’s shoulder.
           Outside the Eastern sun crowns the Franklin Mountains in 
           burgundy and tyrian.  The crinkled edges of the foothills 
           gently settled on the land like the folds of a blanket.

                                 THE END
