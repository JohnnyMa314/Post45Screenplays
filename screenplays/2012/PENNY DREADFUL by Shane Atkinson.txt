           EXT. JAROM CITY, UTAH -- EVENING

           Population 1,200.  Just 25 miles from Salt Lake City, but it
           might as well be 1,000.  Nothing but sagebrush and mountains
           as far as you can see.  The West Desert.  

           There's a sliver of pink light on the horizon.  An old pioneer
           mansion sits on the outskirts of town, falling into decay. 
           Large and ominous-looking.  

           A car pulls up the gravel drive and DENNIS (30s) gets out. 
           He takes a deep breath, collecting himself, then walks to
           the house.

           BO (40), a big stone-faced redneck, stands out front smoking
           a cigarette.

                                 BO
                        You Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yes, sir.

           Bo looks Dennis over, then flicks his cigarette.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Bo leads Dennis down a long hallway.  GRETCHEN (19), a shy
           girl in conservative old-fashioned clothes, walks by.  She
           keeps her eyes down as she passes the men.

           Bo watches her go by but says nothing.  When he gets to the
           room she just emerged from, he looks inside.

           A small office.  RANDY (30s), Bo's younger brother, stands
           inside.  He's small and wiry but no less tough-looking than
           Bo.

                                 BO
                        Where you been?

                                 RANDY
                        Just got off work.

           Bo goes to Randy and the two brothers argue quietly.  Dennis
           watches from the hallway but can't hear what they're saying.  

           Bo grabs Randy's collar, and Randy pushes him off.  Finally,
           the debate ends, and the two men walk back to Dennis.

                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        This him?

                                 BO
                        Yeah, that's him.  Come on.  Hyrum's
                        waiting.
           Randy flashes Dennis a menacing smile, then walks past. 
           Dennis watches them go, hesitant, then follows after.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           A dimly-lit room.  Dennis sits, nervously tapping his fingers
           on the chair.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Holly says you’re reliable.  Are you
                        reliable?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yes, sir.  Very reliable.  I do
                        what I’m told, and I keep my mouth
                        shut.  Things are a little tight for
                        me right now, and I’m just looking
                        for a chance to--

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        I ain’t interested in your life story,
                        son.

                                 DENNIS 
                        No, sir.  Course not.

           HYRUM (60s) sits in a large chair.  He's lean and hard, his
           eyes show little hint of emotion.  He wears long-sleeved,
           conservative clothing.

                                 HYRUM 
                        You know the girl?

                                 DENNIS 
                        Sure, I know her.  Know my way
                        around the school too.  I used to be
                        a janitor there.  Didn't stay long,
                        but long enough so I got pretty
                        familiar with--

                                 HYRUM 
                        I ain’t interested in your life story,
                        son.  

           Dennis nods.  Awkward silence.

                                 HYRUM  (CONT'D)
                        You sure you’re up for this?

                                 DENNIS 
                        Yes, sir.  You can trust me on that.

                                 HYRUM
                        I don't trust you.  I trust Holly. 
                        Holly says you're reliable.
                                 DENNIS
                        Well, sir, I am.

           Hyrum looks him over, then turns to Bo.  Bo shrugs.

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Dennis walks back to the car.

           INT./EXT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis climbs in.  He looks back at the house.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.) 
                        What’d he say?

           HOLLY (30s), hides in the backseat.  She's a tough small-
           town beauty.  A slight baby bump is the only sign that she's
           pregnant.

                                 DENNIS
                        I’m in.  

                                 HOLLY 
                        What’s the plan?

                                 DENNIS 
                        Randy and I are gonna grab her on
                        her way to school.  Then take her up
                        to the reservoir while Hyrum calls
                        the dad.

                                 HOLLY 
                        Hyrum getting the money?

                                 DENNIS 
                        No, Bo's supposed to get it.  Then
                        we're meeting up afterwards.  Hyrum's
                        staying out of it as much as possible.  

                                 HOLLY 
                        That's good.  How much is the ransom?

                                 DENNIS
                        Twenty thousand.

                                 HOLLY 
                           (pause)
                        He suspect anything?

                                 DENNIS 
                        I don't think so.

           Holly opens her purse.  She pulls out a small gun.
                                 HOLLY 
                        This is our last chance here, Dennis. 
                        You get that money.  You hear me? 
                        Do not screw this up.

           Dennis looks down at the gun.  Then takes it.

           EXT. ST. MARY’S ACADEMY -- MORNING

           An old red-brick building on a tree-lined street.  Cars pass. 
           KIDS hurry to school.  This is Salt Lake City.  A quiet
           neighborhood but a far cry from the small town we just left.

           INT./EXT. RANDY’S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Parked across the street, Dennis and Randy watch as several
           kids pass by dressed in private school uniforms.

                                 RANDY 
                        You see her?

                                 DENNIS
                        Not yet. 

           They wait, watching.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        So when we see her, I just grab her?

                                 RANDY
                        You just grab her.

                                 DENNIS
                        Right.

           They wait.  Silence.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Why were you and Bo arguing?

                                 RANDY
                        Don't know what you're talking about.

                                 DENNIS
                        At Hyrum's.  He seemed upset about
                        something.

                                 RANDY
                        Don't know what you're talking about.

           Dennis starts to speak again but sees something and ducks.  

           A LITTLE GIRL (9) walks past.

                                 RANDY (CONT'D)
                        What?  Is that her?
                                 DENNIS
                        I think so.

                                 RANDY
                        You think so, or it is?

                                 DENNIS
                        It is.  She wears that same uniform.

                                 RANDY
                        They all wear that same uniform!

                                 DENNIS
                        No, that’s her.  I got her.

           Dennis climbs out, then sticks his head back in.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        So I just grab her, right?

                                 RANDY
                        Yes, Dennis, you just grab her!

                                 DENNIS
                        Ok, I got it.

           EXT. ST. MARY'S ACADEMY -- CONTINUOUS 

           Dennis walks after the Little Girl, closing in.

                                 DENNIS
                        Uh...excuse me.

           She turns around. 

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        You’re Margot, right?

                                 LITTLE GIRL 
                           (hesitant)
                        Yeah.  Why? 

           INT./EXT. RANDY'S CAR -- MORNING

           They drive in silence, up a winding mountain road.  The Little
           Girl looks out the window, confused.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL 
                        Where are we going?

                                 RANDY
                        You shut your mouth.

           INT./EXT. RANDY’S CAR -- LATER

           They pull to a stop next to a small reservoir.  Bare hills
           surround them.  Isolation.  
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I thought we were getting hamburgers.

                                 RANDY
                        And I thought I told you to shut
                        your mouth.  You can sit there and
                        keep quiet, or I can put you in the
                        trunk.  Which one's it gonna be?

           The Little Girl stares back but says nothing.

                                 DENNIS
                        We're just doing some business with
                        your dad, then you can go home.  

                                 RANDY
                        Why don't you worry a little less
                        about the kid and a little more about
                        the task at hand.  How's that sound?

                                 DENNIS
                        Sounds fine.  
                           (pause)
                        So...what do we do now?

                                 RANDY
                        We let them know we got her.

           Randy dials and holds his PHONE to his ear.  Dennis sits
           back, trying to act calm.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        What’s this?

           They look back to see the Little Girl holding Holly’s gun. 
           Randy hangs up the phone.  Dennis quickly checks his pockets.

                                 RANDY
                        Is that your gun?

                                 DENNIS
                        It’s...the gun I borrowed.  Yeah.

                                 RANDY
                        No one told you to bring a gun?

                                 DENNIS
                        It was just for backup.

                                 RANDY 
                        Let me ask you something, Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Don’t say my name--
                                 RANDY
                        Just let me ask you something.  Are
                        you stupid, or are you totally stupid?

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 RANDY
                        I said, are you stupid, or are you
                        totally stupid?

                                 DENNIS 
                        That...seems like kind of a trick
                        question.

                                 RANDY
                        Just get your gun from the little
                        girl in the back seat!

           Dennis reaches back, but she points the gun at him.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You said we were getting hamburgers.

                                 DENNIS
                           (to Randy)
                        She’s really hungry.

           Randy shakes his head and pulls out his own gun.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 RANDY 
                        The answer, by the way, is totally
                        stupid. 

           Randy turns and puts his gun against the Little Girl's head.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)  (CONT'D)
                        Put it down, you little shit.

                                 DENNIS
                        Will you calm down!?  We’ll just get
                        the kid a burger.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        And a shake.

                                 DENNIS
                        And a shake.  We’ll just get the kid
                        a burger and a shake.

                                 RANDY
                        Nobody’s getting a shake!
           BANG.  Blood splatters across Dennis’s face.  Randy collapses
           on the steering wheel, a gaping hole in the side of his head. 

           Dennis turns to the Little Girl, shocked.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Uh-oh.

                                 DENNIS
                        What did you do that for?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It was an accident.

                                 DENNIS
                        You shot him in the face!

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You’re the one who’s supposed to be
                        watching me!

           Dennis looks at Randy and starts to panic.

                                 DENNIS
                        Damn it.  Damn it.  Damn it!

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Dennis.

           He looks back; she's pointing the gun at him again.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are you doing?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I can't have any witnesses.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I'm going to Harvard, Dennis.  I
                        can't have this on my record.

                                 DENNIS
                        It was just an accident.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You think Harvard cares about
                        accidents, Dennis?  Harvard doesn't
                        care about accidents.

                                 DENNIS
                        I won't say anything.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It's too late for that, Dennis.  I'm
                        sorry.

           Her finger tightens on the trigger.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Wait, no, please.

           Dennis cowers.  Then...

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Just kidding!

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You should see your face.  I don't
                        even want to go to Harvard.

                                 DENNIS
                        What is wrong with you!

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                           (suddenly defensive)
                        I've got a chemical imbalance.  It's
                        not polite to ask about it.

           Randy's phone begins to RING: Toby Keith's "Whiskey Girl." 
           Dennis looks at it: HYRUM CALLING.  

           EXT. RESERVOIR -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis climbs out, freaking out.

                                 DENNIS
                        Damn it, damn it, damn it!

           The Little Girl gets out.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        What's his name?

                                 DENNIS
                        What?
                           (realizing)
                        Randy.

           She looks at Randy through the blood-speckled glass.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Hey, Randy, let me ask you something. 
                        Are you stupid, or are you totally
                        stupid?

           She looks up at Dennis, smiling.  Dennis is horrified.  
           EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Jarom City.  A shabby little rental.  Dennis collects himself,
           then knocks.  

           Hurried FOOTSTEPS.  The door swings open and Holly emerges,
           a suitcase in her hand.  

                                 HOLLY
                        How'd it go?  You get it?  

                                 DENNIS
                        Listen babe, I gotta tell you
                        something, but you've got to promise--

                                 HOLLY
                        Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

           Holly notices the Little Girl standing at the bottom of the
           steps.  Dennis doesn't know where to begin.

           INT. HOLLY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

           Holly storms around the room, unpacking her suitcases.

                                 HOLLY
                        How did the gun accidentally go off? 
                        Can you explain that to me?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  It just sorta happened.

                                 HOLLY
                        Dumb son-of-a-bitch.  I knew you
                        were gonna screw this up?

                                 DENNIS
                        I was just doing what you told me. 
                        This whole thing was your idea.

                                 HOLLY
                        So now this is my fault?

                                 DENNIS
                        No, I didn't say--

                                 HOLLY
                        All I knew was Hyrum had a big deal
                        going down, and if we could get our
                        hands on that money maybe we could
                        get ourselves a fresh start.  Guess
                        that was just too much to ask.

           She slings her purse over her shoulder and walks out.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where are you going?
                                 HOLLY
                        I gotta go to work!  

                                 DENNIS
                        I thought we were leaving town.

                                 HOLLY
                        How are we supposed to leave now? 
                        We ain't got no money.

           EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Holly hurries to her car.  Dennis follows.  The Little Girl
           comes out after them.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, please don't go back there.

                                 HOLLY
                        You think I like working there?  You
                        think I like that pole pressing on
                        my bladder when I gotta pee every
                        five minutes?  We've got an unborn
                        child coming, Dennis!  Someone's got
                        to provide for it.

                                 DENNIS
                        What am I supposed to do with her?

                                 HOLLY
                        She knows your name, Dennis.  She
                        knows where I live.  You gotta get
                        rid of her.

                                 DENNIS
                           (horrified, whispering)
                        You mean like drown her in the bath
                        or something?

           Holly is speechless.

                                 HOLLY
                        No, I don't mean like drown her in
                        the bath or something.  I mean take
                        her home.  'Drown her in the bath?'
                        That's the first thing that jumps
                        into your head?

                                 DENNIS
                        Can you at least give us a ride?

                                 HOLLY
                        No, I can't give you a ride.  I'm
                        already late.  Hyrum's gonna be
                        suspicious.

           Holly drives off.  The Little Girl stands next to Dennis.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.  

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is Holly gonna have a baby?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah.  She's gonna have a baby.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        A boy or girl?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I just hope it's a girl.  Then we
                        can call her Jessica.

           EXT. JAROM CITY -- DAY

           Dennis walks down the road, the Little Girl in tow.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Where are we going?

                                 DENNIS
                        To my mom's house.  We need a car.

           The muffled SOUNDS of "Whiskey Girl" come from somewhere.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What's that?

           The Little Girl pulls Randy's phone.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Who's Hyrum?

                                 DENNIS
                        Why do you have Randy's phone!?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        He doesn't need it anymore.

                                 DENNIS
                        Don't answer it!

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Does it look like I'm answering it?

                                 DENNIS
                        Oh, man.
           He turns and keeps walking.  The Little Girl hurries after.

           EXT. THE OASIS -- DAY

           A ragged bar and strip joint off the two-lane desert highway. 
           Holly pulls into the parking lot and gets out of her car.

           INT. THE OASIS -- DAY

           A few EARLY CUSTOMERS, but the place is mostly dead.  Holly
           enters and makes straight for the back.  Gretchen is sweeping.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Hey there, Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        Hey, Gretchen.

                                 BECKY (O.S.)
                        You're late.

           BECKY (50s), a hard, older woman dressed in the same
           conservative style as Gretchen, is standing behind the bar.  

           Holly stops, but just for a moment.

                                 HOLLY
                        My car wouldn't start.

                                 BECKY
                        Again?

                                 HOLLY
                        That's what I said.

                                 BECKY
                        Hyrum wants to see you.

           Holly disappears into the back.

           INT. THE OASIS, DRESSING ROOM -- DAY

           Holly fastens stockings to her panties.  She wears a faded
           blue corset and heels.  

           There's a KNOCK as Gretchen enters.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        You seen Randy today by chance?

                                 HOLLY
                           (stiffening slightly)
                        No, I sure haven't.  Hyrum tell you
                        to ask me that?
                                 GRETCHEN
                        No, course not.  I just got something
                        real important I gotta tell him is
                        all.  Thought maybe you'd seen him.

                                 HOLLY
                        Sorry.  Not today.

                                 GRETCHEN
                           (lingering)
                        Oh.  I was just wondering because he
                        was supposed to stop by, but he
                        hasn't.  Just had something important
                        to tell him is all.

           Her last few words are a little strained.  Holly looks up
           and sees that she's fighting back tears.

                                 HOLLY
                        Gretchen, what's the matter?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Oh Holly, I done something real bad.  

           INT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Dennis's mom, KATHLENE, a frazzled woman in an oversized-
           sweater, pushes a noisy vacuum.  

                                 DENNIS
                           (yelling over noise)
                        It's just for an hour or two.

                                 KATHLENE
                        I don't care if it's for a minute or
                        two.  You didn't put gas in it last
                        time.

                                 DENNIS
                        Isaac never puts gas in it.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Isaac doesn't have a job on account
                        of he's going to Afghanistan soon.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Isaac's not going to Afghanistan.

                                 KATHLENE
                        He is so.  Just as soon as he drops
                        some weight.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, and how's that going?  How
                        many Mountain Dews he had today?
                                 KATHLENE
                        He did pushups today is what he did.

                                 DENNIS
                        Really?  You saw him do these pushups?

                                 KATHLENE
                           (whispering)
                        You're brother's going overseas to
                        kill al-Qaeda, Mr. smarty-pants. 
                        And who knows whether he's even going
                        to make it home alive.  Maybe you
                        could show some respect.

                                 DENNIS
                        I see.  So now it's a suicide mission.

           ISAAC (late 20s), Dennis's over-weight younger brother, comes
           in.  He has a box of fruit roll-ups in his hand.

                                 ISAAC
                        Hey, Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 ISAAC
                        Did you eat one of my fruit rolls?

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  No.

                                 ISAAC
                        Well, I was just wondering because
                        one is missing, and I thought that
                        was kinda weird.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, I didn't take it.

                                 ISAAC
                        Hmmm.  Because I wrote 'Isaac' right
                        here on the box, and your name's not
                        Isaac, so...hmmm. 

                                 DENNIS
                        I didn't eat your damn fruit roll,
                        Isaac.

           Kathlene kills the VACUUM.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Hey!  You watch the language in this
                        house.  
                                 DENNIS
                        Can I please borrow the car?  I'll
                        put some gas in it.

                                 KATHLENE
                        No.

           She starts up the VACUUM again.

           INT. THE OASIS, DRESSING ROOM -- DAY

           Holly comforts Gretchen.

                                 HOLLY
                        I'm sorry, sweetheart.  I wish I
                        knew what to tell you.  

                                 GRETCHEN
                        It's ok.  I just gotta talk to Randy
                        is all.

                                 HOLLY
                        I ain't so sure that's gonna happen.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        What do you mean?

           The door opens and Becky glares down at Holly.

                                 BECKY
                        I told you Hyrum wanted to see you.

                                 HOLLY
                        After my shift.

                                 BECKY
                        He wants to see you now.

                                 HOLLY
                        I'm about to go on.

                                 BECKY
                        Well, then you better get your skinny
                        ass a-movin.'

           INT. THE OASIS, OFFICE -- DAY

           Holly enters the dark, cluttered office.  She has her coat
           on over her underwear.  

           Behind the desk sits Hyrum.

                                 HOLLY
                        Becky said you wanted to see me.

                                 HYRUM
                        Have a seat.
                                 HOLLY
                        I'm about to go on.

                                 HYRUM
                        Sit down.

           She hesitates, keeping her eyes on Hyrum.

                                 HOLLY
                        Fine.  Tell Terry to leave.

           TERRY, an odd-looking man in an over-sized suit, sits at a
           make-shift desk in the corner.  His RIGHT HAND is dark and
           slightly withered.

                                 HYRUM
                        Why?

                                 HOLLY
                        Because he gives me the creeps.

                                 HYRUM
                        And how's that?

                                 HOLLY
                        He's always staring at my ass.  The
                        way he is right now.

           Terry looks up from her ass to Hyrum, who nods for him to
           leave.  

           Terry closes a BLACK LEATHER BOOK and takes it with him.

           When he's gone Holly sits.

                                 HYRUM
                        Where's Dennis?

                                 HOLLY
                        How am I supposed to know?  I thought
                        he was working for you.

                                 HYRUM
                        He's with Randy.  Randy's not
                        answering his phone.

                                 HOLLY
                        What's that got to do with me?

                                 HYRUM
                        I thought you said your man was
                        reliable.

                                 HOLLY
                        He's not my man, and I never said he
                        was reliable.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        I said he kept his mouth shut and
                        was desperate and dumb enough to do
                        whatever you told him.

                                 HYRUM
                        When did you see him last?

                                 HOLLY
                        I don't know, yesterday.  Why, what
                        do you got him doing?

           Hyrum shifts in his chair but doesn't answer.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Well if that's all, there's some fat
                        sons-of-bitches waiting for me to
                        take my clothes off.

                                 HYRUM
                        One more thing.  How far along are
                        you?

                                 HOLLY
                        Two months.

           Hyrum smiles, an unpleasant sight.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Four.

                                 HYRUM
                        Gonna have to let you go.

                                 HOLLY
                        The hell you are.  

                                 HYRUM
                        You're showing too much.

                                 HOLLY
                        What about when Krissy's dad got
                        dementia and she had to wipe his
                        feces off all the house plants?  

                                 HYRUM
                        What about it?

                                 HOLLY
                        She put on all that weight, but you
                        didn't fire her.

                                 HYRUM
                        It's not the weight.  Men see a
                        pregnant woman, and they start
                        thinking of the consequences of their
                        decisions.  It's bad for business.
                                 HOLLY
                        You can't fire me.  I got a baby
                        coming.  At least let me stand behind
                        the bar and serve drinks.

                                 HYRUM
                        Becky tends bar, and she don't want
                        you around Gretchen.

                                 HOLLY
                        Why the hell not?

                                 HYRUM
                        Says you're a bad influence.

           A little desperation creeps into Holly's voice.

                                 HOLLY
                        Hyrum, I need this job.  I ain't got
                        nothing else.

                                 HYRUM
                        You could always reconsider my offer.
                           (pause)
                        If he ain't your man.

                                 HOLLY
                        You got enough wives around here as
                        it is.

                                 HYRUM
                        I wouldn't mind about the kid.  Hell,
                        we do it fast maybe I'll even make
                        it a twin.

                                 HOLLY
                        That ain't how twins work.

                                 HYRUM
                        Tell that to Jacob and Daryl.

           On the wall is a picture of JACOB and DARYL, identical twins
           dressed in matching polygamist outfits.

                                 HOLLY
                        I think I'll pass.

                                 HYRUM
                        Suit yourself.

           INT. THE OASIS -- DAY

           Holly storms past Gretchen and Becky at the bar.

                                 HOLLY
                        You owe me two weeks pay.
           EXT. THE OASIS -- DAY

           Holly walks to her car.  Gretchen follows her out.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Holly.  Where you going?

                                 HOLLY
                        Your husband just fired me.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Why?  Because of the baby?  Maybe I
                        could talk to him for you.

                                 HOLLY
                        He's already made up his mind.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Holly.

           Her pleading voice stops Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        Listen, I'm sorry, Gretchen.  But I
                        got a world of problems of my own
                        right now.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        There's something else I didn't tell
                        you.  Something else I done.  I'm
                        worried Hyrum's gonna find out.
                           (holding back tears)
                        I just gotta talk to Randy.

           Holly is torn.  Becky steps out of the bar.

                                 BECKY
                        Get on back to work now, Gretchen.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Holly, I'm scared.

                                 BECKY
                        I ain't gonna ask you twice.

                                 HOLLY
                        What time you get done tonight?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Nine o'clock.

                                 HOLLY
                        Come by my place after.  We'll sort
                        this whole thing out.  Alright?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Thank you.
           She hugs Holly then hurries back inside.  Becky stares at
           Holly a moment, then goes in.

           INT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY

           The phone RINGS.  Kathlene answers.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Hello.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Hey Kathlene, is Dennis there?

           Kathlene stiffens.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Yeah, he's here.
                           (yelling)
                        Dennis, your stripper girlfriend's
                        on the telephone.

           Dennis comes in.

                                 DENNIS
                        Do you have to call her my stripper
                        girlfriend?

                                 KATHLENE
                        I'm sorry.  She not your girlfriend?

           She hands him the phone and leaves.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hello?

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        You take the girl back yet?

                                 DENNIS
                        Still...kinda working on that.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Well forget it.  You gotta ransom
                        her, Dennis.  You gotta get that
                        money from her daddy.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  I can't do it by myself.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Hyrum just fired me.  And he's looking
                        for you.  

                                 DENNIS
                        What'd he say?
                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        He said he can't get a hold of Randy,
                        and he's getting suspicious.  You
                        gotta get outa town.

                                 DENNIS
                        That's what I've been trying to tell
                        you.  You gotta come get me.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        We need money, Dennis.  You gotta
                        ransom that girl, and you gotta do
                        it quick.

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know how to do it, Holly. 
                        Besides, my mom won't let me borrow
                        the car.

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        I don't care how you do it, Dennis! 
                        If you ever want to see me or your
                        baby again you better get that money!

           She hangs up on him.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Dennis.

           He turns around and sees her standing there.

                                 DENNIS
                        I told you to wait outside.  

           She dangles a set of keys.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Where'd you get those?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        In her purse.  Can I drive?

                                 DENNIS
                        No, you can't drive.  Is that a fruit
                        roll?

           She takes a bite of something red and leathery.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        No.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY

           A wealthy Salt Lake City block.  Old, beautiful houses. 
           Dennis and the Little Girl pull up in Kathlene's car.
           INT./EXT. KATHLENE'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis eyes a BIG HOUSE just down the street.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Where are we?

                                 DENNIS
                        What do you mean where are we?  This
                        is where they said you lived.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        But what about the hamburgers?

                                 DENNIS
                        Just wait here five minutes.  I'll
                        be right back.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis steps out of the car.  The Little Girl gets out too.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are you doing?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I'm going with you.

                                 DENNIS
                        You can't go with me.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Why not?

                                 DENNIS
                        Because I can't ransom you back if
                        you're already there.  That's not
                        how it works.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't care how it works, Dennis. 
                        I'm hungry.

                                 DENNIS
                        You just had a fruit roll.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I'm still hungry.

           Dennis pulls out a few crumpled bills and hands them to her.

                                 DENNIS
                        Just wait in the car, and then you
                        can buy yourself two hamburgers, ok.

           He scoots her back in the car and turns toward the house.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        He's gonna be real mad at you.

                                 DENNIS
                        You just let me worry about that.

           INT./EXT. BO'S TRUCK -- MOMENTS LATER

           Bo sits behind the wheel, waiting.  He looks back at the
           Chambers house in his side mirror and is startled to see
           Dennis walking to the door.

                                 BO
                        What the hell?

           EXT. CHAMBERS HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis knocks.  MR. CHAMBERS (45) opens.  He wears a tailored
           suit and has a tough, handsome face, a politicians's face.

                                 DENNIS
                        Mr. Chambers?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Can I help you?

                                 DENNIS
                           (nervous)
                        Well sir, I work for Hyrum.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Is that right?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yes, sir.  And he uh...he wants his
                        money now.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                           (closing the door)
                        I already told Hyrum what he can do
                        with his threats.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well sir, the thing is, we have your
                        daughter Margot.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Excuse me?
                                 DENNIS
                        She's ok.  We're not gonna hurt her. 
                        All we want is the money.  Just give
                        it to me, and we'll let her go.

           Mr. Chambers stares at Dennis for a long moment.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Better come inside.

           INT. CHAMBERS HOUSE, BILLIARD ROOM -- DAY

           Mr. Chambers shows Dennis in.  It's an old, elegant house. 
           A large billiard table fills the room.  

           CODY (20s), good-looking kid with a small, muscled frame,
           sinks his shot as Dennis enters.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        This is my son-in-law Cody.  Cody,
                        this gentleman works for Hyrum.

                                 CODY
                        What's he want?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                           (to Dennis)
                        Better tell him.

           Dennis is getting less comfortable by the second.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum's holding Margot until I get
                        his money.

           Cody looks at Mr. Chambers but says nothing.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Bring her in.

           Cody leaves.

                                 DENNIS
                        Wait, what?  Who's he bringing in?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        My daughter.  Margot.  She's watching
                        cartoons in the next room.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        She didn't go to school today.  Had
                        a little bit of a stomach ache.
                                 DENNIS
                        I don't understand.  Do you have two
                        daughters?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        My other daughter is married to Cody. 
                        She's twenty-three, and she's been
                        here all morning taking care of her
                        sister.

                                 DENNIS
                        Wait, does Margot wear a uniform? 
                        Like a private school thing?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        All the girls at her school wear
                        uniforms.  They're compulsory.

           Cody walks in with MARGOT CHAMBERS.  She looks similar to
           the Little Girl, but far from identical.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        Margot, do you know this man?

           She shakes her head.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever seen him before?

           Shakes her head again.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, sweetie.  Go on up to
                        your room and play now, will you?

           She leaves.  Mr. Chambers rolls the cue ball across the table. 
           It hits three sides and lands quietly back in his hand.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        I think it's time you explained your
                        little joke, son.  I'm not sure I
                        find it amusing.

                                 DENNIS
                        I must have made a mistake.  Sorry.  
                        I'll just show myself out--

           Mr. Chambers clutches the ball and smashes it across Dennis's
           face.  Dennis falls on the table.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        If Hyrum thinks he can threaten my
                        family he's got another thing coming.

           Cody pulls Dennis up and holds him.
                                 DENNIS
                        I'm sorry.  It's just a big
                        misunderstanding.

           Another shot to the face.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        You think you can kidnap my little
                        girl while I just stand by?

                                 DENNIS
                        I thought I didn't kidnap her.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        No.  You thought you did.

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, but I didn't.

           Another blow.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        You tell that bastard he's got nothing
                        on me.  I ain't any more afraid of
                        him than I am a fly on a buck's balls.  

                                 DENNIS
                        You don't understand.  I don't even
                        like the guy.  I hate his guts.  

           A punch to the stomach; Cody lets Dennis fall to the floor.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Tell Hyrum next time someone goes
                        missing, it's gonna be someone he
                        cares about.  And it won't just be
                        an empty threat.

           He kicks Dennis once for good measure.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        Now get the hell off my carpet.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY

           Dennis marches away from the house, straight for the car. 

           Suddenly he's grabbed from behind and spun around.  He finds
           himself face-to-face with Bo.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hey, Bo.  What are you doing here?

                                 BO
                        I'm supposed to be here!  Hyrum's
                        been calling--where the hell've you
                        been?
                                 DENNIS
                        Well...that's a good question...

           He glances quickly over to Kathlene's car.  The Little Girl
           hasn't seen them, and Bo hasn't seen her. 

                                 BO
                        Where's Randy?

                                 DENNIS
                        That's who I'm looking for.

                                 BO
                        What do you mean that's who you're
                        looking for?  
                           (realizing)
                        What the hell happened to your face?

           Dennis smiles.  His face is bumped and bruising.

           INT. THE OASIS, OFFICE -- DAY

           Dennis sits across from Hyrum.  Bo hovers nearby.

                                 BO
                        Bullshit!  He's lying.

                                 HYRUM
                        Bo doesn't like your story, Dennis.

                                 BO
                        My brother ain't no backstabber.

                                 DENNIS
                        I swear to you.  That's what happened.

                                 HYRUM
                        Let me explain something to you,
                        Dennis.  Something that might shed
                        some light on the present situation. 
                        Do you know what's really important? 
                        In life I mean.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

           Hyrum comes around and sits on the edge of his desk.

                                 HYRUM
                        Family.  Family is what's important. 
                        It's the only thing that matters.  I
                        love my family.  I love my wives.  I
                        love all my children.  I love my
                        brother Terry.  Come over here, Terry.

           Terry picks up his black leather book and joins Hyrum.
                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        Terry is an inspiration to me.  I
                        don't know if you noticed, but Terry
                        has a himself a hand of the withered
                        nature.  Now he could say, 'God cursed
                        me with this withered appendage, so
                        I'm just gonna give up and not make
                        anything with my life.'  But does he
                        say that?  Do you say that, Terry?

                                 TERRY
                        No.

                                 HYRUM
                        No.  He doesn't say that.  Because
                        Terry is an inspiration.  He doesn't
                        let a little old thing like a withered
                        hand hold him back.  He can do
                        anything you or I can do.  Who put
                        your pants on for you this morning,
                        Terry?

                                 TERRY
                        I did.

                                 HYRUM
                        Who put on that shirt and buttoned
                        up that vest?

                                 TERRY
                        Me.

                                 HYRUM
                        What did I tell you?  My brother's a
                        damn inspiration.

                                 DENNIS
                        Wow.  Can he tie his shoes?

           Hyrum gives Dennis an icy stare.

                                 HYRUM
                        Excuse me?

                                 DENNIS
                        I just wondered if he can tie his
                        shoes.

           Silence.

                                 HYRUM
                        No he can't tie his shoes!  He uses
                        a shoe horn.  It takes two hands to
                        tie a pair of shoes.  Can you tie
                        your fucking shoes with one hand!?
                                 DENNIS
                        No.  Sorry.  I was just trying to go
                        along with it.

                                 HYRUM
                        Terry is an inspiration, Dennis. 
                        When he came to me six years ago and
                        said, 'Hyrum, I'd like to become an
                        accountant,' what do you think he
                        did?

                                 DENNIS
                        Became an accountant?

                                 HYRUM
                        That's right.  Despite having a
                        withered hand, Terry became the best
                        damn accountant in this county.  And
                        now he works for me, and I'm damn
                        lucky to have him. 
                           (calming himself)
                        Do you understand what I'm telling
                        you, Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        Not really.

                                 HYRUM
                        My point is: family is important. 
                        So when you come in here with a story
                        about Randy taking the girl and
                        stealing my ransom money, naturally
                        Randy's brother isn't gonna like it.

           Bo watches Dennis, barely containing his rage.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        Naturally he's gonna want to rip
                        your insides out and stomp on them. 
                        I understand that.  And to be honest
                        I'm about to let him do it, because
                        your story doesn't make a whole lot
                        of sense to me, Dennis.  Now where's
                        Randy?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.

                                 HYRUM
                        Where's the girl, Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        I told you.  Randy beat me up and
                        took her.  Look at my face.

                                 HYRUM
                        You were at her house!
                                 DENNIS
                        I thought maybe he was going there
                        to get the money.

           Bo's had enough.  He knocks Dennis to the floor.

                                 BO
                        Son-of-a-bitch is lying.

                                 DENNIS
                        Will everyone please stop hitting
                        me!?

                                 HYRUM
                        Tell you what I'm gonna do, Dennis. 
                        I'm gonna call Randy one more time.  

                                 DENNIS
                           (panicked)
                        No.  I already tried calling.  He's
                        not gonna answer.

                                 HYRUM
                        You just better hope he does.

           Hyrum picks up the phone and dials.

           Dennis holds his breath. 

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 HYRUM
                        Who's this?

           INT./EXT. KATHLENE'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           The Little Girl is still waiting for Dennis.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Who's this?

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Is Randy there?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Um...not really.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Where is he?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        He's in the bathroom.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Well, can you tell him he's wanted
                        on the telephone.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                           (pause)
                        No.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I'm not going to do that.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Why not?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because I don't want to.

           INT. THE OASIS, OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Hyrum is taken aback.

                                 HYRUM
                        Excuse me?  What do you mean you
                        don't...where are you?

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        I have to go now.

                                 HYRUM
                        Margot, where are you!?

           The line goes silent.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        Margot!  Hello?

           He slams the phone down.  He looks at Dennis, then Bo.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        He's telling the truth.

                                 BO
                        What!?

                                 HYRUM
                        Randy's got the girl.

           The news hits Bo hard.  He takes a second to let it sink in.

                                 BO
                        Where?

                                 HYRUM
                        I don't know.  Find out and bring
                        them back here. 

           Bo hurries to the door.
                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        And take Dennis with you.

           Bo looks down at Dennis, who forces a smile.

           INT. RANDY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           A dingy little place, mostly empty.  The door is kicked open
           and Bo steps in, followed by Dennis.

                                 BO
                        Randy? 

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, I guess he's not here.

           Bo looks around.

                                 BO
                        This is a waste of time.  Randy
                        wouldn't steal from Hyrum.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, I just hope you're right.  I
                        always liked Randy.

           Bo scowls at Dennis, then disappears into the next room.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Listen Bo, maybe we should split up
                        and look for him separate.  Maybe
                        we'll find him quicker if we divide
                        and conquer, you know?

           No reply.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Bo?

           INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY

           Dennis finds Bo standing next to the bed.  There's a suitcase
           on top.

           Bo opens the case.  It's packed to the brim.

                                 DENNIS
                        That doesn't look good.

           Bo looks at Dennis, then punches him in the gut, dropping
           him to the floor. 

           Bo steps over him, SLAMMING the front door on his way out.

           INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- DAY

           Dennis picks up the phone and dials.
                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Hello.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hey babe, listen I need you--

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        You get the money?

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, not exactly.  There was a
                        problem with the girl.

                                 HOLLY
                        What do yo mean 'problem'?  Where is
                        she?

           EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE -- DAY

           Dennis waits on the curb.  Holly drives up.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis gets in.  He notices the Little Girl in the back seat. 
           She smiles.

                                 HOLLY
                        You don't leave a child in a parked
                        car, Dennis.  That's how they
                        suffocate.  You don't know a damn
                        thing about child-rearin' do you?

                                 DENNIS
                        I left the window cracked.

                                 HOLLY
                           (shaking her head)
                        I should have married Chip Conroy.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, don't start with Chip.

                                 HOLLY
                        Chip lives in Los Angeles.  Owns his
                        own business and everything.  He
                        doesn't have to kidnap little girls. 
                        But if he did you could bet he'd
                        have the sense to get the right one!

                                 DENNIS
                        I got confused.  Margot wears that
                        exact same uniform.

                                 HOLLY
                        They all wear the same uniform,
                        Dennis!  That's why they're called
                        uniforms.
           He has no argument for that.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Chip and I were high school
                        sweethearts.  Shoulda got married,
                        that's all.

                                 DENNIS
                        Enough with Chip, Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        Even went to junior prom together. 
                        Had ourselves a swell time too.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, Chip Conroy is gay.

                                 HOLLY
                           (shocked)
                        Oh, what now, you're gonna go
                        spreading fear and hatred in front
                        of your unborn child?

                                 DENNIS
                        No.  I'm saying Chip liked boys.  He
                        wasn't gonna marry you.

                                 HOLLY
                        Chip and I were high school
                        sweethearts, Dennis.  We went to
                        junior prom together.

                                 DENNIS
                        Chip married his high school
                        sweetheart, Nate Wilson.

                                 HOLLY
                        Chip didn't meet Nate until senior
                        year.  Chip and I went to junior
                        prom.  And you better believe we had
                        ourselves a swell time!

           Dennis laughs to himself, pure frustration.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Are you doubting my sex appeal?

                                 DENNIS
                        No, I'm not doubting your sex ap--

                                 HOLLY
                        I may be great with child, but don't
                        you dare doubt my sex appeal.
                           (to Little Girl)
                        You hear that, princess.  Never let
                        a man doubt your sex appeal.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Oh, I won't.

                                 HOLLY
                        There's a good girl.   

                                 DENNIS
                        Will you stop saying sex in front of
                        her?

                                 HOLLY
                        I'm talking about allure, Dennis. 
                        I'm talking about the feminine wile. 
                        I ain't talking about where babies
                        come from.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I already know where babies come
                        from.

                                 HOLLY
                        She already knows where babies come
                        from.

           Dennis is subdued. 

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- DAY

           Kathlene's car is right where they left it.  Holly pulls up. 
           Dennis and the Little Girl get out.

                                 DENNIS
                        I know you're mad at me, but after I
                        drop her off we gotta figure this
                        out.  Bo and Hyrum ain't gonna stay
                        fooled for long--

                                 HOLLY
                        I don't want you around me or my
                        baby no more.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 HOLLY
                        You heard me.  I don't ever want to
                        see you again.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, don't say that.  We're engaged.

                                 HOLLY
                        We ain't engaged.  If I was engaged
                        I'd have a ring on my finger.  You
                        see a ring on my finger?
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't see a ring.

           Dennis scowls at the Little Girl.

                                 DENNIS
                        I told you I was saving up so you
                        could pick out any ring you wanted.

                                 HOLLY
                        My baby needs a provider, Dennis. 
                        If you can't do it I'll find someone
                        who can.

           She drives off.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly!

           Dennis and the Little Girl hurry to Kathlene's.

           EXT. STREET -- DAY

           One of the nicer areas in Jarom City.  Holly steps out of
           her car and walks towards a small, well-kept house.

           Dennis pulls up and jumps out after her.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where are you going?

                                 HOLLY
                        Get back in the car, Dennis.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Who lives here?

                                 HOLLY
                        You think you're the only man I can
                        get?  I got plenty of men knocking
                        down my door.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, get back in the car.

           She steps onto the porch and knocks loudly.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        You better get out of here, Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly.
                                 HOLLY
                        Ain't gonna ask you again!

           JACKSON (38), a doughy man with glasses, opens the door. 
           Dennis hides behind some bushes.

                                 JACKSON
                        Hey there, Holly.  What are you doing
                        here?

                                 HOLLY
                           (forcing a smile)
                        I decided it was time to finally
                        take you up on your offer.  

                                 JACKSON
                        What offer?

                                 HOLLY
                        Well, you know how you're always
                        telling me about that cabin your
                        family's got up at Bear Lake?  And
                        how you're always begging me to go
                        up there with you?  Well, here I am.

                                 JACKSON
                        Are you pregnant?

                                 HOLLY
                        I remember you said it had a swing
                        that went out over the water.  Too
                        cold for that now, I guess.  But I
                        bet it's got a nice little fireplace
                        we could cozy up next to.

                                 JACKSON
                        Holly, I don't know what I said, but--

                                 HOLLY
                        You said you wanted to marry me so
                        you could have me all to yourself. 
                        You said you had dreams about me
                        just about every night.  Well, I'm
                        here to make all those dreams come
                        true.

                                 JACKSON
                        Look, if I gave you the wrong
                        impression I'm sorry.  I may have
                        been unclear about things.

                                 HOLLY
                        You weren't unclear at all, Jackson. 
                        In fact you were pretty damn specific
                        about the details of those dreams!
                                 JACKSON
                        I need you to leave now, Holly.

           Her desperation is starting to show.

                                 HOLLY
                        I know you've been wanting me for a
                        long time, and I promise you won't
                        be disappointed.  I know I can make
                        it worth the wait.

                                 JACKSON
                        You need to leave, Holly.

           He shuts the door, leaving her alone on the porch.  

           Dennis steps out from hiding, unsure what to say.

                                 DENNIS
                        That guy's an idiot.  Don't pay him
                        any attention.  You don't want a
                        creep like that around anyway.

           She walks down the steps, toward her car.  He follows her.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        I'll figure this out, Holly.  You
                        don't gotta worry about nothing.  I
                        know I screwed up, but I'll fix it--

           She turns on him, her face full of rage.

                                 HOLLY
                        Are you deaf or something?  I told
                        you I never wanted to see you again. 

                                 DENNIS
                           (reaching for her)
                        I swear to you I'll figure this out.

                                 HOLLY
                        Don't you touch me.  I told you to
                        stay away from me, and I meant it.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, just wait up a second.

           She turns on him again, holding back tears.

                                 HOLLY
                        I was all set and ready to leave you
                        when I found out I was pregnant. 
                        The only reason I didn't is because
                        I thought I needed you to take care
                        of me.  What was I thinking?  You
                        can't take care of anybody.
                                 DENNIS
                        Yes I can.  I can take care of you. 
                        I'll take care of our baby.

                                 HOLLY
                        You live with your mother, Dennis. 
                        You ain't got no job.  You ain't got
                        no car.  You ain't got nothing. 
                        Just who do you think you're fooling? 
                        You ain't done a single worthwhile
                        thing in your whole damn life.  

           He watches her drive away.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        She's really mad at you, huh?

           Dennis turns.  The Little Girl is standing next to him.

           Ready to explode, Dennis storms off down the street, away
           from the girl, away from the house, away from everything.

           She follows after him.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?
                           (no reply)
                        The car's over here.
                           (getting impatient)
                        Dennis!

           He stops, marches back to her.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why did you say you were Margot?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't know.  I thought maybe you
                        were giving her a prize or something.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why would I give her a prize?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't know.  So do you want to
                        know my real name now?

                                 DENNIS
                        No, I don't want to know your real
                        name.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Why not?  We're best friends now.

                                 DENNIS
                        We're not friends.  I kidnapped you.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Yeah, and now we're best friends.

                                 DENNIS
                        What is wrong with you?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I told you!  I either have too many
                        chemicals or just not enough.  I
                        can't remember which, so just stop
                        asking!

           It's hopeless.  Dennis blows past her, back to Kathlene's
           car.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 DENNIS
                        The hell away from you, that's where.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Dennis!

           He stops and turns around.  She's pointing the GUN at him.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why do you still have that!?

           EXT. FAST FOOD JOINT -- DAY

           Dennis and the Little Girl sit at a table next to the play
           area.  He looks miserable, she content.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Maybe we should get a hamburger for
                        Holly.

                                 DENNIS
                        She doesn't want a hamburger.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        How do you know?  She has to eat for
                        two, Dennis.  

                                 DENNIS
                        She doesn't want a hamburger because
                        she hates me.  Thanks to you.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        She's just mad at you.  Maybe if you
                        bring her something she won't be mad
                        anymore.

                                 DENNIS
                        Maybe you don't know what you're
                        talking about.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Maybe you don't know what you're
                        talking about.

           Dennis gives up.  He puts his head on the table.  

           As he does the Little Girl sees something in the play area
           behind him.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Can we please go now...

           He lifts his head but she's gone.  He looks back and sees
           her approaching TREVOR BANKS (10).  

           The Little Girl speaks to Trevor, but Dennis can't hear what
           they're saying.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           She points to Dennis and Trevor looks over.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh, that's great.  That's perfect.

           He looks around to see if anyone's watching.  The Little
           Girl comes back and sits down.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Who was that?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Trevor Banks.  Yesterday at school
                        he said he didn't want to be my
                        boyfriend.  Now he is my boyfriend.

                                 DENNIS
                        How'd you do that?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I told him you'd shoot his mom if he
                        didn't.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why would you say that!?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because his dad's already dead.

                                 DENNIS
                        No, I mean...

           He looks back and sees Trevor in tears.
           EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Dennis hurries to his car.  The Little Girl follows.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        What was I supposed to do, Dennis? 
                        He doubted my sex appeal.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Go away.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You forgot to get something for Holly.

           Dennis fumbles with the keys, finally dropping them.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why are you following me!?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I already told you.  We're best
                        friends now.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why me?   

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because no one else likes me, Dennis. 
                        There.  Are you happy now?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't like you.

           She stares back coolly and pulls the gun from her pocket.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What are you going to do, shoot me?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Maybe.

           Dennis puts the gun to his own forehead.

                                 DENNIS
                        Shoot me.  Please.  Put me out of my
                        misery. 

           She looks at him a long moment.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What are you waiting for?

           She walks away, leaving him alone.  Then...

           She walks back and SHOOTS HIM in the foot.  Dennis Falls to
           the ground.  Agony.  She walks off again.
           EXT. JAROM CITY HOSPITAL -- DAY

           A small single-story hospital.  Dennis comes out on crutches.  

           INT./EXT. KATHLENE'S CAR -- DAY

           Dennis turns the key, but the car won't start.  He tries
           again.  Same result.

           He looks at the gas gauge.  EMPTY.  He punches the steering
           wheel.  Repeatedly.

                                 DENNIS
                        Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  Shit.  SHIIIIT!

           He leans back, closing his eyes.

           There's a KNOCK on his window.  Cody stands there.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Oh man, come on.

           INT./EXT. LINCOLN TOWN CAR -- EVENING

           Salt Lake City.  Cody pulls up to a large, columned government
           building.  Dennis sits in the passenger seat.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are we doing here?

                                 CODY
                        My father-in-law doesn't like to do
                        business at home.  Get out.

           INT. MR. CHAMBER'S OFFICE -- EVENING

           Cody leads Dennis in.  Mr. Chambers sits behind a large desk.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Sit down.

                                 DENNIS
                        Look, I already told you.  It was
                        just a big misunderstand--

           Cody forces Dennis into a seat.  

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Why do you hate Hyrum?

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        You said you hated him.  I want to
                        know why.
                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  Because he's an
                        asshole.  Do I need a reason?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Yes.

                                 DENNIS
                        My fiancée works at his bar.  Is
                        that a good enough reason?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        She's a stripper?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yes, she's a stripper.  And I don't
                        like it, and I don't like him.

           Mr. Chambers looks him over.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        I have something for you.  Cody.

                                 DENNIS
                        Look man, can you just give me a
                        break?  People have been kicking my
                        ass all day. 

           Cody drops a heavy BRIEFCASE in Dennis's lap.  Not what Dennis
           was expecting.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What's that?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Do you know why Hyrum wants that
                        money?

                                 DENNIS
                        He said you owed him and wouldn't
                        pay.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        I don't owe Hyrum a damn thing. 
                        He's blackmailing me.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Why do you think so many men from
                        Salt Lake go to The Oasis?  We've
                        got plenty of strip clubs right here
                        in town.
                                 DENNIS
                        Because strippers have to wear those
                        nipple covers here.  You want to see
                        the real thing you have to go outside
                        the city limits.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        It's because it's remote.  This is a
                        religious town.  It doesn't do a man
                        any good to be seen walking out of a
                        place like that.  And that goes double
                        for an elected official, like myself. 
                        The Oasis offers a remote location
                        and unfamiliar faces.

                                 DENNIS
                        Ok.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        I wasn't exactly a regular, but I
                        did visit on occasion.
                           (looking at Cody)
                        I'm not proud to admit that, but
                        there it is.
                           (back to Dennis)
                        My last visit was three weeks ago. 
                        As I was leaving, said he wanted to
                        show me something.  He had a black,
                        leather book.  Have you seen it?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, his brother keeps it.  He's
                        Hyrum's accountant.

           Mr. Chambers looks at his son-in-law.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Do you know what's inside it? 

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  Accountant stuff?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        It contains records for a dozen or
                        so of Hyrum's out-of-town clients. 
                        Dates, arrival and departure times,
                        how much we spent.  Things that can
                        be checked.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why would he have that?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Because he realized he could make
                        more money blackmailing us than by
                        keeping us as customers.
                                 DENNIS
                        So...what?  You want me to give him
                        the money now?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        No.  That money is for you.  If you
                        bring me that book.

           Dennis is surprised.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        Open it.

           Dennis opens the briefcase.  There's a lot more than twenty
           thousand dollars inside.

                                 DENNIS
                        How much is that?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        That's every cent of one hundred
                        thousand dollars.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum told me it was twenty.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                           (amused)
                        I'm sure he did.  

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't understand.  If you wouldn't
                        pay Hyrum, why pay me?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        I'm a state politician.  And I'm
                        going to be a lot more than that by
                        the time I'm done.  I'm a man with a
                        lot to lose, and that makes Hyrum a
                        man with a lot to gain.  Even if I
                        pay Hyrum, there's nothing stopping
                        him from blackmailing me again.  And
                        again, and again.  If I have the
                        book he can't do that.

                                 DENNIS
                        How do you know I won't just do the
                        same thing?

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Because if you tried it I would take
                        you into the mountains and put two
                        bullets in the back of your head.  

                                 DENNIS
                        That's a pretty good reason.
                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        I made a mistake, and I'm willing to
                        pay for it.  But only once.  What do
                        you say?

           Dennis looks at the money.

                                 DENNIS
                        Alright.  But I need one thing.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        What's that?

                                 DENNIS
                        Can you give me a ride?

           INT./EXT. BO'S TRUCK -- EVENING

           Bo drives along a dirt road, searching.  The reservoir is
           off to his left.

           Something catches his eye and he stops, puts it in reverse.

           EXT. RESERVOIR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Bo pulls up behind Randy's car.  He walks to Randy's window
           and looks inside.  

           Randy lies there, dead.  Dried blood everywhere.  Bo doesn't
           move, just stands there, looking at his brother.

           EXT. THE OASIS -- EVENING

           Holly exits the building and walks to her car.

                                 DENNIS (O.S.)
                           (whispering)
                        Holly.

           Dennis hobbles out from the shadows.

                                 HOLLY
                        What are you doing here?  You want
                        to get yourself killed?

                                 DENNIS
                        Aren't you going to ask what happened
                        to my foot?

                                 HOLLY
                        No, because whatever it is, I already
                        know it's stupid.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are you doing here?
                                 HOLLY
                        I came to get my paycheck.  I'm going
                        back to my folks' place tomorrow.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why?

                                 HOLLY
                        Because I ain't got a whole lot of
                        other options at this point.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, now you do.  I've got a hundred
                        grand coming my way.  

           Holly scoffs and walks away.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        I'm serious, Holly.  I just gotta
                        find Terry.  

                                 HOLLY
                        Terry's gone.  He left with Hyrum.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where were they going?

                                 HOLLY
                        How the hell would I know?  Just get
                        out of town, will you?  Hyrum don't
                        know what's going on yet, but he
                        ain't exactly happy about it.

                                 DENNIS
                        I need a ride to Hyrum's place.  

                                 HOLLY
                        Are you listening to me?  You gotta
                        leave while you still can.

                                 DENNIS
                        I gotta find Terry first.

                                 HOLLY
                        I'm not going twenty minutes out of
                        my way just so you can get yourself
                        killed.

                                 DENNIS
                        Look, if I screw this up I swear
                        I'll never bother you again.  But I
                        gotta find Terry.  
                           (pause)
                        I promise this is the last favor
                        I'll ever ask you.
           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           Holly's car stops a few hundred feet away.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           They look at the large, foreboding house.

                                 HOLLY
                        This is stupid, Dennis.  What do you
                        think you're gonna do here? 

                                 DENNIS
                        I need you to do something for me.

                                 HOLLY
                        I thought that was your last favor.

                                 DENNIS
                        If I don't make it, I need you to
                        tell our baby I loved it.  
                           (pause)
                        And maybe also that I died doing
                        something great.  Like saving some
                        kids from drowning, or jumping real
                        far on a motorcycle.

                                 HOLLY
                           (pause)
                        Get out of my fucking car, Dennis.

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, BACKYARD -- EVENING

           Dennis creeps around back.  He looks into a window and sees
           Hyrum and Terry.  

           Terry has the BOOK in his good hand.

           Dennis goes for a closer look and sees that the Little Girl
           is there too.

                                 DENNIS
                        What the hell?

           THUMP.  Dennis drops.  Out Cold.  Bo stands behind him, a
           heavy piece of wood in his hand.

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, BACKYARD -- EVENING

           Dennis comes to.  He sits on a chair in the middle of a field. 
           His arms and legs tied.  Hyrum and Bo stare back at him.  

                                 HYRUM
                        You've got some talking to do, son.

           Dennis spots the Little Girl off to the side.  
                                 BO
                        She was just walking down the side
                        of the road.  All by her lonesome. 
                        The uniform caught my eye.

                                 DENNIS
                        What'd she say?  Don't believe
                        anything she tells you.  

                                 HYRUM
                        She didn't say anything.  Except
                        that she ain't never seen you before.

           Dennis looks at the Little Girl.  She stares back coolly.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  Of course she's seen me. 
                        Randy and I got her from school.

                                 HYRUM
                        That ain't what she says.  

                                 DENNIS
                        You can't listen to her.  She's crazy. 
                        She's not even Margot.  

           Hyrum starts to laugh.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        She's not.  We got the wrong little
                        girl.  That's not Margot Chambers.

           Hyrum's smile fades.  He turns to the Little Girl.

                                 HYRUM
                        What's your name little girl?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Margot Chambers.

                                 DENNIS
                        She's lying to you.  That is not
                        Margot.

                                 HYRUM
                        Sounds like the right little girl to
                        me.  It's time your story started
                        making some sense, Dennis.

           Hyrum unscrews the lid of an OLD METAL GAS CAN.

                                 DENNIS
                        What's that?
                                 HYRUM
                        When Terry and I were kids we had
                        this half brother from our dad's
                        first wife.  Big son of a bitch.  He
                        was always teasing Terry about his
                        hand.  Got a real kick out of making
                        him cry.  

           He saunters over to Dennis.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        I used to beg him to stop, but it
                        didn't ever do no good.  I'd be
                        begging, Terry'd be crying, but that
                        mean old bastard just kept on
                        laughing.  All amused as hell.  Just
                        kept right on teasing my little
                        brother on account of his abnormality. 
                        And then one day I figured out a way
                        to make him stop.

           Hyrum pours gas on Dennis's hand.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are you doing? 

                                 HYRUM
                        I thought maybe if he had an
                        abnormality of his own, he might not
                        be so quick to laugh at the
                        misfortunes of others.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum, what are you doing?  

           Dennis turns to the Little Girl and pleads.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Tell him I was with Randy when we
                        picked you up.  Tell him you recognize
                        me.

           Her expression doesn't change.

                                 HYRUM
                        He had third degree burns, and his
                        hand wasn't much use after that, but
                        he never teased Terry again.  Matter
                        of fact, he never so much as looked
                        Terry's direction from that day on.

                                 DENNIS
                        Please, you can't do this.  Hyrum,
                        I'm begging you.

                                 HYRUM
                        Still wanna stick to your story?
                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know where Randy is.

           Hyrum takes out a LIGHTER.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                           (desperate)
                        No.  Hyrum, listen to me.  I've got
                        a brother too.  He's got an upside
                        down penis.

           Hyrum stops.

                                 HYRUM
                        A what?

                                 DENNIS
                        An upside down penis.  He does.  I
                        swear.

                                 HYRUM
                        You mean, like he's a fag?

                                 DENNIS
                        No, not inside out.  Upside down. 
                        Like a birth defect.

           Hyrum looks around, confused.

                                 HYRUM
                        Why are you telling me this, Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        Because we're the same.  We've both
                        got brothers with abnormalities.  

           Hyrum looks at Dennis in disbelief.

                                 HYRUM
                        Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking
                        kidding me?  You're comparing
                        Terry...you think the withered hand
                        is the same as an upside down penis?

                                 DENNIS
                        No.  It's just...they both have
                        medical conditions, so when you were
                        telling that story...I just knew
                        what you're talking about.

                                 HYRUM
                        Terry has a withered hand because he
                        was laying wrong in our mother's
                        womb.  An upside down penis?  That's
                        just bad genes, Dennis.  You've got
                        bad genes.
           He strikes the LIGHTER.

                                 DENNIS
                        Ok.  Ok.  I remember something.  I
                        remember Randy said something about
                        going to the reservoir.  Maybe he's
                        still there?

                                 BO
                        I already went to the reservoir. 
                        There wasn't no sign of Randy.

           He looks at Bo, confused.  Bo just stares back, calmly.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  No.  That's not possible.
                           (turns to girl)
                        It was her!  She killed Randy.  This
                        whole thing is her fault.

           The Little Girl scowls at Dennis.

                                 HYRUM
                        Time's up son.

                                 DENNIS
                        No, please!

           Hyrum goes to light Dennis's hand when his phone RINGS.  He
           looks at it.

                                 HYRUM
                        Chambers.  He got our message.

                                 BO
                        What's he say?

                                 HYRUM
                        He still ain't going to pay.
                           (looks to Little Girl)
                        Your old man's one cheap bastard.

           He walks back to the house.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        Lock them up.

                                 BO
                        Where are you going?

                                 HYRUM
                        To call his bluff.

                                 BO
                        What about him?  I want to find out
                        what he knows about Randy.
                                 HYRUM
                        We've got all night to get it out of
                        him.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum, I'm serious.  You can't go
                        there.  You've got the wrong girl.

           Bo hits him across the face, shutting him up.

           EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE -- EVENING

           Gretchen steps onto the porch, glances around, then knocks.

           No reply.  She knocks again, panic on her face.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Holly.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Bo pulls back a picture frame, revealing a small safe.  He
           looks around to make sure no one is watching.  

           He turns the dial and opens it.  It's empty.

                                 BO
                        Son of a bitch.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, CHILDREN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The room is bare except for a few necessities: a couple of
           beds, a chest of drawers, a small desk and chair.

           Dennis sits on the floor, tied to one of the bed frames. 
           The Little Girl sits on the bed opposite him.  They stare at
           each other in silence.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why'd you say you didn't know me?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You said you weren't going to tell
                        anyone about Randy.

                                 DENNIS
                        He was about to light my hand on
                        fire.  Why didn't you say something?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because we said we weren't going to
                        tell anyone about Randy!

                                 DENNIS
                        He was going to light me on fire!
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't care, Dennis.  I wouldn't
                        have said anything even if he was
                        about to light me on fire.

                                 DENNIS
                        I guess we'll never know, will we?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Yes we will.  I just told you!

           Stalemate.  They stare at each other.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Will you please untie me?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        No.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why not?  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You said you didn't like me.

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, and then you shot me.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You hurt my feelings.

                                 DENNIS
                        I didn't know you had any feelings!

           She turns and faces the wall.  Conversation over.

           Dennis tries to wriggle his way out of the ropes.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Better not do that.  He's coming
                        back any second.

                                 DENNIS
                        Then why don't you just untie me?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Not until you apologize.

                                 DENNIS
                        I ain't going to apologize for
                        something you already shot me about.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Fine.  Then I'm not going to untie
                        you.
                                 DENNIS
                        Fine.

           Dennis struggles violently, desperate to get free.  He's
           beginning to make some headway when the door UNLOCKS.  

           Bo walks in and stares down at him.

                                 BO
                        Who has the book?  

                                 DENNIS
                        What book?

                                 BO
                        The little black leather book Randy
                        stole from Hyrum.  Who'd he try to
                        sell it to?

                                 DENNIS
                        Bo, I have no idea what you're talking
                        about.

                                 BO
                        You think I don't know what's going
                        on?  

                                 DENNIS
                           (nervous)
                        What do you know?

                                 BO
                        I know Randy had that Little Girl
                        this mornng.  And I know his bag was
                        packed, all ready to go.  But he
                        wasn't planning on stealing no ransom. 
                        If Randy was going to steal from
                        Hyrum there's an easier way to do
                        it.

                                 DENNIS
                        How?

                                 BO
                        The book's gone.  Randy stole it and
                        tried to sell it to someone.  And
                        whoever he tried to sell it to killed
                        him for it.  

           Dennis begins to laugh.

                                 DENNIS
                        Man, you are way off.  I mean you
                        are way, way off.

                                 BO
                        I found Randy at the reservoir.
                                 DENNIS
                        Why didn't you tell Hyrum?

                                 BO
                        No more playing dumb.  Randy didn't
                        steal that ransom.  Or else why is
                        the little girl still here?

                                 DENNIS
                        I already told you why she's here.

                                 BO
                        You think you're so damn smart, but
                        I got you all figured out.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, I got you figured out.  How
                        about that?  Mr. Chambers don't owe
                        Hyrum any money.  Hyrum's blackmailing
                        him so he won't tell everyone he's
                        been coming to Hyrum's strip club.  

           A sly smile crosses Bo's lips.

                                 BO
                        Is that what he told you?

                                 DENNIS
                        That's what I figured out.

                                 BO
                        You think anybody's going to care if
                        Frank Chambers went to a strip club? 
                        You think that's worth a hundred
                        thousand dollars?

                                 DENNIS
                        I think Hyrum thinks it is.

                                 BO
                        You got it wrong.  Chambers was one
                        of Hyrum's special customers.  And
                        Hyrum's special customers get a little
                        something extra for their money. 
                        Why don't you ask Holly about it.

                                 DENNIS
                        What are you talking about?

                                 BO
                        A stripper ain't a scandal.  Your
                        wife ain't gonna leave you over a
                        stripper.  But if some of those
                        strippers are whoring it out to you
                        on the side, well, that's something
                        different.  That's something you'd
                        pay to keep quiet.
                                 DENNIS
                        Bullshit.

                                 BO
                        Ask Holly if she think's it's
                        bullshit.  Your girlfriend ain't
                        just a cheap stripper, Dennis.  She's
                        a cheap stripper and an even cheaper
                        whore.  

           Dennis lunges at Bo, but the ropes hold him back.  Bo laughs.

           Dennis struggles, finally getting one hand free, then the
           other.

           He dives at Bo, knocking him into the wall.  

           Bo throws him AGAINST THE DRESSER and onto the floor.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        Look on the bright side.  Maybe you
                        don't have to change all those diapers
                        after all.  Could be you ain't even
                        the daddy.

           Dennis swings wildly and misses.  Bo punches him square in
           the jaw, sending him back to the floor.

           The two men stare at each other, steel-eyed and out of breath. 
           Bo smiles.  

           It's a lost cause.  Dennis scrambles for the door, but Bo
           catches him from behind.  

           He puts his arm around Dennis's throat and lifts him off his
           feet.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        Who killed Randy?

           Dennis flails about, struggling for breath.  

           He kicks and punches behind him.  Useless.  Bo swings him
           around like a ragdoll.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        Who has the book, Dennis?  Who killed
                        my brother?

           Dennis gets his foot against a wall and kicks back with all
           his strength.  

           The two men fall backward into the doorway, onto the floor.  

           But Bo won't release his choke hold.  

           Dennis looks up to see the Little Girl staring down at him.
                                 DENNIS
                           (struggling for air)
                        Help me.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Not...until...you...apologize.

           Bo tightens his hold on Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                           (barely audible)
                        I'm sorry.

           Dennis is about to go.  His eyes begin rolling back.

           The Little Girl grabs the door and SLAMS it as hard as she
           can, catching Bo's head between the door and the door frame.  

           SLAM.  SLAM.  SLAM.  SLAM.  SLAM.

           Dennis wrestles free.  He stands, gasping for air.  

           Silence.

           They look down at Bo.  He lies on the floor, eyes closed, a
           dark puddle forming around his head.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Is he dead?

           The Little Girl leans in over Bo's face.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't know.

           Bo GASPS, his eyes suddenly WIDE.  

           Dennis jumps.  The Little Girl gives the door one final SLAM.  

           Bo lies motionless again.

           The Little Girl looks up and flashes a toothy grin.  

           EXT. HOLLY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Holly gets to her door and finds a note stuck in the crack.

           She reads it: HOLLY, I CAME BY BUT I COULDN'T WAIT. - GRETCHEN

           Holly looks at her watch: 9:28.

                                 HOLLY
                        Damn it.

           She looks around, uncertain of what to do next.
           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Dennis and the Little Girl sneak their way through the house. 
           Somewhere a phone begins to RING.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Are you mad at Holly?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't want to talk about it.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because of what Bo said?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't want to talk about it!

           They pass a large room where SIXTEEN CHILDREN in conservative
           polygamist attire sit watching a black and white TV with no
           sound.  

           The phone RINGS and RINGS, but nobody seems to notice.  They
           just stare at the silent TV.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        What's wrong with them?

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           They get outside.  Dennis hobbles back to the road as best
           he can without his crutches.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Where are you going?

                                 DENNIS
                        I gotta find Terry.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I already know where he is.

           Dennis stops.

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, BACKYARD -- NIGHT

           The Little Girl leads Dennis to a small run-down cabin.

                                 DENNIS
                        You sure he's in there?
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I saw him through the window.

           Dennis grabs a stick, hits it against his palm, testing it.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        What are you going to say?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  We just gotta be quiet.

           Dennis knocks.  Terry opens, a cigarette in his mouth.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Hey, Terry.  I need your book.

           Terry is shocked to see him.  He looks at the stick in
           Dennis's hand, panics.

                                 TERRY
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

                                 DENNIS
                        Shut up.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                           (covering her ears)
                        He's not being quiet, Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Shut up, Terry.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Do something.

           Dennis punches Terry, sending him sprawling back onto the
           floor.

           INT. TERRY'S CABIN -- NIGHT

           A one-room shack.  There's a bed, a desk and a stove, but
           not much else.

           Terry sits on the bed, staring silently at the floor.  Dennis
           stands over him, still clutching his stick. 

                                 DENNIS
                        Where's your book, Terry?
                           (waits for reply)
                        Your little black book.  Where is
                        it?  Bo said it's not in the safe.  

           Terry just stares at the ground.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Look, I'm sorry I hit you, man.  But
                        I really need that book.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Tell me where the book is, Terry!

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        This isn't working.

                                 DENNIS
                        How do you know?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Because he's not saying anything. 
                        You need to make him talk.

                                 DENNIS
                        That's what I'm trying to do.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        No, you're just yelling at him.

                                 DENNIS
                        What am I supposed to do?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                           (pause)
                        Light his hand on fire.

           That gets Terry's attention.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It worked when Hyrum did it to you.

                                 DENNIS
                        Are you crazy?  I'm not lighting his
                        hand on fire.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Then he's not going to say anything!

           Dennis thinks it over.

                                 DENNIS
                        You mean...his withered hand?
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        No, I don't mean his withered hand,
                        Dennis!  His withered is already
                        messed up.  Nobody cares about his
                        withered hand.  

                                 DENNIS
                        But he's only got one good hand.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        That's the whole point, Dennis.

           Dennis is sick at the thought of it.

           INT. TERRY'S CABIN -- LATER

           Terry is tied to a chair.  He looks nervous but keeps silent. 
           Dennis nervously pours gas onto Terry's good hand.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        There.  Now ask him.

                                 DENNIS
                        I'm not sure this is a good idea--

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Just ask him, Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where's your book?

           Terry shakes his head.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        See, I told you this wasn't going to
                        work.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Ask him again.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where's your book, Terry?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Ask him like you mean it.

                                 DENNIS
                        Where's your book, Terry?  I need to
                        find it.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Do you want to get back Holly or
                        not?
                                 DENNIS
                           (yelling)
                        Where's the book, Terry!  I swear I
                        will light your goddamn hand on fire
                        if you don't give me that book!

           Terry is scared but doesn't say a word.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        It's no use.

           The Little Girl shakes her head.  She puts all her weight
           into Terry, knocking his chair on its side.  She grabs the
           can and pours gas all over Terry's head.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        What the hell are you doing!?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Lighting Terry's head on fire.  What
                        does it look like?

           Terry squirms, true fear in his eyes now.

                                 DENNIS
                        You can't do that.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Watch me.

           She grabs the matches and pulls one out.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        Where's the book, Terry?

                                 TERRY
                        I don't know.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Terry, where's the book?

                                 TERRY
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about.

           She lights the match.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Put that out.  What is wrong with
                        you?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Last chance, Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        No.  Please.
           She holds the match with two fingers, ready to drop it.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Goodbye, Terry.

                                 TERRY
                           (screaming, in tears)
                        It's in the bed!  Under the mattress. 
                        Please don't light my head on fire.

           Dennis pulls the mattress up and finds the BLACK LEATHER
           BOOK.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Got it.

           She blows out her match.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Was that so hard, Terry?

           Dennis unties Terry.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        What do we do now?

                                 DENNIS
                        I've got to get this to Mr. Chambers. 
                        I need to find a car.

           Terry sits on the bed, rattled, his hair a wet mess.  He
           pulls out another cigarette from his pocket and puts it in
           his mouth.  

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Um...Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        I can't believe I actually did it.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis!

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

           He looks at Terry who, hands shaking, is pulling out a match
           for his cigarette. 

                                 TERRY
                        Don't tell Hyrum I smoke.

                                 DENNIS
                        No, Terry--

           WHOOSH!  Terry's head and good hand are ENGULFED IN FLAMES.
                                 TERRY
                        AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

           He races around, limbs flailing madly.

           Dennis scours the room for something to put out the fire. 
           He rips the blanket from the bed and TACKLES Terry.  

           When the last of the flames are smothered, Dennis stands.

           Terry lies motionless beneath a heap of bedding.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You think he's ok?

           Dennis shoots her a look that says, 'OBVIOUSLY NOT!'

           A faint WHIMPER comes from inside the heap.

                                 LITTLE GIRL (CONT'D)
                        He's fine.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

           Dennis and the Little Girl walk in silence, Hyrum's house
           shrinking in the distance.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I don't think you should be mad at
                        Holly.

                                 DENNIS
                        I'm not mad at Holly I'm mad at you.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Why are you mad at me?

                                 DENNIS
                        You lit that man's head on fire.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        He lit his own head on fire.

           Before Dennis can argue, a pair of HEADLIGHTS appear.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Shit.

           They stand there, trapped in the beams.  The car stops and a
           SHADOWY FIGURE emerges.
                                 HOLLY
                        Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly? 

           She steps into the light.

                                 HOLLY
                        What is she doing here?  I thought
                        you took her home.

           He's less apologetic now, more cool toward her.

                                 DENNIS
                        It's a long story.  What are you
                        doing here?

                                 HOLLY
                        Trying to find Gretchen.  I've been
                        calling the house, but nobody's
                        answering.

                                 DENNIS
                        She ain't there.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- NIGHT

           Driving.  The Little Girl in the back seat.  Holly looks at
           the book in Dennis's hands.

                                 HOLLY
                        What's that?

                                 DENNIS
                        A hundred thousand dollars.

                                 HOLLY
                        Looks like a book to me.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, nobody asked you, did they?

                                 HOLLY
                        What the hell crawled up your ass?

                                 DENNIS
                        Nothing.

           He opens the book and begins thumbing through the pages.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        No.  No, no, no.  NO!

           Holly slams on the brakes.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- NIGHT

           Dennis climbs out of the car, flipping through the pages. 
           Holly gets out after him.

                                 DENNIS
                        NO!  NO!  NO!

                                 HOLLY
                        What is wrong with you?

           He spikes the book on the ground and pulls his hair.

                                 DENNIS
                        Shiiiiiit!

                                 HOLLY
                        Dennis!

           Randy's familiar RING TONE comes from inside the car. 

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Is that Toby Keith?

           The Little Girl steps out, phone in hand.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It's Hyrum.

                                 HOLLY
                        She had a phone this whole time?

           Dennis snatches the phone and answers it.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hello!

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        You got the wrong girl, shithead.

                                 DENNIS
                        I told you I got the wrong girl!

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Do you have any idea how uncomfortable
                        it is trying to ransom back someone
                        who's asleep in the next room?

                                 DENNIS
                        Actually, I do.  Why did you say
                        that Terry was your accountant?

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Because he is my accountant.  

           Dennis scoops up the book.
                                 DENNIS
                        Oh, really?  Because I'm looking at
                        his accounting book, and there's
                        nothing in here but a bunch of
                        stickers and mazes.

           The book does in fact contain stickers and hand-drawn mazes.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Why do you have Terry's book, Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        What kind of idiot can't get through
                        a fucking maze?

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        You watch your lip!  It's probably a
                        very difficult maze.

                                 DENNIS
                        He drew it himself!  

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Alright, Dennis.  So my brother is a
                        little slow and yours has to sit
                        down to piss so he doesn't spray
                        himself in the face.  Leave it.

                                 DENNIS
                        Why do you pretend he's your
                        accountant?

                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        Because it makes him feel better
                        about himself.  He's got self-esteem
                        issues.  Why do you have his book?

           Dennis is on the verge of tears.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Where's Terry?  Dennis?  Where's my
                        brother?

           SIRENS in the distance, then FLASHING LIGHTS.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Is that the police?

           Dennis turns toward the sound.

                                 HYRUM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Is that the police, Dennis?

                                 DENNIS
                        No.  It's an ambulance.
                                 HYRUM (O.S.)
                        What do you mean ambulance?  Why is
                        there an ambulance?

           In a fit of rage, Dennis hurls the phone into the darkness.

                                 DENNIS
                        Ahhhhhhhhh!

           He marches back to the car, slamming the door as he gets in.

                                 HOLLY
                        What the hell's going on?

                                 DENNIS
                        Oh nothing.  Why do you ask?

           INT. THE OASIS -- NIGHT

           The place is closed for the night.  The door UNLOCKS and
           Holly enters, followed by Dennis and the Little Girl.

                                 HOLLY
                        Gretchen?

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, we shouldn't be here.

                                 HOLLY
                        I told you I've got to find Gretchen.

                                 DENNIS
                        She's not here.  And we shouldn't be
                        either.  

                                 HOLLY
                        Fine, then go.

                                 DENNIS
                        You've got to come with me.  It's
                        not safe anymore.

                                 HOLLY
                        Why?  Because you stole Terry's
                        coloring book?

                                 DENNIS
                        It's not a coloring...just trust me
                        Holly, we've got to leave town.

                                 HOLLY
                        Not until I make sure Gretchen's
                        alright.

           She goes to the back, leaving Dennis and the Little Girl.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is this a bar?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah, it's a bar.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Why does Holly dance at a bar?

                                 DENNIS
                        Because it's a dancing bar.

           A SHRILL SCREAM.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Holly!

           He runs toward the sound.

           INT. THE OASIS, OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Dennis and the Little Girl find Holly staring at the ground,
           both hands covering her mouth.

                                 DENNIS
                        What's wrong?

           Gretchen lies on the floor.  Her head bashed in.  Blood
           everywhere.

           Dennis pulls Holly toward him, shielding her eyes.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        What happened?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.

           Dennis goes to examine the body.  Stiff and lifeless.

                                 HOLLY
                        He killed her.  That son-of-a-bitch
                        killed her.

                                 DENNIS
                        Who?

                                 HOLLY
                        Hyrum.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum?  Why would he do that?

                                 HOLLY
                        She was fooling around with Randy.
                                 DENNIS
                        Really?

                                 HOLLY
                        They were fixin' to run away together. 
                        She was worried Hyrum was going to
                        find out.

                                 DENNIS
                        You think he would have killed her?

                                 HOLLY
                        Who else would have done it?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  Mr. Chambers said
                        next time someone went missing it
                        would be someone Hyrum cared about.

                                 HOLLY
                        She ain't missing, Dennis.  She's
                        dead.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- NIGHT

           They drive in silence.  The Little Girl sits in back, her
           eyes heavy.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        Yeah, sugar.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        When I grow up I want to be a dancer
                        too.

           Holly doesn't answer.

           EXT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Dennis and Holly walk to the door.  Dennis carries the Little
           Girl who is now fast asleep, her arms around his neck.

                                 HOLLY
                        You think she'll be ok?

                                 DENNIS
                        I think so.  Until morning at least.  

           He tries the door.  Locked.  He knocks.

                                 HOLLY
                        Kathlene's gonna be thrilled to see
                        me.
                                 DENNIS
                        No, it's fine.  She'll be fine.

           Kathlene opens the door in her nightgown and curlers.  

                                 KATHLENE
                        Where's my car!?

                                 DENNIS
                        Hey, Mom.

                                 HOLLY
                        Hi, Kathlene.

           She notices the Little Girl.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Where'd you get a kid?

           INT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Holly sits on the couch watching the Little Girl sleep. 
           Dennis enters with two steaming mugs.

                                 DENNIS
                        Is she out?

                                 HOLLY
                        She's a million miles away.

           He hands her one of the mugs.

                                 DENNIS
                        It's hot chocolate.  Sorry.  My mom
                        doesn't drink coffee.

                                 HOLLY
                        I know.  It's ok.

           They sip in silence.

                                 DENNIS
                        Still going to your parents?

                                 HOLLY
                        I think so.  What about you?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  Wherever the bus takes
                        me I guess.

                                 HOLLY
                        I'll drop you off at the stop.

           Silence.
                                 DENNIS
                        I know Hyrum's blackmailing some of
                        his clients.

                                 HOLLY
                        Is he?  I didn't know.

                                 DENNIS
                        Bo told me why.

           Holly just watches the Little Girl.

                                 HOLLY
                        Don't believe everything Bo tells
                        you.  Bo don't know his ass from his
                        overalls.

           She strokes the Little Girl's hair.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Sure she's gonna be alright?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah.  Isaac's gonna call the police. 
                        Tell them he found her.

                                 HOLLY
                        I'll get the car started.

           INT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Kathlene sits at the table sipping from her own mug.  Dennis
           hovers awkwardly in the doorway.

                                 DENNIS
                        We're going now.  Sorry again about
                        the car.

                                 KATHLENE
                        What the hell kind of trouble you
                        got yourself into, son?

                                 DENNIS
                        It's nothing.  I'll see you soon.  I
                        promise.

                                 KATHLENE
                        Say goodbye to your brother before
                        you go.

                                 DENNIS
                        I really gotta get going, Mom.

                                 KATHLENE
                        You say goodbye to your brother!
                           (pause)
                        It may be the last time you see him.
                                 DENNIS
                        Will you stop saying that.  Isaac's
                        gonna be fine.

                                 KATHLENE
                        It ain't your brother I'm worried
                        about.

           INT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE, DENNIS AND ISAAC'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           It looks like the room of two teenagers.  There's a bunk bed
           and a desk.  Banners and posters cover the walls.

           Isaac sits listening to headphones.  He pulls them off as
           Dennis enters.

                                 DENNIS
                        We're leaving now.

                                 ISAAC
                        Oh.  Ok.

                                 DENNIS
                        Thanks for watching the girl.  Just
                        give us an hour head start before
                        you call, alright?

                                 ISAAC
                        Ok.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, thanks.

           Dennis turns to leave.

                                 ISAAC
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

           Isaac holds out a jar of money, mostly coins and singles.

                                 ISAAC
                        I wanted you to take this.

                                 DENNIS
                        That's your savings, Isaac.

                                 ISAAC
                        I wanted you to have it.  I figure I
                        won't need it much anyway, once I'm
                        in Afghanistan.

                                 DENNIS
                        Oh, Isaac...you're not going to
                        Afghanistan.
                                 ISAAC
                        Well, first of all, yes I am.  But
                        second of all, even if I wasn't, I'd
                        still want you to have it.

                                 DENNIS
                        Thank you.

           Dennis reaches out, but Isaac pulls it back.

                                 ISAAC
                        You just got to admit that you took
                        that fruit roll.  

                                 DENNIS
                        Are you serious?

                                 ISAAC
                        I won't be mad.  I just want you to
                        admit it was you.

                                 DENNIS
                        I didn't eat your fruit roll, Isaac. 
                        I don't even like fruit rolls.

                                 ISAAC
                        Well, now I know you're lying, because
                        everybody likes fruit rolls.

                                 DENNIS
                        You know what.  Fine.  I ate your
                        fruit roll.  I feel real bad about
                        it.

                                 ISAAC
                        Thank you for admitting that.  Please
                        just ask next time.

           Isaac hands over the jar but pulls out a dollar.

                                 ISAAC (CONT'D)
                        For the fruit roll you owe me.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- MORNING

           Dawn on the horizon.  Holly and Dennis drive in silence.

           She pulls over to a battered overhanging bus stop.

           They sit there, neither sure what to say.

                                 DENNIS
                        You gonna be alright?

                                 HOLLY
                        I'll be fine.
           Silence.

                                 DENNIS
                        I'm sorry about everything, Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        Me too.

           He goes in to kiss her, but she turns away.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        I gotta get going.

                                 DENNIS
                        Take care of the baby.

                                 HOLLY
                        I will.

           Holly's phone RINGS.  She answers.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Hello.  Yeah, he's here.

           She hands the phone to Dennis.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        It's your brother.

                                 DENNIS
                           (into phone)
                        It's only been twenty minutes, Isaac.

                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        He took her, Dennis.  

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

           EXT. KATHLENE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Isaac is panicked.  

                                 ISAAC
                        Some big guy.  He had a gun.  He
                        just came in and took the girl.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Dennis looks at Holly.

                                 DENNIS
                        Bo got the girl.

                                 HOLLY
                        Shit.
                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        He said he was gonna kill her unless
                        you come.  I didn't know what to do.

                                 DENNIS
                        It's ok, Isaac.  You did good.  I'll
                        take care of it.  

                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 ISAAC (O.S.)
                        Did you tell him about my penis?

                                 DENNIS
                        What?  No, of course not.

                                 ISAAC
                        Well, he knew about it somehow.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hmmm.  That's really weird.  Listen
                        I got to go, Isaac.

           He hangs up.

                                 HOLLY
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.

                                 HOLLY
                        You can't go back there, Dennis. 
                        He'll kill you this time.

                                 DENNIS
                        He's gonna kill her if I don't.

           She shakes her head, sadly.

                                 HOLLY
                        He's gonna kill her anyway.  I'm
                        serious, Dennis.  You can't go back
                        there.  

                                 DENNIS
                        I have to.

                                 HOLLY
                        Fine.  I'm going with you.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, you can't.
                                 HOLLY
                        Don't tell me what I can and can't
                        do, Dennis--

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, the baby.  You can't go back
                        there with the baby.

           Silence.

                                 HOLLY
                        He's gonna kill you, Dennis.  

                                 DENNIS
                        I'll be ok.  You just take care of
                        that kid is all.

           EXT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- MORNING

           Dennis knocks on the door.  No answer.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dennis pushes the door open.  It's dark, quiet inside.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hello.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, PARLOR -- MORNING

           Dennis enters to find the family gathered around the body of
           Gretchen.  She's laid out on a table. 

           Becky, TWO WIVES we haven't seen, and all sixteen children
           have their heads bowed as Hyrum offers a quiet supplication. 
           He finishes, and there's a solemn round of amens.  

           Hyrum sees Dennis.  Becky herds the family out of the room. 
           As they leave Dennis sees the Little Girl sitting there. 

                                 DENNIS
                        You ok?

           She doesn't answer.

                                 HYRUM
                        Where's my book?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.

                                 HYRUM
                        That's too bad for you.
           INT. BARN -- MORNING

           Hyrum slides the door open and lets Dennis and the Little
           Girl inside.

                                 DENNIS
                        It's gonna be ok.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You left me.

                                 DENNIS
                        I was trying to keep you safe.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Wow, great job, Dennis.

           Hyrum pulls out a gun and begins loading it.

                                 HYRUM
                        Did Frank Chambers kill Gretchen?

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly thinks you did it.

                                 HYRUM
                        Why the hell would I kill my own
                        wife?

           Dennis eyes him, not sure if he's telling the truth.

                                 DENNIS
                        Let the girl go.  

                                 HYRUM
                        Nope.  

                                 DENNIS
                        She's just a kid.

                                 HYRUM
                        That's on you.  Matter of fact this
                        whole thing's on you.  

           A truck RUMBLES to a stop outside.  Hyrum looks out.

                                 BO (O.S.)
                        The doctor wasn't happy about me
                        taking him.

                                 HYRUM
                        We'll have him back in a minute. 
                        He's got something to do first.

           Bo leads in Terry.  His head and arm are covered in thick
           bandages.
                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum.  That was just a big huge
                        accident is all that was--

                                 HYRUM
                           (seething)
                        You shut your damn mouth!  You already
                        spoke your last word.   

           He sets his gun down on a work bench next to Terry.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        Despite His infinite goodness, there
                        are some sins even our Lord and Savior
                        Jesus Christ cannot redeem a man
                        from.  Some sins so abominable they
                        put the sinner out of salvation's
                        reach.  In these such cases it becomes
                        necessary to spill the sinner's blood
                        as an act of charity.  It allows the
                        sinner to pay for his wrongdoings,
                        bringing him back within the redeeming
                        circle, so that he is not caught up
                        in that eternal torment.
                           (pause)
                        I was going to do the honors myself,
                        but then I figured it's Terry that
                        has the real claim to it.
                           (to Terry)
                        You ready, brother?

           Terry lets out a hideous, unintelligible affirmation.

           He reaches for the gun, lifting it a few inches before it
           slips between his hands landing back on the bench.

           He tries again.  Same result.  Between his withered hand a
           his bandaged one, he can't get a grip.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                        There you go.  Just grip it
                        there...just... 

           Another failed attempt.  Terry begins sobbing.

                                 HYRUM (CONT'D)
                           (comforting him)
                        That's alright now.  You got nothing
                        to be ashamed of, you hear me?   

           Hyrum picks up the gun and turns to Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum, I swear to you, Terry lit
                        himself on fire.  We were just trying
                        to scare him.
           Hyrum walks closer.  

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Most of this isn't even my fault. 
                        Hyrum, please.  

           Dennis cowers to his knees.  Hyrum places the gun against
           his forehead.

           The Little Girl tenses.

                                 DENNIS (CONT'D)
                        Chambers didn't kill Gretchen.

                                 HYRUM
                        How do you know?

                                 DENNIS
                        Because he hired me to steal your
                        book.  I thought Terry had it. 
                        Chambers isn't gonna kill someone
                        over something he thought he was
                        already getting.

           Hyrum thinks it over.

                                 HYRUM
                        Then who did?  

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  She was in some kind
                        of trouble.

           That gets Bo's attention.

                                 HYRUM
                        What kind of trouble?

                                 DENNIS
                        She was fooling around with Randy.

                                 BO
                        You shut your damn mouth about my
                        brother.

                                 DENNIS
                        It's true.  They were planning to
                        leave together.  I saw his suitcase.

                                 BO
                        You lying son-of-a--

                                 HYRUM
                        Let him talk.
                                 DENNIS
                        Randy's dead.  It was an accident. 
                        His body's up at the reservoir.  

                                 HYRUM
                        Bo didn't find nothing at the
                        reservoir.

                                 DENNIS
                        Yes he did.

                                 BO
                        I didn't find shit.

                                 DENNIS
                        He thought Randy was trying to double-
                        cross you.  He didn't want you to
                        know about it.

                                 BO
                        Boy, I've had enough of your lying.

           Bo lifts his rifle, but Hyrum pushes it down.

                                 HYRUM
                        Who killed Gretchen?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't know.  Maybe Bo did.

                                 BO
                        Why the hell would I kill Gretchen?

                                 HOLLY (O.S.)
                        Because she was the one who took
                        that book.

           Holly stands in the doorway.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        She thought they could use it to
                        start over.  But when Randy didn't
                        show up she got scared.  
                           (to Bo)
                        She went to you for help.
                           (noticing Terry)
                        What the hell happened to Terry?

           Bo is caught off guard.

                                 BO
                        I hated her and she knew it.  I was
                        the one that tried to break them up. 
                        Why would she come to me?

                                 HOLLY
                        Because she was pregnant.
                                 HYRUM
                        Gretchen couldn't get pregnant.

                                 HOLLY
                        You mean you couldn't get her pregnant
                        with your old man sperm.
                           (to Bo)
                        Gretchen came to you for help because
                        she couldn't find Randy, and she was
                        scared shitless.  She thought you
                        would help because that was your
                        family she was carrying inside her.  

                                 BO
                        Bullshit.  You're just trying to
                        save your own ass.

                                 DENNIS
                        See if he has the book.

           Hyrum looks at Bo.

                                 BO
                        How long have we known each other? 
                        I'm telling you, they're lying.

                                 HYRUM
                        Maybe.  But I have to be sure.

           Hyrum takes a step forward.  Bo clutches his rifle.  

           He reaches in his coat and pulls out the MISSING BOOK.  It's 
           identical to Terry's.

                                 BO
                        I was gonna put it back first chance
                        I got.

           Hyrum looks back, a vacant look in his eye.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        She was a no good whore, Hyrum.  She
                        seduced my brother and ran around
                        behind your back.  She deserved what
                        she got.

           Hyrum's expression doesn't change.

                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        She was gonna sell this and use the
                        money to run off with that bastard
                        child in her stomach!

           Rage, madness washes over Hyrum's face.  

           Both men raise their guns and SHOOT.  Bo falls back but gets
           off one SHOT.  Hyrum FIRES REPEATEDLY. 
           Bo falls to the ground, a gushing HOLE in his cheek.

           Hyrum clutches his arm.  When he pulls his hand away it's
           covered in blood.

           The BOOK lies on the ground next to Bo.  The Little Girl
           eyes it.

                                 HYRUM
                        Get the hell out of my sight.

           Dennis tries to pull Holly away, but she doesn't budge.  

                                 HOLLY
                        Bo may have killed Gretchen, but
                        it's your fault she's dead.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly, let's go.

                                 HYRUM
                        What did you say to me?

                                 HOLLY
                        I said it's your fault she's dead.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly.

                                 HOLLY
                        She was scared to death every day of
                        her life.  She was a good girl and
                        you fucked her up.  Randy was nice
                        to her.  He made her happy.  She
                        deserved to be happy.  
                           (pause)
                        She sure as hell deserved better
                        than a sick-in-the-head polygamist
                        son-of-a-bitch like you.

           Hyrum PUNCHES her in the stomach.  She drops, curling into a
           ball on the ground.  

           Dennis is at her side in an instant.

                                 DENNIS
                        Holly!  Are you ok?

           Hyrum bends down and points his gun at Holly.  Dennis covers
           her with his body.

                                 HYRUM
                        You think you can talk to me like
                        that?  If Bo didn't kill her I would
                        have.  Dirty whore.  
                                 DENNIS
                        Hyrum, no.

                                 HYRUM
                        And you're no better than she was. 
                        You got your own bastard kid inside
                        you.  You even sure whose kid that
                        is?  Huh?  Answer me! 

           He pushes the gun into her stomach.

           CLICK.  Hyrum turns and sees the Little Girl pointing a gun
           at his head.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        If you think you're the first asshole
                        I've shot today, think again.

                                 HYRUM
                        Who the hell is that?

                                 DENNIS
                        We're not really sure.

           Hyrum kneels there with a gun to his head, his own gun pointed
           at Holly.  A moment of decision.

           The Little Girl stares down at him, unflinching, terrifying.

                                 HYRUM
                        Hell with it.

           Hyrum stands, picks up the BOOK and helps Terry outside.

           Dennis looks Holly over, she isn't moving.

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY -- DAY

           Dennis paces.  The Little Girl sits on the floor with her
           back against the wall.

           DOCTOR ANDERSON comes out.  

                                 DOCTOR ANDERSON
                        We're cautiously optimistic.  So far
                        everything looks normal.

           Dennis slackens, a weight relieved.

                                 DOCTOR ANDERSON (CONT'D)
                        We're watching them closely, but the
                        baby doesn't seem to have suffered
                        any major trauma.

                                 DENNIS
                        What about Holly?
                                 DOCTOR ANDERSON
                        She'll be ok.  She just needs rest. 
                        I gave her a sedative to help her
                        sleep.  They're both very lucky.

                                 DENNIS
                        Thank you.

           Dr. Anderson continues down the hall.  

           Dennis looks in at Holly sleeping peacefully in bed.

           INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Holly stirs as Dennis sits beside her.  She opens her eyes.

                                 DENNIS
                        You came back.

                                 HOLLY
                           (groggy)
                        Must have been out of my damn mind.

           He looks at the monitors and wires connected to her.

                                 DENNIS
                        I wouldn't care who's baby it is.  I
                        would love it no matter what.

                                 HOLLY
                        It's your baby, dumbass.
                           (pause)
                        I did it once.  What Bo said.  But
                        that was a long time ago.

                                 DENNIS
                        Well, even if it wasn't.

           Her eyelids droop.

                                 HOLLY
                        They got me all drugged up.

                                 DENNIS
                        I know.

                                 HOLLY
                        Gotta sleep.

                                 DENNIS
                        I know.

           EXT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY -- DAY

           Dennis sits on the floor next to the Little Girl.
                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Is Holly going to be ok?

                                 DENNIS
                        Yeah.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Good.

           He looks at her.

                                 DENNIS
                        You really do have something wrong
                        with your chemicals don't you?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Yeah.

                                 DENNIS
                        I'm sorry.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        It's ok.  It doesn't hurt or anything.

           He closes his eyes and leans his head back.

           INT. HYRUM'S HOUSE, OFFICE -- DAY

           Hyrum sits at his desk bandaging his wound.  The little black
           book lies in front of him.  He opens it.  

           Clean, neat columns of numbers and names.  Pages and pages
           of them.  

           He gets to a page that's been ripped out.  A look of horror
           crosses his face.

           INT. HOSPITAL, HALLWAY -- DAY

           The Little Girl looks at Dennis.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        I have something to show you.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        First you have to let me tell you my
                        real name.
                                 DENNIS
                        What's your name?

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        You can't be mad when I tell you.

                                 DENNIS
                        Fine.  What is it?

           She stares him in the eyes.  Dead serious.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Margot Chambers.

                                 DENNIS
                           (confused, terrified)
                        What?

           She smiles.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Just kidding.  It's Penny.

                                 DENNIS
                           (out of fight)
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

           Still smiling, she hands him a torn out page from Hyrum's
           book.  At the top is written: FRANK CHAMBERS.

           Dennis looks a her.  She smiles.

           EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY

           The Lincoln Town Car waits on the side of the road.  Holly's
           car pulls up behind it, and Dennis and Penny get out. 

           They walk to the Lincoln.  Mr. Chambers and Cody step out. 
           Cody has the briefcase in his hand.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        What'd you bring a little girl for?

                                 DENNIS
                        Don't ask. 

           He pulls the paper out and hands it over.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        What's this?

                                 DENNIS
                        Your page from Hyrum's book.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        Where's the rest of it?
                                 DENNIS
                        That's all I could get.  It's the
                        only part about you.

           Mr. Chambers unfolds the note and looks it over.  

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        You have a lighter?

                                 DENNIS
                        I don't smoke.

           Penny holds up Terry's matches, smiling.  Mr. Chambers looks
           at Dennis, confused.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS
                        What the hell's she have matches
                        for?

                                 DENNIS
                           (exhausted)
                        You don't want to know.

           Mr. Chambers takes the matches, sets fire to the paper,
           watches as it slowly burns.

           Then he turns and walks back to the Lincoln.  Cody hands
           Dennis the briefcase and follows after his father-in-law. 

           Dennis opens the case.  The cash is inside.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (O.S.)
                        Dennis.

           Dennis looks up.  Mr. Chambers is climbing into the car.

                                 MR. CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
                        I see you again I'll kill you.

           Cody starts the car and the Lincoln speeds off.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- DAY

           Dennis drives.  Penny sits shotgun, her arms clutching the
           briefcase.  

                                 PENNY
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS
                        What?

                                 PENNY
                        We're best friends now, aren't we?

           He looks at her, then looks ahead again.  He smiles for the
           first time.
           She smiles too.

                                 PENNY (CONT'D)
                        I told you.

           EXT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

           Holly is pushed out in a wheelchair by a NURSE.  Dennis stands
           next to her car, waiting.

                                 DENNIS
                        How are you feeling?

                                 HOLLY
                        Still got to pee every five minutes. 
                        But I guess that's a good thing,
                        considering.

           She stands up and walks over.  He hands her the briefcase.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        What's this?

           He shrugs.  She opens it, sees the money inside.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Where'd you get this?  

           He shrugs again, then kisses her.  She lets him, laughing.

           INT./EXT. HOLLY'S CAR -- DAY

           They get inside.

                                 HOLLY
                        Where should we go?

                                 DENNIS
                        Any old place you want.

           They look at each other, sharing a moment.

                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        I think we should get food.  

           Holly looks back and sees Penny.

                                 HOLLY
                        You didn't take her home?

                                 DENNIS
                        She won't tell me where she lives.

                                 HOLLY
                        You've got to take charge, Dennis.
                        You're the adult in the situation.  
                                 PENNY
                        I don't want to go home.  I want to
                        go with you and Dennis and baby
                        Jessica.

                                 HOLLY
                           (to Dennis)
                        Who's baby Jessica?

                                 DENNIS
                           (whispering)
                        I told you.  She's crazy.

                                 HOLLY
                        Don't blame her, Dennis.  She's got
                        the Stockholms.  You kidnapped her. 
                        It's your responsibility to make
                        sure she gets home.

                                 DENNIS
                        It ain't that simple.

                                 HOLLY
                           (truing back)
                        Princess, we got to take you home
                        now.  Your parents are gonna be
                        worried sick--

           Penny is pointing the gun at her.  Holly sits forward.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Why does she have my gun, Dennis?

           Dennis locks eyes with Penny in the rear-view mirror.

                                 DENNIS
                        I'm not supposed to say.

                                 HOLLY
                        What do you mean you're not supposed
                        to say?  
                           (remembering)
                        And why was Terry all bandaged up
                        like that?

           Dennis doesn't answer.  Holly looks out her window, giving
           up.

                                 HOLLY (CONT'D)
                        Words cannot express the wonderful
                        time we had at that God-damned junior
                        prom.

           EXT. HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           The car pulls out onto the highway.
                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        Dennis?

                                 DENNIS (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        Where are we going?

                                 DENNIS (O.S.)
                        I don't know.

                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        Dennis.

                                 DENNIS (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 PENNY (O.S.)
                        Can we get some burgers on the way
                        there?

                                 DENNIS (O.S.)
                        Fine.

           The car continues down the lonely desert highway.
