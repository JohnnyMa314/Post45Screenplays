           FADE IN:

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA GREYHOUND BUS TERMINAL - MORNING

           Drab architecture houses this under-utilized and generally 
           forgotten mode of transportation.  A wall of windows 
           separates the dingy lobby and ticket offices from the 
           sheltered lot where the buses load passengers and luggage. 

           TERRY FULLER (40s) stands off to the side in his Greyhound 
           driver’s uniform.  Salt and pepper stubble veils a face that 
           is searching for the path of least resistance.  He is strong, 
           but his mid-section carries a paunch from his inactive 
           profession.  His forearms are spotted with prison tattoos.

           Terry lights a cigarette to go with his morning coffee.

           He watches a small crowd of passengers hand their tickets to 
           the ticket agent and board his bus.

           He focuses on SHAMIS (19), a pretty black girl with a natural 
           scowl.  She wears a red shirt and carries only a large purse.

           Terry walks to a nearby pay phone.  Dials.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - LATER

           All the passengers are on board, but the bus is half-empty.

           Terry GROANS himself into the driver’s seat.  STARTS the 
           engine.  Picks up the PA mic to make the announcements.

                                 TERRY
                             (monotone routine)
                        Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
                        Today we’ll be traveling to 
                        Charleston, West Virginia with 
                        stops along the way in Harrisburg, 
                        Cumberland, Morgantown, and 
                        Clarksburg.  If we don’t hit too 
                        much traffic we should arrive in 
                        Charleston at the scheduled time of 
                        9:20 pm.  There’s a bathroom at the 
                        rear of the coach for your 
                        convenience.  I ask you to be 
                        respectful of your fellow 
                        passengers, so if you’re listening 
                        to music please use headphones, and 
                        if you’re going to talk on your 
                        cell phone, please do so at a 
                        reasonable volume.  I’ll be putting 
                        in a movie in a few hours...
                             (looks down)
                                 TERRY(cont'd)
                        ...”Driven” starring Sylvester 
                        Stallone, so anyone that’s looking 
                        to see “Driven,” I’ll have that on 
                        for you in a few.  If you have any 
                        questions, my name is Terry.  Thank 
                        you for choosing Greyhound, sit 
                        back and enjoy the ride.

           EXT. “THE BADLANDS” - NORTH PHILADELPHIA - DAY

           One of the most blatant open-air drug markets on the East 
           Coast.  The streets are filled with hard-fiendin’ addicts and 
           hard-hustlin’ dope slingers.

           A few blocks from the infamous 3rd & Indiana corner, we find 
           ourselves at the corner of Indiana & Leithgow.

           Sitting on a stoop is “CINCH” (20), the corner boss.  He’s 
           good-looking and ghetto fabulous; brand new Phillies cap, 
           baggy tee-shirt, crisp jeans, and immaculate kicks.

           Cinch THROWS GAME at any passing girl, every once in a while 
           sharing a laugh with RIFF (19), his muscular #2.

           A grimy ADDICT approaches Cinch, palming wrinkled money.

           Cinch nods to his right, directing the Addict’s attention to 
           Cinch’s BANK (15) about ten yards away.

           Bank stands by a wall of plywood attached to a chain link 
           fence surrounding an empty lot.  Whoever planned to build 
           something here has long since abandoned the idea.

           The Addict approaches Bank and slips him the money.

           Bank KNOCKS on the plywood three distinct times.

           The Addict moves down the block to a hole in the plywood.

           Cinch’s WAREHOUSE (14) dispenses three vials of crack to the 
           Addict from inside the empty lot.  Deal done.

           The Addict scurries down the block, excited for his score.
           Along the way he passes-

           -JASPER (10), Cinch’s lookout.  The innocence and exuberance 
           of Jasper’s youth are at war with the hardships of his life.
           He wears worn clothes and sits against the wall, doing his 
           math homework in a Mead notebook.

           Jasper finishes SCRIBBLING an answer.  He looks up at a small 
           stand-alone vanity mirror that he’s set up to reflect far 
           down Indiana Ave.-

           -and sees a BLACK SUV creeping up the block.
           Jasper’s focus ZOOMS IN on the SUV: City plates...extra 
           antennae...mounted lights on the front windshield...trouble!

           Jasper lets off two short WHISTLES, and then KICKS OVER a 
           nearby garbage can.

           The garbage can CRASHING sets off a swift chain reaction.

           Cinch’s Bank retrieves a Ziploc bag filled with filthy money 
           from his pocket and TOSSES it over the plywood wall.

           BEHIND THE PLYWOOD, the bag lands next to Warehouse.  He 
           grabs it and stuffs it into a backpack filled with vials.

           THE BLACK SUV flips on its lights and SIRENS, BURNING RUBBER 
           towards the corner.

           BEHIND THE PLYWOOD, Warehouse hops on a BMX bike and pedals 
           furiously across the empty lot towards a makeshift ramp.

           He hits the ramp at full speed and-

           -LAUNCHES over opposite wall, almost killing a pedestrian as 
           he LANDS on the sidewalk.

           Warehouse pedals down the block, disappearing along the 
           railroad tracks with the stash and the cash.

           BACK ON THE CORNER: The SUV SCREECHES to a halt, and a 
           Philadelphia PD task force jumps out, guns drawn.

           One cop rushes to the plywood wall, pulls himself up to see-

           -that Warehouse is long gone.

           The remainder of the task force has their weapons trained on 
           Cinch, Griff, and Bank.

                                 TASK FORCE COMMANDER
                        On the ground, all of you!  Hands 
                        on your head, dirtbags!

           Cinch, Griff, and Bank all lay down on the ground, putting 
           their hands behind their head.

           Jasper watches this unfold from his lookout position.

           The Task Force begins cuffing Cinch’s crew.

                                 CINCH
                        Is there a problem, officer?

           The Commander roughly yanks Cinch’s arms behind his back.
                                 TASK FORCE COMMANDER
                        Yeah, there’s a problem, you’re 
                        peddling crack in my community.

                                 CINCH
                        Oh this is your community, too?
                        That’s funny, I ain’t never seen 
                        you around, where you live?

           The Commander is momentarily thrown by this question.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                             (inciting smile)
                        Seriously, man, where you live?

           The Commander looks to his men, who have been searching the 
           area for evidence.  They come up shaking their heads.

                                 TASK FORCE COMMANDER
                        Where’s your shit?

                                 CINCH
                        Up in my ass, man, I could probably 
                        get it to you in a couple hours if 
                        you got some coffee.

           One of the other cops finds a pistol concealed behind a 
           cement block on the stoop.  He holds it up by the trigger 
           guard for his Commander, who smiles. 

                                 TASK FORCE COMMANDER
                        We got you now, son.

                                 CINCH
                        You ain’t got shit except a couple 
                        niggas standin’ on the corner and a 
                        harassment case when you can’t 
                        connect that gun to me.

           The cops pull Cinch and the others to their feet and begin 
           marching them towards the SUV.

                                 TASK FORCE COMMANDER
                        We’ll see about that.

                                 CINCH
                        Yeah, we’ll see.

           Before Cinch gets loaded into the SUV he looks down the block 
           to Jasper, who awaits further instructions.

           All Cinch gives him is a sly smile and a wink.

           The police convoy departs, leaving Jasper all alone.
           He places the vanity mirror in his bookbag along with his 
           school books and walks away.

           EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HIGHWAY - DAY

           The Greyhound bus CHUGS ALONG on the hilly highway.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Half of the passengers are asleep.  Some are listening to 
           music or reading.  Some are even watching “Driven.”

           Terry looks like an “automatic driving machine,” as though 
           every function in his brain besides driving is turned off.

           Terry snaps out of it when he sees-

           -POLICE LIGHTS flashing in his side-view mirror.

           Terry picks up the PA mic.

                                 TERRY
                        Sorry for the interruption, ladies 
                        and gentlemen, but it looks like 
                        we’re being pulled over by the 
                        Pennsylvania State Police.  The 
                        troopers run random stops on public 
                        transportation, but if everyone 
                        cooperates we’ll be back on the 
                        road in no time.  They’ll be asking 
                        everyone to get off the bus while 
                        they run a routine search.  Again, 
                        I apologize for the inconvenience.

           MURMURS throughout the bus as Terry takes the next exit and 
           pulls the bus into a gas station parking lot.

           Terry OPENS the door, and the passengers slowly disembark.

           Terry stays in his seat until the bus is empty.  Pause.

           Two STATE TROOPERS board the bus.  They nod to Terry, and 
           then proceed to the back of the bus, taking a look around.

           They are followed ROPINSKI (40s), a hefty Sergeant with a 
           golf ball-sized wad of chewing tobacco in his lip.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Afternoon, Terry.

           Ropinski looks around.  Knowing the deal, Terry holds up a 
           tiny plastic-lined waste basket.  Ropinski SPITS into it.
                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        So what do you got for us?

                                 TERRY
                        Red shirt.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        You sure?

           Terry answers that with “a look.”

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                             (CHUCKLES)
                        Well, okay then. 

           Ropinski slips Terry a sealed envelope.

           Terry opens it, retrieving two $100 bills.

                                 TERRY
                        You really don’t need to put it in 
                        an envelope.

           Terry pockets the cash, throws out the envelope.

           EXT. GAS STATION PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           All of the passengers stand in a staggered line, waiting to 
           see what happens.

           The troopers get off the bus, followed by Terry.  Terry steps 
           off to the side and lights a cigarette.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        All right ladies and gentlemen, we 
                        apologize for the hold-up.  My men 
                        and I just have to take a look 
                        through some of your personal 
                        belongings.  If you’re unwilling to 
                        let us search your belongings then 
                        we’ll have to get a warrant, but 
                        that will take a long time and I 
                        don’t think any of you want to wait 
                        that out on the side of the 
                        highway.  There’s nothing to worry 
                        about if you’ve done nothing wrong.
                             (pause)
                        Let’s begin.

           Ropinski’s two officers walk down the line and randomly pick 
           two people to search.

           Ropinski lags behind, trying to seem casual before he ends up 
           standing in front of Shamis.
                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        What’s your name, Love?

                                 SHAMIS
                             (snarling)
                        Fuck you!

           Ropinski recoils with both genuine surprise and amusement.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        That’s quite a name!  I’m sorry, 
                        Ms. You, but I think I’m going to 
                        have to take a look at that bag.

           Shamis clutches her oversized purse, glaring through silence.

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        Are you saying you want me to call 
                        the station and order a warrant?  I 
                        can do that if you’d like.

           Shamis feels the angry stares coming from the rest of the 
           passengers, none of whom want a 3-6 hour delay.

                                 SHAMIS
                        Whatever.

           She shoves the bag into Ropinski’s hands.

           Ropinski rifles through the purse.  Make-up, cell phone, 
           wallet, Skittles...and a teddy bear.

           Ropinski holds up the teddy bear.

                                 SHAMIS (cont’d)
                        That’s my son’s.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Your son’s teddy bear feels a 
                        little bulky, Ms. You.

           Ropinski RIPS the head off of the bear and pulls out-

           -a tightly wrapped package of cocaine.  Smirks.

           WE FIND: Terry smoking his cigarette.  He watches this go 
           down, seemingly indifferent to it all.

                                 ROPINSKI (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        So, do you think this is my lucky 
                        day or your unlucky day?
           INT. JASPER’S HOME - EVENING

           A medium-sized apartment mostly filled with nothing.  The 
           kitchen has an old table with two rickety chairs.  The 
           cupboards are all open (and pretty much bare), and the 
           counters are littered with dirty dishes and food wrappers.

           The living room consists of a ratty couch in front of an old 
           32” TV set that only gets the basic channels.

           On the couch is DESIREE (29), Jasper’s mom.  At one time her 
           face could have been called elegant, but the weight of her 
           circumstances now causes it to sag.  She wears a Sbarro’s
           uniform that could use a washing, adding to the aura that 
           Desiree is just beginning to lose the fight for her own life.

           Jasper enters.  Desiree forces a convincing smile.

                                 DESIREE
                        Hey baby.  How was school?

                                 JASPER
                        Good.  How was work?

           She pulls him into a hug on the couch.

                                 DESIREE
                        Ahhhh, I don’t want to talk about 
                        work.  Work is boooooring.

           She GIGGLES and tickles him.  He playfully wrestles free.

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                        You got homework to do?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, I did it already.

                                 DESIREE
                        You weren’t around all those sirens 
                        I heard before?

                                 JASPER
                        Ain’t no thing.  Couple of Jakes
                        flexin’ on Cinch, it’s cool.

                                 DESIREE
                        Boy, I want you to be careful.

                                 JASPER
                        Yes, mama.

           She gives him a kiss on the forehead and stands up.
                                 DESIREE
                        Okay, well I’m gonna get out of 
                        these clothes, maybe take a bath.
                        Stay here and watch your cartoons.

           She’s halfway into her bedroom when she remembers:

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                        You hungry, Jasper?

                                 JASPER
                        A little.

                                 DESIREE
                        We got cereal in the cupboard.
                             (pause)
                        I’ll go shopping tomorrow, baby.

           She CLOSES her door.

           Jasper gets up and pours himself a big bowl of Cap’n Crunch.

           He moves to the refrigerator: no milk.

           He walks back to the couch and sits.  He opens up an X-Men 
           comic and reads it while eating handfuls of cereal.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/OVERNIGHT LOT - NIGHT

           A gated parking lot that houses the Greyhound buses when 
           they’re not in use.

           Terry gets off of his bus with a small plastic garbage bag.

           He locks the door and tosses the garbage in a dumpster.

           INT. A J ENTERTAINMENT - NIGHT

           A strip club that is called a “titty bar” far more often than 
           it is called a “gentlemen’s club.”

           Terry walks in, nodding to the bouncer.

           He approaches the cashier and pulls out a $100 bill.

                                 TERRY
                        Lemme get a pack of Winstons and 
                        the rest in ones.

           The cashier starts the transaction.

           Terry notices CHARLENE (26), an A-minus stripper amongst a 
           herd of C-pluses.
                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Hey Charlene.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Hey honey, how you doin’?

                                 TERRY
                        Won’t complain.  You?

                                 CHARLENE
                        I’m okay.  I’m going on next, so...

                                 TERRY
                        I’ll see you up there.

           She winks at him and saunters off.

           INT. JASPER’S HOME - NIGHT

           Jasper is still on the couch.  The bowl of cereal is empty, 
           and he’s moved on to his second X-Men comic.

           Desiree emerges from her bedroom, now dressed in casual 
           clothes that highlight her breasts.

           Although her appearance may seem more “put together,” Desiree 
           moves with a subtle combination of the sways and the 
           twitches.  Upon closer inspection, we see that her eyes are 
           glazed over, wandering vacantly from one nothing to another.

           Desiree is high as a kite.

           Jasper looks up, concerned but not surprised.

           Desiree walks into the kitchen, opens a few drawers and 
           cabinets, staring into each of them with no clear purpose.

                                 JASPER
                        Mom, you all right?

                                 DESIREE
                        Hmm?  Oh, I’m fine, baby.

                                 JASPER
                        Come watch TV with me.

                                 DESIREE
                        I’d love to, Jazzy, but I’m going 
                        out to grab a bite with Marie.

           Jasper tenses up.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t want you seein’ Eddie.
                                 DESIREE
                        Boy, I just said that I was goin’
                        to see Marie!

                                 JASPER
                        I know, I just...
                             (pause)
                        ...don’t want you seein’ him.

           She SHUFFLES over to him and kisses the top of his head.

                                 DESIREE
                        I’ll be fine, baby.  Lock the door 
                        after me, and don’t wait up.

           Desiree shoots him a glassy-eyed smile, and then exits.

           Jasper locks the door behind her.

           INT. A J ENTERTAINMENT - NIGHT

           Terry sits at the edge of the stage, watching the dancers.

           The song ends, and Terry puts a few ones on the stage.

           Charlene sashays up to Terry from behind, draping her arms 
           over his shoulders.

                                 CHARLENE
                        You looking for a dance, sugar?

           Terry thinks about that, his hand subconsciously rubbing that 
           other $100 bill that’s burning a hole in his pocket.

                                 CHARLENE (cont’d)
                        I’ll give you two songs for the 
                        price of one.  Hell, I got twice 
                        what any of these other girls are 
                        offering, so you get four times 
                        your money’s worth. 

                                 TERRY
                        Can’t argue with those numbers.

           She smiles flirtatiously, traces her fingers across his face.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        I...got an early morning, how about 
                        I take a rain check?
                             (she pouts)
                        I’ll be back, I promise.

           She leans in close to his ear, whispers:
                                 CHARLENE
                        Make it sooner, not later.

           She gently tugs on his earlobe with her teeth, making the 
           hair stand up on the back of his neck.

           Charlene walks off.  Always leave them wanting more.

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Terry puts a fifth of Wild Turkey on the counter.  The 
           cashier rings him up.

                                 TERRY
                        Lemme get one of those scratch 
                        tickets, too.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 - MOMENTS LATER

           The shoddy motel sits a half block from the bus terminal.

           Terry walks up with his paper bag full of treats.

           INT. MOTEL 6 ROOM - LATER

           Terry sits on the bed, scratching the scratch ticket.  The 
           fifth of Wild Turkey sits half empty on the bedside table.

           Terry squints to see if he won anything, and then tosses the 
           scratch ticket on the floor.

           He drains the rest of the Wild Turkey, grits his teeth as the 
           burn subsides.  Pause. 

           He looks at one of those small tubes of complimentary generic 
           hand lotion on the bedside table.  Picks it up.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jasper sleeps entangled in his blankets.  NOISE.

           Jasper opens his eyes and listens to the sounds of Desiree 
           coming home and CLUNKING around the apartment.

           Jasper’s eyes move to his alarm clock - 3:47 am.

           Jasper shuts his eyes.
           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

           Establishing shot of Jasper’s inner-city elementary school.
           Despite attempts to brighten the exterior with student-made 
           decorations, the building looks like a prison.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The clock reads 2:49 pm.

           Jasper sits in a full class of riled up kids anxious to get 
           the hell out of there.  Jasper keeps his eyes on his work, 
           trying to pay attention to the lesson.

           The TEACHER (50s) has written several multiplication problems 
           on the chalkboard.

                                 TEACHER
                        So with double-digit multiplication 
                        problems you have to go one digit 
                        at a time.  First you take...

           The clock switches to 2:50 pm, and the bell RINGS.

           Kids immediately jump up, moving like it’s a jail break.

                                 TEACHER (cont’d)
                        Remain seated, please!
                             (no one listens)
                        SIT DOWN!  EVERYONE SIT DOWN NOW!

           The kids reluctantly move back to their desks.

           The Teacher picks up a stack of tests from her desk and 
           begins handing them out.

                                 TEACHER (cont’d)
                        Your homework for the weekend is 
                        problems 1-50 in chapter four.
                             (GROANS)
                        Do the work, and if you can’t come 
                        up with an answer then we’ll go 
                        over it on Monday.

           The Teacher places Jasper’s test on his desk.

           THE TEST: 96% Good work!!

           Jasper discreetly stuffs the test into his backpack.
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper walks out into the chaos that it 800+ kids CHARGING 
           away from school into the weekend.

           Jasper’s FRIEND (10) catches up to him.

                                 FRIEND
                        What’s up, kid?

                                 JASPER
                        Ain’t nothin’, what’s up with you?

                                 FRIEND
                        Me and the crew are gonna go sneak 
                        into a double feature at the Pearl.
                        You in?

                                 JASPER
                        I got work.

                                 FRIEND
                        You still on Cinch’s corner?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.

                                 FRIEND
                        Aiight, then.
                                       Holla at me later.

                                 JASPER
                        Mos def.

           EXT. CINCH’S CORNER - AFTERNOON

           Cinch, Riff, and Cinch’s Bank are all back at their normal 
           positions.  Business as usual.

           Jasper walks up and plants himself at his post, setting up 
           the vanity mirror to reflect down Indiana Ave.  He retrieves 
           another X-Men comic from his bag to pass the time.

           Cinch notices Jasper, walks over.

                                 CINCH
                        Ey-yo!  What’s good, Jasper?

                                 JASPER
                        Ain’t nothin’.  You make bail?

                                 CINCH
                        Pssh, no need, they can’t hold me 
                        on some trumped up bullshit charge.
           Cinch pulls out a wad of twenties from his pocket.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                             (one twenty)
                        Paycheck for yesterday.
                             (another)
                        For today.
                             (another)
                        And a little bonus for the nice 
                        spot on that undercover.

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks, Cinch.

                                 CINCH
                        You earned it, little man.

           Cinch looks at Jasper’s set up with the mirror.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        I don’t know how you do it.

                                 JASPER
                        Do what?

                                 CINCH
                        I always see you over here doin’
                        your homework or readin’ comics or 
                        some such, but you ain’t never 
                        missed a spot.

                                 JASPER
                                            Cuz’ I don’t 
                        Is that a problem?
                        have to.

                                 CINCH
                        Nah nah, ain’t a problem, it’s 
                        just...impressive, ya know?

           Cinch gives Jasper a big brother-ish rub on the head.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        You got promise, son.  If you ever 
                        lookin’ to make some extra scratch, 
                        then you let me know. 

           Jasper nods.  Cinch gives him a pound before-

           -returning to his stoop where he finds Riff getting off his 
           cell phone.

                                 RIFF
                        Yo, Shamis got knocked.

                                 CINCH
                        Say what?
                                 RIFF
                        The boy Dante called, said the 
                        package never made it.  Touched 
                        base with Shamis’ people, they said 
                        she’s locked up in lady state.

                                 CINCH
                        Fuuuuuuuuck.  Those Kentucky boys 
                        must be heated, huh?

                                 RIFF
                        They ain’t pleased, but they 
                        understanding of the situation.

           Cinch nods, deep in thought.

                                 RIFF (cont’d)
                        So what do we do next?

                                 CINCH
                        Find another shorty to ride the 
                        bus.  Shouldn’t be hard.

           INT. TERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Pitch black.  Key JINGLING, a deadbolt TURNING.

           The front door OPENS, giving way to Terry’s silhouette.  He 
           FLIPS ON the lights revealing-

           -a small, low-quality one-bedroom apartment.  Terry has a 
           very simple set-up: couch, coffee table, TV, liquor cabinet.
           The apartment is surprisingly neat.

           The only mess comes from the many scattered ashtrays, all of 
           which look like onions sprouting cigarette butts.

           Terry hangs up his jacket.  He starts unbuttoning his 
           Greyhound uniform when he notices something.

           He walks across the room to get a better look at-

           -a fish tank on the liquor cabinet.  A single goldfish floats 
           at the top of the tank.

           Terry stares at the dead fish.

           INT. TERRY’S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON: Toilet.  PLOP!  The dead fish drops in the tank.

           After a brief pause, a stream of urine follows the dead fish.

           So much for sentimentality.  FLUSH.
           Terry turns on the shower, strips off his shirt.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT

           Jasper enters the building and starts to climb the stairs to 
           his home when he hears:

                                 DESIREE (O.S.)
                        This is bullshit, Manny!

                                 MANNY (O.S.)
                        You told me Monday, it’s Friday!

           Jasper slows his climb, listening in.

                                 DESIREE (O.S.)
                        You know I’ll get it to you!

                                 MANNY (O.S.)
                        I’m not hearing that anymore!

                                 DESIREE (O.S.)
                        So what am I supposed to do!?

           Jasper reaches his floor to see his mother arguing with MANNY 
           (40s), the building superintendent.  It is not pretty.

                                 MANNY
                        YOU PAY ME!  That’s what you’re 
                        supposed to do!  Come Tuesday 
                        you’re either settling up with me 
                        or you’re...

           Simultaneously they both notice Jasper standing at the top of 
           the stairs, watching with a hang-dog expression.

           Desiree retreats to the apartment, SLAMMING the door.

           Manny walks towards the stairs.  As he passes Jasper:

                                 MANNY (cont’d)
                        Sorry, kid.

           INT. JASPER’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper walks in to find Desiree sitting on the couch with her 
           head in her hands.  He approaches with caution.

                                 JASPER
                        Mom?  What’s going on?
                             (no answer)
                        Are we getting evicted?

           Desiree looks up, but not at him.  Nods.
                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        How?  I mean, why?

                                 DESIREE
                        Cuz’ we owe rent.

           Jasper notices what Desiree is wearing.

                                 JASPER
                        Where are your work clothes?
                             (no answer)
                        Don’t you always work Fridays?
                             (no answer)
                        Mama, why ain’t you wearing your-?

                                 DESIREE
                             (finally looks at him)
                        CUZ’ I AIN’T BEEN GOIN’, BOY, GOD 
                        DAMN WITH ALL THESE QUESTIONS!!

           Heavy pause as Desiree’s outburst soaks in.

           Desiree averts her eyes, unwilling to look at her son.

           Jasper sits down on the couch next to her.  He produces the 
           sixty dollars that Cinch gave him from his pocket.

           He holds it out for her.

           Desiree sees the money and her face softens.

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                        Oh Jasper...

           She pulls him in for a hug, holding back tears.

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                        You’re the sweetest boy in the 
                        whole world, but we need a lot more 
                        than that, baby.

           Wrapped in each other’s arms, both mother and son rack their 
           brains for ideas.

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                             (thinking out loud)
                        It’ll be okay.  Worst to worst I 
                        can always call Eddie and... 

           Jasper wriggles free, incensed.

                                 JASPER
                        NO!
                                 DESIREE
                        I know you don’t like him, but 
                        Eddie’s helped me through a lot of 
                        hard times.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t give a fuck!

                                 DESIREE
                        JASPER!

                                 JASPER
                             (too riled up to stop)
                        Eddie don’t give a shit about me, 
                        he just wants to own you, and I 
                        don’t wanna go to fuckin’ Florida!

                                 DESIREE
                        Well, I ain’t got no one else!!!

           A brief stare down between two angry faces.

           Jasper realizes that Desiree is not willing to search beyond 
           the easy options, so he-

           -stands up, crosses to the door.

                                 DESIREE (cont’d)
                        Where’re you goin’!?

                                 JASPER
                        I got an idea.  Just don’t call 
                        Eddie.

           And Jasper’s out the door before Desiree can respond.

           INT. CINCH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A decent apartment filled with top-of-the-line furniture and 
           electronics.  Hip hop PLAYS on the Bose stereo system.

           Cinch and Riff sit on a leather couch.  Riff finishes rolling 
           a blunt, lights it, and passes it to Cinch.

                                 CINCH
                        What about Nikki from 115th?

                                 RIFF
                        I don’t know if Nikki’s down for 
                        the cause, knom’ sayin’?

                                 CINCH
                        True.  She’s stupid, too
                             (PUFFS)
                        What about your girl?
                                 RIFF
                        She caught me out with Janelle last 
                        week, been wildin’ ever since.

                                 CINCH
                             (amused)
                        Yeah, can’t trust that.

                                 RIFF
                        What about your girl?

           Cinch just looks at Riff.  Riff recognizes his mistake.

                                 RIFF (cont’d)
                        Right, right.  My B.

           KNOCKING.  Cinch and Riff exchange a concerned look.

           Riff gets up to answer the door.

           Cinch digs into the couch cushions and pulls out a handgun.

           Riff looks through the peephole.

           PEEPHOLE: Empty hallway.

                                 RIFF (cont’d)
                        No one’s there.

           More KNOCKING.

                                 CINCH
                        Fuck is that, then?

                                 RIFF
                             (calling out)
                        Yo, who’s there!?

                                 JASPER (O.S.)
                        Jasper.

                                 RIFF
                        It’s little man from the look.

                                 CINCH
                        Oh shit, let ‘im in.

           Cinch stuffs the gun back in the couch as Riff opens the door 
           to let Jasper in.

                                 RIFF
                        Sorry young’n, I couldn’t see you 
                        through the slot.

                                 CINCH
                        Take a seat.
           Jasper joins Cinch on the couch.  Riff remains standing.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        You need anything?  Soda?  I think 
                        we got some lo mein ‘round here.

                                 JASPER
                        No, I’m good.

                                 CINCH
                        So what’s your troubles then?

                                 JASPER
                        I’m lookin’ to make some more 
                        money.  Like you said today.

                                 CINCH
                        Aiight.  You thinkin’ you want some 
                        more hours on the corner?

                                 JASPER
                        I...dunno.  I kinda was hopin’ for 
                        something bigger, ya know?

           Cinch holds his eyes on Jasper, then smiles.

           He looks up to Riff, who is thinking the same thing.

           Cinch CHUCKLES, rubs Jasper on the head.

                                 CINCH
                        My man.  How you feel about goin’
                        out of state?

           INT. JASPER’S HOME - NIGHT

           Jasper BURSTS through the door, excited.

                                 JASPER
                        Mom!  Hey Mom!?

           He searches the apartment.  Desiree is not there.

           Jasper plops down on the couch.  Turns on the TV.  Waits.

           EXT. CITY BUS STOP - NIGHT

           An empty bus shelter in a modest neighborhood.  Not upper 
           class, but certainly more quiet and quaint than the Badlands.

           A bus WHEEZES to a stop at the bus shelter.

           Several passengers get off.  We follow-
           -ANGELA FULLER (late-60s), a tad run-down with a wardrobe 
           from the 2002 Sears’ catalogue.  Despite the frump, she has a 
           clear sense of working class dignity, exuding strength and a 
           little bit of charm.  She carries a fold-up lawn chair under 
           one arm, and has a purse looped around the other.

           We don’t know it now, but this is Terry’s mother.

           Angela waddles down the block to:

           EXT. IVY HILL CEMETERY - CONTINUOUS

           A security guard sits in a booth next to the gate.  He sees 
           Angela approaching.  She smiles as he gets up.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Evening, Angela.

                                 ANGELA
                        Hiya Freddy.

           He UNLOCKS the gate for her.  They have an understanding.

                                 ANGELA (cont’d)
                        Thanks a million.

           Angela continues up into the cemetery, walking a very 
           familiar path.  Eventually she ends up at-

           -a grave marker, flush to the ground.  It reads:

                                     LAWRENCE FULLER
                                 Beloved Husband & Father.

           Angela sets up the chair next to her husband’s grave.  She 
           reaches into her purse and retrieves-

           -a fifth of Jameson and two plastic cups.

           She pours two fingers into one cup, placing it on top of the 
           grave marker, and another two fingers for herself.

           Angela leans back in the chair.  Sips.

           Enjoys a quiet nightcap with her dead husband.

           WE PAN AWAY from Angela, drifting through the tombstones, 
           past the fence, until we reach-

           -the sidewalk.  Hidden in the shadows we find Terry leaning 
           against a tree.  He is smoking a cigarette with a clear view 
           of his mother.

           It is as close to the ritual as he will allow himself to get.
           Terry pulls a flask from his pocket.  Takes a sip.

           INT. JASPER’S HOME - EARLY MORNING

           Jasper has fallen asleep on the couch waiting for Desiree.

           KNOCKING at the door wakes him up.  Jasper wipes the sleep 
           from his eyes and answers the door to reveal Cinch.

                                 CINCH
                        Rise n’ shine, baby.  You ready?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah, gimme one sec.

           Jasper grabs his Mead notebook from his bookbag and TEARS out 
           a sheet of paper.  He quickly SCRIBBLES a note.

           NOTE:  Mom, I’m getting the money for us.  Will be back soon.
           I love you.  Jasper.

           INT. CINCH’S LEXUS - MORNING

           Cinch drives.  Jasper sits shotgun.

                                 CINCH

                                Philly to Charleston, that’s 
                        So you got two tickets, both round 
                        trip.
                        West Virginia.  Then Charleston to 
                        Lexington, that’s Kentucky.  My boy 
                        Dante’ll have someone pick you up 
                        in Lexington, bring you by the spot 
                        to make the trade.  You with me?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.

                                 CINCH
                        You like X-Men, right?

                                 JASPER
                        Uh-huh.

                                 CINCH
                        Check the back seat.

           Jasper turns around and grabs a brand new X-Men backpack 
           sitting in the back seat.  He pulls it onto his lap.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        The last bus to Lexington leaves 
                        Charleston at 9:30, and sometimes 
                        the bus from Philly comes in after 
                        that.
                                 CINCH(cont'd)
                        If you miss the bus to Lexington 
                        you got two bills in the top 
                        pocket.  Grab some take-out and 
                        rent a room at the Motel 6, catch 
                        the first bus out in the morning.

           Jasper checks the top pocket: two hundred dollars.

                                 JASPER
                        What about my backpack?

                                 CINCH
                        I’ll hold that for you until you 
                        get back.

           Jasper nods and begins transferring his school books and 
           personal belongings into the X-Men bag.

           He stops to pull a teddy bear, similar to the one that Shamis 
           was carrying, out of the X-Men bag.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s this?

                                 CINCH
                        That’s the package, son.

                                 JASPER
                        Oh.

                                 CINCH
                        I put something else down the 
                        bottom.  For emergencies.

           Jasper looks down into the X-Men bag.  We don’t see what 
           Cinch is talking about, only Jasper’s blank face nod.

           Cinch pulls the car over to the side of the street.

           He turns to Jasper, like a heart-to-heart.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Now, don’t talk to no one ‘less you 
                        have to.  Anybody asks why you’re 
                        all by yourself, tell ‘em your moms 
                        is sick, so she bought you a ticket 
                        to go stay with your uncle.  If 
                        they press you, just clam up and 
                        say “I don’t want to talk about my 
                        moms.”  Think you can do that?

                                 JASPER
                        Uh-huh.

           Cinch grabs a prepaid cell phone from his glove box.
                                 CINCH
                        Got you a burner.  I’m programmed 
                        into the speed dial, so if you got 
                        any questions, just holla.
                             (Jasper nods)
                        You got any questions?

                                 JASPER
                        No.

                                 CINCH
                             (rubs his head)
                        My man.  You gonna do just fine.

           Jasper smiles, starts to get out.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Hey.
                             (Jasper turns)
                        Who’s your favorite X-Man?

                                 JASPER
                        Beast.

                                 CINCH
                        Which one’s he?

                                 JASPER
                        He’s all blue and covered in fur.

                                 CINCH
                        Oh right.  Why you like him?

                                 JASPER
                        Cuz’ he’s smart and tough.

           Cinch CRACKS UP, finding this very funny for some reason.

                                 CINCH
                        Smart and tough, boy, you ahead of 
                        the curve.  See, I was just a 
                        Wolverine when I was your age.
                             (pause)
                        Get on to it, then.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA GREYHOUND TERMINAL - MORNING

           Terry smokes his morning cigarette with his morning coffee.

           In the background, a female ticket agent loads the last 
           passenger onto Terry’s bus.  She walks over to Terry. 

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Morning, Terry.
                                 TERRY
                        Morning.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Wanted to let you know that you got 
                        a little kid traveling alone today.

                                 TERRY
                             (long pause)
                        So?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                             (annoyed at his apathy)
                        So keep an eye on him!  Last thing 
                        we need is some kid disappearing or 
                        getting picked up by a pedophile on 
                        our route.
                             (no reaction from Terry)
                        Just...do me this one favor and 
                        look after him.  I put him in the 
                        front row.

           Terry takes the last drag from his cigarette, stomps it out.

                                 TERRY
                        Okay.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           As usual, the bus is half-empty.

           Jasper sits in the front seat across the aisle from the 
           driver’s seat.  His arm clutches the X-Men backpack, which 
           rests in the open seat next to him.

           Terry shleps onto the bus, notices Jasper.

                                 TERRY
                        Hey buddy.

           Jasper stays silent.  It’s unclear if he is shy or scared.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        What’s your name?

                                 JASPER
                        Jasper.

                                 TERRY
                        Good to know you, Jasper.  My 
                        name’s Terry.

           Again, Jasper stays silent.
                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        How old are you?

                                 JASPER
                        Ten.

                                 TERRY
                        You ever been on a bus before?

                                 JASPER
                        Not a bus like this one.

                                 TERRY
                        Let me see your ticket.

           Jasper retrieves his ticket from the X-Men bag.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Ah, you’re with me all the way to 
                        Charleston.  That’s a long haul.
                             (hands it back)
                        Don’t worry, we’ll have some fun.

           As Jasper puts the ticket back in the bag, Terry catches a 
           glimpse of the teddy bear.

           The sight of the bear gives Terry pause.  Jasper is a kid, 
           and kids have teddy bears, but that teddy bear looks 
           identical to the one that Shamis was using to move weight.

           Terry snaps out of his brief trance, and moves to the 
           driver’s seat.  Sneaks another look back at Jasper.

           Terry STARTS the engine, picks up the PA mic.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Good morning ladies and gentlemen.
                        Today we’ll be traveling to...

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - MORNING

           The bus cruises along the turnpike as the suburbs just 
           outside of Philadelphia pass by on either side.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Terry drives.  Jasper looks out the window, still with an arm 
           around the X-Men bag.

           The bus HITS a big pothole, LURCHES a bit.

           Jasper tightens his grip on the X-men bag.  Looks around.
                                 JASPER
                        Yo Terry, where’s my seatbelt?

                                 TERRY
                        There aren’t any seatbelts.

                                 JASPER
                        Oh.

           Jasper looks out the window again.  Pause.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Where are we?

           Terry checks the highway signs.

                                 TERRY
                        We’re about to pass a little town 
                        called Merlin.  Like the wizard 
                        from Sword in the Stone.

                                 JASPER
                        The what?

                                 TERRY
                        Never mind.

                                 JASPER
                        We pretty far from Philly, huh?

                                 TERRY
                        Not really.  About 30 miles.

                                 JASPER
                        Really?

                                 TERRY
                        Uh-huh.

           Jasper marvels at the vastly different landscape rushing by 
           outside the window.

                                 JASPER
                        Feels like we’re pretty far away.

           INT. HARRISBURG GREYHOUND TERMINAL - MORNING

           Terry’s bus idles in the terminal lot.

           Some passengers get off the bus, grabbing their luggage from 
           the lower compartment.

           A small group of passengers wait to board the bus.

           Terry stands off to the side, smoking a cigarette.
           EXT. HARRISBURG - MORNING

           Terry’s bus pulls onto the 76 freeway leaving Harrisburg.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MORNING

           Terry drives.  He looks back to see that-

           -Jasper has dozed off, using the X-Men bag as a pillow.

           Terry puts his eyes back on the road.  Almost smiles.

           EXT. HIGHWAY REST STOP - DAY

           A seemingly self-sufficient concrete oasis in the middle of 
           nowhere: two competing gas stations, a Roy Rogers fast food 
           restaurant, and a massive Uni-Mart convenient store.

           Terry’s bus turns onto the off-ramp.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Terry picks up the PA mic.

                                 TERRY
                        Good afternoon ladies & gentlemen.

           Terry’s voice rouses Jasper, who has a brief moment of panic 
           before he remembers where he is.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        We’re pulling over for a little 
                        rest stop.  Feel free to get out, 
                        stretch your legs, or get something 
                        to eat or drink.  I’ll be pulling 
                        out in exactly 15 minutes, with or 
                        without you, so keep an eye on the 
                        bus and don’t lose track of time.

           EXT. HIGHWAY REST STOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Terry’s bus comes to a stop outside the Uni-Mart.

           The door OPENS and passengers file out.

           Jasper steps off, wearing the X-men bag.

           He squints at the sunlight and walks to the Uni-Mart, passing-
           -a group of four skater punks (14-15).  They’re the type of 
           kids that think it’s cool to wear baggy clothes and be seen 
           with their boards in front of the Uni-Mart, even though they 
           can barely nosegrind a curb.

           Terry gets off the bus last.  Lights a cigarette.

           INT. UNI-MART - CONTINUOUS

           Overwhelmed, Jasper stands at the entrance to this temple of 
           impulse purchases.  He looks around at all the candy, 
           pastries, soda, chips, and cheap toys.

           He smiles.  “I can get anything I want.”

           Thinking with the nutrition concerns of any 10-year-old kid, 
           Jasper goes straight to the Slushie machine.

           He gets one of those preposterous 64-ounce monster cups and 
           begins filling it with every different flavor of Slushie.

           After he’s completed his concoction, Jasper walks up to the 
           cashier’s counter.

           He gazes through a smudged pane of glass at the greasy grill 
           that heats the hot dogs, taquitos, soggy breakfast 
           sandwiches, and nacho fixin’s.  So...many...choices.

                                 CASHIER
                        Just the Slushie?

                                 JASPER
                             (thinks HARD)
                        Lemme get some nachos, too.  With 
                        the jalapenos on ‘em.

           The cashier grabs a tray and fills it with corn chips.

           He removes the lid from a cauldron of bubbling yellow cheese, 
           and ladles a heaping glop on top of the chips.

           Terry enters the store as the cashier is sprinkling jalapeno 
           peppers on the nachos.

           Terry and Jasper exchange a smile; Terry amused by Jasper’s 
           order and Jasper psyched for his junk food.

           Terry walks to the pastry cabinet and grabs a donut.  Moves 
           to the coffee machine and fills a cup.

           Jasper adds a pack of gum to his order, pays the cashier.

           Scarcely able to hold up both the nachos and the Slushie,
           Jasper shuffles his way out to-
           EXT. UNI-MART - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper continues his junk food juggling act as he moves back 
           towards the bus.

           As he passes the skater punks, the ALPHA-SKATER discreetly 
           rolls his board out so that-

           -Jasper TRIPS on it.

           Jasper HITS the ground, barely able to break his fall.

           His nachos and Slushie HIT the pavement a couple feet in 
           front of him.
                             SPLAT!

           FROM INSIDE THE UNI-MART: Terry sees this go down.

                                 ALPHA-SKATER
                        Nice X-Men pack, fag.

           Jasper springs back up to his feet.

           He turns around and mad-dogs the punks.  Jasper’s stare would 
           probably frighten an adult trying to comprehend the dark 
           places that this 10-year-old is able to take himself-

           -but these skater punks don’t give a fuck.

                                 ALPHA-SKATER (cont’d)
                             (feigning scared)
                        Oooo, he looks tough.

           Jasper holds his glare for a couple seconds-

           -and then retreats to the bus.

           The skater punks LAUGH amongst themselves.

                                 ALPHA-SKATER (cont’d)
                        What a little dink.

           They never see Terry coming out of the Uni-Mart.

           Pretending not to see him, Terry walks into, or more 
           accurately walks through the Alpha-Skater.

           Alpha-Skater TUMBLES forward, sprawling out awkwardly on the 
           pavement.

           The momentum of the collision sends his skateboard ROLLING.

           It stops about halfway between the Uni-Mart and the bus.

           Alpha-Skater jumps back up to his feet.
                                 ALPHA-SKATER (cont’d)
                        Yo, what’s your problem, dick!?

           Terry just stares at Alpha-Skater as he inches towards his 
           snivelly little posse.  They put on their “gangsta faces.”

                                 TERRY
                             (dickhead smile)
                        Hey.  You guys look tough.

           The skaters don’t know what to make of Terry.

           Terry turns and walks about towards the bus.

           He reaches the stray skateboard and-

           -STOMPS DOWN, snapping it in half!

                                 ALPHA-SKATER
                        Fuck!  Come on, man!

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Back in his front row seat, Jasper watches this happen 
           through the window.  He’s loving it.

           Terry enters the bus, catches eye contact with Jasper.

           Brief pause, then Terry holds up his donut.

                                 TERRY
                        You want half?

                                 JASPER
                             (unsure)
                        Can I?

                                 TERRY
                        Sure.

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks.

           Jasper reaches forward, breaks off a piece of the donut.
           It’s more like a fourth than a half.

                                 TERRY
                             (re: the big piece)
                        Take this one.

                                 JASPER
                        But that one’s bigger.

                                 TERRY
                        So?
                                 JASPER
                        So...it’s your donut.  You get the 
                        big piece, right?

                                 TERRY
                        Kid, I’m something of a fat-ass.  I 
                        definitely don’t need the big piece 
                        of the donut.

           Jasper SNICKERS at “fat-ass.”

                                 JASPER
                        Okay.

           They switch pieces.  Terry pops the smaller piece into his 
           mouth, demolishing it with one bite.

           Terry returns to the driver’s seat, STARTS the engine.

           Jasper enjoys his 3/4 of a donut in the front seat.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Terry’s bus exits the 76 freeway, merging onto the 220.

           We have officially entered Western Pennsylvania, which is 
           distinctly different from Eastern Pennsylvania due the 
           noticeable ascension of the Appalachian Mountain range.

           The highways weave up and down hills, in and out of valleys, 
           giving the bus’ passengers plenty of beautiful scenery to 
           gaze upon.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Jasper isn’t looking at the beautiful views, but rather he’s 
           pulled out his math textbook and Mead notebook.

           Terry is in “automatic driving machine” mode.

           Jasper scribbles an answer.  Looks at it again.  Doesn’t seem 
           pleased with it.

                                 JASPER
                        Terry?

           Terry snaps out of it.

                                 TERRY
                        Huh?  Yeah, what do ya need?

                                 JASPER
                        What’s twelve times twelve?
                                 TERRY
                        Hundred forty four.

           Jasper is part shocked, part impressed.

                                 JASPER
                        How’d you know that so fast?

                                 TERRY
                        Well, that’s kind of a cheap one.
                        See, twelve is a dozen, twelve 
                        dozen is a gross, and a gross is 
                        one hundred forty four.

                                 JASPER
                        A gross, like...nasty?

                                 TERRY
                        No, no.  Different meaning of the 
                        same word.  If something IS gross, 
                        then it’s nasty.  If you HAVE a 
                        gross of something, then you got 
                        one hundred forty four of it.

           Jasper thinks about that one for a second.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s the point of that?

                                 TERRY
                        I got no idea, kid.  Good question.

           Jasper looks back down at his notebook.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Got some math homework back there?

                                 JASPER
                        Uh-huh.

                                 TERRY
                        What’re you learning these days?

                                 JASPER
                        Double digit multiplication.  It’s 
                        harder than just, ya know, single 
                        digit stuff.

                                 TERRY
                        Right.
                             (pause)
                        Well, you got any problems 
                        multiplying by ten?
                                 JASPER
                             (checks textbook)
                        Yeah.

                                 TERRY
                        Lay it on me.

                                 JASPER
                        Twenty-three times ten.

                                 TERRY
                        Easy, two hundred thirty.  See, any 
                        number multiplied by ten, you just 
                        add a zero onto that number.

           Jasper writes this down, getting it.

                                 JASPER
                        Oooooooh.

                                 TERRY
                        Same thing works for multiplying by 
                        one hundred, just add two zeros on 
                        to the end of the other number.

                                 JASPER
                        Damn, you gettin’ all triple-digit 
                        on me!?  That shit ain’t until the 
                        next chapter!

                                 TERRY
                        Can’t hurt to be ahead of the 
                        curve, buddy.

           Jasper’s heard that before.

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.  You right.

           Jasper’s eyes wander to the window.  He sees a sign.

                      You Are Now Leaving Pennsylvania.
           SIGN:

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Whoa.  We’re out of Pennsylvania?

                                 TERRY
                        Yep.  Coming up on Cumberland, 
                        Maryland.

                                 JASPER
                        We ain’t gotta go through no border 
                        crossing or whatever?
                                 TERRY
                             (looks back)
                        No.  That’s only when you’re going 
                        between countries.

                                 JASPER
                        Oh.
                             (disappointed)
                        Thought it’d be a bigger deal.

                                 TERRY
                        Sorry to let you down there.

           Terry picks up the PA mic to make an announcement.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Attention ladies and gentlemen, 
                        we’ll be pulling into Cumberland in 
                        just a few minutes...

           INT. CUMBERLAND BUS TERMINAL/FOOD COURT - DAY

           A semi-circle of fast food restaurants surround an open area 
           filled with plastic tables and chairs.

                                 TERRY (V.O.)
                        ...I’ll be taking a 45 minute lunch 
                        break, so you’ll all have time to 
                        stretch your legs or get something 
                        to eat...

           We pick up Jasper paying a cashier for a fast food meal.

                                 TERRY (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        ...The bus will depart at 1:35 pm,
                        so make sure you’re back in your 
                        seat by then.  Again, 1:35 pm.

           Jasper carries his tray towards the tables, looks around.

           The place is pretty full, not a lot of open seats.

           Jasper spots Terry sitting by himself, munching on his own 
           fast food meal.

           Jasper stops, thinks, decides.  He approaches Terry.

                                 JASPER
                        It cool if I sit with you?

           Terry finishes chewing before:

                                 TERRY
                        Sure.
           Jasper puts his tray down and unhooks the X-Men bag, resting 
           it against the chair.

           Jasper sits down and digs in.

           Terry and Jasper eat in silence for a few beats until:

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        So, uh...Jasper.  Let me ask you, 
                        how come you’re traveling all by 
                        yourself?

                                 JASPER
                        My mom’s sick, so she bought me a 
                        ticket to go stay with my uncle.

                                 TERRY
                        I’m sorry to hear that.  What’s 
                        wrong with your mom?

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t want to talk about my mom.

                                 TERRY
                             (pause)
                        Fair enough.

           They go back to eating.

           EXT. CUMBERLAND BUS TERMINAL - DAY

           Jasper & Terry sit on a ledge outside of the terminal.  Terry 
           smokes a cigarette.  Jasper clutches the X-Men bag.

                                 TERRY
                             (just to talk)
                        This town used to be an outpost for 
                        George Washington.

                                 JASPER
                        The President?

                                 TERRY
                        It wasn’t when he was President, it 
                        was when he was in the army.

                                 JASPER
                        You’re pretty smart, huh?

                                 TERRY
                        Not at all.  I’ve just driven this 
                        route many, many times before.

           Pause.
                                 JASPER
                        So you was in jail, huh?

           Terry turns to Jasper, rattled by his candor.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Your arms.

           Terry looks down at his faded prison tattoos: “He’s got me 
           there.”  Takes a drag from his cigarette.

                                 TERRY
                        I was in prison, not jail.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s the difference?

                                 TERRY
                        Jail’s where they hold you.
                        Prison’s where they keep you.

                                 JASPER
                        How long they keep you?

                                 TERRY
                        They kept me for a while.

                                 JASPER
                        What’d they get you for?

           Terry looks at Jasper, who looks right back.  His innocent 
           curiosity forces Terry to look away.

                                 TERRY
                        Trafficking.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s that?

                                 TERRY
                        Moving drugs across the state line.

                                 JASPER
                        Oh.

           Now Jasper looks away while Terry’s puts eyes on him.

           Terry takes a drag, an odd look of satisfaction on his face.

                                 TERRY
                             (instigating)
                        What, you out of questions?

           Jasper looks back towards Terry, but not at his face.  His 
           attention falls onto-
           -A specific tattoo on Terry’s arm.  It’s a stocky little 
           demon with red eyes and a mean sneer.  The demon is sitting 
           on a fiery sun holding a flaming sword.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s that one?

           Terry sees which tattoo Jasper is referring to.

                                 TERRY
                        Ever heard of the Pagans?

                                 JASPER
                        No.

                                 TERRY
                        Never seen a group of dirty 
                        roughnecks on motorcycles riding 
                        around the city?

           Jasper shrugs: “I dunno, maybe.”

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Well, if you had, chances are they 
                        were part of the Pagans Motorcycle 
                        Club.  Pagans pretty much own the 
                        whole area, including Philadelphia.

                                 JASPER
                        So...what’s the tattoo?

                                 TERRY
                             (pronounced: Zoo-tar)
                        That’s Surtr the fire God, he’s the 
                        Pagan center patch.

                                 JASPER
                        Center patch?

                                 TERRY
                        Every member wears this patch on 
                        the back of their vest.  Story goes 
                        that Surtr was at war with the 
                        other Gods, so he squatted down 
                        real low to make them think he was 
                        small and weak. When they got close 
                        he jumped up and bashed their heads 
                        in with his flaming sword.  After 
                        that he took over hell.

                                 JASPER
                             (enthralled)
                        Cool.

                                 TERRY
                        Yeah, I thought so, too.
           Terry rolls down his sleeve.

                                 JASPER
                        So you ain’t with them anymore?

                                 TERRY
                        Nope.

                                 JASPER
                        How come?

                                 TERRY
                        Because I went to prison.

           Terry stubs out his cigarette.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Let’s go.

           EXT. CINCH’S CORNER - EVENING

           The block is BUSTLING.

           Cinch sits on the stoop, texting.  Riff directs customer 
           traffic in the background.

           After taking a payment, Bank directs an addict to the hole in 
           the plywood where Warehouse slips him the product.

           Warehouse KNOCKS twice on the plywood.  Pause.  KNOCKS twice 
           a second time.

           Bank hears this and relays it to Riff.

           Riff approaches Cinch.

                                 RIFF
                        Sold out.

                                 CINCH
                        Serious?
                             (Riff nods)
                        Damn, young’ns be hustlin’ tonight!

                                 RIFF
                        Should we re-up?

                                 CINCH
                        Nah, man, fuck it.  It’s Saturday, 
                        let’s hit the club.

           Cinch hops up and accompanies Riff and Bank over to the wall 
           of plywood.  Riff PULLS BACK a loose board.

           The three of them duck under into-
           EXT. ABANDONED LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Warehouse is packing up his stuff.  Cinch walks up, grabs the 
           backpack.  He examines it, inside and out, checking to make 
           sure there aren’t any vials left over.

           Satisfied that they sold their entire inventory, he tosses 
           the bag back to Warehouse.

                                 CINCH
                        Way to step on that package, boy!

           Cinch gives a few twenty-dollar bills to Warehouse.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Get on wit’ it.

           Warehouse hops on his BMX and rides off.

           Cinch turns to Riff, who is counting out Bank’s money.

           Finished, Riff looks up at Cinch and shakes his head.

           As Riff starts counting again, Cinch puts his eyes on Bank.

           Bank sees this, starts getting nervous.

                                 BANK
                        Yo, what’s the problem?

           Cinch simply continues to eyeball him as Riff counts.

                                 CINCH
                             (finally:)
                        How much?

                                 RIFF
                             (finishes counting)
                        Eighty.

                                 BANK
                        Nah, that can’t be right.  Ain’t no 
                        way, count it again.

                                 CINCH
                        Nigga, he just did count it again.

           Bank shrinks a little.

                                 BANK
                        ...I’m sorry, boss.  Just cut it 
                        out of my pay.
                                 CINCH
                             (heating up)
                        Oh, so now you tellin’ me what to 
                        do?  How to run this thing?

                                 BANK
                        No no, it ain’t like that...

                                 CINCH
                        What’s it like, then?

                                 BANK
                             (floundering)
                        Just...I didn’t mean to...I thought 
                        I was on point with the count...

                                 CINCH
                        But you wasn’t.

                                 BANK
                        Right, so I was sayin’ you could 
                        take the cut outta my pay.  You 
                        know, like last time.

                                 CINCH
                             (sinister)
                        Right.  Like last time.  And that 
                        time last month, too.  And then do 
                        the same thing next time you fuck
                        up.  And the time after that.

           Bank is shitting his pants.  No matter what he says Cinch 
           keeps talking him into a corner.

           After a few seconds looking at the two imposing bosses-

           -Bank turns and RUNS for the fence.

           Cinch and Riff are on him, YANKING him down from the fence.

           Bank tries to YELL for help-

           -but he’s silenced by a BRUTAL PUNCH from Riff!

           Bank HITS the ground, but Riff quickly lifts him up and HURLS 
           him into a nasty pile of garbage.

           Cinch picks up an old garbage can.

           Riff KICKS Bank, keeping him on the ground.

           Cinch takes center stage and begins WAILING on Bank with the 
           garbage can.  Over and over and over again.
           The beat-down is unreasonably excessive.  The fact that it is 
           two grown men attacking a 15-year-old kid only makes it that 
           much more difficult to watch.

           It’s unclear if Cinch has made his point or simply grown 
           tired.  Either way, he tosses the garbage can aside.

           Bank is bloody and unconscious, laying amongst the garbage 
           like a corpse.  Pause.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        How much you think those Jordans go 
                        for?

                                 RIFF
                        I’d say eighty.

                                 CINCH
                        Grab them shits, I got a little 
                        nephew that’ll love ‘em.

           Riff pulls the sneakers off of Bank’s feet.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - EVENING

           The bus is stuck in some oppressive traffic.  Dark clouds 
           gather in the sky.  Looks like rain.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - EVENING

           Terry is bored, but he’s used to it.

           Jasper, meanwhile, is itching for some activity.  He looks 
           around for entertainment, fidgeting in his seat.

           Jasper reaches into his bag, pulls out the prepaid cell phone 
           that Cinch gave him.

           He presses some buttons, exploring the functions, and doesn’t 
           find what he’s looking for.

                                 JASPER
                        Hey Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        Yeah?

                                 JASPER
                        Your cell phone got any games on 
                        it?

                                 TERRY
                        Don’t have a cell phone.
                                 JASPER
                        For real!?

                                 TERRY
                        For real.

           It takes Jasper a second to process this information.

                                 JASPER
                        But...how do you talk to your 
                        peoples?

                                 TERRY
                        I don’t really have “peoples.”

                                 JASPER
                        What about your family then?
                             (Terry is silent)
                        How you call your parents?

                                 TERRY
                        My dad’s dead.  Haven’t spoken to 
                        my mother in years.

                                 JASPER
                        Damn, man.  I’m sorry.
                             (pause)
                        You don’t wanna talk to your moms?

                                 TERRY
                        She don’t wanna talk to me.

           Jasper sits back, thinks.  Then-

                                 JASPER
                        That ain’t true.

                                 TERRY
                        Isn’t your business anyway.

                                 JASPER
                             (doesn’t care)
                        Yeah, but my moms always tells me 
                        that she’ll love me no matter what.
                        That there ain’t no bond like the 
                        one between a mother and her child.

                                 TERRY
                        Thought you didn’t want to talk 
                        about your mom.

                                 JASPER
                        I...
                             (realizes)
                        ...nah...I...I just don’t want to 
                        talk about how my moms is sick.
                                 TERRY
                        Let’s not talk about it then.

           Long pause.  Jasper looks out the window.

                                 JASPER
                        Where are we now?

                                 TERRY
                        We’re in the Appalachian Mountains.

                                 JASPER
                        What do they got up here?

                                 TERRY
                        Hillbillies and moonshine.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s moonshine?

                                 TERRY
                        Forget it. 

           Long pause.

                                 JASPER
                        Can’t believe you don’t got a cell.

           Another long pause.  Terry looks down.

                                 TERRY
                        You want to watch “Driven” again?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, man.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT

           RAIN has begun to fall, and the storm is building its way up 
           to a torrential downpour.

           Terry’s bus pulls up under the shelter next to the small 
           stand-alone terminal.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           Terry is on the PA mic.

                                 TERRY
                        ...the time is 9:47 pm here in 
                        Charleston.  I hope you all enjoyed 
                        the ride, thank you for choosing 
                        Greyhound, and have a nice night.
           Terry puts the bus in park, OPENS the door.

           Passengers file out of the bus.  Jasper remains seated.

           The last of the passengers get off the bus. 

           Terry turns to Jasper.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        So, what’d you think of your first 
                        big bus ride?

                                 JASPER
                        It was aiight.

                                 TERRY
                        It was “aiight,” huh?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, it was cool.

                                 TERRY
                        Good.  Glad you had some fun.

           Jasper nods, stands up.

           Terry holds out his hand.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        It was nice meeting you, Jasper.

           Jasper shakes his hand.

                                 JASPER
                        You too, Terry.

           Jasper descends the stairs.

                                 TERRY
                             (calling after him)
                        Hope your mom feels better soon!

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks!

           Jasper moves out of sight.

           Terry SHUTS the door, puts the bus into gear.

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT

           The terminal is empty except for a CLERK behind the ticket 
           counter.  He is getting ready to close up for the night.
           Jasper runs in, fleeing the rain.

           He walks up to the ticket counter.

                                 CLERK
                        How can I help you?

                                 JASPER
                        I have a ticket to Lexington.

                                 CLERK
                        Last bus to Lexington already left.
                        You can catch the next one tomorrow 
                        morning at 7:30.

                                 JASPER
                        Aiight.  Where’s the Motel 6?

                                 CLERK
                             (re: the exit)
                        Take a right, just down the block.

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks.

           The Clerk nods as Jasper heads for the exit.

           INT. MOTEL 6 LOBBY - NIGHT

           LOIS (40s), a rather large and homely woman, sits behind the 
           front desk watching a small TV.

           Jasper BURSTS IN, shaking the rain off of himself.

                                 LOIS
                        Hey there!  Watch what you’re 
                        doin’, quit makin’ a mess!

                                 JASPER
                             (noticing the puddle)
                        Oh.  I didn’t mean...

                                 LOIS
                        “Didn’t mean to” don’t matter, I 
                        still gotta mop it up.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m sorry, ma’am.  It’s just... 
                        that it’s raining out.

           Lois scowls at Jasper.  This woman is filled with bile.

                                 LOIS
                        What’re you doing here anyway?
                                 JASPER
                        I need to rent a room.

           Lois LAUGHS.  It is a shrill and most unattractive laugh.

                                 LOIS
                        We can’t rent to 8-year-olds.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m ten.

                                 LOIS
                        The cut-off ain’t ten either.  You 
                        gotta be eighteen to rent here.

                                 JASPER
                        Is there any way I can get a room?
                             (thinks)
                        Um...I got $100.

                                 LOIS
                        Can’t help ya.

                                 JASPER
                        ...What am I supposed to do?

           Lois gets up and walks to a broom closet.

                                 LOIS
                        I’m sure I don’t know.

           She grabs a mop and walks out from behind the front desk.

           Lost, Jasper is still standing in his puddle.

           She PLOPS the mop down in front of him and begins 
           aggressively pushing it towards his feet.

                                 LOIS (cont’d)
                        Go on!  Shoo!

           Without any other real options, Jasper backs out of the Motel 
           6 as Lois mops up the puddle.

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper rushes back into the empty terminal.  At least it’s 
           dry in here, so he takes a seat.

           He pulls the prepaid cell out of his bag, hits SPEED DIAL.

           RINGING on the other end of the line.  It goes to voicemail.
                                 VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                        Yo, it’s the boy Cinch.  Can’t take 
                        ya call right now, but leave a 
                        message and I’ll holla back.

           BEEP!  Jasper hangs up the phone.

           Jasper pulls out his Mead notebook, flips to the end.

           Written on the back cover is a phone number: “Mom.”

           Jasper DIALS the number.  Waits.  CLICK.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        We’re sorry, you’ve reached a 
                        number that has been disconnected 
                        or is no longer in service.  If you 
                        feel you have reached this 
                        recording in error, please check 
                        the number and try your call again.

           Jasper hangs up.  Looks at the phone, puzzled.

           The Clerk walks over, ZIPPING up his jacket.

                                 CLERK
                        Gotta lock up.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper exits, staying under the awning to keep dry.

           The Clerk LOCKS the door behind him.  Turns off the lights.

           Having no plan, Jasper just stands there.  His eyes search 
           the area for any possible solutions.  He sees no solutions, 
           but he does see-

           -a police cruiser skulking around the parking lot.

           Wanting nothing to do with that, Jasper walks off into the 
           rain without a destination.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

           Terry walks the length of the bus, collecting whatever trash 
           the passengers left behind.  Once he’s gotten everything, he 
           ties off the trash can’s plastic lining.

           He returns to the front of the bus and picks up an umbrella.

           He POPS open the umbrella and heads out into the rain.
           INT. MOTEL 6 LOBBY - NIGHT

           Terry walks in and immediately SLIPS.  One foot slides 
           forward, and he’s barely able to regain his balance before 
           eating shit.

                                 LOIS
                             (not looking up)
                        Careful.  Wet floor.

                                 TERRY
                        Uh-huh.
                                 How’re you, Lois?

                                 LOIS
                             (not a conversationalist)
                        Meh.  Smoking room for a night on 
                        the Greyhound account?

                                 TERRY
                        Yep.

                                 LOIS
                        Additional $5 for HBO?

                                 TERRY
                        Nope.

           Lois hits a button on her antiquated computer and an old 
           printer WHIRS to life.

           She puts the form on the desk.

                                 LOIS
                        Sign here.

           EXT. MOTEL 6 - MOMENTS LATER

           Terry exits his room after dropping off his stuff.

           He OPENS the umbrella and begins walking towards the strip 
           club down the street.

           Terry passes a dark alley.

           Something catches his eye.  He stops walking.  Squints.

                                 TERRY
                             (calling out)
                        Jasper!?  Is that you!?

           Sure enough, Jasper is hunkered down next to the dumpster in 
           this dark alley.  He is using a large piece of cardboard as a 
           shelter to keep dry, but the cardboard isn’t very effective.
           Jasper notices Terry.  He averts his eyes, ashamed.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        What are you doing?

                                 JASPER
                        My bus to Lexington don’t leave 
                        ‘til tomorrow, and the Motel 6 
                        won’t rent me a room.

                                 TERRY
                        Of course they won’t, you’re ten 
                        years old.

                                 JASPER
                             (annoyed)
                        Yeah, I know that.

                                 TERRY
                        Right.  Sorry.

           Some primitive instinct buried deep within Terry’s mind 
           causes him to steal a glimpse at AJ Entertainment’s glowing 
           neon sign before deciding to do the right thing.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        C’mon.  Get up.

           INT. MOTEL 6/LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

           A dingy public room where guests can pay a dollar to use the 
           rickety old washer/dryer set.

           Terry OPENS the dryer, tosses in Jasper’s wet clothes.

           INT. TERRY’S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Your average, ugly middle-of-nowhere motel room.

           Terry has requested a cot for Jasper to sleep on.  Jasper 
           sits on it, wrapped in a blanket.

           The TV is on.  A cable network is showing an edited-down, 
           uber-violent action movie (take your pick).

           After a beat, Jasper’s prepaid RINGS.

           Jasper answers it.  He hears PARTY NOISE through the line.

                                 JASPER
                        Hello?

                                 CINCH (V.O.)
                        Yo Jasper.  I miss a call from you?
                                 JASPER
                        Yeah, earlier.

                                 CINCH (V.O.)
                        What chu need?

                                 JASPER
                        Nothing.  Had a problem before, but 
                        I figured it out.

                                 CINCH (V.O.)
                        You doin’ aiight?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.
                                Goin’ to Lexington tomorrow.

                                 CINCH (V.O.)
                        That’s what’s up.  I’ll let Dante 
                        know you’re comin’ in mid-day.  Go 
                        get that money, son.

                                 JASPER
                        No doubt.

           Jasper hangs up.

           Terry enters, carrying Jasper’s clothes.

                                 TERRY
                        The dryer’s a piece a’ shit.
                             (checks his language)
                        Sorry.
                             (Jasper doesn’t care.)
                        Anyway, they’re pretty dry.  I 
                        could give ‘em another whirl if you 
                        want me to.

           Jasper checks the clothes.  Dry enough.

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, that’s good.

           Jasper starts to get dressed.

           Terry FLOPS down on the bed, lights a cigarette.

           Terry spaces out for a second, watching the violent action 
           flick on TV.  Then-

                                 TERRY
                        You shouldn’t be watching this.

                                 JASPER
                        How come?
                                 TERRY
                        You’re too young.

                                 JASPER
                             (as in “Bitch please!”)
                        Please!

                                 TERRY
                        No way.  I loved this kinda stuff 
                        when I was your age, but it ain’t 
                        good for you.

           Terry turns off the TV.  Jasper is annoyed.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        I don’t think your mom wants you 
                        staying up late watching this 
                        garbage.  It’s gotta be past your 
                        bed time anyway.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t have a bed time.

                                 TERRY
                        You don’t?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, my moms is cool like that.

           Terry marinates on this information for a second.

                                 TERRY
                        Well, this is my room, so what I 
                        say goes.

                                 JASPER
                        What do you wanna do then?

                                 TERRY
                        Nothing.  We both gotta be up early 
                        tomorrow, it’s time to turn in.

                                 JASPER
                        But I ain’t tired.

           Terry thinks, stubs out his cigarette in the ashtray.

                                 TERRY
                        Bring your homework up here, I’ll 
                        check it out for you.

           Jasper pulls out his Mead notebook and math textbook.

           He hops up on the bed, gives them both to Terry.

           Terry opens the notebook, looks it over.  Thinks.
                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Looks like you got the first 
                        problem right.

                                 JASPER
                        Nice.

           Terry looks it over some more.  Thinks, concedes.

                                 TERRY
                        Got the second one right, too.

           INT. TERRY’S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

           It’s the middle of the night.  Jasper lies on the cot, 
           wrapped in the cheap Motel 6 blanket.

           He is not asleep because Terry is out cold and straight 
           LUMBERJACKIN’.  It sounds like Terry’s respiratory system 
           functions like a Harley Davidson exhaust pipe.

           After a few beats, Jasper can’t stand it anymore.

           He gets up and climbs onto the bed.

                                 JASPER
                        Terry, you’re snoring.

           No reaction.  Jasper POKES Terry.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Yo, shut up!

           Terry STIRS in his sleep.  He doesn’t wake up, but he rolls 
           over.  The change of position stops the snoring.

           Jasper looks back to his cot: that thing sucks.

           Jasper lays down, making sure to stay on his side of the bed, 
           pulls the covers over himself.

           Jasper closes his eyes.

           INT. TERRY’S MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Terry and Jasper are asleep.  The phone RINGS.

           Terry wakes up, grabs the phone.

                                 PHONE (V.O.)
                        This is your wake-up call, 
                        scheduled for...
           Terry HANGS UP.  He sits up, clearing his head. 

           He finally notices Jasper in the bed next to him.  His 
           presence startles Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        Jesus Christ!

           Jasper pops up, looking around like something is wrong.

                                 JASPER
                        What?

                                 TERRY
                        You scared the piss outta me.

                                 JASPER
                        Oh.  Sorry, that cot sucks.

           Terry looks at the cot.  It looks like it sucks.

                                 TERRY
                        Don’t worry about it, just gave me 
                        a start is all.
                             (gets up)
                        C’mon, we got a bus to catch.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MORNING

           Terry is now dressed in his driver’s uniform.  He escorts 
           Jasper to an awaiting Greyhound bus.  Passengers are already 
           beginning to board the bus.

                                 TERRY
                        This is you.

                                 JASPER
                        Cool.

                                 TERRY
                        You take care of yourself on the 
                        way to Lexington, okay?

                                 JASPER
                        I will.
                             (pause)
                        Thanks for being so nice to me.

                                 TERRY
                        It was my pleasure, kid.

           Jasper starts to walk away, but stops to say:

                                 JASPER
                        Hey Terry?
                                 TERRY
                        Yeah?

                                 JASPER
                        I bet your mom misses you.

           Terry wasn’t expecting that.  There’s a long pause, as the 
           cat clearly has his tongue.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        See you later.

           Jasper approaches the ticket agent and boards the bus.

           Terry stands there for a second.  He lights a cigarette.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MORNING

           Jasper sits in the front seat, arm around the X-Men bag.

           A severely overweight and generally pissed-off BUS DRIVER 
           (40s) is driving.  Jasper is restless.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s your name?

           No response from the Bus Driver.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Where are we?
                             (no response)
                        Sir?

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Are you talking to me?

                                 JASPER
                        Uh-huh.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Do me a favor and stop, huh?

           Ouch.  Chastised, Jasper turns his gaze to the window.

           EXT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL - EARLY AFTERNOON

           The Greyhound has parked outside the station.  The terminal 
           is in an ugly area of town, industrial buildings and cheap 
           tract housing neighborhoods.

           Jasper gets off the bus with his X-Men bag, looks around.

           As the other passengers disperse, Jasper sees-
           -MOSE (22), a stocky thug in baggy jeans and an oversized 
           Colts jersey.  He is leaning against a grape-purple 1985 
           Coupe DeVille with 100-spoke chrome rims.

           Jasper approaches with caution.  Mose sees him.

                                 MOSE
                        You Cinch’s boy?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.

                                 MOSE
                        I’m Mose.  Dante sent me. 

                                 JASPER
                        Aiight.

           Pause.

                                 MOSE
                        Well get in, nigga.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           Terry is in “automatic driving machine” mode.  The trip back 
           to Philly is a long and tedious one.

           After a few beats, something catches his eye (and ears).

           SIDEVIEW MIRROR:  Bikers.  Lots of them.  15-20 at least.

           Engines ROAR as a pack of bikers pass Terry on the left and 
           settle into formation in front of him.

           Terry looks at the horde of outlaws.

           The patches on their backs read PAGANS MC, and all of them 
           have a Surtr patches that glare back at Terry.

           Terry watches his old club do their thing; a life of power, 
           excess, and immorality.  A life that he gave up

           The Pagans pick up speed, weaving through traffic.

           Soon they are out of sight.

           Terry is left sitting alone in his driver’s seat, thinking 
           about the life he’s chosen to live.
           EXT. “THE HIGHLANDS” - DAY

           One of the more run down neighborhoods on the outskirts of 
           Lexington (to the northeast of downtown).

           Once again we see the low-income tract housing.  These cheap 
           houses appear to be only a fraction above mobile homes.

           A majority of the homes have some form a trash cluttering up 
           the front lawn, from old cars to children’s toys.

           Mose’s Coupe Deville cruises up the street, BLASTING southern 
           crunk-hop.  So much for being inconspicuous.

           The Coupe Deville parks in a driveway.

           INT. DANTE’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           The front door leads into a decently spacious living room, 
           which is furnished with overstuffed leather couches, a glass 
           coffee table, and a huge flat screen TV.

           Seated on the couch is DANTE (24).  He is lanky, yet 
           muscular, and pretty ugly in the face.  He wears baggy jeans 
           and a tight wife-beater tank top.

           He is the “boss,” but the term feels a little generous for 
           this guy.

           Flanking Dante are two YOUNG GIRLS (18-20).  Both are 
           decently pretty, but clearly women of loose morals that hang 
           around for easy access to drugs and creature comforts.

           At the moment, one of the girls is braiding Dante’s medium-
           sized afro into cornrows.  She’s 50% done, so Dante’s head is 
           exactly one half afro and one half cornrows.

           The front door OPENS.

           Mose enters with Jasper trailing him.

           Dante looks up.  Business time.

                                 DANTE
                        This him?

           Mose nods.

                                 GIRL1
                             (to Jasper)
                        Awww, hi baby.  Ain’t you cute.

                                 GIRL2
                        He your cousin or somethin’?
           Dante scowls at them, suddenly annoyed by their existence.

                                 DANTE
                        Ladies.  Go take a nap in my bed.
                        I’ll wake ya’ll up in a minute.

           The girls semi-pout, but know to follow instructions.

           Dante waits until he hears his bedroom door CLOSE before-

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        What’s your name, cuz?

                                 JASPER
                        Jasper.

                                 DANTE
                        Jasper.  I’m Dante.

                                 JASPER
                        I know.

                                 DANTE
                        Course you do, I’m bein’ polite, 
                        nigga!  You don’t wanna be polite, 
                        then break it out and we be done 
                        with it.

           Jasper UNZIPS the X-Men bag, pulls out the teddy bear.

           He passes it to Dante.

           Dante RIPS the head off of the bear, and pulls out the 
           tightly-wrapped package of cocaine.

           Dante holds out his hand.

           Mose hands him a Leatherman hunting knife.

           Dante flips open the knife and uses it to make a tiny 
           incision in the package.

           Dante pulls the knife out, bringing with it a small bump of 
           white powder.

           He brings the knife to his nose, SNORTS.

           Jasper watches.

           Dante closes his eyes tight, feeling the potency.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Yup, that’s that shit.

           He and Mose exchange a smile: “Back in business.”
                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Get youngblood his money.

           Mose disappears into the back hallway.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Your man Cinch got the hot connect.

           Jasper nods.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                             (re: the cocaine)
                        You want a taste?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah, I’m good.

                                 DANTE
                        You a pussy?

                                 JASPER
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Nah...ain’t like...just, I’m good.

           Dante keeps his eyes on Jasper, strangely proud of himself 
           for being able to intimidate this little kid.

           Mose returns with four stacks of hundred-dollar bills.

           He DROPS them on the coffee table.

                                 DANTE
                        There it is, boy.  Pack that shit
                        up in ya school bag and my man’ll
                        bring you back to the station, get 
                        you on ya way back to Philly.

           Jasper picks up one of the money stacks.  He slowly flips 
           through it, counting it out.

           Dante and Mose look at each other.

           After Jasper finishes counting the first stack, he reaches 
           into his X-Men bag.

           However, instead of packing away the money, he pulls out his 
           Mead notebook.

           Perplexed, Dante and Mose watch as Jasper opens the notebook 
           and begins SCRIBBLING on a blank page.

           After a few beats they realize...Jasper’s doing the math.

           Jasper gets his answer.  Double-checks his work.  Then-
                                 JASPER
                        You shorted me.

                                 DANTE
                        Got it wrong, boy.

                                 JASPER
                        Each stack’s got one hundred 
                        hundreds, that’s 10K.  Four stacks 
                        makes 40K.  Package is 50.

                                 DANTE
                        What’re you, fuckin’ black Doogie
                        Howser or some shit?

                                 JASPER
                        Package is 50.

                                 DANTE
                        That’s what you gettin’, nigga.

                                 JASPER
                        What do I tell Cinch?

           Dante looks at Mose, who smirks.

           Dante motions Jasper towards him.

                                 DANTE
                        I’ll tell you what to tell ‘im.

           Jasper walks up to the coffee table.  Dante motions him 
           closer.  Jasper leans forward...

           ...BAM!  Dante BANGS Jasper’s head on the coffee table!

           Jasper FALLS BACK, dazed.  A cut has opened up just above his 
           hairline, and it is bleeding like he’s in a prize fight.

           Dante rises from the couch, looming over Jasper.

           Jasper rolls over on all fours, trying to get up.

           Dante doesn’t kick Jasper, but rather he puts his foot on 
           Jasper’s back and uses it to SHOVE HIM DOWN.

           Jasper BUMPS his face, specifically his mouth, on the floor.

           Dante kneels down next to Jasper, getting real close.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        You tell Cinch that I run a 
                        business and I ain’t to be trifled 
                        with.
                                 DANTE(cont'd)
                        You tell Cinch that I don’t 
                        appreciate him missin’ a shipment 
                        cuz’ some dumb-ass bitch gets 
                        knocked on the route, and I 
                        definitely don’t appreciate ‘im
                        sendin’ some grade-school smart-
                        mouth nigga like you as the back-
                        up.  You tell ‘im as long as he’s 
                        runnin’ a shabby operation then I’m 
                        gettin’ discount prices.  He got a 
                        problem with that?  Then tell ‘im I 
                        don’t give a FUCK!

           Dante keeps his glare in Jasper’s face as he grabs the stacks 
           of cash off of the table and STUFFS them into the X-Men bag.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Now you gonna take this money, and 
                        get yo’ ass outta here.

           Dante PULLS Jasper up by the collar, starts marching him 
           towards the front door.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        See this like a life lesson, boy.
                        Maybe next time you’ll realize who 
                        you’re talkin’ to.  Be more polite.

           Dante OPENS the front door.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Me?  I’m through bein’ polite wit’ 
                        you.  Take a walk back to the bus.

           With that, Dante SHOVES Jasper off the front step to-

           EXT. DANTE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper TRIPS, STUMBLES, and manages to TUCK and ROLL onto the 
           trashy front lawn.

           The front door SLAMS closed.

           Jasper lies still for a while, BREATHING HEAVY.

           After a few beats he pushes himself up to his knees.

           Jasper touches his head, gets blood on his hands.

           He’s definitely scared, but it’s unclear if he’s more scared 
           of Dante or of returning to Philly without Cinch’s 50K.

           Jasper weighs his options.  Pulls out the prepaid.

           DIALS.
           INT. CINCH’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Cinch is watching TV in his boxers.  A half-naked girl sleeps 
           on the couch next to him.

           Cinch finishes rolling a blunt, lights it up.  He exhales a 
           monstrous cloud of smoke, leans back.  Life is good.

           The cell phone on the table BUZZES.

           Cinch picks it up, answers immediately.

                                 CINCH
                        Eh-yo!  What’s up, kid, you touch 
                        base wit’ Dante?

           INTERCUT BTW CINCH AND JASPER.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m outside his spot now.

                                 CINCH
                        Nice.  Everything goin’ smooth?

                                 JASPER
                        He shorted me.

                                 CINCH
                        Say what?

                                 JASPER
                        He only puttin’ up 40.

           Cinch gets up from the couch, roughly pushing the girl aside.

           He moves into another room, getting serious and angry.

                                 CINCH
                        Well tell ‘im that he’s mistaken.

                                 JASPER
                        I did, Cinch, I did.  But he got 
                        all heated and threw me out the 
                        door.  Like, THREW me out the door.

                                 CINCH
                        What he say?

                                 JASPER
                        Said it’s 40 cuz’ you’re runnin’ a 
                        shabby operation.

           Cinch clenches his fist, feigns a punch to the wall.
                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        What do you want me to do?

           Cinch rubs his temples for a second.

                                 CINCH
                        Big day for you, Jasper.  I’m gonna
                        need you to pick up that other 
                        thing I gave you and go back in 
                        there.  Make it right.
                             (pause)
                        Can you do that for me?

           Jasper’s face.

           INT. DANTE’S HOME - SAME

           Dante uses the knife to dig another bump of cocaine from the 
           package.  He holds it out.

                                 DANTE
                        Hit this.

           Mose takes the knife, SNORTS.

                                 MOSE
                        Oooo, that’s what’s up!

                                 DANTE
                        Hell yeah, we back up n’ runnin’!

           CREAK.  Dante and Mose turn.

           The front door has swung open.

           Jasper has returned, but this time he’s holding a snub-nosed
           .38 special with both hands!

           It’s a surreal sight, this little kid with a bloody scalp and 
           an X-Men bag aiming a pistol at two grown men.

           Dante and Mose react, surprised to say the least.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        Whoa, whoaaaaa, what you think 
                        you’re doin’, boy?

                                 JASPER
                        Lemme see your hands.

           Dante and Mose exchange a look, then show their hands.

                                 DANTE
                        Just take it easy there.
                                 JASPER
                        I need that other ten.

                                 DANTE
                        Well I ain’t got it.

                                 JASPER
                             (wavering confidence)
                        I need that other ten.

                                 DANTE
                        Ain’t you hear me, nigga, I said I 
                        don’t got it.  It ain’t here.

                                 JASPER
                        Go get it.

                                 DANTE
                        Ain’t nowhere else neither.
                        Forty’s what I got, forty’s what 
                        you gettin’.

           Jasper pauses.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                        What you gonna do now?
                             (Jasper is silent)
                        Yeah, didn’t think of that, did 
                        you?  You just a kid, you ain’t 
                        gonna be shootin’ no one.

                                 JASPER
                        I will if I have to.

                                 DANTE
                        Bullshit, boy.  Look at you, your 
                        arms is shakin’, can’t barely hold 
                        up that gun.

           It’s true, Jasper’s young arms are tired and trembling.

                                 DANTE (cont’d)
                             (starts to stand)
                        Now what I think you oughta do...

                                 JASPER
                        Yo, sit down!

                                 DANTE
                             (doesn’t sit)
                        ...is put down that piece cuz’ you 
                        ain’t gonna do...

           BANG!  The gun GOES OFF!
           Dante’s head SNAPS BACK!  He DROPS between the couch and the 
           coffee table!

           Mose DIVES over the couch and SCRAMBLES/CRAWLS into the back 
           of the house.

           We hear the Girls SCREAMING from the back room.

           Upon closer inspection, we see that Jasper shot Dante in the 
           head, but didn’t kill him.

           The bullet grazed the afro-side of Dante’s head, bulldozing a 
           canyon into his mountain of hair with a little riverbed of 
           scorched flesh at the bottom of the valley.

           Dante rolls around on the ground like a wounded animal, 
           confused and concussed.

           Meanwhile Jasper is frozen in place.  He can’t believe what 
           he just did.

           The girls continue SCREECHING off screen.

           Jasper snaps out of his trance, frantically looks around.

           His eyes fall on the package.

           Jasper grabs the package and runs.

           EXT. DANTE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper BURSTS out the door, rushing down to the sidewalk.

           He tries to stuff the package and the gun into the X-Men bag 
           while running at full speed.

           In doing so, the prepaid cell phone BOUNCES out of the bag 
           and HITS the sidewalk.  The battery POPS out.

           Jasper SCREECHES to a stop.

           He grabs the phone and the battery, and turns to run-

           -but immediately TRIPS over his own feet, dropping the phone 
           again.  This time it SHATTERS.

           Jasper pauses briefly, recognizes that the phone is dead, and 
           then continues HAULING ASS.

           Jasper runs and runs and runs some more.

           After getting a few blocks away, he ducks behind a corner.

           Reaching into the bag, Jasper pulls out the pack of gum.
           He removes a piece and chews it like he’s on the clock.

           After the gum has turned into a ball of putty, Jasper pulls 
           out the package.

           He uses the piece of gum to seal the incision shut, stopping 
           the powder from leaking out into his bag.

           Jasper ZIPS UP the bag.

           He looks around the corner.

           He sees no visible threats, but he can hear a COMMOTION in 
           the distance.  Most likely a search party.

           Jasper turns and SPRINTS towards downtown Lexington.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN LEXINGTON - EVENING

           A more urban area of Lexington comprised of businesses, 
           office buildings, and luxury apartment buildings.

           There is not much foot traffic.

           Jasper STAGGERS down the sidewalk, PANTING.  It looks like 
           he’s been running forever.

           Exhausted, rattled, and scared, Jasper does what any little 
           kid would do.

           He decides to hide.

           Jasper ducks into a side alley.

           In the alley he finds two dumpsters and four recycling bins, 
           all filled to the brim.

           Jasper grabs the recycling bins and starts moving them closer 
           to the dumpsters.  After a few beats we realize-

           -that he’s building a fort.

           Soon Jasper has the dumpster protecting one side of him, and 
           the four bins protecting the other side.

           Jasper pulls a piece of cardboard over his head, creating a 
           makeshift roof.

           Satisfied with his fort, Jasper hunches down behind the 
           protective wall.

           He retrieves the gun from his bag, holds it with both hands.

           He waits, eyes wide open.
           INT. PHILADELPHIA GREYHOUND TERMINAL - NIGHT

           The bus has just arrived.  Terry stands off to the side, 
           smoking a cigarette while the passengers grab their luggage 
           from the compartment.

           A Greyhound Ticket Agent sees Terry, walks up to him.

                                                    Gonna
                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Hey Terry, bad news.  Jack called 
                        out sick, and Cheryl quit.
                        need you to haul to Charleston 
                        again tomorrow morning.

                                 TERRY
                        Okay.

                                 TICKET AGENT
                             (pause)
                        How come you never complain when I 
                        ask you to drive on a 24-hour
                        turnaround?

                                 TERRY
                        Get paid time and a half, right?

                                 TICKET AGENT
                        Yeah, but still.

           Terry drops his cigarette, stubs it out with his foot.

                                 TERRY
                        Fuck else am I gonna do?

           Terry walks back to the bus to clean up.

           INT. TERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           It’s late.  Terry lies in bed, wide awake.

           He tosses.  He turns.  He gets frustrated.

           Terry sits up in his bed, turns on the light.

           He grabs a pack of cigarettes, lights up.

           Restless, something is clearly on his mind.

           EXT. TERRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Now dressed in jeans, a heavy flannel, and a Carhartt jacket, 
           Terry exits his apartment building.
           He walks down the silent, lonely streets.

           EXT. CITY BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Terry sits under the bus shelter, smoking.

           The city bus PULLS UP to the stop.  Terry stands up.

           INT. CITY BUS - NIGHT

           Terry sits on the bus, looking aimlessly out the window.

           He is all alone, a passenger for first time.

           His knee is bouncing up and down, a nervous tick.

           Takes a deep breath.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Terry stands at the end of a walkway leading up to a quaint, 
           lower-middle class home.

           He takes a drag off of his cigarette, focused on the front 
           door as though they’re in a staring contest.

           Finally, Terry flicks the butt and walks up to the door.

           He RINGS the doorbell twice.  Waits.

           After what seems like an eternity, the lights TURN ON and 
           Terry hears the faint sounds of someone coming to the door.

           The front door OPENS revealing-

           -Angela in her bathrobe.

           Angela peers through the screen door that now separates her 
           and Terry.  Recognition sets in, and her jaw gradually drops.

           She opens the screen door, steps into the doorway.

           Terry attempts a smile.

                                 TERRY
                        Hi Ma...

           WHACK!  Angela SLAPS him hard across the face.

           Terry is upset by this slap, but not surprised.

           His eyes wander to the ground.
           Angela looks at her son, coming to terms with his presence.

           Weighted silence.  Terry nods slightly.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Okay, well I’ll get going...

                                 ANGELA
                        Terrence David Fuller, you’ll get 
                        in the house this very instant!

           Angela turns and disappears into the house, leaving the door 
           open for Terry to follow her.

           Terry stands still, more than perplexed by this exchange.

                                 ANGELA (O.S.) (cont’d)
                        And if you’re out there thinking 
                        you didn’t deserve that slap, then 
                        I got another one waiting for you 
                        in here!

           Terry face: “that’s my mother.”

           Terry enters the house, closing the door behind him.

           INT. ANGELA’S HOME/KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A cluttered, homey kitchen.  Terry sits at the kitchen table.

           Angela brings over two cups of tea.  She maintains a hard, 
           skeptical, and judgmental expression on her face.

                                 TERRY
                        Thank you.

                                 ANGELA
                        You’re welcome.

           Terry pulls out his cigarettes, refers to an ashtray on the 
           kitchen table.

                                 TERRY
                        You started up again?

                                 ANGELA
                        A few years ago.

           He offers her one.  She takes it.

                                 TERRY
                        Why?

           He lights her cigarette, then his.
                                 ANGELA
                        I’m an old woman, Terry, I can do 
                        whatever I want.  You’re the one 
                        who should quit, you’re still a 
                        young man.

           Brief silence as they smoke together.

                                 ANGELA (cont’d)
                        Well go ahead, then.

                                 TERRY
                        ...Go ahead...?

                                 ANGELA
                        I haven’t seen you in over eight 
                        years, Terry, you obviously have 
                        something you want to say.

           Terry retreats into himself.  Fidgets.  Finally-

                                 TERRY
                        I quit ridin’ bikes.

                                 ANGELA
                        That’s good.  Good for you.

                                 TERRY
                        Drive a bus now.

                                 ANGELA
                        They let you work around children?

                                 TERRY
                        Not a school bus, a coach bus.  For 
                        Greyhound.

                                 ANGELA
                        Oh.

                                 TERRY
                        It’s work, you know?
                             (redirects the 
                              conversation)
                        I see you’re still having the 
                        Friday night cap with Dad.

           This receives a look of suspicion from Angela.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        I take walks around the cemetery 
                        sometimes.  Saw you go in there a 
                        couple months back.
                                 ANGELA
                        Best part of my week.  I like the 
                        routine.  It helps me remember him.

           Terry nods, unable to think of anything to say.

           Angela stares at Terry, fed-up with the small talk.

                                 ANGELA (cont’d)
                             (harsh)
                        I’m not entirely sure what you’re 
                        looking for here, but sitting there 
                        feeling sorry for yourself, it’s 
                        not doing you any favors.

           Terry SWALLOWS hard.  This very difficult for him.

                                 TERRY
                        I was ashamed, Ma.  That’s where 
                        I’ve been all this time.

           She says nothing, daring him to continue.

           Terry cringes.  This is the part he was dreading.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                             (struggling through it)
                        I was ashamed of myself, and I knew 
                        you were ashamed of me too.  For 
                        everything.  For being in the can 
                        when dad died.  For letting you 
                        down.  Just...couldn’t stand the 
                        thought of you looking at me the 
                        way you’re looking at me now.
                             (pause)
                        You always told me I could be 
                        whatever I wanted to be.  Never 
                        wanted to be a bus driver.

           Angela’s hard expression softens, recognizing that her son is 
           doing everything in his power to open up.

                                 ANGELA
                        But you don’t want to be a criminal 
                        either, Terry.  It took you a while 
                        to figure that out, but you figured 
                        it out.  The hardest lives to 
                        straighten out are the ones that 
                        get off track.
                             (pause)
                        You’re a good boy, Terry, and it’s 
                        very important for me to know that.

           Terry gets choked up hearing this.  Eyes water.
                                 TERRY
                        I am...so sorry.

                                 ANGELA
                        Yeah.
                             (pause, means it)
                        I know.

           He puts his hand out on the kitchen table.

           Angela takes his hand in her’s.  Squeezes.

                                 ANGELA (cont’d)
                        It’s good to see you again.

           We hold on these two remembering what they once meant and 
           could mean to each other as smoke drifts through the kitchen.

           EXT. ANGELA’S HOME - LATER

           Night has moved on to early morning. 

           The front door OPENS.  Terry is putting on his jacket.

           Angela joins him in the doorway. 

           Terry opens the screen door and starts to leave when-

                                 ANGELA
                        Oh, before you go.

           She disappears for a second, returns with a trash bag.

                                 ANGELA (cont’d)
                        Bring this out for me?

                                 TERRY
                        Sure.

           Terry takes the trash.  He’s halfway down the walk when-

           -he turns around, looks at his mother.  He feels like there 
           is so much more to say.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        So...
                             (can’t find the words)
                        ...I don’t know.

           Angela smiles, letting him know that it’s alright.

                                 ANGELA
                        We can talk about it later.
                                 TERRY
                             (pause, smiles)
                        Yeah.  That sounds good.

           Angela CLOSES the door.

           Terry takes a breath of fresh air, starts walking.

           Reaching the curb, Terry removes the lid of the trash can and 
           dumps Angela’s garbage in it.

           INT. DOWNTOWN LEXINGTON - LATE MORNING

           Jasper has fallen asleep leaning against the wall in his 
           recycling bin/dumpster fort.  His tiny hands are wrapped 
           around the .38 special.

           Jasper WAKES UP with a start as a truck RUMBLES by on a 
           nearby street.

           Jasper looks around frantically, trying to remember what the 
           hell is going on.

           He WINCES, touches his head.

           The cut on his scalp has scabbed up and inflated into an 
           impressive goose egg.  His lip is also split and swollen.

           Jasper takes a second to try to calm his breathing, which is 
           already verging on panic.

           He does a quick inventory check: gun, X-Men bag, cocaine 
           package, cash, and bus ticket.  Everything’s here.

           He stashes the gun in the X-Men bag.

           Jasper pokes his head between the recycling bins.

           The coast is clear.

           Jasper CRAWLS out of the fort, STRETCHES OUT the kinks.

           Standing in the alley, Jasper looks like a feral child: 
           bloody, filthy, and disoriented. 

           He wanders out of the alley to a street where there a few 
           pedestrians on the move.

           Jasper approaches a man in a suit.

                                 JASPER
                        Excuse me, sir.

           The man looks at Jasper, but doesn’t slow down.
                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        You know how to get to the 
                        Greyhound bus station?

           The man shakes his head, and continues walking away.

           Jasper turns to an uptight woman in her thirties.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Excuse me, ma’am.

           The woman doesn’t even look at Jasper, in fact she picks up 
           the pace.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Yo!

           No response.  Jasper deflates a little.

           He looks around for a better mark.

           He spots an ELDERLY WOMAN (70s) SHUFFLING down the sidewalk.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Excuse me, ma’am!

           Elderly Woman notices Jasper, seems happy that someone is 
           looking to talk to her.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Well hello there.

                                 JASPER
                        Hi, do you...?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Good morning to you.

                                 JASPER
                        Good morning to you, too.  Do you 
                        know where the bus station is?

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                        Oh yes, let me see.

           She opens her huge purse, begins DIGGING AROUND.

           Jasper continually looks around, paranoid.

           It feels like forever before-

           -the woman pulls a Lexington bus schedule out of her purse.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN (cont’d)
                        Here we go.
                                 JASPER
                        No no, I need to get to the 
                        Greyhound bus station.

           She puts on her reading glasses.

                                 ELDERLY WOMAN
                             (reading)
                        The yellow route is close, there’s 
                        a stop a few blocks...

                                 JASPER
                        No, ma’am, I need to...

           Jasper sees something out of the corner of his eye-

           -an off-duty taxi driving down the street.

           Jasper RUNS towards the street.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Hey!  Stop!  Yo!

           The taxi doesn’t appear to be slowing down.

           Desperate, Jasper RUSHES INTO THE STREET!

           The taxi HITS THE BRAKES!

           The taxi SCREECHES towards Jasper.

           Jasper CLOSES HIS EYES, prays for the best.

           The taxi BUMPS Jasper, KNOCKING him to the ground!

           Jasper HITS THE GROUND with an OOMPH!

           A hollow silence in this quiet city.

           The CAB DRIVER (40s) jumps out of the taxi, hopping mad.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Are you crazy!?  Are you fucking
                        crazy, what are you doing!?

           Cab Driver checks the hood of his taxi.  No damage.

                                 CAB DRIVER (cont’d)
                        You looking for money, is that it!?
                        I got witnesses, no way you pin 
                        this on me!  Running into the 
                        street like a God damn maniac!

           Jasper moves to his knees, then stands up.
           Cab Driver finally gets a clean look at Jasper, the split 
           lip, and the dried blood on his head.

           Cab Driver pales.

                                 CAB DRIVER (cont’d)
                        Jesus.  Are you alright, kid?

           Jasper looks into Cab Driver’s eyes with a steely focus.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll give you one hundred dollars 
                        to drive me to the Greyhound bus 
                        station.  Right now.

           EXT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL - DAY

           A few buses IDLE outside the terminal, waiting to board all 
           their passengers before departure time.

           In the parking lot we find Mose’s Coupe Deville.

           Dante sits in the passenger seat.  The side of his head is 
           wrapped in a bulky bandage.  He is not a happy guy.

           Dante’s eyes roam the parking lot, looking for Jasper so he 
           can unleash his rage.

           Jasper is nowhere in sight.

           INT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL - SAME

           The terminal is moderately full.  People buy tickets, say 
           goodbye to loved ones, and sit waiting for their bus.

           Mose enters the terminal.  He looks around.

           Some kids are running around, but none are Jasper.

           Mose does a few laps, checking every nook and cranny.

           Mose moves on to-

           INT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL/MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mose walks in.

           There is one man washing his hands, another at a urinal.

           The man finishes washing his hands, exits.

           Mose looks around, kneels down to check under the stalls.
           He sees one pair of adult-sized dress shoes.

           The man at the urinal finishes up, turns around.  He almost 
           bumps into Mose, giving him a strange look.

           Mose stands back up, leaves the bathroom.

           We stay in the bathroom, moving down the stalls to the 
           handicapped stall at the very end.

           Inside the stall is Jasper.  He is hugging the X-Men bag, 
           sitting on the top of the toilet tank.  He looks haggard.

           After a few beats, the terminal PA system comes to life.

                                 PA SYSTEM (V.O.)
                        The 2:20 PM bus to Charleston is 
                        boarding passengers.  The 2:20 to 
                        Charleston is boarding and will be 
                        leaving in two minutes.

           Anxiety overtakes Jasper, knowing it’s game time.

           He steps down off of the toilet, exits the stall.

           The man who was at the urinal is now washing his hands.

           Jasper waits for the man to exit the bathroom.  Jasper 
           follows the man, using him as a screen.

           INT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper walks across the terminal in the man’s shadow, keeping 
           his head low.

           Peeking up, Jasper spots Mose across the room.  Luckily Mose 
           is facing the opposite direction.

           Jasper speeds up, dashing across the terminal and out to-

           EXT. LEXINGTON BUS TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

           Once outside, Jasper runs to the idling bus.

           He gives his ticket to the ticket agent and quickly bounds up 
           the stairs.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper FLOPS down in the front seat.

           He brings himself low to the seat and peers out the window.
           Jasper sees Mose exit the terminal, still searching.

           Jasper ducks down, adrenaline pumping.  His hands are 
           clenched in tight fists, waiting for the bus to leave.

           After an eternity, the Bus Driver enters the bus.

           The Bus Driver CLOSES the door.

           Jasper exhales like he’s been holding his breath since birth.

           The Bus Driver picks up the PA mic.

                                 BUS DRIVER
                        Good afternoon, ladies and 
                        gentlemen.  Today we’ll be...

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT

           The Greyhound bus pulls into the terminal, parks.

           Jasper is the first one off the bus, moving directly to-

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper walks right up to the ticket counter where the Clerk 
           reads his newspaper. 

                                 JASPER
                        Yo.

           The Clerk looks up from his paper: “Yo,” huh?

                                 CLERK
                        Can I help you?

                                 JASPER
                        When’s the next bus to Philly?

                                 CLERK
                        Tomorrow morning.  7:20.

           Jasper looks drained.  He simply nods, turns around.

           The Clerk goes back to his reading.

           Jasper walks across the mostly empty terminal to-

           -the vending machines.

           Jasper buys dinner: a Pepsi, a Snickers bar, and BBQ chips.

           Jasper then moves to-
           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper enters.  A man at the sink is washing his hands.

           Jasper moves to the urinal, pretends to piss.

           The man exits the bathroom.

           Jasper opens the door to the handicapped stall.

           Locks the stall door.

           Jasper rests the X-Men bag on the TP dispenser.

           Climbs up on top of the tank.

           He POPS open the Pepsi.  RIPS open the bag of chips.

           Jasper starts eating.  Miserable.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - LATER

           Deeper into the night, the terminal is a ghost town.

           The last bus ARRIVES, PARKS.

           The door OPENS, and we see Terry in the driver’s seat.

           Bleary-eyed, he leans forward against the steering wheel as 
           the passengers file out of the bus.

           Once the bus is empty, Terry CLOSES the door.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/OVERNIGHT LOT - NIGHT

           Terry exits the bus with a plastic trash bag.

           He locks up the bus.

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT

           The Clerk makes his rounds before locking up for the night.

           He opens the door to the women’s bathroom.

                                 CLERK
                        Locking up, anyone in here!?

           Silence.  He turns off the lights.

           He moves to the men’s bathroom.
           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/MEN’S BATHROOM - SAME

           The door OPENS.  Clerk pokes his head in.

                                 CLERK
                        Locking up, anyone in here!?

           IN THE STALL: Jasper remains perfectly still.

           Satisfied, the Clerk turns off the lights, leaving Jasper in 
           a pitch black bathroom.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Terry strolls down the street as the Clerk locks the entrance 
           to the terminal in the background.

           We follow Terry as he continues down the block.

           His destination is-

           INT. A J ENTERTAINMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Terry enters, surveys the scene.  The place is pretty empty.

           Moving toward the action, Terry sees-

           -Charlene on stage, mid-show.  She dips, swings, arches, and 
           spins around the pole.  There is no question about it: the 
           woman is sexy as hell.

           Terry takes a seat by the stage.

           He catches Charlene’s eyes.

           Re-focusing her energy, Charlene locks onto Terry.

           She seductively crawls across the stage until she is right up 
           in his face.

           She spins around, letting her ankles rest on his shoulders.

           Shoots him a naughty smile.

           Terry’s body temperature is on the rise.

           Charlene’s song ENDS.

           She spins around again, giving Terry a glimpse of her ass 
           before rounding the stage to collect her tips.

           After she’s gotten her money, she returns to Terry.
                                 CHARLENE
                        Hey sweetie.  You’re back.

                                 TERRY
                        I keep my promises.

                                 CHARLENE
                        I like that.  Still interested in 
                        that dance?

                                 TERRY
                        Absolutely.

           Charlene GIGGLES like she loves him, an absolute pro.

           She holds out her hand.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Well let’s go have some fun, sugar.

           Terry takes her hand, helps her down off of the stage.

                                 CHARLENE (cont’d)
                        This way, honey.

           She begins leading Terry towards the back rooms.

           During the journey, Terry’s facial expression shifts.  It’s 
           an odd look, as though his mother just called him while he 
           was in the middle of masturbating.

           Something’s bothering him.

           They are about to reach the back room cashier when-

                                 TERRY
                        What’s my name?

           She stops, looks at him.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Come again, sweetie?

                                 TERRY
                        I said, what’s my name?

                                 CHARLENE
                             (heavy flirting)
                        Now why would you go and ask that?

                                 TERRY
                        Because I’ve been coming in here 
                        for over a year, and I know at one 
                        point you knew my name.  I just 
                        want to know if it was worth 
                        remembering for you.
                                 CHARLENE
                        Baby...

                                 TERRY
                        Charlene.

           Long pause.  Charlene can’t think quick enough.

           Terry turns to leave.

                                 CHARLENE
                        Is it Timmy?

                                 TERRY
                             (walking away)
                        Close.

           INT. TERRY’S MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           The phone RINGS, jarring Terry from a deep sleep.

           He answers it.

                                 PHONE (V.O.)
                        This is your wake-up call, 
                        scheduled for...

           Terry HANGS UP, throws the covers off of himself.

           Terry stands up, stumbles groggily towards the bathroom.

           The ashtray on the bedside table is conspicuously empty.

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MORNING

           Terry enters the terminal dressed in his driver’s uniform.

                                 PA SYSTEM (V.O.)
                        The 7:20 bus to Philadelphia is now 
                        boarding passengers.  Again, the 
                        7:20 to Philadelphia is boarding 
                        passengers and with be departing in 
                        fifteen minutes.

           Terry heads towards-

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Terry enters and takes a spot at an open urinal.  WHISTLING.

           The stall door behind him CREAKS OPEN.
           Terry continues PISSING and WHISTLING.

           The stream slows, and then stops.  Terry ZIPS UP.

           He turns to see-

           -Jasper looking like death warmed over.

                                 TERRY
                             (stunned)
                        ...Jasper!?

           If Jasper is excited to see a familiar face, then he is 
           barely able to express it.

                                 JASPER
                        Hey.

           Terry kneels down next to him.

                                 TERRY
                        What are you doing...?
                             (gets a better look)
                        Jesus Christ, look at your face!
                        What happened to you!?
                             (Jasper is silent)
                        Who did this to you?

           Again, Jasper remains silent.  Terry senses that Jasper isn’t 
           looking to talk right now.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Listen to me, you stay here.  Stay 
                        right here, I’ll be back.

           EXT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Passengers give their tickets to the ticket agent and make 
           their way onto the bus.

           Terry bulls his way to the front of the line.

                                 TERRY
                        Excuse me, sorry, excuse me, gotta
                        get in, sorry.

           Terry gets onto the bus and grabs a first aid kit that is 
           stashed by the driver’s seat.

           INT. CHARLESTON BUS TERMINAL/MEN’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper now sits on one of the sinks.

           Terry is running hot water and soap in the other sink.
           He grabs some paper towels and dunks them in the soapy water.

           Terry uses them to gently scrub away the dried blood on 
           Jasper’s scalp.

           He then gets a fresh paper towel to clean out the cut on 
           Jasper’s head.

           He repeats this process for Jasper’s split lip.

           Terry then retrieves a small bottle of hydrogen peroxide from 
           the first aid kit.

                                 TERRY
                        This is gonna sting, okay?

           Jasper nods.

           Terry soaks a gauze pad with hydrogen peroxide.

           He then applies it to Jasper’s cut.

           Jasper winces.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        You’re okay.  You’re doing good.

           After holding it there for a few seconds, Terry removes the 
           gauze pad.

           Next out of the first aid kit is a tube of Neosporin.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Gimme you hand.

           Jasper holds out his hand.

           Terry dabs some Neosporin on his finger.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Rub that on your lip.

           Jasper does.

           Meanwhile, Terry unwraps a bandage.  He squirts some 
           Neosporin on the bandage before applying it to Jasper’s head.

           Terry takes a step back, looks at Jasper.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        There.  That’s better.

                                 JASPER
                        Thank you.
           Pause.

                                 TERRY
                        You want to tell me what happened 
                        now?

           Jasper is silent.  Terry hides his frustration.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        You riding back to Philly with me?

           Jasper nods.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Okay.
                             (pause)
                        Let’s go then.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Terry’s bus drives back towards Philadelphia.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

           Terry is driving, but he looks very different from his 
           “automatic driving machine” status.

           On the contrary it seems like Terry’s mind is reeling, trying 
           to prioritize various competing thoughts.

           Pause.  Then-

                                 TERRY
                        Jasper.

           No response.  Terry turns.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Hey Jasper...

           He sees Jasper laid out across the front seat.  Jasper’s head 
           rests on the X-Men bag, and his back is facing Terry.

           Looks like he dozed off.

           Terry turns his focus back to the road.

           PAN OVER TO the reverse angle of Jasper.

           He is in a sleeping position, but his eyes are WIDE OPEN,
           haunted by the events of the past 36 hours.
           EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

           Terry’s bus RUMBLES along, back in the familiar territory of 
           western Pennsylvania.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Terry is driving, still deep in thought.

           Jasper is in the same exact sleeping position.

           Terry tries again.

                                 TERRY
                        Jasper?

           No reaction.  This frustrates Terry.

           Terry thinks for a few beats.  He realizes that, if he’s 
           truly turning over a new leaf, then it is up to him to put 
           effort into reaching out to others.  So-

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        I went to see my mom.

           The slightest, almost imperceptible movement from Jasper.

           This is enough encouragement for Terry to continue.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        You were right, Jasper.  She missed 
                        me a lot.
                             (pause)
                        She rode my back pretty hard for 
                        some mistakes I made in the past, 
                        but that’s her right.

           Terry’s conversation is transforming into a confession.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        I mean...I stole from her.  Stole 
                        from my parents.  I lied to her and 
                        I disappointed her and I brought 
                        disgrace to our family...but...she 
                        was willing to...well, as soon as 
                        she realized I wasn’t there to ask 
                        for money, she was willing to...
                             (pause)
                        ...forgive me.
                             (pause)
                        I couldn’t have asked for anything 
                        more than that.

           Terry looks at Jasper, who remains still.
                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Anyway.  You were right, Jasper.
                        And I wanted to thank you for it, 
                        because if I hadn’t met you, I 
                        don’t think anything would’ve...

           Terry is interrupted as something catches his eye:

           FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS in his sideview mirror!

           Terry almost does a double-take, confused by this.

           He picks up the PA mic.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Uh...sorry for the interruption, 
                        ladies and gentlemen...but...it
                        looks like we’re being pulled over 
                        by Pennsylvania State Police. 

           Supposedly asleep, Jasper snaps up into a sitting position 
           like he was shot out of a cannon.

           Terry notices this, as well as the panic in Jasper’s eyes.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        The troopers run random stops on 
                        public transportation, but if 
                        everyone cooperates we’ll be back 
                        on the road in no time.  They’ll be 
                        asking everyone to get off the bus 
                        while they run a routine search.
                        Again, I apologize for the 
                        inconvenience.

           Predictable GRUMBLES throughout the coach.

           Terry takes the next exit, pulling the bus over in a gas 
           station parking lot.

           Once the bus is parked, Terry OPENS the door.  As he does 
           this he shoots Jasper a look: “Stay in your seat.”

           The passengers get off the bus, leaving Jasper & Terry alone.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                             (low voice)
                        So social services took you away 
                        from you mother.  They dropped you 
                        off at the station with a ticket, 
                        sending you to go stay with your 
                        uncle.  Right?

           Jasper nods.
                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Go.

           Jasper hops up, dragging the X-Men bag behind him.

           Pause.

           Two STATE TROOPERS board the bus.  They nod to Terry, and 
           then proceed to the back of the bus, taking a look around.

           Sergeant Ropinksi follows them, sucking on his trademark hunk 
           of chewing tobacco.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Afternoon, Terry.

           Terry holds up a tiny plastic-lined waste basket.

           Ropinski SPITS into it.

                                 TERRY
                        Didn’t call you.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Well, if we don’t do some of these 
                        stops randomly, then they won’t be 
                        random stops, will they?

                                 TERRY
                        Suppose not.  Don’t think I have 
                        anything for you this time though.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Can’t all be winners.  Or losers, 
                        that is.

           Ropinski looks out the window, scanning the crowd of 
           passengers waiting outside.

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        What about the kid?

                                 TERRY
                        Social services.  They’re sending 
                        him to stay with his uncle, told me 
                        to keep an eye on him.  Looks like 
                        whoever he was living with before 
                        tuned him up pretty good.
                             (feigning innocence)
                        You don’t think that he...?

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Never know.

                                 TERRY
                        Sick world.
                                 ROPINSKI
                        Ain’t it?

           Ropinski SLAPS Terry on the shoulder, friendly-like. 

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        Don’t worry Terry, we won’t hold 
                        you up long.

           EXT. GAS STATION PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Ropinski and his troopers get off the bus, followed by Terry, 
           who steps to the side.

           Ropinski address the line of waiting passengers.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        All right ladies and gentlemen, we 
                        apologize for the hold-up.  My men 
                        and I just have to take a look 
                        through some of your personal 
                        belongings.  If you’re unwilling to 
                        let us search your belongings then 
                        we’ll have to get a warrant, but 
                        that will take a long time and I 
                        don’t think any of you want to wait 
                        that out on the side of the 
                        highway.  There’s nothing to worry 
                        about if you’ve done nothing wrong.
                             (pause)
                        Let’s begin.

           Ropinski’s troopers take the lead, randomly picking two 
           people to search.

           Ropinski can’t keep his eye off Jasper.  He lumbers over to 
           Jasper, who is looking towards the ground.

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        What’s your name, young fella?

           Jasper forces himself to look up.

                                 JASPER
                        Jasper.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        What are you doing traveling all 
                        alone, Jasper?

                                 JASPER
                             (pause)
                        Lady from the state gave me a 
                        ticket.  Said I gotta go stay with 
                        uncle for a while.
                                 ROPINSKI
                        What’s your uncle’s name?

                                 JASPER
                        Cinch.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        “Cinch?”

                                 JASPER
                        I think his real name be Charles, 
                        but we always called him uncle 
                        Cinch.

                                 ROPINSKI
                             (CHUCKLES)
                        Uncle Cinch.  I like that.

           Ropinski eyes Jasper’s X-Men bag.

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        Cool bag.

                                 JASPER
                             (pause)
                        Thank you.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Who’s your favorite X-Man?

                                 JASPER
                        Wolverine.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Yeah, he’s everyone’s favorite.

           Ropinski holds out his hand.

                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        Well, you have a good trip, Jasper.

           It takes Jasper a second to realize what’s going on.

           Finally, he shakes Ropinski’s hand.

                                 JASPER
                        Thank you, sir.

           Ropinski looks down the line.

                                 ROPINSKI
                        Anything?

           The two troopers respond, shaking their heads “no.”
                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                        Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank 
                        you for your cooperation.  We’re 
                        going to get out of your hair, so 
                        please return to your seats.

           The passengers move back to the bus.

           Ropinski passes Terry.

                        Poor kid.
                                 ROPINSKI (cont’d)
                                   Fuckin’ shame.

                                 TERRY
                        Yeah.

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA TURNPIKE - EVENING

           Terry’s bus is officially in eastern Pennsylvania, drawing 
           closer to Philadelphia.

           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - SAME

           Terry drives.  Jasper looks out the window.

           The silence is very heavy.

           Eventually:

                                 JASPER
                        Hey Terry?

                                 TERRY
                        Yeah?

                                 JASPER
                        Where are we?

           Long pause.

                                 TERRY
                        I don’t know, pal.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA  - NIGHT

           The bright lights of the big city swallow Terry’s bus as it 
           returns home.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA GREYHOUND TERMINAL - NIGHT

           Terry’s bus rolls to a stop.
           INT. GREYHOUND BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Both Terry and Jasper remain seated as the other passengers 
           file out.  Once they’re alone-

           -Terry turns to Jasper.  A moment.

                                 TERRY
                        This is it.

           Jasper nods, stands up.

           Terry toils for a second.  Jasper notices this.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Listen...is there any way I can 
                        help you?

                                 JASPER
                        How you mean?

                                 TERRY
                        It’s just...
                             (searches for the words)
                        ...you’re a good boy, Jasper.  I 
                        want you to be alright.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll be aiight.

                                 TERRY
                        Are you sure?

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah, man.  I’m home now, 
                        everything’s gonna be good.

           It’s a tough pill for Terry to swallow, but he swallows it.

                                 TERRY
                        Okay then.

           Jasper reaches into the X-Men bag.

                                 JASPER
                        Here.

           Jasper passes something to Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        What’s this?

                                 JASPER
                        It’s for you.
           Terry inspects the gift.  It is a piece of Mead notebook 
           paper, folded over several times into a makeshift envelope.

           Terry opens it, can’t believe his eyes...

           ...two $100 bills.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Thanks for not ratting me out to 
                        that state cop.

           Terry is completely dumbfounded by this gesture and 
           everything that it means.

           He looks at Jasper, wanting to say everything.

           But he is speechless.

           Jasper smiles at Terry and gets off the bus.

           Hold on Terry, looking totally helpless.

           He CRUMPLES up the makeshift envelope.

           INT. CINCH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The door OPENS, revealing Jasper.

           Jasper looks up at Riff, who does not appear pleased.

           Riff lets Jasper in, SHUTS the door behind him.

           Jasper finds Cinch sitting on the couch.  He looks similarly 
           displeased, like he’s been stressing out for days.

           Even more menacing is the Mac-10 machine pistol that Cinch is 
           in the process of cleaning!

                                 CINCH
                        Sit.

           Jasper sits.

           Cinch lays the Mac-10 on the table with a CLUNK.  Glares.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Where you been?

                                 JASPER
                        I been comin’ back.

                                 CINCH
                        Oh yeah?  Well I been callin’ you 
                        round the clock.
                                 CINCH(cont'd)
                        No word from you, no word from 
                        Dante, I was getting ready to crew 
                        up and head out to Kentucky my-
                        fuckin’-self, so you better have 
                        some good reasoning behind all this 
                        fuckin’ hysteria.

                                 JASPER
                        I lost the burner in Lexington.

                                 CINCH
                        Tell me you got my money.

                                 JASPER
                        Not all of it.

           Cinch’s face tightens up.  Dark clouds on the horizon.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        But I got the package back.

           Cinch’s face loosens.  Clear skies ahead?

                                 CINCH
                        Say what?

           Jasper UNZIPS the X-Men bag.

           He produces four stacks of cash and the package of cocaine, 
           still sealed with a piece of bubble gum.

           Cinch looks at this, then to Riff, who is just as baffled.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Okay, walk me through this.  What 
                        happened out there?

                                 JASPER
                        Like I told you, Dante was only 
                        givin’ up forty. So I went back in 
                        there with the heater and told him 
                        to scrounge up the other ten.  He 
                        said that wasn’t happenin’.  He 
                        started to make a move, and the gun 
                        went off.  Hit Dante in the head.

                                 CINCH
                        You killed Dante!?

                                 JASPER
                        Nah.  It hit him in the head, but 
                        didn’t kill him.

                                 CINCH
                        So you grazed ‘im?
                                 JASPER
                        What’s that mean?

                                 CINCH
                        Like, skimmed off the side.

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah.  I grazed ‘im.

           Jasper retrieves the .38 from the bag, sets it down next to 
           the cash and the cocaine.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Anyway, Dante went down, and his 
                        boy split to the back.  I knew I 
                        wasn’t gettin’ the money, but I 
                        didn’t want to come back short.
                             (pause)
                        So I snatched the package.

           Cinch is taken aback by all this.

           He looks to Riff, who nods: “I’m impressed.”

           Cinch looks back to Jasper, and then-

           -BURSTS INTO LAUGHTER.  HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

           Riff joins in on the revelry.

           Jasper is odd man out, confused by this reaction.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        ...You ain’t mad?

                                 CINCH
                             (still LAUGHING)
                        Mad why?

                                 JASPER
                        I...just....didn’t mean to fuck
                        things up between you and Dante.

                                 CINCH
                                 Fuck that nigga, who give 
                        Dante!?
                        a shit about Dante!?

           Cinch gets up, walks over to Jasper.

           He puts his arm around Jasper for a heart-to-heart.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Lemme tell you somethin’, there are 
                        ALWAYS more Dantes.  There’s a 
                        fuckin’ endless supply of Dantes.
                        But you!
                                 CINCH(cont'd)
                        You, Jasper, are in short supply.
                        I ain’t taken a shine to a young’n
                        like you in a minute.
                             (totally sincere)
                        You got a big future ahead of you.

           Pause.  Jasper doesn’t know how to feel about this.

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks, Cinch.

           Cinch smiles, rubs Jasper’s head.

                                 CINCH
                        My man.

           Cinch picks up one of the stacks, hands it to Jasper.

                                 CINCH (cont’d)
                        Here.  Investment in your future.

                                 JASPER
                             (the whole stack!?)
                        For real?

                                 CINCH
                        Hell yeah.  Boy, you went out on a 
                        sale and came back with payment and 
                        the product!  That’s 100% gross 
                        return, baby!

                                 JASPER
                             (confused)
                        Like...a hundred forty four?

                                 CINCH
                        Huh?

                                 JASPER
                             (still confused)
                        Gross, like, nasty or...

                                 CINCH
                        Fuck is you talkin’ about, nigga?
                        Gross profit!
                             (waves it off)
                        Forget it, man, you had a long 
                        weekend.  Go get yourself some 
                        sleep, handle your business.

                                 JASPER
                        You still got my backpack?

                                 CINCH
                        You don’t want that X-Men joint?
                                 JASPER
                        Nah.  That’s kids’ stuff.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Jasper RUNS through the front door, wearing his old backpack.

           So close to home, Jasper is unable to conceal his excitement.

           He BOUNDS up the stairs two at a time.

           Reaching his floor, Jasper slows down and pulls his apartment 
           keys from his bag.

           Jasper gets to his apartment’s door, inserts the key...

           ...except the key doesn’t fit.

           Jasper checks the key ring, makes sure it’s the right one.

           He tries it again.  The key won’t turn.

           He POUNDS on the door.

                                 JASPER
                        Mama!  Yo, Mom!

           Jasper waits.  Silence.  He POUNDS on the door again.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Mama?

           Again, silence.  No one is coming to the door.

           Jasper ponders for a bit.

           He turns around and walks back down the stairs.

           Back on the first floor, Jasper finds the door that bears a 
           faded “Manager” sign.

           Jasper KNOCKS.  Pause.

           We hear MOVEMENT behind the door.

           Manny answers the door with a box of greasy Chinese take-out 
           food, shoveling it into his mouth with a fork.

                                 JASPER (cont’d)
                        Hey Manny...
                                 MANNY
                             (irritated)
                        Listen, if you’re looking for any 
                        of that junk you left behind, some 
                        of it might still be in the 
                        dumpster out back.

                                 JASPER
                        What...do you mean?

           Manny’s irritation slowly fades as he comes to recognize the 
           situation.  There is even a twinge of guilt in his eyes.

                                 MANNY
                        Oh.

                                 JASPER
                        Where’s my mom?

                                 MANNY
                             (chews awkwardly)
                        She left with your daddy.  Thought 
                        you went with them.

                                 JASPER
                        My daddy?

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah, tall guy I’ve seen around.
                        Shaved head, always showing off 
                        that Rolex he’s got.

           What’s left of Jasper’s hope, trust, dignity, and childhood 
           crumbles away.  He knows who that is, but-

                                 JASPER
                        That’s not my daddy.

           Long pause.

                                 MANNY
                        Sorry, kid.

           Manny CLOSES the door, leaving Jasper all alone.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper exits the building, takes a right.

           He wanders into a side alley.

           Jasper grabs a stray milk crate and DRAGS it over to a large 
           dumpster in the alley.

           Jasper hops up on the crate, making himself taller.
           He pushes open the lid of the dumpster.

           Sure enough, inside the dumpster are Desiree’s old TV, a 
           small collection of dishes and silverware...

           ...and a big pile of Jasper’s comic books.

           Jasper stares at it, tears in his eyes.

           He gets down off the crate.

           He ambles aimlessly towards the street.

           He sits on a park bench.  He looks around.

           There is a corner kid slingin’ across the street.

           A city bus DRIVES by.

           EXT. ANGELA’S HOME - NIGHT

           Dressed in casual clothes, Terry is KNOCKING.

           Angela opens the door.  Her face brightens a little.

                                 ANGELA
                        Didn’t expect to see you again so 
                        soon.

                                 TERRY
                             (absently)
                        Yeah.

                                 ANGELA
                             (senses it)
                        What’s wrong?

           Terry takes a moment for himself.

                                 TERRY
                        I just needed a hug.

                                 ANGELA
                        Why didn’t you say so?

           She opens her arms.

           Terry hugs his mother, finding comfort in her embrace.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

           The sun rises as the city of brotherly love wakes up.
           INT. PHILADELPHIA GREYHOUND TERMINAL - MORNING

           Terry enters the terminal, a cup of coffee in his hand.

           He is on his way to get his bus, but he stops when he sees-

           -Jasper sitting on a nearby bench with his backpack.  His 
           eyes are puffy and his demeanor is defeated, the absolute 
           embodiment of neglect.

                                 TERRY
                        Hey...Jasper?

           Jasper doesn’t even look up at him.

           Terry walks over to him, kneels down.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Are you okay, buddy?

           Jasper shakes his head “no.”

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        You want to talk to me about it?

           Jasper shakes his head “no.”  Pause.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        You want to take a ride today, keep 
                        me company?

           Jasper finally looks up at him.  Nods yes.

           Terry forces a smile.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        Okay.

           Terry stands up.  Jasper joins him.

           They walk towards the bus.  Terry rubs Jasper’s head.

                                 TERRY (cont’d)
                        It’ll be all right, son.  We’ll 
                        figure something out.

           They reach the door that leads to the passenger loading area.

           Terry holds it open.  Jasper walks through.

           Terry follows him.  The door closes.

           FADE OUT.
           THE END.
