           Space. Magical, dark and lonely.

                              “9 YEARS AGO” 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Navajo-1 to Base. Successful detach 
                        from Shuttle Endeavour. Proceeding 
                        to objective: Sprut-Vosem.

           A SPACE ORBITAL POD comes into frame, then SHOOTS off toward 
           the abandoned SOVIET SPACE STATION: SPRUT-VOSEM.

                                 TOM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Boosters fired. E.T.A.: 9 hours. 

                                 BASE (V.O.)
                         (relaxed)
                        Alright, Tom. Kicking you over to 
                        Communications just to keep you 
                        company. We’ll be back on-line when 
                        you attach. Don’t get too lonely up 
                        there.

           We SWIRL around the pod and catch a glimpse of EARTH as it 
           drifts farther and farther away from us.

           INT. SPACE ORBITAL POD - SAME

           A small space pod. TOM ROBERTS (30’s, war hero, turned down a 
           spot on The Real World - basically he’s awesome) glances out 
           through the PORTHOLE window as Earth fades away.

                                 TOM
                         (laughs)
                        Think I can handle it. 

           Tom picks up a STUFFED ANIMAL. A dog in an ASTRONAUT SUIT 
           with a plastic SPACE HELMET. Around his neck is a CD JEWEL 
           CASE - pink and decorated with butterfly stickers. 

           An inscription on the case written in black sharpie reads...

                           To my big brother Tom: 
                            Have a safe flight... 
                       Love, your ‘baby sis’, Olivia.

           Tom smiles and settles in for his flight. The stuffed dog 
           stares back at Tom with his puppy dog face.

           TEXAS - LATER

           The Communications Hub is a zoo of activity. Communications 
           Specialists speak at stations all over the room. 

           RACHEL (20’s, redhead, could care less) stands over SARAH 
           SPARKS, (20’s, I’s dotted and T’s crossed). Today is Sarah’s 
           first day.

                                 RACHEL
                        So this is your station. Usually 
                        they just start you off with 
                        something simple, like your mission 
                        today, but eventually you’ll be 
                        running communication for all kinds 
                        of things - satellite launches, 
                        working with the NWS, maybe even a 
                        shuttle launch. 

           Sarah give her a look.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be nervous. You were top of 
                        your class.

                        They make us say that.

                                 SARAH
                        Great.

                                 RACHEL
                        You signed up for the 401(k), 
                        right?

                                 SARAH
                        Should I?

                                 RACHEL
                        Uh, yeah... in 10 years stocks 
                        prices are gonna be through the 
                        roof and we’ll all be living on 
                        private islands.  

           Rachel motions at the GREEN light blinking at Sarah’s 
           station.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Green means talk.
                         (BEAT)
                        It’s okay. You’ll do fine.

           Rachel exits. 
           Sarah puts on her headset. She’s new, but was trained well. 
           She flips a few switches and assumes a professional position.

                                 SARAH
                        Just following the manual, Sir.

                                 TOM
                        Does the manual allow you to tell 
                        me your name?

                        So what are we gonna’ talk about 
                        for nine hours, Sarah? 

           Sarah considers this.

                                 SARAH
                        That’s up to you, Sir.

                        How about you pick?

                                 SARAH
                        The weather?

                                 TOM
                        I’m in space. Looks pretty clear 
                        and calm. 

                                 SARAH
                        Baseball?

                                 TOM
                        Hate baseball.

                         (to herself)
                        Thank God.
                         (to Tom)
                        Maybe politics?

                                 TOM
                        In the history of the world, no 
                        political discussion has ever ended 
                        well.

                                 SARAH
                        Okay. How about this: Music?

                                 TOM
                        Music’s good. I could do music.

                                 SARAH
                        Alrighty then...

           Tom has his feet up on the control board. Sarah is surrounded 
           by empty diet coke cans and M&M wrappers.
                                 TOM
                        No way.

                                 SARAH
                        Yes, way! Okay, see, at the time 
                        Elton John has like a real problem - 
                        I’m talking drugs, booze, pills - 
                        you name it, he was snorting it.

                                 TOM
                        It was the 70’s.

                                 SARAH
                        Exactly. So anyway the guy is lost 
                        and really wants to come down to be 
                        with his family but he has no 
                        control over the drugs, right? 

                                 TOM
                        That’s why he’s all ‘I think it’s 
                        gonna be a long, long time.’

                                 SARAH
                        Exactly.

                                 TOM
                        I can’t believe this whole time I 
                        thought it was just about an 
                        astronaut.

                                 SARAH
                        Who wants to hear a song about some 
                        astronaut?

                                 TOM
                        They’re so boring...

                                 SARAH
                        So anyway, it’s sad because in the 
                        end he just resigns himself to 
                        being alone forever. 

                                 TOM
                        What’s so bad about that?

                                 SARAH
                        Being alone forever? Eventually you 
                        need someone.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not true. 

                                 SARAH
                        Of course it’s true.

                                 TOM
                        Not for me.
                                 SARAH
                        How do you know?

                                 TOM
                        Because I know.

                                 SARAH
                        How old are you?

                                 TOM
                        Thirty-one.

                                 SARAH
                        Figures. You’ll learn.

                                 TOM
                        Really? How old are you?

                                 SARAH
                         (without irony)
                        Twenty-five. 

           Tom laughs.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Nothing.

                                 SARAH
                        You’ll see. One day the soulmate 
                        you’re destined to be with will 
                        just show up and you’ll know. It’s 
                        called fate for a reason.

                                 TOM
                        Oh see, now that is just so 
                        ridiculous. It’s just what people 
                        tell themselves because the truth 
                        is soul-crushing and they can’t 
                        handle it. 

                                 SARAH
                        What is the truth we can’t handle?

                                 TOM
                        That statistically speaking, your 
                        soul mate is more likely to live in 
                        China or India and you will never 
                        meet them. Ever.

                                 SARAH
                        If it’s meant to be, they will come 
                        for you.
                                 TOM
                        What if your soul mate is in 
                        prison. Prison for life.  

                                 SARAH
                        My soul mate is not in prison. And 
                        if he was, I would be fine with it 
                        and we would - by some twist of 
                        fate - meet and fall in love and  
                        write beautiful letters to each 
                        other every day. He would spend his 
                        days educating himself and pining 
                        for me while I spent my days 
                        clearing his name and petitioning 
                        the Governor for his pardon.

                                 TOM
                        Wow.

                        Look at the facts. You ask any 
                        person anywhere who’s ever been in 
                        love and they will have a story of 
                        how their car broke down, or they 
                        weren’t gonna’ go back for that 
                        muffin at Starbucks, or how they 
                        were gonna take Psych 101 but it 
                        was full so they ended up taking 
                        History 102 and, voila!... their 
                        one true love is sitting right next 
                        to them and they live happily ever 
                        after. Hence, fate.

                                 TOM
                        That’s called coincidence.

                        for you: It can’t. Which is why

                        coming into my room and telling me 
                        that he went away to heaven. I

                        my Mom just started crying and

                        I think I got it. 

           Tom spots something.

           Tom’s Space-orbital pod is slowing but instead of heading for 
           the dock it’s moving toward one of the main SOLAR PANEL

                        Tom. What is it?

                        He must be a really great guy.

                        Can you tell him that someone far, 
                        far away thinks he might just be 
                        the luckiest guy on earth-

                        Goddamnit where are they?!

           Tom watches as the pod moves toward the wing. He’s gonna’ try 
           to float out in his suit before it hits.

                                 TOM
                        Here goes.

           Sarah is basically jamming the help button, crying.

                        Sarah. Can you do something else

           flash for a SECOND, and then debris shoots off in straight

           but just as powerful.

           the body of Sprut-Vosem. He’s just a ping-pong ball out here.

           She basically looks the same, maybe a line here or there, but 
           just as adorable and all done up for a date.

                                 SARAH
                        Are you sure? No. It gets weird.

                        You’re right. That’s super-weird.

           They both laugh. It seems to be going really well.

           Sarah pulls out her iPhone and scrolls through photos of a 
           young boy. This is EVAN, age 7.

                        Halloween but then at the last 
                        minute he decided he also wanted to 
                        be a chicken so I guess he’s like 
                        chicken-superman? I’m not really 
                        sure.

           As Sarah looks at the pics she gets lost a little bit. It’s 
           clear Evan is her world.

                        Evan found this raccoon outside and

                        Um. Do you want to come in for a

                        It’s okay if you don’t. I mean, 
                        it’s late.

                                 KEVIN
                        I think I should probably get home.

           Sarah knows the deal.

                                 SARAH
                        Sure. Of course. Absolutely.

           She gets out. No kiss.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Okay, bye.
           Kevin smiles and then drives off. Sarah looks back, composes 
           herself, and then heads inside.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - EVAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           A boy’s bedroom. Blue. Magical. Space toys everywhere.

           Sarah enters, kneels down beside Evan (7) and kisses him on 
           the forehead. 

                                 EVAN
                        How’d that one work out?

                                 SARAH
                        You should be asleep.
                         (then)
                        Not so great.

                                 EVAN
                        He didn’t want to kiss with you?

                                 SARAH
                        No. He didn’t want to kiss with me.

           Evan flips over and faces away from Sarah.

                                 EVAN
                        Because of me, right?

                                 SARAH
                        Evan. Don’t ever think that. 
                        Sometimes... sometimes it just 
                        doesn’t work out between two 
                        adults. 

                                 EVAN
                        Like you and Dad?

                                 SARAH
                        Well, yes. And your dad is a great 
                        guy. But sometimes it just doesn’t 
                        work out. But look up there.

           Sarah points to Evan’s ceiling: tons of glow-in-the-dark 
           stars.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Remember how I told you the world 
                        is filled with millions of 
                        wonderful people just waiting to be 
                        your friend-

                                 EVAN
                        Grandpa said that was bullshit-

                                 SARAH
                        Don’t listen to your Grandpa.
                         (BEAT)
                        - well, the same goes for Moms. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SARAH (CONT'D)
                        One day my star, maybe that one, 
                        will meet up with another star and-
                         (sighs)
                        Oh, your Grandpa’s right... total 
                        b.s. But at least I have my little 
                        guy.

           Evan smiles.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Now go to sleep.

           Evan flops his head over and closes his eyes. Sarah takes one 
           last glance at her son before she exits.

           KITCHEN - LATER

           An older man sits at the kitchen table, surrounded by what 
           looks like radio-parts and rolled up blueprints. This is 
           Sarah’s father, GRANDPA TED, 60’s.

                                 GRANDPA TED 
                         (without looking up)
                        How’d that one work out?

           Sarah grabs a glass of water.

                                 SARAH
                        Great guy. Nice job. Not ready to 
                        deal with a kid. 

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Well then he’s a piece of shit.

                                 SARAH
                        Dad. You have to stop cursing 
                        around Evan.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        What? He’s seven years old.

                                 SARAH
                        And the guy wasn’t a piece of shit. 
                        He was perfectly nice.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        If he doesn’t want to date my 
                        daughter then he’s a piece of shit.
                         (THEN)
                        You at least make out with him?

                                 SARAH
                        Dad!

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        I don’t understand your generation.

           Sarah catches her reflection in the kitchen window as she 
           puts her glass away.
                                 SARAH
                        When you and Mom first met... how 
                        did you know?

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        How’d I know what?

                                 SARAH
                        That she was The One.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Easy. We talked for hours. When you 
                        can talk to someone for three hours 
                        about the best roast beef sandwich 
                        in Chicago... you know.

           Sarah considers this, maybe more than it warrants.

                                 GRANDPA TED (CONT’D)
                        She was working at Berghoff’s as a 
                        waitress and I came in one day. I’d 
                        never met a woman as smart as her. 
                        I didn’t even like their food but I 
                        kept coming back. Every Thursday 
                        night. I’d move if I didn’t get her 
                        table. Used to piss off the other 
                        waitresses. 

           Sarah laughs.

                                 GRANDPA TED (CONT’D)
                        And then one day I came in and they 
                        said she left. No help, they were. 
                        But you know what. Exactly a week 
                        later... the very next Thursday 
                        night... I was walking on campus 
                        and there she was.
                         (BEAT)
                        When you’re meant to be, the 
                        universe finds a way.

           Sarah finds this at once incredibly romantic and also 
           incredibly depressing.

                                 SARAH
                        Alright, Dad. Night shift. Check in 
                        on him for me, okay?

           Sarah kisses her father on the cheek and heads out. 

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Chin up. You’ll find the right one. 
                        That guy was a piece of shit.
                         (back to work)
                        Still, you should’ve at least 
                        gotten some tongue.

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Sarah drives, listening to the radio.
                                 PARANORMAL RADIO CALLER
                        Dr. Mebane, first time caller, long 
                        time listener. I was wondering how 
                        you feel tonight’s solar event will 
                        effect those of us who have been 
                        visited by our inter-planetary 
                        brethren?

           Sarah rolls her eyes.

                                 SARAH
                         (to herself)
                        Uh, you’ll probably still be crazy?

                                 DR. MEBANE
                        That’s a great question. You see 
                        the US gov’t. would have us believe 
                        that these events will have only a 
                        minor impact on electronic devices, 
                        such as cell phones, satellites and 
                        the like. 

                                 PARANORMAL RADIO CALLER
                        Um-hmm.

                                 DR. MEBANE
                        But you an I both know the real 
                        truth is that these solar events 
                        are actually caused by the Air 
                        Force - and this has been 
                        documented many, many times - as a 
                        means of erasing the evidence of a 
                        post-human life form visit-

           Sarah turns the radio off.

           EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - NIGHT

           Sarah pulls up and parks her car. She gets out and glances up 
           at the stars before flashing her badge for a Security Guard 
           and heading inside.

           It is kind of a magical night...

           EXT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - NIGHT

           The old Soviet Space Station floats along. Still dark, still  
           lonely.

           A SOLAR WIND swirls around the Space Station.

           We move in through the porthole window...

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           A series of shots... 9 years has taken its toll:
           - Parts, wires, tubes are everywhere. Every possible option 
           of fixing the Sprut-Vosem Return Pod has clearly been tried.

           - PRISONER SLASHES on the wall marking 9 years.

           - The SPACE DOG STUFFED ANIMAL.

           - The CD (the one from 2004 with butterfly stickers all over 
           it.) 

           A HAND removes the CD, pops it into a portable CD player, and 
           hits... 

           ...PLAY 

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Ready? I want 100 percent focus 
                        this time, Demitri... Okay, here we 
                        go.

           Shania Twain’s “Man, I feel Like a Woman,” ramps up (...don’t 
           judge, his little sister made the mix tape.) 

           And then we see him:

           Tom SLIDES into frame. 

           Still handsome, but with messier hair and a beard. He holds a 
           bottle of vodka as a microphone.

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN
                         (singing)
                        Let's go girls! Come on.

           And then Tom begins an ELABORATE DANCE routine. He’s had 9 
           years to perfect it, so it’s pretty damn good.

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN (CONT’D)
                        I'm going out tonight-I'm feelin' 
                        alright...

           Tom gives the Glee kids a run for their money: twirling, 
           whirling... somersaults. He’s AWESOME. 

           The Space Dog looks on with blank expressions:  This is now 
           Tom’s best friend, DEMITRI (ageless, quiet, supportive.)

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE STATION - SAME

           Sarah enters the empty communications room. It’s changed in 
           nine years. The buzz of activity is gone. It’s a little worn, 
           a little rough around the edges. 

           Sarah puts down her purse, and pauses as she hears...

                                 TOM /SHANIA TWAIN (V.O.)
                        The best thing about being a woman/
                        Is the prerogative to have a little 
                        fun...
           She ZEROES in on a GREEN blinking light at her station: what 
           the hell?

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom steadies himself for the chorus as he eyes a SWITCH, 
           labeled in Russian. 

           SUDDENLY, Tom’s routine has taken to the air. He’s flipped 
           the ANTI-GRAVITY switch. His moves take on a whole new level 
           of awesome as he’s gone full on Risky Business, but in mid-
           air.

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN
                        Oh, oh, oh,/ go totally crazy-
                        forget I'm a lady... 

           Tom SLIDES across the “air.”

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN (CONT’D)
                        Short skirts...

           Tom does some “Saturday Night Fever.”

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN (CONT’D)
                        Color my hair/ Do what I dare...

           A little air-tumble... no big deal.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE STATION - SAME

           Sarah sits at her desk, staring in awe at her communications 
           system... 

                                 TOM /SHANIA TWAIN (V.O.)
                        The best thing about being a woman/
                        Is the prerogative to have a little 
                        fun!

           Sarah presses the ‘SPEAK” button and adjust her headset.

                                 SARAH
                        Hello?
                         (BEAT)
                        Hello? 

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom goes in for his finale: a triple anti-gravity-lutz.

                                 TOM/SHANIA TWAIN 
                        Man, I feel like a woman! 

           Tom bows, hits the anti-gravity switch and falls to the 
           ground.
                                 TOM
                        Hi-five, Demitri.

           Demitri stares back at him: I only have paws, dude.

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Hello? Is someone...
                         (can’t believe herself)
                        ..singing old Shania Twain songs on 
                        my line?

           Tom stops everything. 

                                 SARAH (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Who is this? Is someone 
                        there?

           Tom rushes to the communications desk: HOLY SHIT, A HUMAN 
           VOICE.

                                 TOM
                         (some static)
                        Is this... a human person? 

           [CUT BACK AND FORTH]

                                 SARAH
                        Rachel? Are you and Carl messing 
                        with me again?

                                 TOM
                         (professional)
                        Sprut-Vosem to Base: I’m contacting 
                        you from space. This is Major Tom 
                        Roberts. The year is-

           Sarah sours. She’s pissed...

                                 SARAH
                        This isn’t funny, guys.

           Sarah clicks OFF her communications system and removes her 
           headset, stands up and walks out...

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom clicks the communications switch (which now glows GREEN) 

                                 TOM 
                        Hello? Hello?! Wait... come back. 

           Tom turns to Demitri: holy shit!

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hello?
                         (to Demitri)
                        A woman has contacted me, Demitri. 
                        Just as I said would happen.
                         (back to mic)
                        Hello? Hello? Please respond. Over.
           Nothing...

           INT. BREAK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rachel (we met her briefly 9 years ago) sits with her feet up 
           watching “Masterpiece” on PBS. British people raise eyebrows 
           at a dinner table.

           Sarah storms in.

                                 RACHEL
                         (rapt)
                        Hold on. The Footman just spilled 
                        pudding on Lady Edith.
                         (BEAT)
                        Oh, they’re totally gonna’ sex it 
                        up now.

                                 SARAH
                        That wasn’t funny.

                                 RACHEL
                         (hurt)
                        If you think I would ever joke 
                        about something as important as 
                        Lady Edith’s love life than you 
                        don’t know me. 

           Rachel gets up for a Coke Zero, stares back at Sarah...

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        ...don’t know me at all.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m talking about Tom. It wasn’t 
                        funny.

                                 RACHEL
                        Tom? 

                                 SARAH
                        I just heard Tom on my line. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Huh? Where are we now? Because I’m 
                        here in reality drinking a Coke 
                        Zero. Where are you?

                                 SARAH
                        Nine years ago. Sprut-Vosem. He 
                        died. Tom Roberts.

           Rachel stands up and hugs Sarah.

                                 RACHEL
                        Talk to me. How long has it been 
                        since you’ve gotten laid?

                                 SARAH
                        Rachel. 
                                 RACHEL
                        An astronaut who died almost ten 
                        years ago called you up from space? 
                        Just ‘Hey gurl, wat up? Haven’t 
                        seen u in a while. Hit me back, k?’

                                 SARAH
                        I heard him. He was singing...  
                         (then, insecure)
                        ...Shania Twain.

           Rachel sits Sarah down like a sick child.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay, okay. What about Carl?

           They glance outside to CARL, a fellow NASA co-worker.

                                 SARAH
                        Rachel.

                                 RACHEL
                        What? I’d do Carl.

                                 SARAH
                        That’s because you have no 
                        standards.

                                 RACHEL
                        Having standards is just another 
                        way of saying ‘I’m still not ready 
                        to let love into my life.’ 
                         (THEN)
                        Look, you probably just fell asleep 
                        and had a dream. It happens. Last 
                        night I had an erotic encounter 
                        with Morgan Freeman and a Mer-man.
                         (BEAT)
                        I’m working that out with my 
                        therapist tomorrow.

                                 SARAH
                         (questioning)
                        But it just felt so real.

                                 RACHEL
                        So did Morgan. 
                         (BEAT)
                        Sarah. Remember how you told me all 
                        your boyfriends in college turned 
                        out to be gay?

                                 SARAH
                        So weird, right?

                                 RACHEL
                        We’ve all been there. People like 
                        the unavailable. Guys too. My 
                        little brother, bless his ugly 
                        heart, tried to pick up on a Dallas 
                        Cowboy cheerleader the other night. 
                                 SARAH
                        Noah? Ouch.

                                 RACHEL
                        It wasn’t pretty to watch.
                         (BEAT)
                        They’re unavailable so we want them 
                        more. Your ghost-astronaut is the 
                        cowboy cheerleader in this-   

                                 SARAH
                        I got the metaphor.

                                 RACHEL
                        Good. Now c’mon. Let me be the best 
                        friend you deserve and allow you to 
                        take me to Denny’s.

           Sarah smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        I have to take Evan to his 
                        father’s.

           Sarah exits. Back on “Masterpiece,” British people KISS.

                                 RACHEL
                         (to the TV)
                        Lady Edith, you slut! Well, now 
                        you’ll never be received by the 
                        best families in London.

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - SAME

           Sarah enters the empty room, looks at her station, pauses: 
           Maybe I made it all up.

           Still, she walks over to her station. The button glows: 
           yellow.

                                 SARAH
                         (quiet)
                        Tom?

           Nothing. 

           Sarah pauses, hovers her finger over the talk button again: 
           Maybe it was him?

           But then pulls her finger away: Stop, I’m just being crazy.

           Sarah grabs her coat, shakes her head and exits.

           She doesn’t see, but the light then turns to green just as 
           she leaves.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - BATHROOM - LATER

           Tom, shirtless, stares at the mirror, using scissors to cut 
           off his beard. 
           Demitri, sits on the shelf in front of the mirror. He’s is 
           usual, Russian, emotionless, non-talkative, inanimate object-
           self.

                                 TOM
                        You sure about this? I feel like 
                        women like a man with a beard?

           Demitri doesn’t respond... hard to read some guys.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        No, no. You’re right. Clean shaven 
                        at first, then some stubble as we 
                        get more comfortable.

           Tom continues shaving.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. We’ve been over this a 
                        thousand times, Demitri. Fresh 
                        breath... check. Don’t talk too 
                        much... check... What was the other  
                        one?

           Demitri is not pleased.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, yeah. 

           Tom is done cutting off the long parts of his beard and 
           begins to shave for real.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Smile. Always smile on the first 
                        date. 
                         (BEAT)
                        Wait. Who pays? Do you think the 
                        guy still pays? Or is that 
                        considered presumptuous now?... 
                        Okay, okay. I’ll pay. It’s just 
                        been so long, man. I’m rusty.

           Tom cleans off the razor.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I know. I know. I’ll stop. I’m just 
                        being negative and I should think 
                        positive.

           Tom splashes on some after shave. It stings.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        But what if she doesn’t like me?... 
                        I mean, I have a strong personality 
                        and that can be a turn off. And 
                        sometimes I wear socks to bed.

           Demitri seems to agree.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Those little things can add up. I 
                        don’t know. Maybe this isn’t such a 
                        good idea...
                         (off Demitri)
                        No. No you’re right. Confident. Be 
                        confident, Tom. She’s gonna’ love 
                        me. 

           Tom picks up Demitri.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        A date, Demitri! A date! 
                         (re: his clean face)
                        What do you think?

           Demitri stares.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Thanks, little guy.

           Tom pats Demitri on his plastic helmet, stands up and puts on 
           his undershirt. He picks up Demitri and heads to the 
           Communications station

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Do you think she’ll be able to 
                        bring us home?... of course I won’t 
                        bring it up first thing... I mean, 
                        I want to get to know the girl 
                        first, you know... Oh man, great 
                        day, Demitri... GREAT day.

           Tom SMILES broadly at Demitri, fully committed. 

           We move in close on Demitri’s puppy-face: the guy’s lost it.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Evan spins on the playground round-about. Sarah hands Evan’s 
           Wolverine backpack to STEVE, her ex husband. 

                                 SARAH
                        I put the permission slip in there. 
                        Oh, and he has the dentist-

                                 STEVE
                        -dentist at 4. I got it. 

           Sarah smiles. It’s not acrimonious between them, just 
           awkward.

                                 SARAH
                        How are you? 

                                 STEVE
                        Good. I’m really good.

                        fad-diet train are over. Her latest 
                        one is the spoon diet. She only 
                        eats food you can pick up with a 
                        spoon.

                        You can pick up any food with a 
                        spoon.

                                 SARAH
                        Rachel and the concept of ‘logic’ 
                        aren’t really best friends.

           Steve laughs.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m glad you’re good.

           Sarah smiles, but also crosses her arms. 

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Evan! Say goodbye to your mom.

           Evan stops spinning, regains his ground and runs over and 
           hugs his mom. This is all pretty normal for him.

                                 SARAH
                        I’ll pick you up on Sunday, okay.

                                 EVAN
                        Okay.

           Sarah kisses Evan and sends him off with Steve. The two race 
           off into the playground where Steve spins Evan super fast on 
           the roundabout.

           Before she gets into her car, Sarah turns back and watches 
           Evan and his dad play together. Evan loves it.

           Sarah considers this.

                        It’s a book I’m reading.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom’s hair is parted nicely, ready at a moments notice for 
           his ‘date.’ He speaks in hushed tones to Demitri, in the 

           BEDROOM CAPSULE -

                                 TOM
                         (to Demitri)
                        Shh. She’ll hear you, Demitri.

           Demitri sits on a shelf. His puppy dog eyes are fixed, yet 
           attentive

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I know I know but it will be 
                        different this time... I hear 
                        you... you said ‘Tom, she’s 
                        trouble’ and I didn’t listen to 
                        you. Okay. I’ll say it. “You were, 
                        right, Demitri.”

           Demitri shakes his head: I told you so.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Alright, alright you don’t have to 
                        gloat.

           Demitri sits there.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Yes you did. You mumbled ‘I told 
                        you so,” under your breath.

           Demitri: I said no such thing.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I’m not crazy. I heard an ‘I told 
                        you so.” 

           Demitri remains stoic.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Look bud, you gotta understand a 
                        man gets lonely sometimes.

           Demitri: I’m just a stuffed dog, man.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Well that’s a not a fair 
                        accusation, Demitri... We hang out 
                        all the time.

           Demitri still just sits on that shelf.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        So that’s what this is about. 
                        You’re jealous.

           Demitri stares emotionless: I am NOT jealous.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I’m just saying it sounds like this 
                        is coming from a place of jealousy 
                        to me... 

           Demitri cannot believe this shit. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Alright, alright. Calm down, dude. 
                        Look... Demitri. Buddy. You’re my 
                        best friend. No girl will ever 
                        change that... 

           Demitri looks at Tom.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Are we cool?

           Demitri says nothing.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, man. Are we cool?

           Tom picks up Demitri. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Thata’ boy! Now let’s get in 
                        there... 

           Tom heads into the main-

           CONTROL CENTER -

           - and sits down at the communications station, smooths down 
           his hair and checks his breath: I’m ready.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - HOUSTON, 
           TEXAS - SAME

           Sarah isn’t alone now. She works alongside CARL, (30’s, 
           follows Sarah Michelle Gellar on Twitter.)

                                 CARL
                        Hey.

           Sarah looks over at Carl and smiles: ugh.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You look pretty today. 

                                 SARAH
                        Thanks?

           Sarah notices the same green light on the channel she heard 
           Tom blinks.  
                                 CARL

                                 SARAH
                        Great?

           Sarah looks back at the blinking green light... thinks about 
           flipping the ‘TALK” switch, then ignores it. He’s not real.

                                 CARL
                        So I was wondering, you know, we’ve 
                        been working together for a while 
                        and-

                         (sensing what’s coming)
                        Carl. I don’t think that would-

                        I mean, you’re sweet but-

                                 CARL
                        You don’t think she’d just go on 
                        one date with me? Not even one?

                                 SARAH
                         (realizing, relieved)
                        Oh! Rachel? Yes. Of course she 
                        would. 
                         (BEAT)
                        I thought you were gonna’ ask me.

                                 CARL
                        Uh... no.

           Sarah doesn’t know if she should be offended or what so... 

                                 SARAH
                         (re: the green light)

                        cuts. Let me.

           Carl bangs on the communications desk. It turns yellow.

                                 SARAH
                         (’it’s all in my head’)
                        I need to get a Coke.

                        No, I don’t know.

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, you’re happy being alone. 

                                 SARAH
                        Is that what people think? That I’m 
                        just the ‘alone girl?’

                                 RACHEL
                        No. I mean... yes. It’s a 
                        compliment. You don’t need anyone. 
                        We respect that.

                                 RACHEL (CONT'D)
                         (BEAT)
                        You’re not mad, are you?

           Sarah thinks.

                                 SARAH
                        Maybe you’re right. I’ve tried but 
                        you know... it’s just not in the 
                        cards for some people. So maybe 
                        you’re right...

           Rachel nods.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        And then there’s Evan... guys find 
                        out I have a seven year old and 
                        they’re either out the door or they 
                        think ‘cool, someone to play catch 
                        with’ and then they’re out the door 
                        the minute they realize playing 
                        catch is like .005 percent of 
                        raising a kid. The last guy... 
                        remember Pete? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Loved Pete.

                                 SARAH
                        Great. Pete was great. 

                                 RACHEL
                        So great.

                                 SARAH
                        And Evan thought he was great. And 
                        then it didn’t work out. Well, 
                        guess who Evan talks about all the 
                        time? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Pete.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s not good for him, Rachel. He 
                        gets attached and then they’re just 
                        gone. ‘When’s Pete coming back 
                        over, Mom?’ And it’s my fault. No 
                        one else’s. I can’t do this to him 
                        anymore. I had all these great 
                        plans and this is where I end up?  
                        But instead of fighting it, I need 
                        to accept it. So right here, right 
                        now in the parking lot of The 
                        Galaxy Diner I declare I’m done. 
                        And I’m happy about it. I really 
                        am. But I’m done. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Done?

                                 SARAH
                        Done? I don’t need anyone. 
                                 RACHEL
                        Sure?

                                 SARAH
                        Positive.

                                 RACHEL
                         (deathly serious)
                        Because The Galaxy Diner parking 
                        lot is a parking lot of truth.

           Sarah laughs, then starts her car.

                                 SARAH
                        Positive. You’re right. I’m fine 
                        with being by myself and I don’t 
                        need anyone.

           Sarah drives off.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sarah enters. It’s dark, save for some science program on TV. 
           Evan is asleep on Grandpa Ted’s lap (who is also asleep.)

           Sarah smiles.

           EXT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           So lonely. But the stars in the distance sparkle just a 
           little brighter tonight.

           EXT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - NIGHT

           Sarah arrives for the night shift.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - HALLWAY

           Sarah walks down a long hallway. Nobody. Just a JANITOR.

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - SAME

           Sarah enters, puts down her purse and sits down. 

           THE GREEN LIGHT blinks.

           She presses the ‘TALK’ button.

                                 SARAH
                        Hello?

           Nothing.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Hello? 
           Still blinking green.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION/ INT. JOHNSON SPACE STATION - 
           SAME

           The Sprut-Vosem Communications light blinks green as well. We 
           track back to Tom, passed out in his bed, holding Demitri 
           like a teddy bear.

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Um, I don’t know if anyone can hear 
                        me but since you’re probably not 
                        real I figured you’d be the perfect 
                        person to talk to. And I’m not in 
                        the best place right now, so 
                        telling my problems to a space 
                        ghost seems like a pretty good idea 
                        to me.

           Sarah looks behind her again: I look insane, but screw it.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        So here goes...

           LATER -

           Sarah keeps going. She doesn’t necessarily believe or really 
           care if anyone really is listening... just more catharsis.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I never had that at all with Steve. 
                        He was great and all -

           Tom slowly wakes up and eyes the GREEN blinking light. He 
           races over and sits down.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        But then I spent that night with 
                        you. 

           Tom is about to press the button. Stops. Doesn’t want to ruin 
           this....

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        And then I thought ‘oh, this is 
                        what it feels like.’ Because they 
                        don’t teach you, you know. And it 
                        sounds so crazy, which is why I 
                        never told anyone because it’s 
                        crazy to say ‘I just fell in love 
                        with someone I’ve never met and 
                        only talked to for nine hours.’ But 
                        it was real. And it was the best 
                        nine hours of my life. 

           Tom is riveted.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        And then you died. 
                         (BEAT)
                        And I was engaged and once you get 
                        on that train it just -

           Tom leans in and presses the “TALK” button.

                                 TOM
                        I didn’t die, Sarah.

           Sarah scoots away from her station, stunned.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I made it into the air-lock. The 
                        explosion knocked out all 
                        communications but then somehow it 
                        got kicked back on the other night. 
                        That’s when you heard me.

           Sarah is speechless.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Still want soup for your last meal?

                                 SARAH
                        It is you.

                                 TOM
                        In the flesh. 

                                 SARAH
                        I-I... are you okay?

                                 TOM
                        My best friend is stuffed dog named 
                        Demitri but other than that I think 
                        I’m good.

           Sarah laughs.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        So, got any plans for the next nine 
                        hours?

           Sarah stands up...

                                 SARAH
                         (determined)
                        Yes. I’m bringing you home.

           Sarah PRESSES the ALARM. 

           MOMENTS LATER -

           A FEW TECHIES, led by EDWARD (30’s) STARE at the 
           communications system.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Tom. Come in.
           BEAT... 

           ...and then...

                                 TOM
                        Major Tom Roberts to Base. Over.

                                 EDWARD
                        Holy shit.

           Sarah smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        He’s alive. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I think we’re gonna’ need to wake 
                        up Bill.

           OFF EVERYONE - The look on the Techie’s faces says everything 
           we need to know about this “Bill” fellow.

           INT. BILL SANDERSON’S HOUSE - SAME

           CLOSE ON - A GIANT BOAR’S HEAD, mounted to the wall. We move 
           down past a row of antique RIFLES and finally to a snoring 
           hulk of a man, and his sleeping WIFE. This is BILL SANDERSON, 
           NASA CHIEF (50’s, seen Unforgiven 108 times.)

           A RED PHONE next to him rings. He startles awake.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                         (groggy)

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - LATER 

           Sanderson, cup of coffee in hand, stands with Edward and 
           Sarah. 

                                 SARAH
                        You just press this button and 
                        talk.

                                 BILL SANDERSON

                        Sanderson. Chief Administrator of 
                        NASA. Come in.

           ...NOTHING.

           Sanderson looks to Sarah.

                         (into Mic)

                        It will work.

           Bill recovers from his shock...

                        Uh... good to hear your voice.

           Sanderson clicks off the Mic so Tom can’t hear.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Anybody got any bright ideas? Now 
                        would be the time-

           SATELLITE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sanderson, Edward, Sarah and a few Techies are in a high tech 
           room with GIANT LCD SCREENS EVERYWHERE. SATELLITE IMAGES of 
           SPRUT-VOSEM swirl around the screens.
                                 EDWARD
                        So Sprut-Vosem is here. 

           We swirl over on the LCD SCREEN to another SPACE STATION.

                                 SANDERSON
                        We don’t have any of our guys up 
                        there right now.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well no, not since they dismantled 
                        the Shuttle Program.  

                                 SANDERSON
                        Right.

                                 SARAH
                        Couldn’t we send an unmanned-

                                 SANDERSON
                         (disgusted, almost to 
                          himself)
                        For the first time since the 60’s 
                        the United States of America 
                        officially has no way to get into 
                        space. 

           The team takes this (actual truth) in.

                                 EDWARD
                         (pointing to the ISS)
                        True. But there are three 
                        Australians up on the International 
                        Space Station. Technically, one of 
                        them could man the ISS’s Rover over 
                        to Sprut-Vosem. 

           [note: we see a computer model of Edward’s proposed plan as 
           he speaks.]

                                 SARAH
                        Well let’s do that, then.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sarah. This really isn’t a 
                        Communications Department issue 
                        anymore. We can handle-

                                 SANDERSON
                        She stays.

                                 EDWARD
                        Okay. But it’s not that simple. 
                        Sprut-Vosem is old technology. So 
                        there’s nowhere for the ISS Rover 
                        to dock.
                                 TECHIE #1
                        Tom would have to suit-up and float 
                        out to the Rover’s air-lock. 
                        Assuming his suit is still intact.

                                 EDWARD
                        That’s a big assumption. 

                                 TECHIE #2
                        We can slow the Rover down to two 
                        knots and that’s about it. Which 
                        gives us about 26 seconds for Tom 
                        to float out. The Rover needs to be 
                        as close to Sprut-Vosem as possible 
                        which, in space, is incredibly 
                        dangerous. 

                                 SANDERSON
                        I don’t know. Lost a man in ‘92 
                        that way.

                                 SARAH
                        Well, we have to do something.

                                 EDWARD
                        We’d be risking a man’s life.

           Sarah looks to everyone. They seem to agree.

                                 SARAH
                        So we just do nothing?

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m sorry, Sarah. We can’t risk one 
                        man’s life for another’s.

           Sanderson steps in.

                                 SANDERSON
                        Edward’s right. The smart thing to 
                        do would be to walk away. 

           Sarah is crushed.

                                 SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        But when I was in the Marines, we 
                        weren’t taught to do what was 
                        smart... we were taught to do what 
                        was right.

                                 TECHIE #1
                         (whispers to Techie #2)
                        Man-crush.

           Techie #2 nods in approval.

                                 SANDERSON
                         (taking charge)
                        Edward. Contact the ISS and get our 
                        guy. Systems: I want a full plan

                        Let’s make it happen, people.

                                 SARAH
                        Sir. Is there anything I can do?

                                 SANDERSON
                        Yeah... Go keep Major Tom company. 

           OFF SARAH, THRILLED...

           Sarah is alone, talking with Tom. Tom is ecstatic, packing up 
           things left and right.

                                 TOM
                        I’m really coming home.

           Tom is overcome with emotion. He almost doesn’t know how to 
           deal with it.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re coming home.

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s incredibly dangerous.
                                 WELLINGTON
                        Wouldn’t have it any other way.

           Tom and Sarah have both reverted to their former selves. This 
           is the first time in a while we’ve seen Sarah relaxed: adult-
           life is fading away, if just for a moment.

                        No worries, mate. I get to listen 
                        to Princess Lea and Hans Solo here.
                         (to Houston)
                        Hey... they can’t hear me can they?

                        Nope.

                                 JACK
                        Good because I wanted to ask you 
                        guys: are they, like, a thing?

                                 EDWARD
                         (uhhh..)
                        I don’t know.

                        ‘Cause they really need to get a

                        So the plane crashed on a tropical 
                        island and then they got chased by 
                        a polar bear?

                                 SARAH
                        And also this weird smoke monster 
                        thing. And then Hurley won the 
                        lotto. But that was after Locke was 
                        sketchy, but then he got not 
                        sketchy but then he got sketchy 
                        again.

                                 TOM
                        I’m so confused.
                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know why you’re not getting 
                        this?
                         (BEAT)
                        Fine, I’ll start again from the

           LATER-

           Sarah is snacking away and Tom is cleaning up the space 
           station as he talks.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Well that’s the thing. In like the 
                        50’s it was like a man does ‘this’ 
                        and a woman does ‘this’ and that’s 
                        that and everyone was happy.

                                 TOM
                        And on pills.

                                 SARAH
                        Even happier. But now I open my 
                        computer every day and there’s one 
                        article that’s like “Women love 
                        manly men,” but another that’s all 
                        “Women love manly women.” Or “Never 
                        get married before 30,” but also 
                        “If you’re not married before 30 
                        you have an increased risk of 
                        breast cancer.” “No sexting a guy 
                        until the third date,” but read 
                        this related article titled “15 
                        ways to sext a guy you just met.”
                         (BEAT)
                        It’s like the entire internet is 
                        written by the crazy lady who yells 
                        at me outside Target.  

                                 TOM
                        What’s sexting?

                                 SARAH
                        God, you’re so lucky.
                         (BEAT)
                        Do you realize we’ve been talking 
                        for eight hours straight? 

                                 TOM
                        No. I didn’t. 
                         (BEAT)
                        But that’s kind of the point, isn’t 
                        it?

           Sarah blushes.

                        Well, we met at school. All my 
                        friends used to call her Library 
                        Girl because she was kind of a 
                        nerd. She was beautiful but because 
                        she wore glasses they couldn’t see 
                        it.

                                 SARAH
                        You went to college in an 80’s 
                        movie?

                                 TOM
                        And then we graduated and dated and 
                        moved in together and then one day, 
                        she came home and just said she 
                        needed some ‘time apart.’

                                 SARAH
                        Then what happened?

                                 TOM
                        Technically I ‘died’ so, you know, 
                        she got that time apart.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, yeah.

                                 TOM
                        Thank, God. 
                         (BEAT, excited)
                        Wait. Play me some new music.

                                 SARAH
                        I have some good hip-hop.

                                 TOM
                        You listen to hip-hop?

                                 SARAH
                        What? A girl likes to keep it real 
                        every once in awhile.

                                 TOM
                        You just don’t seem like a hip-hop 
                        girl to me.
                                 SARAH
                        Well there’s a lot of me to 
                        discover, then, huh?

                                 TOM
                        Alright. Anything non-hip-hop?

                                 SARAH
                        Meh. There’s nothing good.

                                 TOM
                        Nothing good? No one has made a 
                        single good song in nine years? 

                                 SARAH
                        Not really.

                                 TOM
                        I have been trapped up here with 
                        only one CD put together by my 12 
                        year old sister so you can imagine 
                        what’s on it and you WILL find me 
                        one good song...

           Sarah laughs.

           LATER-

           Sarah holds her iPhone against the microphone. 

                                 SARAH
                        Ok. Here goes. This one is from 
                        like 2009, I think. 

           Tom closes his eyes. She presses play on The Generational’s 
           “When They Fight.”

           As the song continues...

           LATER -

           Tom, animated, tells the story of how he made it into Sprut-
           Vosem alive. Sarah is mesmerized. 

           LATER -

           Sarah checks in with Edward: on the LCD we can see the ISS 
           Rover is getting closer to Sprut-Vosem.

           LATER - 

           Sarah speaks, crying. Tom listens intently.

           LATER - 

           Tom is doing a chicken impression for some reason. 

           LATER - 

           Sarah sings along.
           LATER -

           Sarah talks again to Edward. He seems a bit annoyed with her 
           but she’s determined. 

           LATER - 

           Tom talks, but we move past him. Demitri is in the same place 
           he’s been in for awhile, neglected.

                                 TOM
                        That was amazing. You don’t know 
                        how great it feels to hear some new 
                        music. 

           Sarah smiles.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Can you play it again?

                         (blissful)
                        Here. Try this one...

           Sarah presses play on Sufjan Stevens “Chicago,” and adjusts 
           the mic.

           Tom listens to the music with his eyes closed.

           LATER - 

           We track into the Communications Room as the song continues.

           Sarah is asleep at her desk. Tom is also asleep... but 
           they’re as close as they can be, each holding on to the 
           microphones.

           LATER - Sarah gets up as the song continues and smiles...

                        they interview these women who have 
                        erotic encounters with the un-dead  
                        while they sleep. You know, like 
                        some lady in Oklahoma gets visited 
                        at night by like an 18th century 
                        British Lord or something and he 
                        just takes her and just turns her 
                        out and they just have like crazy-
                        hot ghost-sex. And so as I’m 
                        watching this I’m like... wait: 
                        ‘how come only super sexy ghosts

                        from the skeevy ghost from the 70’s 
                        who lives in a van? Do you want to 
                        know why, Sarah? Do you know why 
                        these ladies claim they only get 
                        freaked by sexy ghosts?

                                 TOM
                         (laughing)
                        Who are you?

                                 SARAH
                        What?

           The Techies smile at each other...

                                 SANDERSON
                        Ahem.

           The crew, embarrassed, gets back to work.

           LATER -

                                 TOM
                        You know my mom used to tell me you 
                        know you love someone when you can 
                        sit together for hours and not say 
                        a word. Just be.

           Sarah laughs.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        My dad says you know you’re in love 
                        when you can talk for hours. 

                                 TOM
                        Maybe they should date. 

           Sarah laughs...

                        Alright people, it’s go-time.

           Edward takes over.

                         (into mic)
                        Captain Wellington.

                                 JACK
                        Over.
                                 EDWARD
                        Major Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Over.

                                 EDWARD
                        Major Tom. You will have exactly a 
                        26 second window to float out to 
                        ISS ROVER. 

                                 TOM
                        Affirmative.

           CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE THREE.

                                 JACK
                        I see her.

                                 EDWARD
                        Commence slow down. 

                                 JACK
                        Affirmative. Two knots.

           Jack slows down his rover.

                                 EDWARD
                        ISS, you need to maneuver between 
                        solar wings 2 and 3. Get as close 
                        as possible so he can catch you.

           Jack spots the now MASSIVE SOLAR WINGS.

                                 JACK
                        Easy-peasy, mate.

                                 EDWARD
                        ISS, as soon as I give the go 
                        ahead, open your outer air-lock 
                        doors.

                                 JACK
                        Got it.

                                 EDWARD
                        Standby, Captain Wellington.

                                 TOM
                        Suiting up and standing by.

           Tom put on his Space Suit and spots Demitri staring at him 
           with his puppy dog eyes: Don’t leave me. 

           Tom ignores him.

                                 EDWARD
                         (on mic)

                        Be safe.

           AIR-LOCK - 

           Tom enters the air-lock all suited up.

           Tom presses the AIR-LOCK button....
           Nothing.

                                 EDWARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Tom? I need confirmation...

           He hits it again.

           Nothing...

           The Rover maneuvers between the tight solar wings. We see the

                        Negative.

           Tom jams it again. And again. Until finally...

           ISS ROVER -

           Jack is worried. Through the window we see he’s moving past 
           the Sprut-Vosem air-lock.

                                 JACK
                        Still negative...

           AND THEN, Tom appears, floating out.

           Tom floats toward the Rover. It’s gonna be close as the Rover 
           is moving fast from this vantage point. Tom struggles and 
           finally reaches out. He GRABS...

           The ISS AIR-LOCK just in time...

           BUT his hand SLIPS...

                        Tom?

           OUTSIDE -

           The ROVER spins out of control and KNOCKS Tom back toward 
           SPRUT-VOSEM, tearing his AIR-LINE.

           ON TOM - 

           Losing oxygen. He has to float back.

                         (re: Jack on video)
                        He’s out.

           The screen then goes BLACK.

           ISS ROVER -

           We track out slowly from the spinning Jack, who has blacked-
           out completely...

           And then flutters his eyes again. He grabs the THROTTLE one 
           last fast-push and STABILIZES.

                                 JACK
                        Close one, mates.

           Edward is relieved.

                        He’s back online.

                        Not good.

                        Sure? Not much power but I could 
                        try and give her another go?

                        -I understand. 

           Sanderson rubs his forehead.

                                 SANDERSON
                        So we’re going to try to help you 
                        fix the Sprut-Vosem return pod 
                        remotely-

                                 TOM
                        Sir. With all due respect I’ve 
                        tried that twice a day for nine 
                        years. That’s 6,570 attempts. 
                        Anything you can think of I’ve 
                        tried. 

                                 SANDERSON
                        Well, then we try one more time.

           Tom seems different. The weight of someone’s death is hanging 
           over him...

           Sarah and Tom speak. Sarah is crying. Tom seems oddly 
           distant.

                        No, I’m not giving up on you. We’re 
                        going to try something else.

                         (emotionless)
                        You’ve tried everything.

                                 SARAH
                        And we’ll keep trying. We’ll help

                        I’ve tried that a thousand 
                        different times, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        Then we’ll try a thousand more.
                                 TOM
                        Sarah. A man almost died. Because 
                        of me. 

                                 SARAH
                        There’s got to be another way.

                                 TOM
                         (angry)
                        There is no other way! This is it. 
                        I will be alone forever. That’s 
                        what I wanted, isn’t it?... and 
                        that’s what I got. You said it 
                        yourself. You can’t fight destiny 
                        and this is mine. 

                                 SARAH
                        Tom?

           Tom stands up, puts his finger on the Communications button.

                                 TOM
                         (resigned now)
                        And yours is to move on and be 
                        happy.  

           Tom looks at the button, takes a deep breath..

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Sarah?

                                 SARAH
                        Yes?

                                 TOM
                        I love you... and goodbye.

                                 SARAH
                        Tom!

           Tom SWITCHES the Sprut-Vosem communications dashboard OFF.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Tom?

           Sarah tries furiously but all communications have been lost.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Tom.

           LATER - 

           Sarah is still trying. Sanderson and Edward, along with the 
           other Techies, are working.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Maybe he’ll turn it back on.

                                 EDWARD
                        Well, there’s no way we can help 
                        him now.
                                 SARAH
                        He’ll turn it back on.

           Edward looks to Sanderson...

           LATER -

           Sarah is still trying. But this time we can understand she’s 
           just going though the motions.

           LATER - 

           Sarah has fallen asleep with her finger on Tom’s button. 
           Rachel comes in and wakes her up.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Tom.

                                 RACHEL
                        Come on. 

                                 SARAH
                        But he’s coming back.

           Rachel doesn’t really know what to say other than...

                                 RACHEL
                        Time to go.

           Sarah gets up and follows Rachel out.

           EXT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - LATER

           Tom gazes out of Sprut-Vosem’s porthole window. 

           The Station drifts away from us... Tom getting smaller and 
           smaller and smaller until he’s just another speck in the 
           night sky.

                                                     FADE OUT:

           INT. GALAXY DINER - NIGHT

           An older gentleman holds up a glass of beer. This is RACHEL’S 
           DAD.

                                 RACHEL’S DAD
                        To my daughter...
                         (then, resigned)
                        ...and also her new boyfriend, 
                        Carl.

           Everyone toasts. Sarah is there, with Evan. She sits across 
           from her ex-husband, Steve.
           Some time has passed but Sarah still finds it hard to smile. 
           But she’s a trooper so she puts on a brave face.

           LATER -

           The guests mill about. Steve approaches Sarah with Evan.

                                 STEVE
                         (to Evan)
                        Go get some cake.

           Evan runs off.

                                 SARAH
                        Hi.

                                 STEVE
                        I had a chance to talk to Carl. 
                        He’s a little-

                                 SARAH
                        We know... we know.

           Steve laughs.

                                 STEVE
                        Do you... want to go for a walk?

           EXT. GALAXY DINER - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Sarah and Steve walk.

                                 SARAH
                        The Galaxy parking lot is really 
                        lovely this time of year.

                                 STEVE
                        You got your asphalt, your 
                        dumpsters, your sodium lamps...

                                 SARAH
                        So where’s, um-

                                 STEVE
                        Amber?

                                 SARAH
                        She was the dumb one, right?

                                 STEVE
                        No, that was Jessica.

                                 SARAH
                        Right, Jessica. With the boobs.

                                 STEVE
                        They’ve all had boobs.
                                 SARAH
                        Not like those. Those could’ve been 
                        an appetizer at the Cheesecake 
                        Factory. 

           Steve laughs.

                                 STEVE
                        No, Amber was the kick-boxer.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh, right. The other dumb one.

                                 STEVE
                        She wasn’t dumb, Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        I told her I worked at NASA and she 
                        asked me how long my commute to 
                        space was.

                                 STEVE
                        She was so dumb.

           Steve and Sarah both laugh. 

                                 SARAH
                        Pretty, though.

                                 STEVE
                        Very pretty. 

                                 SARAH
                        But just so, so stupid.

                                 STEVE
                        You have no idea.
                         (BEAT)
                        What about you? You never bring 
                        anyone to these things.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. It’s hard - with Evan 
                        and everything. I don’t know... 
                        guess it’s just not really my thing 
                        anymore.

                                 STEVE
                        Sarah, everybody needs someone.

           Sarah considers this...

                                 SARAH
                        We should go back inside.

           The two head back in.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Hey.
                                 STEVE
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        What did one boob say to the other?

                                 STEVE
                        What?

                                 SARAH
                        What up, bra.

                                 STEVE
                         (laughing)
                        That was so bad.

                                 SARAH
                        You laughed.

                                 STEVE
                        Legitimately the worst joke I’ve 
                        ever heard.

                                 SARAH
                        And you still laughed.

           Sarah and Steve smile.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - EVAN’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Steve puts an already asleep Evan to bed and kisses him.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Sarah waves Steve off as he drives away. She ponders for a 
           moment, smiles. 

           She looks up at the dark sky for a minute, then heads back 
           inside.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom has a full beard now... messy hair. We also see he’s 
           stopped counting the days with slash marks. Scrawled on the 
           wall now is just the words: 

                               “WHO CARES?”

           He talks to Demitri. He’s seems even more lost than he was 
           when we met him before. 

                                 TOM
                         (manic)
                        No way, man... Because I just can’t 
                        that’s why. I have too much to do. 
                        And who is this girl anyway?
           Demitri gives a puppy dog face: just give it a whirl.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Nope. No way. Plus, I’m close to 
                        fixing the return pod.

           A pile of wires and tools. He’s not close at all.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Just a few more tweaks. You know, 
                        you Russians thought of everything. 
                        And when I get back home there’s a 
                        lot I gotta do. 
                         (whispering)
                        I just talked to the President. You 
                        know what he said? He said he’s 
                        gonna give me a medal when I get 
                        back. Yeah. So that means I’ll have 
                        to get a suit probably, and maybe a 
                        haircut. And new shoes.

           Demitri knows the guy is gone now.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You can’t go to the White House in 
                        old shoes... and I need to mow the 
                        lawn at Mom’s house. I can’t 
                        imagine how tall that grass is now. 
                        You see guys, I’m gonna have a lot 
                        of catching up to do. And Olivia, I 
                        sometimes would pick her up from 
                        school. I hope she hasn’t been 
                        waiting too long. I wonder if I 
                        turned off the stove in my 
                        apartment? I think I did. You know 
                        what, though? My voice-mail is 
                        probably full. I have to remember 
                        to take care of that. As a matter 
                        of fact I’m gonna write that down 
                        now so I don’t forget. I need a 
                        pencil.

           Tom heads into the bedroom.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        A lot to do, man. A lot to do.

           Demitri stares with quiet concern for their best friend.

           INT. TARGET - DAY

           Sarah and Rachel push carts through Target.

                                 RACHEL
                        Well, are you gonna’ go?

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know?
                                 RACHEL
                        It’s your first date in like, 
                        forever and you don’t know?

                                 SARAH
                        He’s my ex-husband. Don’t you think 
                        that’s weird?

                                 RACHEL
                        I think it’s romantic. You were 
                        together and then you weren’t 
                        together but then like destiny 
                        intervened and now you’ll be 
                        together again. 
                         (BEAT)
                        I suddenly want Colin Firth to slap 
                        me and then take me.

                                 SARAH
                        It’s good for Evan.

                                 RACHEL
                        You never know how these things are 
                        gonna’ work out. I mean, look at me 
                        and Carl. Who would’ve ever thought 
                        I’d find someone as amazing as 
                        Carl?

                                 SARAH
                        No one.

                                 RACHEL
                        Exactly. 

                                 SARAH
                        No one at all.

                                 RACHEL
                        And to tell the truth, I thought he 
                        was weird at first.

                                 SARAH
                        No.

                                 RACHEL
                        True story. But then I was like 
                        ‘fine, I’ll come to your place 
                        because...’ I don’t even remember 
                        why now-

                                 SARAH
                        Because you’re a slut?

                                 RACHEL
                        That was it.
                         (BEAT)
                        So I get over there and he had 
                        candles and a whole box of wine and 
                        we just-
                                 SARAH
                        Do not put something in my brain I 
                        can’t erase-

                                 RACHEL
                        No. We just talked all night. 

                                 SARAH
                        Really? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yes... And then we did it and let 
                        me tell you he found places on my 
                        body that I didn’t even-

                                 SARAH
                        Okay, okay.

                                 RACHEL
                        All I’m saying is give it another 
                        go... maybe Steve is your Carl?!

           Sarah considers that.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know. I think I’m just 
                        gonna’ say no. 

           Rachel picks up some scented candles and puts them in her 
           cart.

                                 RACHEL
                        You know, I think I’ll finally be 
                        complete as a person once I buy 
                        these scented candles.
                         (off Sarah’s look)
                        No. I really believe that.

                                 SARAH
                        I know you do. That’s the issue.

           Rachel tries to get Sarah to smell them but she declines.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sarah, Grandpa Ted and Evan have dinner. Grandpa Ted shows 
           Evan how to tie varies ROPE KNOTS.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        - Did I ever tell you about my time 
                        in the Navy?

                                 SARAH
                        Dad.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        What? He’s seven.

                                 SARAH
                        Evan, remember what I told you?
                                 EVAN
                        Yes. Never repeat anything Grandpa 
                        Ted says.

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        What? The kid needs a father. 

           Sarah isn’t too happy with this. She shoots her dad a look 
           and gets up to clear plates.

                                 EVAN
                        Dad called again.
                         (BEAT)
                        For you.

                                 SARAH
                         (not thrilled)
                        Thank you, Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        Are you going to call him? 

                                 SARAH
                        Time to go to bed, Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        You said yourself dad was nice. You 
                        guys could get married again-

                                 SARAH
                        Evan. Go to bed. Now.

           Evan sulks to bed.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        The kid’s got a point-

                                 SARAH
                        Dad. What is wrong with you?

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        What? He’s got a point. I’m just 
                        trying to help.

                                 SARAH
                         (pissed)
                        Well it’s not working.
                         (BEAT)
                        Good night.

           Sarah exits. 

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - LATER

           Sarah walks past the Communications Room. Stops. Looks over 
           to her station... Maybe... just maybe? 
           Nothing.

           She keeps going. Even Sarah has realized this isn’t healthy 
           anymore.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           MAIN ROOM -

           The table is set with two plates. The finest of borscht and 
           pickled herring awaits.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        I’m coming!

           BEDROOM -

           Demitri sits on the shelf above the bed. 

           Tom enters. He’s used red borscht juice to create a David 
           Bowie style lightning bolt over his eye.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        How do I look?... It’s not too much 
                        is it?... You said she was kind of 
                        young and rock n’ roll... Okay 
                        good. 

           Tom takes a deep breath then turns back to Demitri.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and if things get... you 
                        know... 
                         (whispers)
                        Hot and heavy... I’m gonna need you 
                        to sleep in the other room tonight, 
                        okay? 

           Tom heads into the

           MAIN ROOM -

           Tom enters and takes a seat. He stares at the empty plate 
           across from him. Behind him, a mainframe computer blinks.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                         (sexy)
                        Hello, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Hi.

           Tom puts on his best face. Clearly it’s all in his head, but 
           this coping mechanism feels as real to him as any other one.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        So glad you could join me for 
                        dinner, Tom.
                                 TOM
                        You look great. 

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Why, thank you, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        That’s a beautiful dress.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Oh, this old thing? I just threw on 
                        the first thing I grabbed from my 
                        closet, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        So, do you come here often? 
                         (to himself)
                        No that’s what you say in a bar. 
                        Not on a date. Pull it together.
                         (back to her)
                        I hear the steak here is great.

           The computer mainframe BLINKS a few times.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        I’ve never been on a date with 
                        someone so handsome, Tom. 

           Tom laughs.

                                 TOM
                        Well, I do a lot of push-ups so-

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        You’re so amazing and special, Tom. 
                        You’re so tall and intelligent. Has 
                        anyone told you that recently, Tom? 
                        Has anyone told you how athletic 
                        and good with children you are? How 
                        you’d make a wonderful father, Tom. 
                        You know that, right? Has anyone 
                        told you how much value you have as 
                        a person? How much you mean to 
                        them, Tom? How much worse off 
                        they’d be if you didn’t exist? Has 
                        anyone said that to you recently, 
                        Tom? Because that’s what we all 
                        want to hear in the end, isn’t it, 
                        Tom? To know that we matter?

           As she speaks, we move in on Tom. Closer and closer.

                                 TOM
                        I guess so.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Well, I’ll say it, Tom. You matter. 
                        What you do makes a difference. 
                        When you talk, Tom, people listen. 
                        You’re not just some insignificant 
                        speck in the universe, Tom. No, not 
                        you. Other people, sure... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (CONT'D)
                        but not you, Tom. People care about 
                        you, Tom. People need you, Tom. 
                        Why? Because you’re Tom. You, 
                        Tom... are Tom. Tom. Valuable, 
                        strong, handsome, intelligent, 
                        kind, generous... You matter, Tom. 
                        Tom. You matter, Tom... 

           Tom is mesmerized.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom...

           And below...

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER - NIGHT

           ...The light at Sarah’s station is still YELLOW on Tom’s 
           channel.  

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Sarah pulls up in her Honda. Notices another car in the 
           driveway.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           Sarah enters. The dining room table is set with two plates. 
           Candles are lit. 

           Evan stands before her, holding a dish towel over his arm 
           like a waiter.

                                 EVAN
                        Madame... right this way please.

                                 SARAH
                        Evan. What is this?

           Evan pulls out her chair. 

                                 EVAN
                        Welcome to Chez Evan. 

           Sarah sits down. Smiles.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                         (bad french accent)
                        Tonight we will be serving peanut 
                        butter and jell-ay sandwiches and 
                        the grocery store’s finest milk.

                                 SARAH
                        Sounds delicious.

                                 EVAN
                        One moment, madame.
           Evan runs to the other room in his socks and returns with 

           STEVE -

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        May I introduce your dining 
                        companion tonight, Mr. Dad.

           Sarah is not too thrilled.

                                 SARAH
                         (to Evan)
                        Evan. You can’t do stuff like this. 
                        Bedroom.
                         (mad, to Steve)
                        Did you know about this?

           Sarah gets up. Evan, realizing she’s upset runs into his 
           room.

           BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan hides under his covers.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Evan. 

                                 EVAN
                         (crying)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SARAH
                        Evan, go out there right now and 
                        tell your father you’re sorry but 
                        he has to go. 

           Evan shakes his head ‘no.’ Sarah’s pretty exasperated. She 
           sits down on the bed.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                         (angry)
                        I know you want a someone here all 
                        the time. I know that Evan. But 
                        people don’t always get what they 
                        want? I don’t and you don’t either.

           Evan peeks his head out from under the covers.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        I just want you to be happy.

           Sarah is taken aback.

                                 SARAH
                        I am happy.

                                 EVAN
                        No you’re not. You’re always sad.
                                 SARAH
                        I’m not sad.

                                 EVAN
                        Yes you are. You act like the 
                        people on TV act when they’re sad.

           Sarah looks away.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        He says he wants to make it work 
                        again.

           Sarah sighs.

                                 SARAH
                        Go to bed.

           Evan throws the covers back over his head.

           DINING ROOM -

           Steve sits at his plate. Sarah enters.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry. He said you knew-

                                 SARAH
                        It’s fine. 
                         (looking at food)
                        I hope you like PBJ’s.

           Steve smiles.

           LATER-

           The milk has been replaced by wine. The PBJ’s are gone.

                                 STEVE
                        - and Rachel was so drunk. And in 
                        that horrible dress.

                                 SARAH
                        My bridesmaids looked great. 

                                 STEVE
                        They looked like marshmallows 
                        dipped in glitter.

                                 SARAH
                         (sorta’ tipsy, laughing)
                        That was ‘in’ back then!

                                 STEVE
                        So hideous.

                                 SARAH
                        What was the name of the guy she 
                        slept with that night?
                                 STEVE
                        Oh, there were so many back then. 
                        Oh! Redhead. Stupid shoes.

                                 SARAH
                        Oh yeah! I don’t even remember. Was 
                        he the dentist?

                                 STEVE
                        I think he was comedian or 
                        something.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        Vincent!

                                 SARAH
                        Vincent! That’s right. She met him 
                        backstage. At that sad comedy club. 
                        Oh god, only Rachel would be a 
                        groupie to a comedian.

           Steve moves in a bit.

                                 STEVE
                        That was a fun night.

                                 SARAH
                        It was.

           There’s a silence.

                                 STEVE
                        I really want to kiss you.

           Sarah closes her eyes.

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

           Steve moves closer.

                                 STEVE
                        We can get back to how it was.  

           Sarah glances back towards Evan’s room.

                                 STEVE (CONT’D)
                        We can make it work.

           Steve leans in and kisses Sarah. She kisses him back.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           As they kiss, we pan up to the sparkling Texas sky.

                                                     FADE OUT:
           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION -

           The main room is a WRECK. Parts and wires everywhere. Tom is 
           exasperated.

           Demitri looks on.

                                 TOM
                         (manic)
                        I’m close, Demitri. Just a few more 
                        turns of the screw and we’re going 
                        home. Ok. Please let this work.
                         (BEAT)
                        Well, of course I know what I’m 
                        doing. My mission was to...

           Tom pauses. He doesn’t even know anymore.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Of course he knows what he’s doing, 
                        Demitri. He’s Tom. The most amazing 
                        man alive.

                                 TOM
                        See, Demitri.

           Demitri stares.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Tom, I don’t know if I would accept 
                        that kind of back-talk if I were 
                        you.

                                 TOM
                        Did you hear that, Demitri? No more 
                        back-talk. Once I fix the pod we 
                        can go home. 

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        You know, Tom, when someone is as 
                        special as you are, other people 
                        will always try to get rid of them. 

           Tom looks over to Demitri, backs up a bit.

                                 TOM
                        You don’t feel that way Demitri, do 
                        ya’ buddy? you don’t want to get 
                        rid of me?
                         (BEAT)
                        See. He doesn’t feel that way at 
                        all. He’s my best friend.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        I didn’t want to tell you this, Tom 
                        but I heard him talking to his 
                        comrades on earth last night. I’m 
                        sorry, Tom, but I think it’s best 
                        you disposed of him.  

           Tom looks to Demitri.
                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                        He’s a conspirator, Tom. A Russian 
                        spy. Why do you think he’s here? To 
                        undermine The United States of 
                        America, Tom. Don’t you care about 
                        your country, Tom?

           Tom is truly distraught. He covers his ears.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not true. You’re not a spy, 
                        Demitri? Are you?

           Demitri looks to Tom: Spy? I’m a stuffed dog in an astronaut 
           suit.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Isn’t it obvious, Tom. Keeping you 
                        up here all this time. Making you 
                        question everything, Tom. It’s a 
                        good thing you have me to help you, 
                        Tom.

                                 TOM
                        Help me, what?

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Help you kill him, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        No, No, No!

           Tom then furiously starts to try (in vain) to fix the control 
           panel: wires, tools, etc.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I can do this.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Yes, you can, Tom. Why? Because 
                        you... are Tom. Of course, you’ll 
                        have to get rid of him first.

                                 TOM
                        Please stop. Demitri is my friend.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Then why does he want to kill you, 
                        Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Shut up!

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        I’m just trying to help you, Tom.

                                 TOM
                        No you’re not!

           Tom is seriously breaking down.
                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        But Tom-,

                                 TOM
                        SHUT UP!

           Tom picks up a wrench. 

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        Tom. I love you, Tom. You’re so 
                        special and smart and intelligent 
                        and handsome-

                                 TOM
                        STOP SAYING THAT! I just want to go 
                        home.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        But if you go back home, Tom, 
                        you’ll be just another loser. The 
                        world forgot about you, Tom. Have 
                        you ever thought about that? Really 
                        thought about it, Tom. Here, you 
                        are Tom. But down there, no one 
                        cares about you. They left you up 
                        here, Tom. Think about what that 
                        means. To abandon a loved one. It 
                        means they don’t care at all, Tom. 
                        Your friends, your family, your 
                        country. They all forgot about you.

                                 TOM
                        They tried! 

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE
                        No, Tom. They just don’t care. No 
                        one cares, Tom. Down there, you 
                        don’t matter, Tom. You don’t matter 
                        at all.

           Tom SMASHES the blinking lights of the computer mainframe.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                         (dying)
                        Now you’ll never go home, Tom.

           Tom falls to his knees, sobbing.

                                 FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Tom, Tom, Tom...

           The lights go out. Tom grabs onto Demitri and sobs on the 
           floor.

           Sarah picks up Evan from a kid’s birthday party. He holds a 
           balloon.

                                 SARAH
                        Have fun?

                                 EVAN

           Evan hops in the front seat and they drive off.

           Sarah drives, Evan is asleep. She flips through the radio.

                        ...I was sitting on my porch and 
                        there was a bright light and then 
                        the little green man came down from 
                        the sky and said to me ‘Helen, you 
                        are special...”

           Next...

                                 DR. LAURA-TYPE
                        ...he left you because you’re a 
                        hateful tramp, Becky... 

                                 SARAH
                        Good Lord.

           Sarah switches the station: DEATH METAL.

                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                        Yikes.

           She flips again. It’s Shania Twain’s “Man, I Feel Like a 
           Woman!” 

           Sarah sings along for a chorus or two.

           But slowly, we see her realizing something. She pulls over 
           and switches off the radio. She picks up her phone.
                                 SARAH (CONT’D)
                         (on phone)
                        Hey Carl. Think you could find an 
                        address for me?... Ok. Text it me 
                        when you can. Thank you.

           Sarah drives...

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom is at the porthole window, holding Demitri like a newborn 
           baby.

                                 TOM
                        Want to know a secret? I control 
                        what goes on down there.

           EARTH spins in the distance.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Right now, in Kansas City, a bad 
                        guy is about to steal an old lady’s 
                        purse but I’m gonna make him trip 
                        on the sidewalk. See. He just 
                        tripped. And the old lady didn’t 
                        even know it. But she’s safe now 
                        because of me.

           Demitri stares out the window.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        And see down there. In that house. 
                        There’s a little boy crying. See 
                        him. He’s sitting in the corner 
                        wearing Spider-man pajamas. His dad 
                        just died. It was a car accident 
                        and the little boy thinks it’s his 
                        fault. But I’m gonna’ make it all 
                        go away. Just like that. All gone. 
                        Poof! Just like that...

           Tom moves closer to the porthole.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        And there’s Sarah. She’s the pretty 
                        one who just pulled over to get 
                        gas. But she’s gonna’ leave the gas 
                        cap off again... like she always 
                        does. But I’m gonna fix it for her. 
                        See, Demitri, there she goes. Never 
                        even knew there was a problem. 
                        Because I make all her problems go 
                        away. From right up here.  

           Tom holds his hand out to the porthole window.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I can make them all go away...
           EXT. GAS STATION - SAME

           Sarah’s car pulls away. We move in on the GAS CAP: it’s fine.

           EXT. OLIVIA ROBERTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sarah’s car is in the driveway.

           INT. OLIVIA ROBERTS’ HOUSE - LATER

           Sarah sits in OLIVIA’S (21, pretty, Tom’s younger sister who 
           made him the CD) living room. Evan plays on the floor. Olivia 
           seems shocked.

                                 SARAH
                        ... I wanted to find you at the 
                        time but the Government considered 
                        anything surrounding the event 
                        confidential. So I couldn’t. But 
                        honestly, I don’t care anymore.
                         (BEAT)
                        ...right before we lost contact, 
                        Tom wanted you to know how much he 
                        loved you. He talked about your CD 
                        the whole way there.

           Olivia cries, but smiles too.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you think he, you know, 
                        suffered?

           Sarah pauses, but refrains from sounding crazy.

                                 SARAH
                        Wherever he is, I know he’s 
                        watching over you.

           Olivia gets up and returns with a photograph of Tom in his 
           Astronaut uniform from 2004.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I want you to have this.

           Sarah looks at it and smiles.

                                 SARAH
                        Thank you.

           Sarah gets up.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sarah exits the back screen door, holding Evan’s balloon. She 
           looks up: a star-filled Texas night.
           “Haphazardly” by Rhett Miller plays... the perfect modern, 
           sad, Texas song about letting go.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           The mess is everywhere still. Tom is working with some BLACK 
           TUBING...

                                 TOM
                         (Sportscaster voice)
                        And there goes superstar Tom 
                        Roberts with an interception! The 
                        crowd is going wild, cheering their 
                        hometown hero on as he makes it to 
                        the fifty...

           Tom strings out the TUBING further.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        ...the forty, the thirty... he’s 
                        going for it folks! He’s going... 
                        ...going ...going ...and there you 
                        have it folks... Tom Roberts is...

           Tom winds the long length of black tubing into a 

           NOOSE -

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                         (simulating crowd cheers)
                        ...finally gone.

           Tom moves the chair underneath the noose. 

           ON DEMITRI - who watches as Tom steps up on the chair.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           As the song BUILDS, Sarah ties the PHOTOGRAPH of Tom onto the 
           end of the balloon and let’s it go.

           Sarah watches as the balloon floats up into the still night 
           sky.

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           The song continues.

           We only see Tom’s feet on the chair. Demitri watches.

           ON DEMITRI-

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           Sarah watches the balloon float away out of sight.
           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom KICKS the chair out from under him. 

           The chair, lying on its side, lands next to Demitri...

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           We follow the BALLOON, the chorus of the song building as it 
           heads past telephone wires and trees, until it finally 
           disappears forever.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SCREENED PORCH - SAME/ INT. STEVE’S 
           BEDROOM

           Sarah is on the porch, a blanket wrapped around her to stop 
           the chill. She dials a number.

                                 SARAH
                         (on phone)
                        Hey.

           [Cut back and forth]

                                 STEVE
                        What time is it?

           Steve wakes up from a deep sleep.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m sorry.. I just called to see if 
                        you wanted to talk?

           Steve looks over at the clock: 1 A.M.

                                 STEVE
                        It’s 1 A.M.

                                 SARAH
                        Did you know that “Rocket Man,” is 
                        really about Elton John’s struggle 
                        with addiction? 

                                 STEVE
                         (so tired)
                        Everyone knows that. Sarah, 
                        seriously, it’s late. Can we talk 
                        in the morning?

                                 SARAH
                        I really need someone to talk to 
                        right now-

                                 STEVE
                        I just have to get some sleep. I’ll 
                        see you Sunday, okay? We can talk 
                        then.
                                 SARAH
                        Okay.

           Steve shakes his head and hangs up.

           Sarah heads back in, upset. Not really with him, more with 
           herself.

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - SAME

           Sarah enters. Grandpa Ted is working at the kitchen table, 
           metal parts strewn everywhere.

           Sarah heads to the sink for a glass of water.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                         (not looking up)
                        He’s not the one.

                                 SARAH
                        Dad. Don’t eavesdrop.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Then don’t talk so loud. Sounded 
                        like the cast of the goddamn View 
                        was on my porch.

           Sarah turn to her dad. 

                                 SARAH
                        Dad... do you miss Mom?

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        No.

                                 SARAH
                        Dad.

           Grandpa Ted motions for Sarah to sit down.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Sit down.
                         (BEAT)
                        I don’t miss your mother because to 
                        me, she never went anywhere. You 
                        know, when I have my breakfast, in 
                        my head all I hear is her asking me 
                        how I can possibly put ketchup on 
                        my eggs. When I go to a movies, you 
                        know what I hear? I hear her lean 
                        over and ask me ‘what did he say?’ 
                        Every line she would say that. When 
                        we went to your cousin’s wedding I 
                        heard her list all the things she 
                        hated about your Aunt Diane. And 
                        when I put my head down for the 
                        night, I hear her sigh and then 
                        lean over and say ‘good night, 
                        hon.’

                        Just because someone’s not 
                        physically next to you doesn’t mean 
                        they’re not there.

           Grandpa Ted stands up.

                                 GRANDPA TED (CONT’D)
                        Come here.

           He holds out his hand and begins dancing with Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        What are you doing?

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Dancing with my daughter.

                                 SARAH
                        Why?

                                 GRANDPA TED
                        Because I pee into a bag and when 
                        you pee into a bag the trade-off is 
                        you can do whatever the hell you 
                        want.

           Sarah and Grandpa Ted dance in the kitchen as the song comes 
           back alive.

                                 GRANDPA TED (CONT’D)
                        And I only wish I had started doing 
                        whatever the hell I wanted a long 
                        time ago.

           Sarah considers this, then continues dancing with her dad in 
           the kitchen.

           Tom’s feet fall to the floor. The tubing was nowhere near 
           strong enough to hold a grown man.

           Tom stays on the floor... a man who matters so little, a man 
           so ineffectual - that he can’t even kill himself. 

           He spots a bottle of vodka, removes the homemade noose, and 
           takes a swig.

                                 RACHEL
                        You need to start taking Oprah’s 
                        Life Class because it will heal 
                        your negative attitude-
                         (BEAT)
                        So my new thing is... are you 
                        ready?

                                 SARAH
                        So, so ready.

                                 RACHEL
                        My new thing is ‘I don’t give a 
                        shit.’

                                 SARAH
                        That’s your new thing? 

                                 RACHEL
                        Yup. I don’t give a shit.
                         (BEAT)
                        It’s Buddhist. Like you cut me off 
                        on the way to work Guy in the 
                        stupid yellow truck... ‘I don’t 
                        give a shit.’ My Hyundai will just 
                        keep on rolling, zen-style. Debbie 
                        in H.R. steals my good pen again... 
                        ‘I don’t give a shit.’ I’ll find 
                        another pen, and a better one at 
                        that. Lady at the bank, you give me 
                        the side-eye when you see my 
                        balance is only 34 dollars. ‘I 
                        don’t give a shit.’ That’s your 
                        drama, not mine.
                                 SARAH
                        This is a powerful new thing.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s about letting go. The minute 
                        you stop giving a shit, shit starts 
                        happening for you. I started 
                        yesterday and this morning I found 
                        a five dollar bill in my nice 
                        jeans.

           Sarah looks at Rachel: really?

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Try it. 

           They enter the COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -

           Carl is there. 

                                 SARAH
                        I don’t know if this is really one 
                        of your best ‘new things.’

                                 RACHEL
                        Try it. Say ‘I don’t give a shit.’ 
                        And I want to hear emphasis.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m not saying that word.

                                 RACHEL
                        Fine. Close your eyes and I’ll do 
                        it for you.

           Sarah closes her eyes and smiles.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        My name is Sarah Sparks and I don’t 
                        give a shit. You hear that 
                        universe. This lady right here does 
                        not give a shit. A shit... she does 
                        not give.

           Sarah beings laughing.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Why, universe? Because she doesn’t 
                        give a shit.

                                 SARAH
                        Can I open my eyes now?

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t give a shit.

           Sarah opens her eyes and instantly spots the GREEN BLINKING 
           LIGHT. She RACES over to her station.
                                 SARAH
                         (straight-up movie 
                          romance)
                        Tom.

           Sarah throws her headset on.

                                 RACHEL
                        I need a new thing.

                                 SARAH
                         (into headset)
                        Tom. Can you hear me? It’s Sarah. 

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom is on the floor in the main room, full beard and 
           surrounded by empty Vodka Bottles. 

                                 SARAH (V.O.)
                        Tom? Come in.

           Tom comes to, the GREEN light slowly coming into focus.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE CENTER/ SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Sarah is on the edge of her seat. Rachel is concerned.

                                 SARAH
                        Tom? Tom? Come in Tom? 
                         (BEAT)
                        Tom? 

           Rachel takes this as her cue to stop this nonsense.

                                 RACHEL
                         (to Carl)
                        Maybe she needs to go on a juice 
                        cleanse. Just pee the crazy out.

           [CUT BACK AND FORTH]

                                 SARAH
                        Tom. Please? Come in.

           Tom stumbles up to the communications desk.

                                 TOM
                        Sarah?

                                 RACHEL
                         (freaked out)
                        Oh, shit.

                                 SARAH
                        You’re there.
                                 TOM
                        I’m here, Sarah. I’m here.

                                 SARAH
                        But you destroyed the system-

           Tom looks to the panel he destroyed.

                                 TOM
                        I did. I don’t know... I did.

                                 SARAH
                         (standing up, 
                          professional)
                        Tom. Standby. We’re bringing you 
                        home for real this time.

                                 TOM
                        I’ve heard that before.

                                 SARAH
                         (confident)
                        Let me rephrase that. I am bringing 
                        you home.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           Sarah races down the hallway. Rachel behind her.

           FANCY OFFICE at the end of the hall. 

           INSERT PLACARD -

                    “WILLIAM SANDERSON, NASA CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR”

           Rachel stops.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh, shit.

           A SECRETARY stands up.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Ma’am. You can’t go on-

           Sarah blows straight into the double-doors.

                                 RACHEL
                         (to Secretary)
                        Snap.
                         (THEN)
                        Sorry. That was rude. I was just in 
                        the moment and... you understand.

           And now we’re in the...

           COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - LATER
           Sanderson stares at Sarah and now Rachel. Edward and the 
           Techies are there.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Sarah, you don’t give up, I’ll give 
                        you that...

           Sarah motions for Sanderson to press the mic. 

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                         (into mic)
                        Major Roberts. This is Bill S-

                                 TOM
                        Major Tom Roberts. Over.

                                 EDWARD
                        Sarah. Listen to me. We do not have 
                        the ability to do this. 

                                 SARAH
                        But we planned on another attempt 
                        before we lost commun-

                                 EDWARD
                        An attempt. Yes. “Try.” But the 
                        reality is we can’t do it, Sarah. 
                        And at a certain point we just have 
                        to stop chasing the windmill-

                                 SARAH
                        I can’t accept that.

                                 EDWARD
                        It doesn’t matter what you can 
                        accept. What matters is reality.

           Sanderson shuts off the mic.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Sarah. He’s right. We just don’t 
                        have the ability to bring Major Tom 
                        home. 

                                 SARAH
                        I think I know of someone who does.

           OFF THEIR LOOKS:

           INT. INDUSTRIAL HANGAR - LATER

           Unlike the worn and shabby NASA, this place is spotless. 
           White. Gleaming. Even the floors are white.

           Sarah and Sanderson and now Grandpa Ted are being led by an 
           ASSISTANT, 40’s, toward a large STRUCTURE in the center, 
           covered by a giant TARP. 
                                 ASSISTANT
                         (leading)
                        Mr. Jones is thrilled you’ve 
                        contacted him. He feels this could 
                        be the perfect product launch for 
                        the X-97.

                                 GRANDPA TED
                         (whispering to Sarah)
                        Great.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        And where is Mr. Jones? He’s 3 
                        minutes late.

           The Assistant looks around, nervous. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                        He should be here-

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Sarah, this is the last-

           Just then the sound of a SKATEBOARD cuts through the echoing 
           hangar. Meet LELAND JONES (fourth richest man in the world 
           and... age 17) 

           He zooms up on his skateboard, skids and stops right in front 
           of Sanderson. 

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Sorry... Sixth period ran late.
                         (removing his backpack)
                        Leland Jones.

           Sarah is the only one with a shred of optimism.

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                         (ignoring Sanderson)
                        And you must be Ted Sparks. 

           Grandpa Ted is unimpressed.

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        Huge fan. The idea for the X-97 was 
                        based on your work on the Marie 
                        Antoinette Project.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        We scrapped that program.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        I know. Big mistake.

           Grandpa Ted is now very impressed.
                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Sparks’ work here would’ve 
                        reduced costs for NASA by 78 
                        percent while providing a safer, 
                        quicker more nimble space delivery 
                        system. We essentially just cribbed 
                        off your work, dude. Hope you don’t 
                        mind?

           Grandpa Ted looks to Sanderson. They have a history. 

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                         (to assistant)
                        Let’s take a look.

           A team of WORKERS removes the TARP revealing the gleaming 
           white X-97 space rocket. It’s pretty amazing.

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentleman, the X-97...

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        What’s the 97 for?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        That’s the year I was born.

           Leland hops on his skateboard and zooms toward the X-97. 
           Sanderson and Sarah look to each other. 

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        Give us a week.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        A week? You can be ready to launch 
                        in a week?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Ok, fine. Three days. 

           Leland gives Sanderson an awkward fist-bump and heads out.

                        Later.

           Sarah turns to Sanderson, a huge grin on her face.

           INT. INDUSTRIAL HANGAR - DAY

                                 “THREE DAYS LATER”

           A small TEAM from Leland’s crew, along with Sarah, Grandpa 
           Ted and Sanderson get ready for the big day. 

           A large WINDOW overlooks the X-97 which is now outside on a 
           tarmac. 
                                 LELAND JONES
                        The X-97 is unmanned. When she 
                        reaches Sprut-Vosem, the X-97 has a 
                        gyroscope-enabled tether system 
                        that will allow her to get close 
                        enough without impact. Major Tom 
                        can float out and then we begin re-
                        entry.

           Sanderson looks around.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Where’s your communications system? 

           Leland holds up his IPad. Sanderson motions for his crew to 
           leave.

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        This is a joke.

           Leland types onto his iPad. 

           INSERT IPad: All of the NASA communications systems are now 
           live-streaming in small windows on his iPad.

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        There’s no way to hack into the 
                        NASA mainframe-

           Leland shoots him a look: come on.

                                 LELAND JONES
                         (zooming in on Sanderson’s 
                          desk)
                        Looks like you’re about halfway 
                        through The Help?

           Sarah chuckles. Leland types again.

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                         (into mic)
                        Hey dude, you there?

           Bill Sanderson mouths ‘hey dude’ to himself. 

                                 TOM
                         (via IPad)
                        Major Tom to Base, over.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Tom. My name is Leland Jones. We’re 
                        sending help. Standby.

                                 TOM
                        Sir, yes, Sir.

           Leland turns to Sanderson.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        So. Shall we start her up?
                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        May as well. What do we do? Send a 
                        text?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Great idea, man. 
                         (BEAT)
                        Alright. Here we go.

           Leland types a bit more on his iPad. the X-97 begins to fire. 
           A large, clean blue blast of heat underneath the nimble ship 
           forms. An AUTOMATED VOICE countdown begins as we move in on

           SARAH - 

           This is her last hope. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE

           In the distance, the X-97 shoots up into the sky.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        We have liftoff!

           And then SPUTTERS, SWERVES, AND CRASHES IN THE DISTANCE.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        How much did that cost you?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Thankfully only 600 million.
                         (BEAT)
                        I’m sorry guys. Got a few more 
                        kinks to work out before we can try 
                        this again.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        How long ‘til you can build another 
                        one. One that works?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        This one took 2 years so... yeah, 2 
                        years?

           On Sarah: this is real for her and she can’t take it. She 
           excused herself and runs out.

           Leland registers this...

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        Maybe there’s something else I 
                        could do to help? 

           Bill looks to Grandpa Ted: worth a try now.

           INT. SUV - LATER

           Sanderson is on the phone. Leland, Sarah and Grandpa Ted in 
           the back.
                                 BILL SANDERSON
                         (on the phone)
                        I want all hands on deck by the 
                        time we get there. We’re giving her 
                        another go.

           Bill glances at Sarah.

           INT. JOHNSON SPACE STATION - MISSION COMMAND - LATER

           The REAL DEAL room. Huge and buzzing. Sanderson blows in. An 
           army of NASA GEEKS take notice. Carl is there too.

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                         (to NASA crew spilling in)
                        Alright people, we got a situation. 
                        If you’ve been looking for your 
                        time to shine, now would be it. If 
                        not, I suggest you find a new line 
                        of work. I need ECS online in five. 
                        Communications is up and has 
                        contact. Systems. We need the plans 
                        to every Soviet Tin Can they every 
                        threw up there. Go over them with 
                        Leland, here. He’s 17 and smarter 
                        than all of you combined. Tech. 
                        Find every ex-Russian Cosmonaut 
                        living in the US and get them here 
                        before I take my next piss.

                        Texas housewife out there shoutin’ 
                        from the rooftops. We’re going 
                        international with this.

           Rachel now holds Sarah’s hand.

           MISSION CONTROL - LATER

           A giant wall of PLASMA SCREENS.
                                 EDWARD
                        Pulling up Sprut-Vosem.

                                 TECHIE #2
                        Looks like a panel-breach.

           A SATELLITE VIEW merges with the actual original plans for 
           Sprut-Vosem. The damaged GIANT SOLAR PANELS.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Kid. What you got?

           Leland walks to the image of plasma.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Ok. So these plans are Russian so 
                        work with me here but seems Major 
                        Roberts’s initial approach in 
                        Navajo-1 compromised panel 4. 

           Edward looks to Sanderson.

                                 LELAND JONES (CONT’D)
                        These older systems weren’t 
                        integrated so each panel generates 
                        specific power for specific 
                        functions. For example, Panel 2 
                        fuels communications, lights, 
                        temperature, etc. But what I don’t 
                        understand is how he’s getting 
                        temperature regulation. It doesn’t 
                        make sense. He should be dead.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Well, he’s not. 
                         (BEAT)
                        What about panel 4?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Panel 4 is mainly responsible for 
                        the Return Pod. Which is why 
                        Roberts could never fix the thing. 
                        There just wasn’t power to initiate 
                        the battery charge, which in turn 
                        ignites the engines.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Then we fix the panel.

                                 EDWARD
                        Not possible, Sir. Not without a 
                        supply mission. 
                         (BEAT)
                        And there’s no more shuttle 
                        program, so-

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Any of y’all care to make your 
                        M.I.T. degrees worthwhile?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        I think I have an idea.
           An AIDE comes in and whispers to Sanderson.

                                 AIDE
                        They’re ready for you, Sir.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Make it a good one, kid. 

           Sanderson follows the AIDE out to the-

           HALLWAY-

                                 AIDE
                        The press is this way.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        Deep breaths.

           PRESS CONFERENCE -

           EVERY NETWORK is there. Sanderson works the podium.

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        What’s different? This time we’re 
                        all working together. NASA, the 
                        Russians, experts from private 
                        industry. We’re all chipping in and 
                        doing whatever it takes.
                         (BEAT)
                        - Any more questions?

           The REPORTERS freak.

                                 BILL SANDERSON (CONT’D)
                        Too bad ‘cause I’m not taking any.

           Sanderson walks away.  A CNN REPORTER pipes up anyway.

                                 CNN
                        Chief Sanderson. What are Major 
                        Roberts’s chances this time?

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                         (turning back)
                        We’re doing our best.

           Even Sanderson realizes the gravity of the situation. Sarah 
           too.

           MISSION CONTROL/SPRUT-VOSEM [cut back and forth] - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Sanderson and his Aide are back. Leland and Edward speak with 
           Tom. On the PLASMA, we see visually what Leland explains. 

           Tom is at a control panel.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        - and how many do you see?
                                 TOM
                        Four.

                                 EDWARD
                        Find the meter labeled “three.”

           Tom looks at the meters.

                                 TOM
                        They’re in Russian.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Alright. Clockwise from top: find 
                        the meter at three o’clock.

                                 TOM
                        Got it.

                                 EDWARD
                        The wire connecting that meter to 
                        the power grid above should be red.

                                 TOM
                        Affirmative.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Now the meter at six o’clock. That 
                        should have a black wire. Remove 
                        black and replace with red. 
                        Interior lights should dim.

           Tom does just that. Nothing.

                                 TOM
                        Nothing.

           Leland looks to Edward: no, clue.

           Sanderson looks at his watch.

                        This was your plan?

                                 LELAND JONES
                        It should work. I’m redirecting 
                        power to the Return Pod. The 
                        numbers are all according to our 
                        blueprint of Sprut-Vosem. I don’t 
                        know-

                        here.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           FOUR BURLY RUSSIANS, all in TRACK SUITS and SNEAKERS walk the 
           hallway straight out of “The Right Stuff.” They’re kind of 
           awesome. They are ALEXI, IGOR, GOGOL and KARP... Retired 
           Russian cosmonauts.

           MISSION CONTROL -

           The Russians enter. The NASA team doesn’t know what to make 
           of them. Bill shakes their hands.

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                        No time for Perestroika, boys. 
                        Let’s get this guy home.

           Alexi, the biggest, spots the plasma.

                        Leland. Go...

                                 LELAND JONES
                        Two of the solar panels are out. We 
                        went through the plans and 
                        redirected the wires but nothing 
                        happened.

           Alexi looks at the plans and then laughs.

                                 ALEXI
                         (to Leland)
                        Do you mind?

           Alexi speaks into the mic to Tom.

                        Affirmative.

                                 LELAND JONES
                        That’s not right. The plans say it 
                        should be-

           The RETURN POD BATTERY INDICATOR on Sprut-Vosem begins to 
           flicker. It worked. Power has been redirected.
                                 ALEXI
                         (patting Leland on the

                        for three million rubles.

           The Russians laugh. 

                                 BILL SANDERSON
                         (to Alexi)
                        Admire your work.

                        the return pod air-lock...

           Bill Sanderson smiles. This is why he took the job...

           INT. SPRUT-VOSEM SPACE STATION - SAME

           Tom turns the AIR-LOCK, something he’s tried a thousand times 
           before, but this time, the door rises and reveals the Sprut-
           Vosem RETURN POD. 

           He takes a step in but turns back:

           DEMITRI sits on the kitchen table.

                                 TOM
                        Don’t give me that look. 

           Demitri is emotionless. Tom kneels down and looks Demitri in 
           the eye. He’s leaving his best friend forever...

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        This is harder for me than it is 
                        for you but I just ask that you be 
                        happy for me, little buddy. I’m 
                        going home. And where I’m from a 
                        man can’t just go around talking to 
                        a space-dog all day, okay?

           Demitri is cold.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Okay?

           Tom gets up, heads to the Pod and turns back. Demitri holds 
           it all in.

           Tom gets in the pod and SHUTS THE DOOR. 

           ON DEMITRI - He’s been abandoned now too.

           Tom is suited up. He fires up the pod and begins setting 
           coordinates.

                                 TOM
                        Ready. 

           He moves to press the air-lock door. Then pauses.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

                        What is it, Tom?

           Tom gets out of his chair and races back into Sprut-Vosem.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Tom? Come in?

                        It’s called “Eternal Flame” by The 
                        Bangles and it will Change. Your. 
                        Life.
           She hits PLAY and TURNS UP THE VOLUME...

           The intro-xylophone of “Eternal Flame” plays over:

           RETURN POD - SAME

           Tom braces himself. The pod is shaking. 

           ON SARAH- As she rides in the back of a SPEED BOAT. A GROUP 
           of other BOATS are just up ahead. 

           ON THE POD -

           As it SPLASHES down. 

           ON CROWD -

           Rachel holds up a LIGHTER like at a rock concert as the song 
           blares.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                         (authoritative, to crowd)
                        Lighters up, people. Lighters up.

           The crowd quickly obliges.

           OCEAN -

           The Pod bobs in the moonlit water. Sarah’s boat veers toward 
           it. It’s quite possibly the most romantic thing ever. 
           Finally, they’re getting close...

           ON SARAH -

           As she stands up. A few MEDICS open the pod door.

           Behind her, the crowd on the beach holds up their lighters.

           ON TOM -

           As he emerges from the pod door and takes a DEEP breath: 

           He’s finally seeing Sarah for the first time. And it’s 
           amazing.

                                 TOM
                        Sorry. I’m a little out of breath.

                                 SARAH
                        Your oxygen tanks were-

                                 TOM
                        It’s got nothing to do with the 
                        oxygen tanks...

           Tom is helped into the boat by a gaggle of MEDICS, looks to 
           Sarah and...

           KISSES her... 
           ...just like in the movies (not movies recently, but in the 
           good old ones where the kiss was long and true and pure.)

           “Eternal Flame” plays-

           We move around Tom and Sarah, the world stopping as they 
           kiss,

           -Past the space pod bobbing in the water...

           -Past the crowd, all holding lighters

           -and up over the stars as we...

                                                     FADE OUT:

           INT. SARAH’S HOUSE - NIGHT  -

           Tom and Sarah stand in Evan’s bedroom.

                                 EVAN
                        So you’re from space?

                                 TOM
                        More like Virginia, but-
                         (BEAT)
                        Oh-

           Tom kneels down to Evan’s height and hands him Demitri.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        This is a very special friend of 
                        mine. His name is Demitri and he’s 
                        from space.

                                 EVAN
                        Cool.

                                 TOM
                        You can have him if you promise to 
                        take good care of him.

           Evan is mesmerized.

                                 SARAH
                         (kissing Evan on the head)
                        Good night.

           Sarah and Tom exit. Evan shows Demitri around his bedroom.

                                 EVAN
                        This is my bedroom. You can sleep 
                        on the bottom bunk.... these are my 
                        video games... you can play with 
                        any of them if you want...

                                 EVAN (CONT'D)
                        This is space ice cream from the 
                        museum in Washington, D.C. It 
                        tastes like a sponge.

           EXT. SARAH’S HOUSE - BACKYARD 

           The perfect Texas night. Sarah begins taking her shoes off.

                                 TOM
                        What are you doing?

                                 SARAH
                        You said you wanted to lay in the 
                        grass. Here’s some grass.

           Tom takes off his shoes and steps in the grass with Sarah. 
           They both lay down and look up at the stars. 

                                 TOM
                         (holding out a handshake)
                        Nice to finally meet you.

                                 SARAH
                         (returning)
                        Nice to finally meet you too.

           They kiss again...

                            ...THE END
