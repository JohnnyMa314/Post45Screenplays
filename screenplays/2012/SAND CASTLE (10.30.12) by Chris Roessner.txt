                        Super: Based on a true story... 

           Wind howls. Hummer engines whisper towards us. Closer. 
           They’re roaring now, about to smash through the screen.   

                                                           FADE IN:

           EXT. IRAQI DESERT-DAY

           From the turret of a Humvee, an Iraqi village speeds by, 
           surprisingly beautiful and picturesque.   

           PVT. MATTHEW OCRE, a baby-faced 19, rides in the turret 
           with the M-249 MACHINE GUN.  We’ve been in his P.O.V., 
           surveying his area alongside him.  

           Sweat covers his every inch.  

                                 RADIO CHATTER
                        Lima One, X-ray this is Charlie Actual, 
                        over.

                                 RADIO CHATTER (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead Charlie.

           The Chatter continues as:   

           --IRAQI CHILDREN play soccer at the roadside.

           --An IRAQI MOTHER scrubs clothes in a wash basin. 

           --An IRAQI GIRL in a purple burqa innocently waves.  

           The radio vomits static then dies. Finally--  

                                 MATT
                              (yells to crew)
                        Any chance we’ll see the FOB before 
                        nightfall?  I can’t go another round with 
                        this heat. 
           No response.  Matt crouches inside the Hummer only to see 
           the tops of helmets, cold and uncaring.   

           The SPEEDOMETER bounces wildly between 15mph and 30mph.  
           Broken. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. Can we get the lead out? 

           Nothing. 

           Matt pushes himself back into the scorching wind.

           FROM AFAR--

           Matt’s convoy slowly serpentines through a ROUND-A-BOUT.  

           Up ahead a pile of trash burns.  Black smoke blankets the 
           roadway.

           BACK IN THE TURRET--

           Matt swigs from his CAMELBAK--a sweet moment of relief in 
           the Iraqi heat.

           The convoy rolls to a halt in the center of the village.     

           The idle engine hums.

                                 MATT
                        What’s the situation here, guys?

           A FLOCK OF BIRDS take flight from a nearby rooftop.  Matt 
           jumps, turns.  Nothing. 

                                 RADIO CHATTER
                        Talk to us Bravo 4.  What do you see, 
                        over.   

           Matt looks rooftop to rooftop.  Empty.

           A YOUNG IRAQI BOY flies a RED KITE high into the wind.

                                 RADIO CHATTER (CONT’D)
                        Bravo 4, we’re talking to you.  What do 
                        you see, over.  

           Matt grabs his radio, goes to speak--stops. 

                                 RADIO CHATTER (CONT’D)
                        Bravo 4--
                                 MATT
                              (into Radio)
                        Bravo 4 clear.  Over.

           The convoy kicks back to life and rolls toward the 
           bellowing black smoke.

           Matt spies movement on a rooftop.  An IRAQI MAN stares 
           down at him, locks eyes, then disappears.  Something is 
           off.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                              (into radio)
                        Hold tight, Charlie. Repeat, Charlie stop 
                        the convoy. 

           The first vehicle disappears into the black cloud.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                              (to his vehicle)
                        Guys stop the vehicle. Guys--

           Matt drops back in the Hummer to find it completely empty.  
           The steering wheel gently guiding itself.  

           Matt stands back in the turret, is engulfed by the black 
           smoke. Can’t see.  

           He comes through the haze in time for--

           BOOM.

           The front vehicle is lifted into the sky, comes crashing 
           down on its roof in a fiery blaze.

           The symphony of gunfire begins.  

           Bullets riddle the sides of vehicles.  

           Radio chatter roars to life.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Get the Machine Gun going.  Now, now.  
                        Return fire.

           Matt goes for the trigger, looks down to see his hands are 
           only square blocks of skin.  He’s useless, his face 
           petrified.  

           He paws angrily at the metal of his weapon.   

           Matt’s body jolts.  He’s been hit.
           The front of his flack jacket covers in blood. He reaches 
           to his neck, pulls back a fist of blood and skin.  Oddly, 
           his hands once again normal.  

           He collapses, his eyes vacant, looking to the blue sky, 
           and the RED KITE that falls peacefully to earth.

           Matt gasps his last breath. Pupils dilate, lifeless.

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGER--DAY

           Matt jolts awake, checks his neck for blood--nothing.  He 
           catches his breath, sighs relief.   

           He rises slowly to find, taped to his chest, a sign: “Iraq 
           Vet.  Will Work For Food”.

                                 MATT
                              (to Himself)
                        Assholes.

           He crumples the sign, lets it fall.  Checks his left hand 
           and the dirty cast wrapped around it.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

           We pull back to see Matt as the lone soldier amidst a sea 
           of bunks, perfectly uniformed, stretching to infinity.  

           Spirit in The Sky by Norman Greenbaum throws us into--

           I/E. AIRPLANE HANGER--DAY

           Blinding sun.  Matt’s eyes adjust, bringing the MASSIVE 
           EXPANSE of the Army Base into view.

           Hundreds of soldiers buzz about.  

           Blackhawks take flight high into the blue desert sky.

           Soldiers barbecue, catch some sun.

           SUPER:  CAMP ARIFJAN, KUWAIT. 2003.
           EXT. CAMP ARIFJAN--CONTINUOUS

           Matt dons his Boonie Cap and journeys through wind and 
           dust.

           He pumps a tube of Colgate into his mouth, swigs from his 
           canteen, gargles and spits.  

           An ARMOR UNIT of M1A1 ABRAMS TANKS are fueled and packed 
           with gear.  On the firing well of each is painted the 
           tank’s nickname: LONE WOLF, STARS AND STRIPES, ANACONDA, 
           etc. 

                                 TANK SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Private Ocre.

           Matt stops.

           Tank Soldier paints the finishing touches on his tank’s 
           nickname: POKEY MIRRA LOMA.

                                 TANK SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Whattaya think of the name?

           Matt looks blankly.

                                 TANK SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Pokey was my dog’s name, and Mirra Loma 
                        was the street I grew up on.

           Matt still doesn’t get it.

                                 TANK SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        It’s my porn star name, man.  I’m going 
                        balls deep in Iraq, get it?  

                                 MATT
                        Clever.

                                 TANK SOLDIER
                        Better than that ‘Cold Fury’ bullshit. 
                        Shit’s gay. 

                                 MATT
                        You seen Sergeant Baker?

                                 TANK SOLDIER
                        The gym with the rest of your guys.

           Matt nods, steps to leave.
                                 TANK SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        Yo, Ocre.  Armor’s rolling out today.  
                        Baghdad or bust. If I don’t see you the 
                        rest of the war, be safe.

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. 

           Tank Soldier smiles, drops down into the Abrams, 
           disappears.

           Pre-Lap: The whizz of a surgical saw.

           INT. MEDIC TENT--LATER

           An ARMY MEDIC inches the saw along Matt’s cast, revealing 
           the atrophied, discolored hand beneath.

                                 ARMY MEDIC
                        I had this soldier in the other day.  
                        Electrocuted himself in the shower.  Got 
                        buzzed up something awful.  Hold these. 

           The Medic hands Matt a pair of hospital sheers, then tugs 
           at the cast.

           Matt winces in pain.

                                 ARMY MEDIC (CONT’D)
                        Kid thought he was yanking a rope to turn 
                        the shower on.  Turned out it was a 
                        bundle of exposed wires.  They found him 
                        face down in a puddle of his own piss.  

           The Medic takes the shears and cuts away.

                                 ARMY MEDIC (CONT’D)
                        Hold tight, you’ll feel some pressure.

           The Medic jerks the remainder of the plaster from Matt’s 
           forearm.

           Matt’s eyes tear and swell in pain.

                                 ARMY MEDIC (CONT’D)
                        You young guys got as much brains in your 
                        head as hair on top. 
                              (beat, suspicious)
                        A door did this?

                                 MATT
                        I got it caught in the hummer--  
                                 ARMY MEDIC
                        Let me see you move it.

           Matt tries to wiggle his fingers.  They barely move.  
           Shooting pain.

                                 ARMY MEDIC (CONT’D)
                        Blood seeps into the interstitial tissue, 
                        that’s causing the discoloration.  Looks 
                        worse than it is.  

                                 MATT
                        There’s no fucking way I can go out like 
                        this.   

                                 ARMY MEDIC
                        Ice it.  

                                 MATT
                        I can’t make a fist, Doc.

           The Medic digs into his medicine cabinet.  Produces a 
           bottle of TYLENOL.

           The Medic leans into Matt.

                                 ARMY MEDIC
                        Guys are rolling out with a lot worse. 

           Matt studies his black and blue balloon of a hand.

                                 ARMY MEDIC (CONT’D)
                        Take this form back to your Platoon 
                        Sergeant.

           Insert: Medical Form. A pen sweeps across the box ‘Battle 
           Ready’.  Check.

           INT. GYM TENT-DAY

           Soldiers pump iron in this sad excuse for a gym: blocks of 
           cement double as dumbbells, huge tires are rolled end over 
           end. Welcome to macho world. 

           Pounding rock music wails through the space.

           SSG. BAKER (28), tall and confident, the leader of our 
           Motley Crew, is the lone man with his eyes fixed to the 
           BBC.
                                 BRITISH NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        Explosions and anti-aircraft missiles 
                        erupt over Baghdad marking the first 
                        clear sign that war has begun.  This is 
                        the BBC World News--   

           Insert: Stock footage of the bombing raids over Baghdad.  
           Superimposed at the lower corner of the screen: ‘Day 1’. 

           SGT. BARTLES, shaved white head, intimidating physique--
           spots his buddy CPL. MEYERS (24), scrawny and slight with 
           a southern drawl, on the bench press.  

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        That a boy, Meyers.  Finish strong, 
                        buddy.

           A red-faced Meyers powers through his last set.

           In the corner, country bumpkin SGT. FALVY (28), shirt off 
           and muscles blazing, lifts two TIDE BOXES filled with 
           CEMENT. A lit cigarette dangles between his lips, a 
           thicket of chaw in his jaw.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        I’m telling you guys.  We get back to the 
                        States you’re gonna see my body on ‘Men’s 
                        Health’.  Two big-tittied girls on each 
                        arm. The waves splashing all up on my 
                        pecks and shit.

           SSG. Baker returns to his group. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Falvy, we’re gonna see you in ‘Out 
                        Magazine’ with a dick in each hand and 
                        shame in your eyes.

           Laughter.  Dumbbells hit the floor.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        We’ll see, Sergeant Baker.  We’ll see.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        We coulda used you in World War II, 
                        Falvy. All by yourself on the beaches of 
                        Normandie.  Waving the U-Boats in with a 
                        flashlight and shit.  

           The guys laugh.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Either fish or cut bait, Meyers.  I came 
                        to fish.
           Matt enters.

                                 MATT
                        Sergeant Baker.  

                                 ALL
                        There he is/’Morning Sunshine/Sup, 
                        Private Fuckface.

                                 SGT. FALVY 
                        The Imp, the gimp, America’s wimp. You 
                        look like a bag of smashed shit.  

                                 MATT
                        Those damn Malaria pills.  Giving me 
                        nightmares.

                                 CPL. MEYERS (O.S.)
                        This whole place is a nightmare.

           Matt hands Baker his MEDICAL FORMS. Baker studies them.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Looks like you’re good to go.

                                 MATT
                        You see Armored is rolling out today?

           Ears perk up. 

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        That true?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        The LT is with the brass now.  He’ll 
                        brief us when he’s done.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        When the briefing start?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (reluctantly)
                        1800.  Last night.

           Collective huffs.  Excitement.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Tick, tock.  Tick, tock. Army’s kept me 
                        in a cage, Sergeant Baker.  About time to 
                        let me out.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (re: Hand)
                        How’s it feel?  You good?
                                 MATT
                        It’s not a problem.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Take it easy.  I don’t want you to 
                        reinjure it.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Fuck that. ‘Easy’ set sail long a time 
                        ago.  

           Falvy steps close to Matt, a little too close.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        What Ocre needs is some ‘rehabilitative 
                        training’. And because I care so deeply 
                        for his well being, I’m making his 
                        physical fitness my personal 
                        responsibility.    

           Off Falvy’s grin--

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. CAMP ARIFJAN, KUWAIT-LATER

           The guys jog the camp’s perimeter, SSG. Baker leads the 
           cadence and the formation.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (singing)
                        Remember JFK...

                                 ALL
                        Remember JFK...

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        He tried to lead the way.

                                 ALL
                        He tried to lead the way.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        But he was shot one day.

                                 ALL
                        But he was shot one day.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        In the early morning-- 
                                 ALL
                        Rai-ai-ai-ain.  In the early morning 
                        Rain.

           The cadence continues as Matt brings up the rear, the 
           boxes of Tide in hand. 

           Falvy jogs alongside as Matt winces in pain, drops the 
           cement blocks to the sand.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        That’s all you can give, huh? Don’t 
                        worry, Ocre. I believe shame is a private 
                        thing. 

           Falvy squeezes Matt’s injured hand, pulls him in close--
           whispers in his ear.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        You’re secret is safe with me.

           He releases his grip.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        Now gimme these fucking things.  You’re 
                        fucking up my workout.  

           Falvy snags the Tide boxes and sprints to the front of the 
           formation. Too easy.   

           Matt’s left to suck wind and cradle his injured hand.

           EXT. MESS TENT-DUSK

           Matt stands in a long line, his M-16 slung over his 
           shoulder, an empty food tray at the ready.  

           He stares at gobs of unidentifiable food--slop, square 
           pieces of cardboard meat.  

                                 SOLDIER
                              (to Matt)
                        Hurry it up, Soldier.  Staring at it 
                        won’t make it taste better.  

           MESS TENT, PICNIC TABLE--CONTINUOUS

           Matt slides in next to SSG Baker.  The end of day reverie 
           in full swing--CPL. Meyers deep into a story.
                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        ...me and Bartles just finished shoveling 
                        this rich prick’s driveway. We’re talking 
                        worst winter in Missouri history.  
                        Fuckin’ back breakin’. After three hours 
                        we ring the doorbell and we’re like ‘can 
                        we have our money, please sir?  We’re 
                        done’.  He hands me a $20 and I’m like, 
                        in this little kid voice...
                              (in high-pitched voice)
                        ‘The cost is $20 A PIECE.  For me and my 
                        co-worker’.  He wouldn’t give it. Just 
                        stood there. So Bartles looks this 
                        diamond-sized prick right in the face and 
                        says-- 

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        No, no.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Come on tell ‘em. You always fuck up the 
                        story right at the end, man.  Bartles 
                        says--

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (reluctantly)
                        Gimme the money, you fuckin’ cocksucker.   

           Laughter.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        This guy looked at us like we punched his 
                        mother in the face. This 14 year old just 
                        called him a fuckin’ cocksucker.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        So you’re out the $20?

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        No. Old Bartles here pries the rims off 
                        the guy’s car. With his bare fucking 
                        hands. We ride the bus two hours home 
                        carrying four rims to an Escalade.

           The gang cracks up.   

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Jesus, Bartles. Glad that yoga shit has 
                        mellowed you out.
                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (dead serious)
                        I don’t like people taking advantage of 
                        me. And I don’t like people taking 
                        advantage of my friends.

                                 MATT
                        You guys grew up together?  I didn’t know 
                        that.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Since we were this high.   

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Been in trouble ever since.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        We signed up together. This program 
                        called The Buddy System.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        I drive Meyers to the recruiter, in my 
                        mind so I could talk him out of it. Next 
                        thing I know, that fucking recruiter got 
                        us both. 

           The guys laugh.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        He was a real slick Rick, that one.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        They always are.  Mine said I’d see the 
                        whole world before my 21st birthday.  
                        Made it sound like a fucking Carnival 
                        Cruise.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Hell I walked in, said, ‘if I sign up 
                        could I shoot some guns’?  He said, ‘Yep.  
                        Big ones’.  Was on a bus the next day.   

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What about you, Ocre? Why’d you sign up?

                                 MATT
                        Never put much thought to it. My dad was 
                        in. So was my grandad. It’s just 
                        something you did, I guess.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Hey, Kidwell. How’d you end up here?  Get 
                        in line for the wrong bus? 
           PVT. KIDWELL (19), a translucent toothpick of freckled 
           white skin and orange buzz cut, sits alone at the end of 
           the table.  He listens to HEADPHONES, doesn’t acknowledge 
           Falvy, or anyone for that matter.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        Hey I’m talking to you, Kidwell.  

           Falvy pings some food off Kidwell’s tray.

           Kidwell looks over.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Falvy.  Knock it off.     

           Baker shakes his head, gives Falvy a hard stare.

           PVT. Kidwell grabs his tray and leaves.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Just trying to be inclusive, Sergeant.

           Falvy tosses some food in his mouth, smiles defiantly.

           INT. AIRPLANE HANGER--NIGHT

           Soldiers play poker, video games, enjoy the evening down 
           time.

           Matt sits on his bunk, writing.  Baker pops up from the 
           bottom bunk.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Writing a book?

                                 MATT
                        Journal.  Figure war is once in a 
                        lifetime, I might as well document it.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Who says you’ll want to remember it?

           The joke hits Matt a little too close.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Then again, if we don’t remember it how 
                        we gonna tell stories that scare the shit 
                        out of our grandkids.

           Matt laughs.
                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Hell, I can’t wait to scare kids with 
                        stories of blood and napalm. 

                                 MATT
                        Like my father and his before him.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        That is the natural order of things, 
                        isn’t it?

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        Lights out.  Lights out.

           All through the airplane hanger, soldiers scream ‘Light’s 
           Out’. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (yells)
                        Light’s out.
                              (to Matt)
                        Rest up, take your Malaria Pill.  And if 
                        you’re gonna take it, take it easy.  

                                 MATT
                        I’ll take it how I can get it.

                                 MATT/SSG. BAKER
                        And if it’s easy I’ll take it twice.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        ‘Night, bud.

           Baker gives him a pat on the shoulder and disappears to 
           the bottom bunk.

           Matt grabs his pill bottle, pops one in his hand, 
           hesitates--

           Insert Pill Bottle: MEFLOQUIN, MALARIA, 1EACH

                                 MATT
                        This whole place is a nightmare.

           He tosses it down the hatch, then lays back as lights shut 
           off overhead and the rolling blackness continues. 

                                                           FADE TO:
           EXT. CAMP ARIFJAN, KUWAIT--NEXT DAY

           Baker’s under the hood of a HUMMVEE. Matt’s in the 
           driver’s seat, checking gauges.

           The two struggle to be heard over the sound of a running 
           compressor.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You know the best part of my day?  

                                 MATT
                        Come again?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        The best part of my day. Right when I 
                        wake up. For about three seconds I think 
                        I’m back home, next to my fiance. Happens 
                        every morning.   

                                 MATT
                        What happens after those 3 seconds?

           Baker considers.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Well, I guess that’s the worst part of my 
                        day.

           Baker shuts off the compressor.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                              (Re: vehicle engine)
                        Wanna give me a hand with this? 

           Matt grabs a rag and checks under the hood.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        So, let me ask you.  What are you doing 
                        here?

                                 MATT
                        Fixing a Hummer.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        ‘S not what I mean.  You’re a smart kid.  
                        Smarter than most of these rock heads.  
                        Why aren’t you ‘being all you can be’ 
                        somewhere the fuck else?

                                 MATT
                        Like I said. My dad did was in, his dad.
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        So you came to make papa proud.  Is he?

                                 MATT
                        Wouldn’t know. He went AWOL when I was 
                        eight.  

           Baker stops.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        It bother you?

                                 MATT
                        I’m sure he had his reasons.  Fuck ‘em.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Remember him at all?

                                 MATT
                        Just the day he left. Said he was going 
                        for a coke, never came back.  Now I only 
                        drink Pepsi outta spite.

           Baker cracks a smile.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (re: Hummer)
                        Try the ignition.

           Matt turns the engine over and it sputters to life.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Bingo.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT (O.S.)
                        Lovely day for the infantry, Sergeant 
                        Baker.

           SGM. MCELLIGOT (50’s) approaches--a man carved from stone, 
           his face the grizzled pages of past wars. With him is 1LT 
           AISLAGER (30’s) the Commanding Officer of Matt’s unit.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Huah, Sergeant Major.  LT. Which way’s 
                        the shit rolling?

                                 1LT. AISLAGER 
                        Downhill. As always.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        Just as gravity intended, my boy. 
                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        General wants us in the mess tent in 20 
                        mikes.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        The General? What’s he--

           McElligot, Aislager don’t respond. Something is up.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        We got about an hour left on this Humvee.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        20 Mikes. Round everyone up.    

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Yes, sir.

           McElligot and Aislager walk off.  

                                 MATT
                        What’s up?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        If anyone knew, it wouldn’t be the U.S. 
                        Army, would it? Clean up.

           Matt scrubs his hand with a rag, watches McElligot and 
           Aislager in the distance.

           INT. MESS TENT--DAWN

           The might of Matt’s unit (300 soldiers strong), pack it in 
           the mess tent, oddly pristine.  White table cloths don 
           each table.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Well, look at this.  Some Chateau on the 
                        Green type shit.

           A ROW OF KUWAITI SERVANTS enter with large plates of food.  
           It’s a make shift banquet:  bread rolls, sandwich meat, 
           ice cream.  Nothing too special, but to these men it might 
           as well be Spago.     

           They are served.

                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                        Mmm. Mmm.  Golden, fluffy ass biscuits. 
                        If I had some gravy these’d be just like 
                        back home.

           Meyers notices Bartles isn’t touching his food.
                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                        Hey Bartles.  You only eat MRE’s now?

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (Knowingly)
                        Meyers, when’s the last time the Army did 
                        something nice for you?

           Meyers keeps chewing, unaware of what’s next.

           THE GENERAL enters from the side door.  The place jumps to 
           attention.  A pin could drop and there’d be an echo. God 
           has just arrived.

                                 GENERAL 
                        At ease.  Sit down, gentleman.  How’s the 
                        food?

                                 ALL
                        Huah.

                                 GENERAL 
                        Good.  Good.  Anybody that don’t lick 
                        their plate clean gets sent home and 
                        misses all the fun.

                                 ALL
                              (laughing)
                        Huah.

                                 GENERAL 
                        Now.  I consider everyone here lucky for 
                        two reasons. One: You were assigned, by 
                        the grace of our Lord and savior Jesus 
                        Christ, to my Brigade.  Which means you 
                        have the best military training on God’s 
                        green earth.  You are tough, you are 
                        ruthless, you are lions. And whoever’s 
                        waiting over that border, if they’re not 
                        scared yet, is about to get scared 
                        because we are coming and we are not 
                        stopping until Baghdad.  

           Beat.

                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        Two:  The average age in this Brigade... 
                        is 20. Now, gentleman, I’m an old man.  
                        And I envy your position because tonight 
                        we move to the staging area, and before 
                        sunrise you young men will lead all the 
                        iron and brass of this United States Army 
                        over the berm and straight into the heart 
                        of Baghdad.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        You will spend the rest of your long 
                        lives telling people you meet how you 
                        made history.  Enjoy tonight.  Tomorrow, 
                        you get your war.      

           The men snap to attention as the General exits. 

           Matt’s eyes dart about, palms sweaty, heart pounding 
           through his chest.  

           EXT. CAMP ARIFJAN, KUWAIT-NIGHT

           An approaching SANDSTORM sends gale force winds through 
           camp.  Canvas and leather straps flutter in its wake. 

                                 RADIO CHATTER
                        Base to Chalk 3.  You are clear to roll, 
                        Chalk 3.  

           AIRPLANE HANGER-NIGHT

           Now completely empty--a lonely stretch of bunks--a ghost 
           town.

           MATT’S VEHICLE-NIGHT

           Matt’s in the back seat, SGT. Falvy beside him.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Looks like it’s go time. Cigarette? 

                                 MATT
                        Don’t smoke.

           Falvy exhales a cloud of smoke, chest heaves with 
           excitement.

           Outside, Bartles and Meyers do their customary handshake 
           and fist bump. 

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Keep me safe up there.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Will do.

           Bartles pulls his balaclava over his mouth, sticks his 
           boot in the tire well, and climbs into the turret.
           FRONT OF THE CONVOY-SAME

           SGM. McElligot grabs the radio receiver, hops to the roof 
           of his Hummer, the storm at his back, and speaks to his 
           unit.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        I say unto you, as the Lord said unto the 
                        Hittites while standing upon Mt. Arad 
                        with his arms outstretched looking down 
                        upon the multitudes.

           MATT’S VEHICLE--SAME

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        I love it when he does this.

           FRONT OF CONVOY--SAME

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        In a deep guttural tone the Lord looked 
                        down and said, “Hittites.  Ateeen-shun”.

           Laughter from the vehicles.  

           The Sergeant Major loves this shit--an old man at home at 
           the brink of war.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT (CONT’D)
                        The Hittites responded in kind.  The Lord 
                        then said, “Riiiiiight.  Face”.  Then, 
                        unto them he spoke those most feared 
                        words in the Hittite infantry, “Double 
                        Tiiiimmmmeee...”  

                                 ALL
                        Double Tiiiiimmmeee...

                                 SGM MCELLIGOT
                        Double Tiiiiimmmeee.  March.  

           The Sergeant Major fires up his engine, horns honk, and 
           the rest follow suit all the way to the back.

           Matt’s engine fires, he closes his eyes, breathes deep.  

           The convoy lurches to life, an endless serpent slithering 
           towards the sandstorm, into the heart of the unforgiving 
           desert.  

                                                           FADE TO:
           EXT. BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS-DUSK

           Oil fields burn.  Black smoke mixes with the orange glow 
           of the rising sun.  It’d be a beautiful sight if not for 
           RAT TAT TAT--GUNFIRE, crackling like a campfire.

           Matt’s unit is a few hundred yards behind CHARLIE TEAM--
           pinned down in an irrigation ditch, taking fire from 
           buildings in the city.  

           SGM. McElligot stands calm, his eyes trained on the 
           BAGHDAD AIRPORT.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                              (yells)
                        All the way to airport, boys. All the 
                        way.  

           Kidwell hunkers in the fetal position behind a hummer, his 
           hands shake as he puts on his HEADPHONES. 

           A FEW SOLDIERS do the 100 yard dash to a dirt embankment.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (yells)
                        We’re up.  Let’s go.

           Baker, Matt and his team dash to the irrigation ditch to 
           link up with CHARLIE.  

           Bartles carries his SAW, the massive hunk of weaponry, 
           with one arm and SPRINTS like there’s no tomorrow.    

           Bullets ping around their feet.

           The guys arrive safely, take cover and fan out. 

           Bartles sets up the bipod and unleashes a flurry of 
           rounds.  

           Matt looks down the barrel of his rifle, sees muzzle 
           flashes coming from a BUILDING in the city.

           He breathes, squeezes the trigger but his weapon jams.  
           Half a round’s stuck in the ejection port.  Can’t pry it 
           out.

           Falvy runs over.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Sergeant Baker.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Yeah.
                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Charlie is putting together a flank.  
                        They’re taking the airport.  Permission 
                        to join.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        All you, brotha’.  If you want in.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Kidding me?

                                 MATT
                        Watch that building there. I just saw a 
                        bunch of muzzle flashes in the windows.  

           Matt points.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Which building?

                                 MATT
                        Off to your 3.

           Falvy and Baker look, don’t see it.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (to Baker)
                        I’m taking the kid.  We’ll get close and 
                        he can point out the building.

           Matt stops.  He just stepped in shit and knows it.  He 
           looks to Baker for help.

           Baker considers.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Take him.

           Falvy grabs Matt by the LBE and pulls him to his feet.

           The two haul ass to join--

           CHARLIE UNIT

           They drop down with the others, take cover in an 
           irrigation ditch.

           Falvy fires.  Matt’s weapon is still jammed.

           Falvy grabs Matt’s weapon, yanks back the Charging Handle.  
           The stuck round flies out.  
           Falvy hocks a gob of spit on the expelled round and jams 
           it back in Matt’s hand. Slimy. 

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Spit on your rounds, you’re getting sand 
                        in the mag. 

                                 CHARLIE TEAM LEADER
                        We’re moving.  Let’s go, go.

           We’re running alongside Falvy and Matt, the rear men in a 
           TWELVE PERSON chain, as they sprint through the ditch.  

           The team posts up behind a bullet-riddled building on the 
           outskirts of the city.  

           CHARLIE TEAM LEADER peeks around the corner.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (to Charlie Team Leader)
                        Hey, Sergeant.  The Private here knows 
                        where the gunfire’s coming from.

                                 CHARLIE TEAM LEADER
                        Well get him up here.

           Matt’s pushed to the front of the formation, leans against 
           the wall.  

                                 CHARLIE TEAM LEADER 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Go on.  Get eyes on the building.

           Matt doesn’t move.

                                 CHARLIE TEAM LEADER 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry.  These Hajis can’t shoot 
                        shit. 

           Matt slowly peeks his head around the corner.

           Matt’s P.O.V.:

           --a BLUE AWNING BUILDING.  Gunfire from the windows.

           Matt ducks back.

                                 MATT
                        Blue awning, first floor.  

           The guys nod.
           Charlie Team Leader peels half the platoon off, leads them 
           into the city. We’ll call this new team CHARLIE TWO.

           Falvy leads a team of SIX GUYS, CHARLIE TEAM ONE, into a 
           nearby DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE, across from the BLUE AWNING 
           BUILDING. 

           INT. BAGHDAD, DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE-CONTINUOUS

           Matt, Falvy, and Charlie One charge up a flight of stairs.

           A bullet smashes through a window and strikes the soldier 
           right in front of Matt.  Blood splatters.

           The wall gets pounded with lead, incessant and unending. 
           Falvy returns fire out the window.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (into Radio)
                        Contact.  Contact.  Southeast building.

           The downed soldier screams in pain, bleeds from shoulder 
           and mouth. 

           Falvy hoists the downed soldier into a fireman carry.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                              (to Matt)
                        Shoot that mother fucker.

           Matt sticks his weapon out the window, FIRES BLINDLY.

           Falvy tears ass up FLIGHTS OF STAIRS, the wounded warrior 
           over shoulder, as if the guy were a feather.  

           EXT. DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE, ROOFTOP-CONTINUOUS

           Falvy kicks in the door to the roof.  He dumps the wounded 
           soldier to the ground, posts up against a brick overhang.

           EXT. BAGHDAD OUTSKIRTS, BAKER’S CONVOY-SAME

           Baker spies the situation through his binocs.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        They’re made. Let’s move, move.

           The guys peel off, 2X2, back to their vehicles.
           DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE ROOFTOP, CHARLIE ONE-CONTINUOUS

           A medic tends to the wounded soldier. Plunges morphine 
           into his leg.  

           Matt emerges on the rooftop, slides in next to Falvy.

                                 RADIO CHATTER
                        Charlie Two, in position.  Repeat, 
                        Charlie Two in position.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (into radio)
                        Roger, Two.  Charlie One ready.
                              (yells to soldiers)
                        Fire, Fire, Fire. 

           Falvy and Charlie One send a barrage of brass downrange.

           Bullet casings litter the roof.

           A SOLDIER lets loose an AT-4 ROCKET LAUNCHER at the BLUE 
           AWNING BUILDING.  He fires it inches from Matt’s ears.

           Matt drops his weapon, cradles his ears in pain.

           The rocket hits with a loud boom, sending brick fragments 
           everywhere.

           STREET LEVEL, CHARLIE TWO--SAME

           The six man team, led by Charlie Team Leader, slides down 
           a narrow alleyway toward the insurgent stronghold. 

           BAKER’S VEHICLE-CONTINUOUS

           Hummers tear ass across a BRIDGE into the city--Meyers in 
           the driver seat, pedal to the metal.

           Bartles up top, his machine gun belching rounds into the 
           city.    

           STREET LEVEL, CHARLIE TWO--SAME

           The team enters the BLUE AWNING BUILDING.

           ROOFTOP, CHARLIE ONE-CONTINUOUS

           Matt watches as Charlie Two lights up the inside of the 
           building with gunfire--clearing floor after floor.
           The gunfire ceases.  Quiet.  

           ROOFTOP, CHARLIE TWO--CONTINUOUS

           A canister pings across the roof, then bellows purple 
           smoke into the heavens.  

           Charlie Team Leader steps through the smoke and into view.

           ROOFTOP CHARLIE ONE--SAME

                                 CHARLIE TEAM LEADER
                              (over radio )
                        Charlie Team to Noble Lion.  Building 
                        secure, over.

           Falvy slumps down, beaten and exhausted.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (re:  Wounded Soldier)
                        How is he?

           The MEDIC nods.  It’s gonna be okay. 

           Falvy looks to Matt, still cradling his ears, his face 
           drained of its color.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                              (to Matt)
                        You gonna puke?

                                 MATT
                        What? I can’t hear--

           Falvy laughs, gives Matt a pat on the helmet.

           BAKER’S VEHICLE--SAME

           They roll past--

           ROAD SIGN:  BAGHDAD 

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        I fucking did it. Get ready to drop those 
                        panties ladies of Overland Park.  Ol’ 
                        Jared Meyers, Hero, will be home soon.   
           EXT. BAGHDAD, DILAPIDATED WAREHOUSE--DAY

           Matt and Falvy walk out of the building, are met by their 
           convoy.

           SMILING IRAQIS crowd the Hummer.  They clamor to shake 
           Matt’s hand, their liberator.    

           A battered Falvy throws his gear in the Hummer, hops in 
           the passenger seat next to Meyers. 

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        I tell you man, back home I was fucking 
                        broads that were maybe, 3’s, 4’s?
                        With a story like this, I’ll be banging 
                        6’s, maybe even a 7 if I get a drunk 
                        patriot.

           Falvy cracks a smile.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Ocre.  You Okay?

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        He can’t hear you.

           Baker grabs Matt, leans in and yells--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Ocre.  How do you feel?

                                 MATT
                        Underpaid.  

           Baker laughs. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I’ll pass your complaint to Management.

           A grin creeps onto Matt’s face.  He steps back, looks in 
           awe of the sights around him, a front row seat to history 
           being forged.

                                                           FADE TO:

           EXT. BAGHDAD--MORNING 

           The IRAQI CALL TO PRAYER sounds through sparsely populated 
           streets.  A MAN kneels in prayer on the roof of his home 
           as the sun rises behind him.

           A stray dog rummages through trash on the roadside.
           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--SAME

           Now a developed, fully functioning Army Base.

           A game of Rugby takes place on the tarmac.

           INT. CMOC COMMAND-SAME

           A small TV in the corner plays stock footage of the now 
           infamous MISSION ACCOMPLISHED BANNER. In the lower corner--
           the date: May 1, 2003.  We pull back to reveal-- 

           The CMOC: The heart of military planning and strategy for 
           Matt’s unit.  A beehive buzzing with activity.  Maps 
           wallpaper floor to ceiling.  

           SSG. Baker observes the MISSION BOARD, mug of coffee in 
           hand.

           A COMMUNICATIONS SOLDIER relays info over the radio.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        My boys rolling out?

                        Roger that, Sergeant.  Psyop convoy’s 
                        ahead of them.

           Baker grabs a radio receiver.

                        Just getting in some bronzing time.

           OUTSIDE HUMMER--SAME

           Matt leans against the Hummer, drives a REMOTE CONTROL 
           RACE CAR through the camp.

                                 SGT. BARTLES (O.S.)
                        Next one.

           Bartles is in the turret, taping the triggers down on the 
           race car guns, and mounting them to the Hummer’s roof.

           Matt hands him the remote, tears into the packaging of 
           another TOY RACE CAR.

                                 MATT
                        You think this’ll work?

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        IED’s detonate on frequencies.  Same 
                        thing that opens garage doors or controls 
                        race cars.  If the frequency matches, 
                        it’ll detonate before we’re in the kill 
                        zone.  

                                 MATT
                              (skeptical)
                        There’s a lot of frequencies, Sergeant.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Yeah.  Well we’re safe from six of ‘em.

                        Anyone see Kidwell?

           They look to each other, no answer.  Meyer’s rolls his

           INT. CMOC COMMAND--SAME

           Baker sips his coffee.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (yells)
                        Who in the hell brewed this shit?  

                                 COMMS SOLDIER
                        I did.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Christ.  Well, you’re fired.

                                 COMMS SOLDIER
                        I wish.

           1LT. Aislager walks into the CMOC, a concerned look on his 
           face.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Sergeant Baker.  This way, please.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What is it LT?

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Just bring your ass and stow the 
                        questions.

           Baker sets his coffee on the table, whispers to the COMMS 
           SOLDIER--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Brew better shit tomorrow.  Take pride in 
                        your work, for shit’s sake.

           Baker follows after Aislager.

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--DAY

           PVT. Kidwell fills a sandbag, ties it off, throws it on a 
           pile.  His movements robotic, mechanical.

           Matt marches toward him, agitated.  His gear in hand.

                                 MATT
                        Kidwell.  You know it’s your turn on the 
                        rotation.

           No response.
                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        You understand that if you don’t go, I 
                        have to take your place.  It’s not fair.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                        Matt, will you help me take these to my 
                        room?

                                 MATT
                        Your room?  What--

           Falvy calls out from his convoy, about to roll out the 
           gate.

                                 SGT. FALVY (O.S.)
                        Ocre.  Let’s go.    

           Matt puts on his helmet, resigned to go on the mission.

                                 MATT
                        You know you’re pissing everyone off? 
                        You’ll get in serious shit you keep 
                        refusing to leave the wire.

           Kidwell hoists a sandbag over shoulder.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL 
                        Do you think we’ll get to go home soon?

           Matt shakes his head and runs off to join the convoy.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (re: Kidwell)
                        Let it go.  Kid’s a waste of space.

           Matt hops in the Hummer--with Meyers, Bartles and Falvy-- 
           already on the move.

                                 MATT
                        What’s the mission today?

           The guys look to each other.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Transport.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BAGHDAD--DAY

           Matt looks at the corpse of a DEAD TERRORIST, splayed out 
           on a steel slab, it’s body frozen blue.  
                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        One, Two, Up.

           Bartles and Meyers grab either side and heft the body up 
           into the back of the hummer.

                                 MATT
                              (to Himself)
                        Transport.  Right.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Load it up.  Ocre, you ride in the back 
                        with the Haji.

                                 MATT
                        What?  Why do I have to ride in the back?

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        ‘Cause Bartles is in the turret, Meyers 
                        is driving, and fuck you.  That’s why.

           Matt reluctantly climbs in the back.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        Hurry it up.  We gotta get this popsicle 
                        to the morgue.

           Falvy zips the canvas, and locks Matt in the dark with the 
           corpse. 

           INT. HUMMER, CAB--LATER

           Meyers drives, Falvy rides shotgun.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        But that’s my point though.  Army tells 
                        you to go this way, go that way.  In a 
                        few months this shit’ll be over.  I’m 
                        starting a business.  Uncle Sam is the 
                        last boss I’ll ever have, tell you that 
                        much.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Meyers I respect you, but who in the shit 
                        is gonna lend you money for a business? 
                        First United Bank of Retards?  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        You let me worry about the specifics.

           Honks horn.
                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                              (to traffic)
                        Make room.  Clear a path.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Wait, wait. Slow up a minute.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        What is it?

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Stop the vehicle.

           HUMMER, BACK--SAME

           Matt sits in the dark, stuck listening to the rambling 
           conversation up front, and the commotion outside.

           The vehicle slows to a halt.

                                 MATT
                        We there?

           No answer.   

           HUMMER, CAB--SAME

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (into radio)
                        Noble Lion, this is Eagle One, over.

                                 RADIO
                        Go ahead Eagle One.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        We got a pile of trash up ahead with what 
                        looks like wires running into the dirt, 
                        over.

                                 RADIO
                        What’s your location, over?

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Center of the marketplace.  It’s pretty 
                        crowded, over.

                                 RADIO
                        Hold tight Eagle One.  EOD is making the 
                        rounds, over.

                        Copy that.

           Meyers bangs on the roof.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                              (yells to Bartles)
                        Might as well dismount, Bartles.  We’re 
                        gonna be stuck here a while.  

           HUMMER, BACK--SAME

           Matt swigs water--peeks through the side of the canvas to 
           see the city outside.

                                 MATT
                        Can I get out?

           Falvy peels back the canvas.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Hell, no.  These people see us riding 
                        around with a dead body they’ll go 
                        ballistic.  Stay put.

           Falvy zips the flap closed.

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--DAY

           1LT. Aislager and SSG. Baker journey through camp.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER 
                        0200 this morning an Apache spotted a 
                        weapons exchange, unleashed hell on a 
                        truck filled with RPG’s.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Where?

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Small village about an hour north.  Town 
                        called Baqubah.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        A Toyota filled with dead terrorists 
                        isn’t exactly a big problem.
                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        No.  The big fucking problem is the big 
                        fucking hole we left in their Aqueduct 
                        when the Apache fired on ‘em without 
                        clearance.   

           A SOLDIER walks by, salutes Aislager.  He returns the 
           gesture.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER (CONT’D)
                        Baqubah has no water supply and the 
                        townspeople think it’s our fault. If this 
                        thing boils over, if the village turns on 
                        the few SF soldiers holding it together--
                        we lose the town.  Command’s gonna ask 
                        for volunteers.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Are you shitting, me?  LT, listen.  The 
                        guys are already chattering about going 
                        home.  We’ve been sitting on our thumbs 
                        for months, no one’s gonna volunteer for 
                        this.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Then you volun-tell them.  Look, this war 
                        is shaping up to be longer than Command 
                        expected. And if fixing pipes for a few 
                        weeks gets me home sooner, then fine. But 
                        I believe in leading by example.  Which 
                        is why I’m going, the Sergeant Major is 
                        going...and so are you.

           Baker stops.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER (CONT’D)
                        Your men are on missions until the end of 
                        the day.  I suggest you use that time to 
                        think of some rousing words.  And I mean 
                        channel Lombardi, my friend.

           Aislager steps off, leaving Baker still amidst the buzzing 
           camp.

           EXT. MATT’S VEHICLE--SAME

           Falvy and Meyers lean against the hummer, their helmets 
           and kevlars off.  

           BOOM.  

           Dust and debris shoots to the sky, blankets the 
           surrounding palm trees.
                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Gob Bless EOD. You imagine getting nailed 
                        by one of those?

           HUMMER, BACK--SAME

           Matt sits up, puts his sweat-drenched LBE back on.

                                 MATT
                        Hey Bartles.  We all clear?

                                 SGT. BARTLES (O.S.)
                        Sure enough.

                                 MATT
                              (to Himself)
                        Thank God.  It’s a goddamn sauna back 
                        here.  

           Matt leans back.

           The sound of CRACK CRACK startles him.

           He looks to the body.  

           CRACK CRACK, the fingers of the body slowly curl.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                              (yells to Bartles)
                        Hey man.  This fucking thing is moving.  

                                 SGT. BARTLES (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 MATT
                        He’s alive, man.  This fucking thing is 
                        moving.

           Matt scrambles to the back, rips open the canvas.  

           Falvy and Meyers take their seats back in the cab, close 
           the door.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Ocre.  Stop the fucking commotion.

                                 MATT
                        He’s alive, man.  I saw it.

           Meyers unsnaps the canvas, looks in back.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        What in the shit are you talking--
           CRACK CRACK.  The leg moves and jumps.

                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit.

           Meyers yells, pulls his 9mm and points it at the body.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Will you nancies please stop screaming in 
                        my ear.  It’s what, 113 degrees?  The 
                        thing is just thawing out.  That’s why 
                        it’s jumping around like a catfish.

           Matt and Meyers sigh a deep relief.

           From the turret, the muted sound of Bartles laughing.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                              (yells to Bartles)
                        It’s not fucking funny, Chuck.  

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Oh, I’m gonna have to disagree, my 
                        friend.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Almost had a fucking heart attack.

           Matt sighs relief.

                                 MATT
                        I hate transport missions.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, MAIN GATE--LATER

           Matt’s convoy rolls through the main gate.  Meyers gives a 
           nod to the GATE GUARD and drives onto base.

           EXT. WEAPONS CLEARING STATION--DAY

           Bartles helps Matt out of the back of the Hummer.  Matt’s 
           drenched in sweat, salt stains around his collar.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Christ, you look like you went swimming?

           Matt grabs his M16 and stumbles to the clearing barrel. 

                                 MATT
                        No ventilation back there.  
                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        That’s why I ride up top.  Cool breezes, 
                        sunshine.  I see more of the country than 
                        anyone else.

           Bartles cocks the hammer back on his Machine Gun, clears 
           his weapon into a barrel.

                                 SGT. BARTLES (CONT’D)
                              (yells re: Weapon)
                        Clear.

                                 MATT
                        You can have the cool breeze--  

           Matt clears his weapon.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        --couldn’t pay me enough to ride the 
                        turret. We hit shit, all the gunfire’s 
                        coming your way, buddy.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Yeah. But when we get home I’ll remember 
                        the breeze and the countryside, you’ll 
                        remember sitting in the dark, sweating 
                        your ass off.   

           Bartles winks, pats Matt on the shoulder and walks back to 
           the vehicle.

           INT. MATT’S ROOM--LATER

           The guys dump gear on bunks. Matt tips his boot upside 
           down, sand tumbles out.

           Baker enters, all eyes turn toward him. He’s all business.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Hey, can you guys circle up for a minute?

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Sergeant Baker.  What’s up my brother 
                        from another mother? 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Grab a seat, Meyers. You guys know, even 
                        without this uniform and this war, I 
                        consider you my friends, right?  
                        Something came down today--

           He stops.
           Eyes shoot around the room.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        What is it, Sergeant?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        As we sit here, there’s a whole village 
                        without water.  They’re dying.  And it’s 
                        our fault. Our fault because our Apaches 
                        destroyed their aqueduct. It’s our fault 
                        because we sit here now and do nothing.  
                        But that can change.  If you want it to.  
                        I need some volunteers to come with me to 
                        Baqubah.  

           Off their reaction.

                                 MATT
                        What’s Baqubah?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Baqubah is no picnic.  It’s not all Flip-
                        Flops and Yahtzee like it is here.  

           The guys crack an uneasy smile.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        So look.  We all got enough medals to be 
                        decorated like a Christmas Tree.  But is 
                        that why you’re here?  Get some medals, 
                        go home, be in a parade. You’re here 
                        because you got the balls to believe you 
                        matter.  If you didn’t have balls you’d 
                        be at home wearing a backwards cap to a 
                        Frat Party.  It’s time to matter.  I need 
                        names on the Mission Board before lights 
                        out.        

           Baker looks right at Matt.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        If we go, can we get the SAT phone? Make 
                        a call home.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I’ll make sure it happens.

           With that, Baker exits.  The room is left to deal with 
           their sentence.  
           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--NIGHT

           Matt sits on the steps outside his building, lost in 
           thought.

           A CAMEL SPIDER crawls slowly toward his flip-flop. Inches 
           closer.  Matt raises his foot gently, brings it down easy 
           on the spiders back, kills it. 

           He scrapes the remains on concrete.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL (O.S.)
                        Hey, Private Ocre.

           Kidwell unloads two sandbags, takes a seat next to Matt.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL (CONT’D)
                        Happy May Day.  You know what May Day is?

                                 MATT
                        No.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                        Me neither.  I was thinking, you know, 
                        how funny it is no one knows what it is 
                        but we celebrate it anyway.  Don’t you 
                        think that’s funny? 

           Matt waits for Kidwell to leave.  He doesn’t. 

                                 MATT
                        Kidwell.  Doesn’t it bother you how the 
                        guys look at you?  They think you’re a 
                        pussy, man. 

           Kidwell considers.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                        My Pastor says we’re all walking hand and 
                        hand to the same finish line.  He’s 
                        right.  Some of us cross it a little 
                        sooner, I guess.  I don’t mind being 
                        called names.  Just want to go home is 
                        all.  

           Kidwell picks up his sandbags and heads inside.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL (CONT’D)
                        See you in the morning, Private Ocre.

           Matt looks under his foot, sees the spider twitching it’s 
           last moments of life.

                                                            CUT TO:
           INT. MATT’S ROOM-NIGHT

           In the corner bunk, Bartles has his M-249 disassembled, 
           cleans it.  

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        I’m going.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Fuck.  I knew it.  

           Bartles shakes his head.

                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                        Man, you’ve done more for this unit than 
                        anyone.  Take a rest for shit’s sake. 

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        I gotta go.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Then me, too. You go, I go. You want that 
                        on your conscience?

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        You’re a grown man. You choose to go 
                        that’s your decision.  

           Bartles lays back in his bunk.  That’s the end of that.

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, ROOF-NIGHT 

           SSG. Baker stands alone on the roof, a SAT PHONE in hand.

           The roof door slams, Matt’s in the doorway.

                                 MATT
                        I can come back. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        No it’s fine.  Just called my fiance.

                                 MATT
                        How is she?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Caught the answering machine.

           Baker pats a spot on the roof’s edge.

                                 MATT
                        Get your volunteers?
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        No one’s said anything.  

                                 MATT
                        If no one does?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        They will. 

           Matt sits next to Baker, dangles his feet over the edge.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        So why are you up here, Ocre? You here to 
                        tell me your name’s on the mission board?

                                 MATT
                        I just think the other guys are better 
                        for this kind of thing.  You know. 
                        Bartles is tough as nails. Falvy isn’t 
                        scared of anything--  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Falvy’s a great soldier, but he’s a 
                        child. He sees a fire he’s gotta put his 
                        hand in it. I need someone there who can 
                        see the big picture. Who’s smart. 

                                 MATT
                        Sergeant, I’m not like you guys. Hell, I 
                        throw up every time my name is on the 
                        mission board. Every time.   

           Baker looks out into the lights of Baghdad.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        My dad used to say, ‘Joel, there’s a 
                        bullet out there for everyone.  Their 
                        name’s carved real small on the side, and 
                        it’s comin’.  Now, maybe my bullet is 
                        waiting out there in Baqubah. Maybe my 
                        bullet is cancer and it’ll catch me 
                        eighty years from now back in Kansas 
                        City.         

           Baker sets the SAT Phone next to Matt. Stands to leave.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        But that’s not up to me.  The stakes of 
                        the game are always life or death.  And 
                        that won’t change, even if you stay 
                        behind.  

                                 MATT
                        If I don’t volunteer?
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        If you don’t volunteer then I was wrong 
                        about you.  And I can’t have someone I 
                        was wrong about watching my back.  But if 
                        you do decide to go, the SAT phone is 
                        right there, and you got a call to make.

           The heavy metal of the roof door slams.  Matt’s left to 
           stare at the phone, and the phone back at him.

           He reaches for it, holds it, his thumb over the keypad.

           INT. HALLWAY-LATER

           Baker uses his flashlight to navigate the halls while his 
           unit sleeps. He comes to--

           INT. CMOC-CONTINUOUS

           Now dark and lifeless.  He finds THE MISSION BOARD. 

           He finds BAQUBAH, and follows it down to see the list of 
           names:  Aislager, McElligot, Baker, Falvy, Bartles, Meyers

           And finally, at the very bottom--

           Ocre.

           Baker smiles his approval. Leaves the room dark.

           INT. BATHROOM-SAME

           Matt heaves his nervous guts into the toilet, arms wrapped 
           around porcelain.

                                                           FADE TO:

           INT. MATT’S ROOM-MORNING

           The room comes alive. It’s barely 0500 but it’s Mission 
           Day.  

           Soldiers pace back and forth across the room.  Rounds are 
           loaded into magazines.  Gloves are stretched over fingers.  

           Bartles tapes some lose straps on Meyers’s vest--rips the 
           tape with his teeth.
                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        There.  Now you don’t look like a soup 
                        sandwich.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Ain’t gotta look good.  Just gotta do 
                        good.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Shit. Looking good’s the most important 
                        part.

           Matt slips into a Flak Vest--visibly nervous, lost in 
           thought.

           Baker leans toward him, tries to ease the anxiety.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        We’re right here next to you, understand?  
                        No one’s by themselves out there.

           Matt nods.  Baker pats him on the chest--no body armor.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Where’re your plates?

                                 MATT
                        Not enough to go around.

                                 SGT. BAKER
                        Christ.  
                              (to the room)
                        Yo.  Someone cough up a plate.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Here.  Take one of mine.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        No, Bartles.  You’re up top. Falvy give 
                        him one of yours.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        What?  Fuck that.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Falvy. Now.

           Falvy relents, slams a plate into Matt’s chest.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Here.  Now you gotta ask yourself, “Am I 
                        more likely to get shot in the chest, or 
                        in the back?” Choose wisely.
           Matt winces, pries the plate from his chest.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT  (V.O.)
                        Our Route is North up Highway One to 
                        Baqubah.  

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, MAIN GATE-DAY

           The team rallies up by their vehicles for the pre-mission 
           briefing.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        There’ve been consistent IED attacks 
                        along the route, as it’s the only road 
                        into or out of the village.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        A vehicle got hit there just yesterday.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        So maintain convoy integrity, and 
                        maintain radio contact.    

           The soldiers hang on every word, focused--each a wound top 
           ready to spin. 

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, MAIN GATE-DAY

           The vehicles exit the main gate.  The GATE GUARD eyes Matt 
           as they pass.  

           IRAQI CHILDREN smile and wave.  

           I/E. HUMMER, HWY 1-LATER

           Tires crunch blacktop, carrying our guys into the unknown.  

           Up in the turret, Bartles surveys his territory.  

           Matt has his M-16 trained out the window.  He shifts in 
           his seat, trying to find comfort. The silence is broken by-
           -

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Hey, guys.  Eleven O’Clock.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What do you got, Meyers.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Wait for it.  Wait for it--
           The guys pass A BURNT VEHICLE, the charred remains of a 
           dead Iraqi slouched in the driver’s seat.  Gruesome.  

           The guys sit back, each taken aback by the sight.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (re: The Body)
                        You lose, asshole.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Meyers let’s save the alerts for actual 
                        threats.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Roger that, Sergeant.  

           Matt taps Baker on the shoulder.

                                 MATT
                        We just leave the body on the side of the 
                        road?  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Someone’ll be along to pick it up.

           Back in the turret, Bartles sees an IRAQI CAR speed  
           toward the convoy.

           Bartles spins his machine gun, faces the car.  He watches 
           the car get closer.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (yells)
                        Meyers.  This guys’ gonna try to pass.

           Meyers checks the rear view, sees the car right on his 
           tail.  

           It swerves to pass, honks.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Mother fucker.

           Meyers swerves to block the advance.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Hey.  Get the fuck back asshole.

           Matt pokes his head out the window and see what Bartles 
           sees:  a vehicle right on their ass.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Shit.  Don’t let this guy into the 
                        convoy.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT'D)
                              (into Radio)
                        Noble Lion 1, this is Eagle Five.  We got 
                        a hostile, over.

           No sooner does the message get out, Bartles FIRES A ROUND 
           up over the hood of the car.  A warning.

           The Iraqi car screeches to a halt.

           Bartles watches the vehicle become smaller in the 
           distance.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Guess he understood that.  

           Then, the vehicle peels rubber, coming up on the convoy 
           fast.  

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (into Radio)
                        Eagle Five making the arrest, over.
                              (to his soldiers)
                        This thing screeches to a halt, everyone 
                        descend on that son of a bitch.  

           Matt nods, nervous.   

           The Iraqi car comes up fast.  

           Meyer’s slams the brakes, tires smoke.  

           Bartles FIRES A FEW SHOTS over the Iraqi vehicle’s roof.

           The guys dismount.  Guns drawn.  

           But Matt is stuck.  His LBE Vest is caught in the seat 
           belt.  He jerks, pulls.  Nothing.  

           He leans out the side window to see:

           Falvy reach inside the Iraqi car and RIP THE MAN OUT the 
           driver’s side window.

           Baker, Meyers, and Bartles are right on him, their weapons 
           in the man’s face.

           Matt sits back.  He missed it.

           Falvy zip ties the guy, Baker runs back to the vehicle.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Private Ocre.  What the fuck do you think 
                        you’re doing?
                                 MATT
                        I got stuck, Sergeant--

           Baker, fuming, reaches over and puts both hands on Matt’s 
           chest.  He rips at the Velcro and the vest opens.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        When I say get outta the fucking car, 
                        that means outta the fucking car.  If 
                        your vest is stuck, then you take it off 
                        and go without it, understand?  

           Falvy walks back, the arrested Iraqi in tow. 

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Your safety is not more important than 
                        all of ours. 

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (to Matt, harsh sarcasm)
                        Why didn’t I think of that? Staying in 
                        the car.  It is a lot fucking safer. Good 
                        idea, Ocre.

           Matt hangs his head.  He fucked up.

           EXT. BAQUBAH-LATER

           Their convoy fights it’s way through a crowd of angry 
           Iraqi Protestors. 

           Fists and bottles slam against the vehicles.

           MATT’S VEHICLE--SAME

           Hands claw at him.  A stark contrast to the welcome he 
           received in Baghdad.

           Falvy takes an AXE HANDLE and prods away the masses.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE, MAIN GATE--SAME

           The vehicles wind through a chicane of sand barrels.  A 
           sign welcomes them--

           CAMP WARHORSE

           Spray painted underneath:

           SPA & RESORT
           Matt sees:

           An SF SOLDIER grab the edge of the concertina wire, peel 
           it back--usher in Matt’s convoy.

           The SF Soldier wears no helmet, only a beige baseball cap 
           with an AMERICAN FLAG Velcro-ed to the front. 

           The convoy makes its way inside the gate-- 

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           And we see for the fist time the Safe House--a four-story 
           cement structure, crumbling under its own weight.  The 
           outside, bullet-ridden. Windows, boarded up.

           SAND BARRELS, six feet high, fortify the perimeter. 
           Concertina wire wraps all the way around.

           Series of shots:

           --Soldiers caked in dirt.

           --Guys filling sand barrels.

           --Men stand guard on the roof, look over the city.

           The full extent of their fucked-ness is now apparent.

           INT. BAQUBAH SAFEHOSE-CONTINUOUS

           Matt and the team file through the building.  

           The safe house liaison and Commander, CPT. SYVERSON 
           (30’s), grizzled, tough, the pound pitbull you’d rather 
           put to sleep than rescue, greets them.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        S’arnt Major.  CPT. Syverson.  Pleasure 
                        to meet you. Let me help get you guys 
                        settled in.

           A few BAQUBAH SOLDIERS help with the unit’s gear, lug it 
           up steps.  One, we’ll call him PEPS--young, muscled, and 
           filthy dirty--helps Matt. 

                                 PEPPS
                              (re: Bags)
                        Give it.

           Pepps, stone-faced, hefts Matt’s bag on his shoulder--
           studies him.  A dog that smells fear.
                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        We’re completely self-sufficient here.  
                        Guard duty twice a week.  Showers are 
                        every Saturday. Make sure your men take 
                        care of each other. Down here they will 
                        be tired always, but make mistakes never.     
                              (to Machmoud)
                        Hey, Machmoud.  Come here. Come here. 

           Machmoud (20’s), affable young Iraqi tosses his arm around 
           CPT. Syverson.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        Captain, you got my $20?  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        These here are the guys gonna fix your 
                        water problem. 

           Machmoud looks the guys over, unimpressed.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        Are there more?

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        That’s what I was thinking.  Get out of 
                        here, Machmoud. Go on, get.

           Syverson gives him a playful shove.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        I want my $20.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        How bout I pay you in freedom and 
                        democracy, asshole?

           Machmoud gives Syverson the middle finger.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Taught that fucker Texas Hold ‘Em, turns 
                        out he’s a Goddamn prodigy.  Let me show 
                        your boys their room.  

           STEPS--CONTINUOUS

           Matt spies every room he passes.  Soldiers baby wipe their 
           dirty bodies, a GROUP quickly shuffles past, late for some 
           unknown mission.   

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        We have one concern: get this town back 
                        to normal.  
           He stops turns to them.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        And make that roaring crowd out there 
                        believe we’re part of the solution, not 
                        the problem.

           LIVING QUARTERS-CONTINUOUS

           The unit piles in a small, dilapidated room. Sunlight 
           streams in through holes in the wall concrete.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Your guys will be here. Drop your rucks, 
                        and be downstairs in 5 mikes.  And one 
                        last thing.  At night we go dark.  
                        Snipers so much as see the reflection in 
                        your dogtags, they’ll take a pop shot. 

           Syverson exits.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Lovely. Who wants the bunk by the window?

           Matt sticks his pinky in one of the holes, clears out the 
           dust.  Looks right through the hole to see the protest 
           raging outside.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                              (whispers to Matt)
                        We’re in the middle of the fucking city.  
                        You think ‘safe house’ is a little 
                        misleading?

           Matt peels back the edge of a WALL POSTER to reveal a big 
           fucking hole.  The protest is right at his doorstep.

           INT. BAQUBAH SAFEHOUSE, WAR ROOM-LATER

           CPT. Syverson stands at the front, an intricate map of 
           Iraq on the wall behind him.  RED PINS cluster the map.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Gentleman, right now you’re in the heart 
                        of the Diyala River Valley--center of the 
                        Sunni Triangle.  More importantly, you’re 
                        at what is believed to be the crossroads 
                        of the Iraq War.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        What’s all the red pins?
                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        The red pins are American casualties.  
                        According to M.I., over the past few 
                        months attacks have trended out of major 
                        cities.  North from Baghdad, south from 
                        Tikrit, to where you currently sit.  

                                 1LT. AISLAIGER
                        They’re spreading us thin.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        That’s right. Outside that gate is the 
                        real deal.  When you leave the wire, you 
                        don’t go anywhere without at least a 
                        three vehicle convoy.  And when the sun 
                        goes down you hightail it back to the 
                        Safe House.  Only the snipers go out at 
                        night, huah?     

                                 ALL
                        Huah.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Lieutenant.    

           Aislager takes the floor.

                        Our mission is clear, pipe up this 200 
                        yard stretch of Aqueduct, get water 
                        flowing back to the village. To do that, 
                        means recruitment. We need Iraqi workers, 
                        guys. Workers who know they could be 
                        killed for helping us. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Sir.  Why didn’t command just task the 
                        Engineers? They could pipe up this place 
                        in no time.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Baqubah’s too hot.  Until 7th Group 
                        secures the city, we’re all alone here.  

                                 SGT. FALVY
                              (to Himself)
                        Fuckin’ pussy Engineers.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        And we will secure it, you have my word. 
                        But there will be a fight, and you will 
                        participate.   

           Off Matt’s reaction.
                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Not a single person outside that gate 
                        wants you here. Make no mistake, this 
                        place is one knotted shoe lace of fuck.  

           Matt’s face stays fixed on the red pins that cluster 
           Baqubah.  

           INT. BATHROOM-NIGHT

           Matt washes his face. The REARVIEW MIRROR of a Hummer is 
           taped to the wall--a makeshift vanity mirror. 

           The bathroom’s in shambles.  The sinks, showers, toilets 
           are stained by rusty water.  

           The sounds of the protest rage on outside.  

           His reflection stares back at him. 

           The GENERATOR shuts off and the building goes black.

                                 MATT
                        Shit.

           Moonlight streams through bullet holes in the wall.

                                                           FADE TO:

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--NEXT MORNING

           Mission Day.  Stryker vehicles line up, prepare to move 
           out the gate.

           Matt runs from vehicle to vehicle.  Each Stryker loaded to 
           the hilt, packed like sardine cans with soldiers.

                                 SSG. BAKER (O.S.)
                        Hey.  Ocre.

           Baker waves Matt into his vehicle. The rear hatch pulls 
           closed--

           INT. STRYKER--CONTINUOUS

           Baker and Matt huddle together with EIGHT OTHER SOLDIERS.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        How you feel?

           Matt nods, ‘okay’.
                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t get too comfortable. We’ll have to 
                        dismount at the bridge.  It’s too narrow 
                        for the Stryker.

           Matt nods.

           Machmoud sits across from Matt in flak vest and helmet.

           The other soldiers eye Matt. A moment of quiet tension. 
           Matt’s far out of his league here, and it’s all over his 
           face.

           Machmoud crunches into a fistful of crackers, oblivious.  
           He offers some to Matt.  

           Matt waves him off.

           Machmoud spots on Matt’s boot: ‘A+’.  His blood type.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        Hey.  A-positive.

           Machmoud points to his helmet, and the ‘A+’ sharpied on 
           the side.

                                 MACHMOUD (CONT’D)
                        Me, too.

           Thumbs up from Machmoud.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE, MAIN GATE--SAME

           The Stryker vehicles roll out the gate and into the city.  
           Throngs of protestors make way.

           INT. STRYKER--SAME

           No one moves or talks for what feels like an eternity.  
           The first sounds of gunfire in the city.  A burst more. 

           The PING of rounds as they hit the side of the Stryker.

           The fighting intensifies until, in the distance--

           BOOM

           The explosion rocks the vehicle to life.

           HEAVY GUNFIRE
                                 STRYKER DRIVER
                        Time to clear the benches.

           The Stryker rolls to a stop.

           The men stand, lock and load.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Hey. Why we stopping?  You’re supposed to 
                        take us to the aqueduct.  

                                 SF SOLDIER
                        I suggest you guys stand, or get run 
                        over.

           Matt and Baker find their feet, just as the REAR HATCH 
           drops, and they’re out to--

           EXT. BAQUBAH CITY SQUARE-DAY

           The Eight Soldiers run into the streets, the fight already 
           under way.

           Matt and Baker remain close to the vehicle, are joined by 
           Bartles, Meyers and Falvy.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (to SSG. Baker)
                        Tell your guys to hug the Stryker. You 
                        move on foot through the town; we’ll meet 
                        you at the bridge to the Aqueduct.     

           Baker nods, signals to his team.

           The guys form up on either side of the Stryker and begin 
           the slow crawl though Baqubah’s city square.

           Matt’s P.O.V:

           --SOLDIERS kick in doors, clear houses.

           --A SIX MAN TEAM takes fire in an alley way.

           --A roadblock of BURNING TIRES.

           BOOM.  A small explosion, cries of pain. 

           Soldiers run toward the sound, a house yards away.

           Matt looks to Baker for instruction.  

           Baker considers, then leads his guys toward the house.
           BACK OF THE HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           A gaggle surrounds a screaming soldier.  

           The screams belong to Peps--he lies on his back, hands 
           tucked between his thighs, pant legs covered in blood.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Is there a medic on the way?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Let me see your hands.

           CPT. Syverson pries Peps hands from between his thighs to 
           reveal TWO MANGLED HANDS, fingers missing, pinky hanging 
           by a thread.  

           Syverson searches the ground to find AN EXPLODED LUNCH 
           PAIL. He picks up the hunk of metal, hoists it over his 
           head.    

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        How many times do I have to tell you dumb 
                        fucks not to pick anything up off the 
                        ground? If you wanna do stupid shit, 
                        fine.  Go home without hands.  Now, if 
                        anyone else is feeling especially 
                        curious, I suggest you call it quits or 
                        wise the fuck up.  

           Syverson slams the pail to the ground.  It bounces to 
           Matt’s feet, the mangled hunk of metal, pieces of flesh on 
           the jagged edge, stares back at him.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Come on.  Let’s go.

           Baker pulls him away.

           EXT. BAQUBAH OUTSKIRTS--DAY

           Matt’s vehicle crosses a bombed out BRIDGE, the tire a 
           mere inches from tumbling them into the river below.

           EXT. AQUEDUCT--DAY

           A V-Shaped cavern of mud and dirt, six feet deep. A few 
           IRAQI WORKERS dig with their hands, doing what good they 
           can.  
           SGT. Falvy walks the trenches, pulling security.

           The rest of the guys assess the damage.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        The A-system runs about 210 miles up into 
                        the hills.  We estimate the damage here 
                        to be roughly 200 yards.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What’s the state of the rest of it?

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Not our concern.  We care only about this 
                        200 yards.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        We’ve tried incentivizing the Iraqis. We 
                        offer pay for a day’s work.  

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        How much have you given?

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        They won’t take a penny.  Just show up, 
                        work, and go home.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Sir, maybe we get some water up here. 
                        Keep ‘em hydrated.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        Good idea.  Captain, have you had contact 
                        with the tribal leader?  We get him on 
                        our side he can convince his people to 
                        help.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        The Sheik?  Yeah. We’ve had contact.  
                        Trust me he’s a waste of fucking time.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        I should meet him.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        You can try. The Sheik is scared 
                        shitless. Won’t talk to anyone but me.     

           FURTHER UP THE AQUEDUCT--

           Matt walks beside Machmoud who pulls dried dirt from the 
           ground, squeezes it.
                                 MACHMOUD
                        See how the soil won’t clot.  No water 
                        means it can’t form. 

           Machmoud spits in his palm. The dirt becomes a clay ball.

                                 MACHMOUD (CONT’D)
                        Even before your planes bomb here, water 
                        was problem.  Sunni farmers north steal 
                        water before it came south to Shiites in 
                        Baqubah.

                                 MATT
                        How’d you stop it from happening?

                                 MACHMOUD
                        Always fighting.  Now you come to make it 
                        normal again?  Normal may not be good 
                        enough.

           A distant shot rings out. The workers scurry for cover.

           Falvy takes the prone, trains his weapon in the distance.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Mountain side, 6 O’clock.  I got ‘em.

           Our guys post up and train their weapons towards a rocky 
           overhang in the distance.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        No one return fire.  Sniper’s too far 
                        out. Last thing we need is these workers 
                        thinking they’re in a fire fight.   

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        They’re trying to scare us. 

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        They know why you’re here.
                              (yells)
                        Ten til sundown.  We’re Oscar Mike.  

           Matt stays trained on the mountain.  

                                                           FADE TO:

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--NIGHT

           Matt and the guys unload their gear. Falvy bumps past 
           Matt, leaves him alone at the vehicle.
           Matt sees: TWO SNIPERS, clad in ghille suits, journey out 
           the gate on foot, and into the night.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--NIGHT

           Soldiers stand guard on the roof, watch over the quiet 
           evening.

           INT. MATT’S ROOM--NIGHT

           Matt lies awake in his bunk, twirls his dog tags in his 
           fingers. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. AQUEDUCT--DAY

           Matt lugs two JERRY CANS of water up the steep hill to the 
           Aqueduct.  He slips, falls. 

           Baker breezes by with his water cans.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You alright?

           Matt nods.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Good.  Still got a dozen more trips.

           Matt crouches over in defeat.  A few BEADS OF RAIN splash 
           his forehead.  

           He looks to A GRAY SKY.

           AQUEDUCT, TOP OF THE HILL--LATER

           Heavy Rain. Matt plops down the Jerry Cans in the mud.  
           His arms like jelly. His body soaked. 

           In the distance, Iraqi’s take a break, share cans of 
           water. 

           Matt takes his boots off, rubs his scabbed feet.

           Falvy tosses a JERRY CAN down next to Matt, splashes him 
           with mud.
                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Fucking bullshit, right? A whole village 
                        at the bottom of that hill and we’re 
                        scabbing our hands like chumps.
                              (yells to the village)
                        Don’t worry, assholes.  We got it.

                                 MATT
                        They’re just scared, Falvy.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Is that supposed to be an excuse?

                                 MATT
                        No. 

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        ‘Cause it ain’t.  Fuckers shake my hand 
                        in the day, shoot at me at night.

                                 MATT
                        Give it time, man.   

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        You need to crawl out from behind your 
                        faggotty little rainbow.  I know a loaded 
                        deck when I see one.

           He points to the aqueduct.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        This game we can’t win.  

           COMMOTION at the bottom of the aqueduct.

           A voice screams for help.

           Falvy takes off down the hill, Matt tosses his boots aside 
           and follows.

           FURTHER DOWN THE AQUEDUCT--

           Matt runs barefoot to find an Iraqi with a LARGE STONE 
           crushing his leg.  He screams in pain.

           Soldiers and Iraqis work to wedge the stone off.

           Matt and Falvy jump in, push.  Finally, the stone tumbles 
           over revealing the man’s leg, horribly shattered.

                        Goddamn it.  What happened?
                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        These guys are overworked. They’re tired.  
                        They’re gonna make mistakes.

                        This doesn’t get done without the Sheik’s 
                        blessing. We show him some trust, he’s 
                        gotta do what’s right.  His people are 
                        dying for shit’s sake.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Sheik ain’t interested in what’s right. 
                        Only thing that excites him is self-
                        preservation.    

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        If he won’t tell his people to trust us, 
                        then we’re at a stalemate. Captain?

           Aislager won’t look away, stays trained on Syverson.

           Syverson considers.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (yells)
                        Gimme three vehicles. Load ‘em up.

           Soldiers hop to.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. SHEIK’S HOUSE--DAY

           Matt’s convoy speeds to a stop in front of the Sheik’s 
           house.

           Syverson tosses his weapon in the Hummer.

           He and Machmoud hop out and dart toward the building, 
           Aislager close behind.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Lieutenant, stay in the Hummer.

                                 1LT. AISLAGER
                        I need to talk to him, sir.
                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Lieutenant if you walk in that door, one 
                        of his guards will dot your eye with an 
                        AK round.  No questions.  Just done.  Get 
                        it?

           Syverson and Machmoud head into the building, leave 
           Aislager and the guys outside.

           INT. SHEIK’S HOUSE-DAY

           Ornate, covered in colored rugs. The SHEIK--a bearded, 
           grossly overweight man in his 50’s, sits and enjoys tea.  
           Two GUARDS stand by his side.

           The door opens, in walks Syverson and Machmoud.

           The Guards jump to attention, reach for their guns.

           As they speak, Machmoud translates.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Sheik. We need the inclusion of your 
                        people. You must give them your blessing.

           The Guards rush Syverson and Machmoud, pat them down.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Tell them we will protect them.  

           The Sheik calmly sips from his cup, then speaks--

                                 MACHMOUD
                              (translating)
                        He say, you no can protect. Anyone help 
                        the Americans will be slaughtered.  You 
                        cannot protect.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        I understand your fear. But if we do not 
                        have help, there will be no water. No 
                        water. You understand.
                              (to Machmoud)
                        Tell him.  Tell him NO WATER.  

           The Sheik leans in to Syverson and unloads a load rambling 
           of venom.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        What’s he saying, Machmoud?
                                 MACHMOUD
                        He say to leave his house.  You make 
                        promises that are dangerous.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (to Sheik)
                        We will pay.  We pay, understand?  Money 
                        for economy.  

           The Sheik continues to yell, not listening to Machmoud’s 
           translations.

           EXT. SHEIK’S HOUSE-SAME

           The convoy pulls security outside the building, hears the 
           Sheik yelling.

           Matt eyes the bustling market square.  The threat is 
           everywhere--windows, villagers, rooftops.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                              (re: Sheik yelling)
                        Sounds like we’re winning hearts and 
                        minds.

           SHEIK’S HOUSE-CONTINUOUS

           The Sheik stands. 

                                 MACHMOUD
                        He say there is other way to use your 
                        American money. 

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        What the fuck does that mean?

                                 MACHMOUD
                        He say his town will grow more violent.  
                        He will give blessing if you provide a 
                        safe haven for him.  Jordan.  Beautiful 
                        home with white curtains.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        White curtains? Wait, is he talking about 
                        a bribe?  
                              (to Sheik)
                        You think I like waking up in this shit 
                        hole either?  I’d rather watch you rot in  
                        this room than let you leave your people, 
                        you piece of shit.

           Machmoud begins to translate.
                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Shut up, Machmoud.  Don’t translate that.  
                        Tell the Sheik I appreciate his time.

           CPT. Syverson stands to leave, hugs the Sheik, gives him 
           the customary kiss on each cheek.  

           EXT. SHEIK’S HOUSE-DAY

           CPT. Syverson and Machmoud come out of the house, Syverson 
           puts his helmet on.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Like I said.  Big fucking waste of time.

           The guys load it up and move out.

           INT. BAQUBAH SAFEHOUSE--NIGHT

           The room is quiet, except for the sound of SSG. Baker 
           scrubbing his weapon with a bore brush.

                                 MATT
                        This mission’s a loser, Sergeant Baker.  
                        We all know it.  210 miles.

           Baker stops.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        200 yards.  That’s all we can think 
                        about.

                                 MATT
                        Machmoud said, even before we showed up, 
                        there was fighting over the water.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Yeah.

                                 MATT
                        And if we put it back to normal, that’s 
                        what normal is.  Fighting.

           Beat.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        You know why the workers won’t take our 
                        money? Because they know if they spend it 
                        they’ll be killed.

                        There’s only one way a poor farmer from 
                        Baqubah can get cash--from us.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        If the wheels in your brain are turning, 
                        I suggest you speak up.

                                 MATT
                        You asked me in Kuwait why I was here.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        And you gave me bullshit.

                                 MATT
                        My recruiter asked me, ‘What do you see 
                        when you watch the news, son’. I said, 
                        ‘Lot of suffering. Same as anyone’. 
                        ‘Wouldn’t it be nice’ he said, ‘to watch 
                        the news one day and know your phone was 
                        gonna ring? Because it was your job to 
                        fix it’. I signed up because I wanted to 
                        make things better. Same reason those 
                        workers risk their lives, same reason 
                        Machmoud is on our side. No one wants to 
                        die to make things normal.  We need to 
                        let every person in this town know, we 
                        didn’t come here to make things normal. 
                        We came to make them better. 

           For Baker, the words land.  Off his reaction--

           MONTAGE: Upbeat music over the following.

           EXT. BAQUBAH MARKETPLACE--DAY

           A convoy rolls through a crowded square.

           Speakers pump the Army’s message in Arabic.

           PAMPHLETS are thrown into the sky, the wind litters them 
           through the village.

           Matt hands a pamphlet and a bottle of CHLORINE TABLETS to 
           an IRAQI MOTHER and her children.

                                 MATT
                        If you can get water, this will make it 
                        clean.  Tell her Machmoud.

           Machmoud translates.

           The Mother cautiously takes the tablets and ushers her 
           kids back inside.
           INT. BAQUBAH SCHOOL--DAY

           Matt is at the head of a class of 3rd graders.  Baker, 
           Bartles and Meyers pass out toothbrushes.   

           As Matt speaks, Machmoud translates.

                                 MATT
                        Brushing with clean water can make your 
                        teeth brighter.  Just like this.

           Machmoud holds up posters of various Hollywood celebrities 
           with pearly whites.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        And stronger.

           Picture of a guy pulling a truck with his teeth.

           The kids laugh, brush their teeth joyfully.

           CPT. Syverson sits with IRAQI ELDERS.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Our new pipe system means no upkeep.  
                        Understand?

           The Iraqi’s look at him clueless.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn it, where’ Machmoud?

                                 1LT. AISLAIGER
                        At the school still, sir.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Water cleaner.  Crops bigger.

           Syverson points to his A-system graphic.

           Syverson pulls from his bag LARGE CALIFORNIA GRAPES. 

           INT. BAQUBAH SAFEHOUSE--DAY

           An LMTV beeps it’s way in reverse to the front gates. A 
           gaggle of soldiers guide him in.
                                 SOLDIERS
                        Keep it coming.  Back it up. Stop.  Stop.

           The LMTV hits the side of the brick wall. SHOVELS AND 
           EQUIPMENT spill out the back.

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--DAY

           The IRAQI WORKERS are now outfitted with new shovels.

           Matt turns the release on the WATER BUFFALO, fresh water 
           spews from the hose.  

           The workers drink ferociously.  A THANKFUL IRAQI shakes 
           Matt’s hand, hugs him.

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--DAY

           Matt’s convoy approaches a long line of Iraqis at the base 
           of the hill winding up to the Aqueduct.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Shit.  Look at the size of that protest.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Not a protest.  They got our shovels. 

                                 MATT
                        They’re here to work.   

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Jesus.  It’s working.

           END MONTAGE

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--DUSK

           Soldiers and Iraqis, faces stained with mud, stare at--

           The pipe--a black, lifeless hole.  Until finally, a THIN 
           STREAM OF GRAY WATER spews into the dirt.  It’s working.

           Muted cheers, exhausted sighs of relief build to outright 
           revelry.   

           Matt and Baker shake hands.

                                 MATT
                        50 yards down.
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Still got a ways to go.

                                 MATT
                        50 yards at a time, Sergeant. 

           The two hug.  

           Falvy steps close to Matt, a little too close.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        The only thing I give a shit about, 
                        Private, is the shot of Knob’s Creek and 
                        the piece of pussy waiting for me back 
                        home.

           Falvy’s anger softens.

                                 SGT. FALVY (CONT’D)
                        And if that brain of yours is what’s 
                        gonna get me there sooner.  Then, I guess 
                        I’m okay with that.

           Falvy walks off, leaving Matt and Baker confused.

                                 MATT
                        Was that a Thank You?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        As close to one as he’s capable. Yeah.

           Matt spots Machmoud, unmoving in the sea of celebration.  

                                 MATT
                        I’m gonna check on something.  I’ll be 
                        right back.

           As Matt leaves--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I was right about you, Ocre. The big 
                        picture. 

           Matt smiles, then makes his way through the crowd.  
           Heading towards--

                                 MATT
                        Machmoud. Look alive, buddy.  Water’s not 
                        safe to drink, but we can at least 
                        irrigate the farms.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        I am very grateful.
                                 MATT
                        We’re not leaving until it’s finished. I 
                        promise. Now get over there with your 
                        people and celebrate.  

                                 MACHMOUD
                        By tomorrow, everyone know water working 
                        again.  Maybe more people come to help. 
                        Or, maybe tomorrow, a whole new war come 
                        to Baqubah. 

           With that, Machmoud, still and quiet, steps off towards 
           the celebration.

           Safe House.  Each face as battered as the next.

                        I know you’re all hurtin’. Your bones are 
                        bruised, your muscles sting. But, let me 
                        ask.  Does anybody feel it?         

           Whispers of ‘No, sir’ from the crowd.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        You don’t feel pain because pride has 
                        taken its place.  And you should be 
                        proud.  Outside that gate are the quiet 
                        sounds of trust. 

           Faces crack proud smiles.

                        And you’ve proven what every Infantry 
                        Captain already knows. You give U.S.

           CPT. Syverson stands with a GIANT WATER HOSE at the ready.

           The hose roars to life, espousing gallons of frigid, icy 
           water.

                        2,3,4...

           Syverson sways the hose out over A CROWD OF SOLDIERS, clad 
           only in their underwear, a bar of soap in hand.

           Matt, and each of our guys, are pelted in the face with 
           water.  They scrub furiously and hop out of line.

           The cadence continues as we--

                                                           FADE TO:
           EXT. BAQUBAH--MORNING

           The MORNING CALL TO PRAYER.  The sun crests the horizon, 
           throws light on a vacant, quiet town.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--SAME

           Matt rests an MRE on the hood of a Hummer. The meal 
           crackles with heat, smokes.

           Machmoud leans against the vehicle and stares into the 
           city.

                                 MATT
                        Skittles?

           Matt offers.  Machmoud declines.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Your morning prayers are really getting 
                        on my nerves, Machmoud.  I swear it’s 
                        getting louder every day.

                                 MACHMOUD
                        That not prayer.  Yesterday yes, but 
                        today--They say ‘Death to America’.  
                        Today very bad.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (O.S.)
                        Rally up. Let’s move it out.

           EXT. BAQUBAH MARKETPLACE--DAY

           From Matt’s window he sees the city square completely 
           vacant, not a soul stirring. 

           Baker knocks on Matt’s shoulder.  Gives him a look, ‘Where 
           is everybody’? 

           Matt shrugs.

           EXT. BAQUBAH MARKET--DAY

           The convoy rolls to a stop.     

           Matt looks on confused. The engine hums.

           Syverson studies the roadway, pick ups the radio receiver.
                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (over radio)
                        Dismount, over.

           ROADWAY--CONTINUOUS

           Matt, Baker, Bartles, Meyers, and Falvy move in formation 
           alongside a brick wall.

           They reach the edge, Baker gives the signal to hold.

           The others kneel, at the ready.

           Baker peers around the edge, studies the city.  Safe to 
           move.

           He waves the soldiers forward as:

           The MOSQUE comes into view.  Two dead Iraqi workers, 
           bodies burned and laid out for all to see. Shovels are 
           splayed out before them.  

                                 MATT
                        Oh, God.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Someone wants to send a message.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Message read, loud and clear. Fuckin’ 
                        savages.

           The townspeople stand outside their homes, watching the 
           horror of what the U.S. has brought to their town.

           A SOLDIER emerges from the other side of the road.  Walks 
           towards the bodies to inspect.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (yells to soldier)
                        Hey. Get back.

           The Soldier reaches the bodies, sees A CLUSTER OF WIRES 
           emerging from the body’s skin.

           The soldier’s eyes go wide, knowing what’s next.

           BOOM.
           Debris shoots towards Matt and the rest of the guys, the 
           brick wall baring most of the damage.

           As the dust settles--

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (screaming)
                        Fuck.  Fuck. Get back.
                              (to Baker/Matt)
                        You two in the Hummer. Machmoud, come 
                        with me.  

           Syverson grabs a BLACK DUFFLE from another Hummvee, tosses 
           it in back.

           He hops in the driver’s seat. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Sir, we need three vehicles--

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Get in the fucking Hummer.

           Matt and Baker hop inside.  Syverson mashes the gas and 
           tears ass across town.

           INT. SHEIK’S HOUSE-DAY

           Captain Syverson storms through the Sheik’s door, Machmoud 
           cautiously behind.

           The Sheik and HIS GUESTS are startled from their meal.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Two of your people were burned.  Their 
                        bodies cut open and a bomb stuffed 
                        inside. This is what happens while you 
                        sit and drink tea.

           The Sheik calmly waves everyone out of the room.  Motions 
           the Captain to sit, then speaks.

                                 MACHMOUD
                              (translating)
                        He say ‘Baqubah is two cities. The day 
                        belong to U.S. But night belong to men 
                        who murder, who rape.  Who burn bodies’.   

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Talk to your people. We could end this.
           EXT. SHEIK’S HOUSE--SAME

           Matt and Baker stand guard outside.  The streets are 
           getting crowded.  They are vastly outnumbered.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (into radio)
                        The Captain tore ass to the Sheik’s 
                        house. We need some more guys out here 
                        now.

           Matt is backed up against the wall, everywhere is a 
           potential threat.

           A FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from a nearby rooftop.  

                                 RADIO
                        We got a hell of a situation at the 
                        Mosque.  Sit tight, over.

           An IRAQI carrying a large bag approaches from around the 
           corner.

                                 MATT
                        Hey.  Stop it there mother fucker.

           The Iraqi looks confused, nervous, still approaches.

           SHEIK’S HOUSE--SAME

           Syverson produces the BLACK DUFFLE, unzips it to reveal a 
           large stack of AMERICAN MONEY.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        The U.S. can provide a safe place for you 
                        in Jordan.  Until Baqubah is ready for 
                        your return.

           Syverson slides the bag over. The Sheik smiles.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Give them your blessing, and get on the 
                        right side of this.

           Syverson grabs the Sheik's tea cup, and downs it.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        Thank the Sheik for his tea, Machmoud.

           The Sheik sits speechless. 
                                 CPT. SYVERSON (CONT’D)
                        And tell him the U.S. Army ain’t afraid 
                        of the dark.

           EXT. SHEIK’S HOUSE--SAME

           Matt rushes the Iraqi man, gun to his face.  The man puts 
           his hands up, pleads innocence. 

           Matt smashes him to the ground with the butt of his 
           weapon, rips the bag from his hands.

           RICE spills in the street.

           Matt’s anger softens.

           The Iraqi scrapes grains of rice off the ground and puts 
           it into his pocket.  A week’s worth of food for his family 
           tumbled into the dirt.

           Matt stoops to help.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Ocre.  What the fuck are you doing?

           Syverson emerges from the Sheik’s house.  Without a word 
           he hops in the driver’s seat and fires up the engine.

           Matt leaves the man to pick up his food.

           EXT. BAQUBAH--NIGHT

           The dark, foreboding streets of Baqubah.  Seen at night 
           for the first time.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--NIGHT

           Matt’s beside his Hummer, NVG’s mounted to his Kevlar 
           helmet. He looks through them:

           Matt’s P.O.V, Night Vision:

           The green glow of Baqubah, and the bursts of green GUN 
           FIRE that await him. 

           INT. HUMMER--SAME

           Meyer’s hummer waits to leave the gate, sits idle at the 
           rear of the convoy.
           Meyers has a death grip on the steering wheel, Bartles 
           sits in the back seat, Falvy in the passenger.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        I don’t know, man. Sweeping houses at 
                        night? Windows, tall buildings. Lotta 
                        nooks and crannies.    

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Yep.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        There’s a reason we don’t go out night.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Yeah, it’s the same reason we’re losing. 
                        Because we’re afraid.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Falvy will you stow the macho bullshit 
                        for once.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                        Falvy’s right. This was inevitable.

           Bartles hops out of the Hummer. Puts on the rest of his 
           gear.

                                 SGT. BARTLES (CONT’D)
                        Everything is as it should be. We can’t 
                        see it, but everything is perfect. 
                              (to Meyers)
                        Keep me safe up there?

           Meyers nods, nervous.

           Bartles and Meyers do their customary handshake and 
           Bartles takes the turret.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--NIGHT

           Baker cracks a glow stick, duct tapes it to his helmet.

           Matt notices BAKER’S SHAKING HAND.  

                                 1LT. AISLAGER (O.S.)
                        Sergeant Baker.  Got room for one more?

           Aislager runs toward the vehicle.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You sure you wanna come, sir?
           Aislager stares hard, nods. He knows the risk, won’t let 
           his men fight without him.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Hope you don’t mind the tight squeeze.

           Aislager smiles, hops in the Hummer.

           FRONT GATE--SAME

           The GATE GUARD waves his arms overhead, getting the 
           attention of the convoy.  

           Soldiers don their NVG’s.

           The Gate Guard holds a fist to the sky, signaling HOLD. 
           Then runs the concertina wire open, unleashing the convoy 
           upon the night.

           EXT. BAQUBAH CITY SQUARE-NIGHT

           Overhead we see the convoy spilt up, STRYKER VEHICLES veer 
           down different streets--FOOT SOLDIERS dismount, sneak 
           through alleys.  

           CITY SQUARE, STREET LEVEL--NIGHT

           Matt’s vehicle skids to a halt. 

           Matt, Baker, and Falvy dismount. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (to Meyers)
                        Take a breath. You know the route. We’ll 
                        meet you on the other side of the city. 

           Meyers is shaking.

           Baker shows no fear, can’t.  He pats the side of the 
           Hummer and it drives away.

           Matt, Baker, and Falvy link up with OTHER SOLDIERS 
           kneeling beside a wall.   

           STREET LEVEL--LATER

           Matt, Baker, and Falvy reach the end of the wall, hold. 
           Baker peeks around the corner to see AN EMPTY 
           INTERSECTION, TALL BUILDINGS.  
           Matt’s P.O.V:

           --SOLDIERS line up alongside an Iraqi Home.   

           --CRACK, they kick the door in, rush inside.

           Doors are kicked in all over town, commotion, chaos, the 
           first sounds of gunfire.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Here we go. 2X2 formation. We’re gonna 
                        leap frog to the Southwest corner.  Ocre, 
                        we’re first.

           Matt nods.  And they’re off.  Full sprint to cover behind 
           a parked vehicle.  

           Baker checks windows and alleys--safe.

           He motions for the next two.

           The soldiers run. 

           GUNFIRE.

           Rounds rip through a soldier’s knee cap. 

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Contact. Contact.

           Baker returns fire to the building.  Fire comes his way, 
           obliterating what little cover the car provided.

           Falvy makes a full sprint to the downed soldier--grabs him 
           by the LBE harness and drags him to safety.

           Baker returns fire.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                              (into Radio)

                        Copy that Lima 1, over.

           Matt looks at Baker, then stands to return fire.
           MEYERS VEHICLE--SAME

           Meyer’s turns wildly through the empty streets. Bartles 
           struggles to hold on.

           Each turn, each street is a roadblock.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Fuck.  Fuck.  I can’t get anywhere. The 
                        route is all fucked up.

                                 1LT. AISLAIGER
                        We got our asses in the wind, Meyers. 
                        Where are we?

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        I don’t know. It all looks the fucking 
                        same.

                                 1LT. AISLAIGER
                              (into Radio)
                        Noble Lion do you copy, over? Repeat, 
                        Noble Lion do you copy?

           Static.

           Meyers jerks the wheel and the vehicle speeds down a 
           narrow alleyway.

           EXT. ROOFTOOP-CONTINUOUS

           TWO SNIPERS take position on a rooftop.  Their movements 
           are precise, surgical.

           The SPOTTER peeks his head over the roof and eyes Matt and 
           Baker pinned down.  

           He swoops to spot the enemy, firing out a window.  

                                 SPOTTER
                        Wind SW, 8mph.  Range 600 yards.  2 
                        hostiles, top floor.  Eyes on.

           The Sniper makes the adjustments, CLICK CLICK. Points the 
           .50 Cal Barret Sniper Rifle towards the enemy.   

           Through the scope we see:

           --2 enemy combatants firing out the window of a 
           dilapidated building.

                                 SPOTTER (CONT’D)
                        Send it.
           The Sniper fires.

                                 SPOTTER (CONT’D)
                        Kill.

           The Sniper takes a breath, adjusts slightly. CLICK CLICK. 
           Fires.

           We see one hostile’s head split apart.

                                 SPOTTER (CONT’D)
                        Kill.
                              (to radio)
                        Lima 1, they’re clear to move.  Over.

           BAQUBAH STREETS--SAME

           A STRYKER vehicle rolls into position a few blocks down.

           Baker hoists the wounded soldier on his back, runs like 
           hell across the street to the Stryker vehicle.

           Bullets strike the walls around him.

           Matt and Falvy return fire, cover Baker’s movements.

           An RPG SOLDIER takes the center of the road, shoulders a 
           Rocket Propelled Grenade. He aims to fire when--

           An ARMED INSURGENT pops up from a window right behind 
           Falvy and Matt, and shots the RPG Soldier--the rocket 
           sears off into an adjacent building.

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        Fuck.

           Falvy turns, fires at the Armed Insurgent. The insurgent 
           races out the back of the building.

           Falvy charges after, full-speed past houses and buildings.  
           A reckless pursuit.

                                 MATT
                        Falvy.   
                              (back to the other soldiers)
                        Falvy’s got a runner.

           No one hears him.  

           Matt hesitates, then runs after. The CHASE IS ON.

           Buildings and lights stream past.
           Bullets explode around feet, blast concrete just inches 
           from Matt and Falvy.

           EXT. IRAQI HOME--CONTINUOUS

           The Insurgent ducks into a door a few houses down.  

           Falvy’s only steps behind.  He posts up just outside.

                                 MATT
                        Falvy. Wait. Hold on.

           He doesn’t.  Falvy kicks in the door and rushes in alone.

           A SINGLE GUN SHOT. 

           Matt picks up the pace, his helmet falls off as he enters-

           I/E. IRAQI HOME-CONTINUOUS

           Falvy lays there, unmoving, shot in the throat and 
           bleeding out.

           The Insurgent, crouched in the corner, moves his weapon to 
           Matt.  

           Matt fires quickly, reflexively, slams the man between the 
           eyes.  Dead.

           Matt’s stunned. Falvy gasps, gargles blood in the corner.  

           Matt presses his palms against Falvy’s throat.  No use. 
           Too much blood.  

           Falvy grips Matt’s sleeve, tugs at his shoulder.  Then, 
           finally gives in to the inevitable. 

                                 SGT. FALVY
                        I couldn’t wait.  I couldn’t--

           His eyes go lifeless, Matt his last living sight.

           EXT. BAQUBAH STREETS-DUSK

           Everything goes SLOW-MOTION, STACCATO.

           Matt and Baker run Falvy’s stretcher to a Stryker.       

           Sounds mix and blend into one indiscernible mess. 

           The edges of Matt’s periphery bend and blur.  
           Falvy’s loaded inside.  The Stryker hauls ass, kicks up a 
           plum of dust in its wake. 

                                                            CUT TO:

           MEYERS VEHICLE-SAME

           Fast and Frantic. Bartles, Meyers and Aislager drive 
           through a narrow city street. 

           They take heavy fire from the rooftop.

           Bartles unleashes on the SAW.

           Ahead, Meyers sees the road comes to a dead end, slams on 
           the breaks.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Shit.
                              (yells to Bartles)
                        Hold on.

           Meyers throws the vehicle in reverse and mashes the gas.

           The vehicle flies BACKWARDS down the narrow street, 
           scraping from wall to wall.

           A round strikes Aislager’s leg. Another hits his shoulder. 

           He screams.

           EXT. BAQUBAH CITY STREETS--SAME

           Matt’s stunned, looks around to see:

           --Soldiers kicking in doors

           --Iraqis being dragged outside

           --Weapons seized and piled up

           Matt grips his weapon, the blood on his hand now coating 
           weapon.

           EXT. BAQUBAH STREET, MEYER’S VEHICLE-SAME

           Meyers’ vehicle comes flying, backwards, into an 
           intersection. 
           Meyers slams the brakes and spins the wheel. He scans the 
           area, not a single soldier or vehicle to be found.  They 
           are alone.

                                 SGT. BARTLES
                              (to himself)
                        Not good.

           Meyers slams the gas.  To where, he’s not sure.

           BAQUBAH STREETS, IRAQI HOME--SAME

           Matt tears through a home, overturns beds, knocks over 
           dressers.

           An IRAQI FAMILY kneels in the corner, crying.

                                 MATT
                              (yells to Baker)
                        Got anything?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Just a few AK’s.

                                 MATT
                        Bullshit.
                              (to the Iraqi Family)
                        Where are your fucking weapons? Don’t 
                        tell me you ain’t go ‘em.

           The IRAQI HUSBAND, pleads with his hand, guards his 
           family.

                                 RADIO CHATTER (V.O.)
                        Lima 1, regroup at Warhorse. Repeat, all

                        Lima 1 to Warhorse. Beat feet and

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Hang in there, LT.

                                 1LT. AISLAIGER
                        I’m fine.  Just get us back to base.
           BAQUBAH STREET--SAME

           Matt and Baker rush out of the Iraqi Home, run toward an 
           open Stryker.  The sound of gunfire overwhelming.  Baker 
           leans into Matt’s ear.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        We’re heading back to the Safe House.  We 
                        gotta regroup.

           Matt nods.

                                 MATT
                        Where’s Meyers and Bartles?

           Baker doesn’t hear.  He ducks back into the Stryker.

           EXT. BAQUBAH STREETS--SAME

           Meyers’ vehicle speeds through the city, enters a round-a-
           bout. 

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Almost there guys.  Almost--

           Their vehicle rounds a corner--

           BOOM.

           An explosion rips into their vehicle.

           Dust and debris.

           Ringing dissonance.  

           MEYER’S VEHICLE--CONTINUOUS

           Choppy and disoriented.  The ringing continues.

           Meyers’ head is slumped forward on the steering wheel.  
           His face bloodied and black from smoke.

           Aislager in the passenger seat. Covered in blood. Dead.

           The driver side door--completely blown off, Meyers’ body 
           exposed and vulnerable.  

           A BULLET pierces his shin. 

           Meyers looks at the LT, then in the backseat to his 
           friend.  He sees--  
           SGT. Bartles, covered in blood, his right arm gone, his 
           eyes barely open, and spit sliding from his mouth.

           Meyers summons the last bit of life he has left.  

           He mashes the gas, and the Hummer lurches to life, its 
           broken axle wobbling on the blacktop, it, too, gasping its 
           last breath.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--SAME

           Matt’s convoy speeds to the gate, the Camp already alive 
           with activity.  

           Matt’s vehicle erupts through the gate, blasting through 
           the concertina wire.

           MEYER’S VEHICLE--SAME

           The tires of the vehicle continue to bow, look as if 
           they’ll break.  

           Another round enters Meyer’s shoulder.  He’s being shot to 
           shit.

           Once more he mashes the gas, but this time the vehicle 
           complies, and guns the two wounded soldiers at full speed.

           BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--SAME

           Matt and Baker come speeding into camp.

                                 MATT
                        Line these fucking vehicles up.  Now.  We 
                        gotta go back out.

           Helicopter engines turn over, their blades spinning.  The 
           Medevac is ready, expecting to extract three dead 
           soldiers.

           Suddenly, in the distance, Meyer’s vehicle, as battered 
           and lifeless as the soldiers inside, comes speeding over 
           the horizon.

           MEYER’S VEHICLE--SAME

           Bartles is unconscious, bleeding out, his severed arm 
           nowhere to be found.
           Meyer’ face is speckled with shrapnel, his body bullet-
           ridden.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Hold on. Hold on, Chuck.  Don’t let go.  
                        Don’t let go, buddy. 

           Meyers honks his horn, as much to alert the camp as to 
           keep Bartles conscious.  The vehicle speeds to the gate 
           of:

           BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           Soldiers, Medics descend on Meyers’s vehicle.  

           MEYER’S VEHICLE-CONTINUOUS

           Meyers is in pure adrenaline mode--unaware of his wounds.

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Don’t let him die.

                                 MEDIC
                        Come on.  We’ll take care of him.  We 
                        gotta treat you.

           The Medic rips Meyers from the vehicle, from his friend.

           Meyers pushes the Medic back and hobbles over to see 
           Bartles being pulled from the wreckage.

           Baker and Matt hold an unconscious Bartles--apply pressure 
           to the wounds.

           A Medic administers MORPHINE.  

                                 CPL. MEYERS
                        Is he dead?  Is he dead? 

           Bartles is rushed onto a Blackhawk, Meyers close behind. 

                                 CPL. MEYERS (CONT’D)
                        Put me on the same chopper.

           Meyers hops in, a Medic gives the ‘Okay’ to the PILOT and 
           off they go.

           The camp is engulfed in dust as the Blackhawk lifts up 
           into a dark night.

           Matt looks at his uniform--red with his friends’ blood. 
                                 MATT
                        Come on.

           Baker doesn’t move, can’t. He’s stunned. 

           Matt sprints, pure anger driving his muscles.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (yells)
                        Ocre.  Get your ass back here. 

           Matt jumps into the turret of a vehicle.  

                                 MATT
                        We gotta go.

           Matt slams the hood of the vehicle. Pure rage.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        We gotta go back out.

           No one moves.  Whoever set off the bomb is long gone.  
           Nothing to be done.

                                                           FADE TO:

           INT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE, BATHROOM-LATER

           Matt’s alone. His face, it hangs heavy now, a new stark 
           look in his eyes--soaks his head in water.

           The sink mixes brown with dirt and blood.   

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--SAME

           The camp’s illuminated by work lights.  Soldiers do back 
           breaking labor filling sandbags, fortifying positions. 

           No rest tonight.  

           EXT. BAQUBAH HOUSE, BALCONY--NIGHT

           Matt sits on the ledge of the balcony, his back to the 
           city.  He lights up a cigarette, exhales smoke.

           Baker emerges from the doorway.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I’ve been looking for you.  Bartles is on 
                        an emergency evac to Landstuhl. He’s--
                                 MATT
                              (offering)
                        Cigarette?  

           Baker doesn’t acknowledge.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        He’s gonna live, Ocre.

                                 MATT
                        I don’t smoke either.
                              (joking)
                        Really gets in the way of my yoga. 

           Matt ashes over the balcony.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You can’t be out here.

                                 MATT
                        The Sergeant Major made me see the 
                        Chaplain? Guess it was obvious I’m not 
                        feeling too hot. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What the Chaplain say?

                                 MATT
                        Lotta nothing. God’s plan. I said anyone 
                        who planned this needs their fucking jaw 
                        unhinged.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        And then?

                                 MATT
                        Then, Chaplain asked if I smoke.  I said 
                        no. He leaned in, slipped this pack in my 
                        hand and said ‘maybe you should consider 
                        starting’.  

           Matt stubs out the cigarette on the railing.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        It’s gone bad, Sergeant Baker. And if 
                        it’s gonna get worse, if I’m next, then 
                        fine. I really don’t give a shit.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Easy. The farther you walk down that 
                        path, the longer the walk back.  

                                 MATT
                        Maybe we’re too far already. 
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        The only way we get out of here is 
                        together. If I can’t count on you to pull 
                        yourself out of this fucking hole, then 
                        what hope do I have?  You understand?

                                 MATT
                              (glib)
                        Proud and Ready, Sergeant Baker.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Good. Get inside. We shouldn’t be 
                        standing out here at night.

                                 MATT
                        I just wish one person in my life, one 
                        person, would’ve told me the truth. If my 
                        dad had the balls to stick around maybe 
                        he’d have told me: Matt, good people die, 
                        and cry all you want but the world don’t 
                        give a shit. So how I see it, is we spend 
                        the next 20 years crying by the front 
                        door, or we admit it now. Daddy ain’t 
                        coming home. And we ain’t saving this 
                        town.      

           Matt flicks his cigarette butt.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        If you’ve got some mourning to do, do it 
                        now.  Tomorrow we go back out.

           Baker takes one more good look at his friend, then heads 
           back inside.

                                 MATT
                        Take it easy, Sergeant Baker.   
                              (to Himself)
                        And if its easy take it twice.

           Matt’s gaze trails off.

           INT. BATHROOM-LATER

           Blinding fluorescent bulbs, a white room as artificial as 
           the lighting.  

           Matt looks out the window.  

           His P.O.V:

           --The calm late night of Baqubah.
           We TIMELAPSE--moonlight becomes early dawn.  Matt’s been 
           in here all night.   

           --SINK

           Gobs of hair fall into the porcelain.  The buzz of hair 
           trimmers.

           The faucet spews water and swirls the thickets of hair 
           into a wet mitten in the drain. 

           EXT. BAQUBAH HOUSE--NEXT MORNING

           The camp is quiet, lifeless, yet there’s Matt his head 
           shaved to a mohawk--the lone soldier in the turret of a 
           Humvee.     

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        Beautiful day for the infantry, son.

                                 MATT
                        Hoo-rah, Sergeant Major.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        What the hell is that on your head?  No 
                        way that thing is regulation.

           The Sergeant Major plants a foot in the tire well, climbs 
           to look Matt eye to eye. Studies him.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT (CONT’D)
                              (whispers)
                        When we get back I want you to dye that 
                        thing Infantry blue.  Anyone gives you 
                        shit, you send ‘em my way.

           The Sergeant Major winks, and whistles his way off.

           Other soldiers pile out of the Safe House for the day’s 
           mission.

           Baker walks by silent, loads up his gear in the Humvee.  
           Finally--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You’re not riding up there.

                                 MATT
                        Someone has to.
                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Not having a wild man in the turret.  You 
                        pull your brain back in your skull then 
                        fine.

           Matt squats down into the Hummer.

                                 MATT
                        I’m riding up here and that’s the end of 
                        it.   

           Baker stares hard into Matt’s eyes, seeing if there is a 
           human being in there somewhere. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Alight. Don’t fuck this up.  

           Matt smiles and stands back up.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Your head looks like a 70’s vagina by the 
                        way.  

                                 MATT
                        Fuck you.  

           The convoy rolls out of camp, Matt atop for the first 
           time.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BAQUBAH VILLAGE--CONTINUOUS

           Matt’s P.O.V.

           --People in buildings

           --Children hanging over an overpass

           --Trash lining the streets

           The threat is everywhere. His eyes shift around looking 
           for a fight.  

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--DAY

           Water spews everywhere. It’s chaos.     

           Matt dismounts, speeds to the center of the crowd.  Sees 
           the pipe is ruptured, water blasts in all directions.  
                                 MATT
                        We’re not gonna plug this thing.  We need 
                        to put a new pipe in.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        How do we get this one out?  

           Matt considers.  Looks around.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        You got a plan, I suggest you step on it.

           Matt runs toward the Humvee and grabs cables.

           People clear the way while Matt ratchet straps them around 
           the pipe.

                                 MATT
                        Where’s Machmoud?

                                 MACHMOUD
                        Here.  

                                 MATT
                        Tell them exactly what I say.

           Machmoud nods.  Translates for Matt--

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        This pipe has to be replaced.  I’m gonna 
                        rip it free with the vehicle.  But we’re 
                        gonna need everyone we got to carry a new 
                        pipe from the truck.  Soldiers, Iraqis, 
                        everybody.

           Matt points to the PILE OF PIPING at the top of the hill. 

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go.  Go, go, go.

           With that, everyone disperses, runs fast up the hill.

           Matt hops inside the hummer and hits the gas.  The vehicle 
           tires spin up mud and burry themselves deep in the earth.

           TOP OF HILL--SAME

           Baker and a GROUP of Soldiers and Iraqis pick up pipes, 
           lug them on their shoulders.

           MATT’S HUMMER-SAME

           The engine smokes, but the pipe barely moves.  
                                 MATT
                        Fuck.  

           The pipe bends, bends more, and finally breaks to the 
           ground.  

           The Hummer lurches forward and drags the pipe away. Water 
           rushes.

           HILL--SAME

           The men run the pipe toward the aqueduct.  It’s heavy.  
           Real fucking heavy.  

           They all grind teeth, scream in agony, but they make it.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Ready. One, Two, Three.

           They heft the pipe off their shoulders. It splashes in the 
           mud.  

           A WELDING SOLDIER drops his mask, stokes the torch--  
           Sparks fly, and melted gobs of metal hold the new pipe in 
           place.  

           As they work, Matt storms towards Syverson.  

                                 MATT
                        Where the fuck is everyone?

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Excuse, me?  

                                 MATT
                        Where are all the workers?

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        The burnt bodies scared them off. No one 
                        wants to work.

                                 MATT
                        We need the engineers, sir.  We can’t do 
                        this without them.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Not gonna happen.  Not until we make this 
                        place safe.

                                 MATT
                        Well we better figure something out, 
                        because this is about as safe as this 
                        place is gonna get.  
                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Is it just me or did we lose good 
                        soldiers yesterday?

                                 MATT
                        Yeah.  And it’s gonna happen again.  If 
                        you’re in charge, then figure this the 
                        fuck out.

           Matt storms off. 

           EXT. BAQUBAH OUTSKIRTS--LATER

           Mud soaked Hummers wheel through the town.  Up top, Matt 
           looks out over the city once more, dried mud in every 
           crevice.  

           Inside, Baker yanks on Matt’s pant leg. Matt crouches 
           inside.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You need to cool it. You can’t tell the 
                        Captain to fuck himself.  Get your 
                        emotions under control.

                                 MATT
                        You’re right.
                              (sarcastically)
                        I mean things are going so well, maybe we 
                        should all just relax a little.

           Matt pops back up in the turret.  

           Baker grabs at Matt’s leg again.  Matt shakes him off.

           From the rear, a CAR ENGINE roars.  Matt turns to see an 
           Iraqi taxi speeding toward his convoy.  

           Matt spins his SAW around.  

           He fires a few shots over the top.

           Inside the Hummer, all look to the rear view, see the 
           vehicle lurching at them still.

           Radio chatter erupts.    

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Hold on, Ocre.  
                              (to Driver)
                        Get ready to slam these fucking breaks.
           Matt’s legs start to draw up the in turret.  He’s actually 
           climbing up onto the roof.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Ocre.  Get your fucking legs inside.  
                        You’re gonna fly off--

           The vehicle screeches to a halt.

           IN THE TURRET

           Matt holds on tight, then leaps off while the Hummer 
           fishtails.

           Matt pulls his 9mm from his leg and rushes the taxi.

           Baker and the rest hop out.  

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Ocre.  Get the fuck back.

           But Matt reaches inside the driver’s window and rips the 
           man out of the car.  

           A handheld electronic device goes flying from the Iraqi’s 
           hand.

           The Iraqi man scrambles along the ground looking for his 
           detonator.    

           Matt’s on him, unleashes a flurry of punches at the back 
           of the man’s head.  

           Baker intercepts, drags Matt off the man.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        Everyone away from the car.  Call EOD.  

           Baker pulls Matt aside

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?  He was 
                        gonna blow you sky high.

           Matt smacks Baker’s hands from his vest.  Walks back to 
           the Hummer and climbs in the turret, his new home.

           EXT. BAQUBAH-LATER

           The city, once alive, is now quiet and terrified.  

           The markets empty, the store fronts gated shut. 
           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE--CONTINUOUS

           The convoy stops just inside the gate.  Baker and Matt 
           dismount.

                                 MATT
                        This is getting to be a good time.

           He cocks back the hammer on the M-249 and clears it.  
           Click, click, snap.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You jump out of the turret like that 
                        again and I’ll kill you.

           He clears his weapon.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        If that guy would have got his hands 
                        around that detonator--

                                 MATT
                        You’re welcome.  

           Matt walks off, that’s the end of the conversation.

           EXT. BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE, BAQUBAH SAFE HOUSE-NEXT DAY

           Matt puts the SAW into the turret.  He straps a 9mm onto 
           his right leg, an M-4 leans against the side wall, his 
           spare.

           His mohawk now a beautiful infantry blue.

           He opens a wooden box to reveal GRENADES.  Matt is armed 
           to the hilt. 

           At the front gate there’s loud commotion.  

           An IRAQI WOMAN screams, cries.  With her are TWO IRAQI 
           CHILDREN. She pleads to get inside the gate but the guards 
           hold her back.

                                 SSG. BAKER (O.S.)
                        What’s up at the gate?

                                 MATT
                        Don’t know. 
           EXT. FRONT GATE-SAME

           CPT. Syverson stands with the two GATE GUARDS as the Iraqi 
           woman cries, pleads.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        What is she saying?

                                 GATE GUARD
                        She says her husband was killed.  It’s 
                        our fault.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON 
                        Our fault?  What the fuck did we do?

                                 GATE GUARD
                        She says his feet were tied...
                              (in Arabic to woman)
                        How did he die?

           The Iraqi Woman can barely speak through her tears.

                                 GATE GUARD (CONT’D)
                        He was beaten, his feet tied to a truck.  
                        He was dragged through the streets.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Jesus.

                                 IRAQI WOMAN
                        ...Machmoud Jassim Sarraf.

           Syverson stops.  

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Wait.  Tell her to say that name again?

                                 GATE GUARD
                              (in Arabic)
                        What was that name?  Say it again?

           The Iraqi woman realizes she has gotten through to the 
           soldiers. 

                                 IRAQI WOMAN
                        Machmoud Jassim Sarraf.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Get her and the kids into the CMOC.

                                 GATE GUARD
                        Yes, sir.

           Matt’s convoy rolls to the gate to inspect the commotion.
                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        What is it?

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Our translator.

           MATT’S VEHICLE

           Matt sees the crying Iraqi woman and her children being 
           ushered inside.

           Starts to piece the scene together.  Realization hitting 
           his face.

                                 MATT
                        Where’s Machmoud?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Haven’t seen him.

           The two dismount and check the other vehicles. No 
           Machmoud.  

           They reach the gate.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        Do we have a positive ID?

                                 GATE GUARD
                        The body is in the center of town, she 
                        says.  We’ll have to go retrieve it and 
                        check.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                        Sergeant Major, round up a few guys to 
                        check.  Take EOD, the body could be booby 
                        trapped.

                                 MATT
                        It’s Machmoud, isn’t it?

           Pause.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. The aqueduct.

           Matt leaps into action, the others follow suit, grasping 
           the severity of what’s to happen next. 

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (yells to convoy)
                        Load up now.  Everyone, let’s move.
           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--SAME

           An IRAQI WORKER, his eyes cold, produces a little WIRE AND 
           SWITCH from under his sleeve.

           He sets his shovel down and walks toward another section 
           of the aqueduct.   

           EXT. BAQUBAH--SAME

           The convoy speeds around corners, the radio chatter 
           ignites.

                                 CPT. SYVERSON
                              (into Radio)
                        Eagle One do you copy?  Eagle One?  Stop 
                        the workers.  Repeat, stop the Iraqi 
                        workers.

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT

           The radio inside a Hummer chatters with Syverson’s 
           warning.  It’s static-y, hard to understand.

           A SOLDIER answers.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Eagle One, go ahead, over.

           A GUARD SOLDIER spots the Iraqi Worker, suspiciously 
           walking toward him.

                                 GUARD SOLDIER
                        Hey.  There a problem?  

           The Iraqi stops, his face toward the ground. Can’t see his 
           eyes.

           EXT. BAQUBAH--SAME

           Matt’s vehicle speeds past the guards at the bottom of the 
           hill and climbs toward the aqueduct.

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--SAME

           The Iraqi Worker stops.  Stands still, eerily motionless.

                                 GUARD SOLDIER
                        Do you need something?
                              (yells, nervous)
                                 (MORE)
                                 GUARD SOLDIER (CONT'D)
                        I need a translator.  Need a translator 
                        over here.

           The Iraqi Worker slowly kneels to the ground.

           The Guard Soldier, confused, approaches with his weapon 
           half-drawn.

           The Iraqi Worker, a tear of regret streams down his face, 
           his eyes looking for the curve of the earth.

           EXT. BAQUBAH AQUEDUCT--SAME

           Matt’s convoy comes rolling into camp just in time for--

           A DEAFENING EXPLOSION

           The heavens light up with a flash.

           Matt is thrown from the Hummer, barely conscious.  Water 
           comes rushing toward him and the rest of his unit.

           His body tumbles end over end down the hill.

           Pieces of metal mix with water.  It’s from the piping, the 
           aqueduct has been destroyed.

           From Matt’s P.O.V. we see the ensuing chaos of those who 
           survived the blast tend to the wounded.

           Matt stumbles to his knees.  His ears ringing.

           Arms wrap around him.

           It’s Baker, bruised and bloody. He hoists Matt to his 
           feet.  

           Baker screams to Matt, but he/we hear nothing. 

           Matt looks at the destruction, puts his hand to his face 
           and pulls back a fist of blood and skin.  

           He screams. No sound. 

           And, for the first time, Matt weeps.  

                                                           FADE TO:

           BLACK SCREEN:

           Hummer engines whisper towards us, as in the opening.  
           They’re roaring now.
           INT. HUMMER-DAY 

           Matt stares at the Iraqi countryside--desolate, unending 
           sand. The blood from his face is washed clean, but the 
           open wounds remain.

           They roll past a sign: BAGHDAD 50km.

           The Hummer holds a heavy silence until--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        It can be beautiful, can’t it?  The 
                        country.

                                 MATT 
                        Yeah.  It can be.

           They pass: 

           A convoy.  A flag draped over reading: 3RD ENGINEERING 
           BRIGADE.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        There they go.  Army Engineers.  Maybe 
                        they’ll have better luck.

           Matt doesn’t answer.

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, MAIN GATE-SAME

           A stark contrast to the Baqubah Safe House.  IRAQI 
           CHILDREN play soccer outside the gate, Soldiers wear clean 
           uniforms. The war barely exists here.

           INT. HUMMER-CONTINUOUS

           Matt and Baker take in the beauty of home.  They are back 
           with their unit, back to safety.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I took a little souvenir.  

           Baker produces from his rucksack the sign: Camp Warhorse 
           SPA & RESORT.

                                 SSG. BAKER (CONT’D)
                        I figure it took from me so I wanted 
                        something in return.
           INT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--DAY

           Matt and Baker carry their gear through the halls.  The 
           place is crowded with unfamiliar faces--new faces, 
           innocent faces.  

           They make their way to the top of the marble staircase to 
           find Kidwell, mopping the floor.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                        Sergeant Baker, Private Ocre.  I heard 
                        they were bringing you guys back.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Yep.

           Awkward silence.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                        Well, I’ve been doing my part here.  
                        Someone’s gotta clean the floors, you 
                        know.  Sorry to hear about what happened.

                                 MATT
                        We just need to get to our room, Kidwell.

                                 PVT. KIDWELL
                              (hurt)
                        Right. 

           Kidwell gives his attention back to mopping.  

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, SHOWER-LATER

           Matt stands naked in the shower, looks amused at the hot 
           and cold faucets. He turns the cold water on.  Then off. 
           On. Off.     

           He smiles.  So simple. 

           INT. MESS HALL-NIGHT

           Matt sits by himself, empty chairs in all directions.  He 
           quietly munches on a late night meal.

           A TV barely audible, spouts sports highlights.  The 
           fluorescent lights hum and whiz.  
           INT. MATT’S ROOM-NIGHT

           Matt lies awake in his bunk, staring at the ceiling. 

           The churning overhead fan, the hum of laptops.

           He tosses and turns.  No sleep.

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, ROOFTOP-NIGHT

           Baker paces, SAT phone in hand.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Hello?  Anne?

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        I’m sorry, who is this?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Could I speak to Anne please.  It’s a 
                        friend of hers.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                              (suspicious)
                        Can I get a name?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Please, man.  Just put her on the phone.

           Muffled arguing in the background.

                                 ANNE
                        Hello?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Anne, listen I know this hurts but I need 
                        to talk.

                                 ANNE
                        You can’t call me anymore, Joel.  Please, 
                        this is too much.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I know, I know.  It’s just--

                                 ANNE
                        I’m gonna hang up.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I don’t know when I’ll get the phone 
                        again. 

           Anne sighs heavy, resignedly. 
                                 ANNE
                        Are you okay?

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        I’m fine, yeah.  It’s just.  I had to 
                        talk with you.  I don’t know what’s gonna 
                        happen.  And I miss you.   

                                 ANNE
                        Joel stop.  You can’t call me up and 
                        scare me like this.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Just tell me you’ll be there for me when 
                        I get back.  You don’t have to mean it. 
                        And I don’t care you found someone else.  
                        Just tell me you miss me and that you’ll 
                        be waiting. 

                                 ANNE
                              (stifling back tears)
                        Please be careful.  Please.  

           She hangs up. Baker drops the phone to his side.  

                                 MATT (O.S.)
                        Didn’t get the answering machine this 
                        time?

           Matt’s in the doorway.  He heard the whole exchange.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What’s on your mind, Ocre?

                                 MATT
                        The water. It was running.  We fucking 
                        had it, Sergeant. We had it. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        It wasn’t ours to have. If Baqubah gets 
                        water it won’t be because of us.  

           Baker takes a seat of the roof’s ledge, dangles is feet 
           over the side.

                                 MATT
                        Then why’d we bother?

           A heavy silence.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You know what every person on this planet 
                        has in common? 
                                 MATT
                        Answer my question.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Every person believes, truly believes, 
                        they’re the hero of the story.  The 
                        slayer of the dragon, the rescuer of the 
                        princess. And good for them, you know. 
                        They get to live life that way. There 
                        will never be a moment that fucks up 
                        their fantasy. 

                                 MATT
                        What’s that gotta do with Bartles and 
                        Meyers?  And Falvy.   

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Their moment came, Ocre.  Our moment. We 
                        coulda stayed outta Baqubah and lived the 
                        same fantasy as everyone else, but we 
                        went.  You went. And maybe reality had a 
                        hefty price tag, but at least we know 
                        what kind of men we are.

                                 MATT
                        What kind of men we are? 

           Matt swallows hard.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Back in Kuwait I spent every waking 
                        moment thinkin’ how I’d get sent home. 
                        Hell, I thought so hard I never slept. 
                        ‘Til one night, an idea. I went out to 
                        the motor pool, I put my hand in a Hummer 
                        door, and I shut it.  Over and over until 
                        my skin tore and my bones broke. I sat on 
                        the ground crying. Then, I see cigarette 
                        smoke from the doorway. Falvy. He didn’t 
                        say anything, just watched, then dropped 
                        his smoke and left. And as big of an 
                        asshole as he was, he never told anyone.  
                        He let me have my shame. So don’t you put 
                        me in the same fucking sentence as 
                        Bartles and Meyers. Or Falvy. Because I 
                        know exactly what kind of man I am.

           Baker searches for words that won’t come.  Instead, he 
           rests his hand on Matt’s shoulder.  This will have to do.
           INT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, MATT’S ROOM--NIGHT

           Matt and Baker sneak into their room, the rest of the guys 
           fast asleep.

           A flashlight glides over each of the sleeping soldiers, 
           taking Matt to his cold, empty bunk.

           Suddenly, a LOUD EXPLOSION rocks the building.

           Soldiers hop to, hit the lights.

                                 SGT. THOMPSON
                        Mortar round. That’s the closest one 
                        we’ve had in a while.  

           They settle back to sleep.

                                                           FADE TO:

           INT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT, GENERAL’S QUARTERS-NEXT DAY 

           Matt and Baker file into the General’s quarters and stand 
           at attention. The General is behind his desk, the Sergeant 
           Major in the corner. 

                                 GENERAL
                        At ease.

           They do.

                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        How you men feeling?

                                 MATT/SSG. BAKER
                        Good, sir.

                                 GENERAL
                        Sleeping?  Anything keeping you up?

                                 MATT/SSG. BAKER
                        No, sir.

                                 GENERAL
                        Good. 

           The General and Sergeant Major exchange looks.

                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        This whole business of war is, well, 
                        uneven.

                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        And there comes a time when a soldier has 
                        to be put back on level ground. The 
                        Sergeant Major and I think, for you two, 
                        that time is now.

           They stand silent, until--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GENERAL
                        There’s a convoy outside and you two will 
                        be on it. It’ll take you to the Balad 
                        flight line where a C-130 will take you 
                        back to the States.

                                 MATT
                        Sir, I’m happy to waive my two weeks of 
                        leave.  If it’s all the same, I’ll stay.

                                 GENERAL
                        Son, I’m not talking about paid leave.  
                        Your war is over.  You two are going 
                        home.

                                 MATT
                        Well we can’t, sir. Who’s gonna train our 
                        replacements?

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        You let us worry about that, Private.

                                 MATT
                        We haven’t packed up our gear, or--

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        It’s being taken care of. 

           Matt looks around the room in disbelief.

                                 MATT
                        Sergeant Major, I know because of what 
                        happened there’s reason to be concerned.  
                        But Sergeant Baker and I are fine to 
                        Demob with the rest of the unit.  

           Matt looks to Baker for support.  Baker looks straight 
           ahead.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Sir, it’s the opinion of both Private 
                        Ocre’s NCO’s that he ADVON back to the 
                        States as soon as possible--  
                                 MATT
                        Wait, wait--

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (ignoring him)
                        Furthermore, both the Sergeant Major and 
                        I agree from a previous discussion that 
                        the Private has nothing more to prove to 
                        himself, or anyone else.

                                 MATT
                        Previous discussion? You knew about this?

           Baker finally turns to look at his friend.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                              (softly)
                        It’s time to go home, Matt.

           All eyes are on him.

                                 MATT
                        I’m not fucking going anywhere.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        Easy, son.

                                 MATT
                        The Army ripped me from my home.  Then it 
                        shipped me and my friends to die in some 
                        God damn village.

           Baker grabs Matt’s shoulders, Matt shrugs him off.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        Not this time.  

                                 GENERAL
                        You two are dismissed.

                                 MATT
                        I say when it’s time to go.  There’s more 
                        to do.

           The Sergeant Major steps in to usher Matt from the room.

                                 MATT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got more to do.  We’re not finished 
                        yet. We can fix it, sir.  Sergeant Major, 
                        please--

           Matt tears up as Baker drags him from the room.  
           INT. HALLWAY--CONTINUOUS

           Matt and Baker emerge from the General’s quarters. Baker 
           pins Matt to the wall.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Enough is enough.  Look.  It’s over, 
                        Ocre. We’re done.

           They’re interrupted by--COMMOTION in the hallway.

           Soldiers gather around a doorway.

           Matt and Baker run over to--

           INT. KIDWELL’S ROOM--CONTINUOUS

           The room is lined with sandbags, packed tight and deep, 
           extending to the ceiling.

           Soldiers pull a huge mound of COLLAPSED SANDBAGS out of 
           the room, toss them.  Sand is everywhere, soldiers work 
           furiously.

           Matt and Baker join in the digging.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        What the fuck happened?

                                 SOLDIER
                        The mortar round last night shook ‘em 
                        loose.

           They dig and dig until Matt sees, peeking up from the 
           sand, Kidwell’s HEADPHONES. 

           Matt pulls at it, and finally drags into view the dead 
           body of Pvt. Kidwell, sand in his mouth, his face blue, 
           suffocated by the weight of his own sandbags.

           The group is left stunned, speechless, unsure of what to 
           do.  

                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        We need a medic.

           Matt checks Kidwell’s neck, no pulse.

           Matt bends down and looks into Kidwell’s lifeless eyes. 

           He looks the body up and down, his face stoic, no emotion.  
           The medics arrive and clear Matt away.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Come on, Ocre. Nothing to be done.   

           EXT. BAGHDAD AIRPORT--LATER

           Matt and Baker walk toward their convoy. Their gear 
           already loaded up in the rear vehicle.  Matt and Baker 
           climb inside.

           The convoy kicks to life and slowly rolls them away from 
           their building.

           Matt watches the Baghdad Airport, the commotion 
           surrounding it, get smaller in the distance.  Taking him 
           away, once again from a place he called home.

                                                            CUT TO:

           EXT. BALAD FLIGHTLINE-DAY

           The convoy stops alongside the flightline, C-130’s lined 
           up, now idle but soon their engines will churn and these 
           soldiers will be on their way home, to safety, to the life 
           they once knew.

           Matt hops out of the vehicle. A SOLDIER places Matt’s 
           duffels neatly on the ground.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Any advice on how to make it out of here 
                        alive?

                                 MATT
                        Yeah. Stop thinking about staying alive.

           Matt hefts his bags over shoulder and walks to join Baker 
           at--

           FRONT OF CONVOY--SAME

           Where the Sergeant Major and Baker trade their farewells.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        It’s a confusing feeling, isn’t it? All 
                        you want is to go home now here it is.  

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        Don’t feel anything, Sergeant Major.
                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        That’s what I mean. It takes a while for 
                        the experience to catch up to you, but it 
                        will.  Believe me. A man at war has two 
                        choices: spend your life reliving what 
                        you’ve seen, or not living at all.  

           Matt drops his bags next to Baker’s. The Sergeant Major 
           looks the two over, smiles.  These are his boys, his sons 
           of war.

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess we better leave you two 
                        nancies to it.
                              (yells to Convoy)
                        Load ‘em up.

           The Sergeant Major hops in his vehicle, pats the top of 
           the hood.

                                 MATT
                        Hey, Sergeant Major. Beautiful day for 
                        the Infantry?

                                 SGM. MCELLIGOT
                        Beautiful day, son. Beautiful. God. Damn. 
                        Day.

           And with that, the convoy speeds off.

           Matt and Baker watch their unit disappear into the 
           distance. Then hoist their bags over shoulder.   

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        After you, Private Ocre.

                                 MATT
                        Don’t mind if I do.

           Matt turns to the flight line, walks toward his plane. 

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        The Sergeant Major told me I’d miss this 
                        place some day.

                                 MATT
                        Not fucking likely.

           The two march on silently, the C-130’s engine fires up, 
           the blades whizz to life.

           A LINE OF SOLDIERS march single file up the steps into the 
           belly of the 130.
           Matt and Baker exchange looks, the reality of their 
           homecoming rushing toward them.

           Matt’s boots crunch sand, step after step. 

           We stay close on his boots as--

           The sound of the 130’s engine dims, muffles.  Until it 
           morphs into the unmistakable sound of an ocean.

           Matt’s boots stop. Ocean water laps against them.

           Matt looks up confused, turns around to see he’s at--

           MATT’S MEMORY, THE BEACH, SOMEWHERE U.S.A--DAY

           The planes have disappeared, so has Baker and the Line of 
           Soldiers.

           Just a few yards away, all he sees is a young child 
           building a sand castle.  It’s YOUNG MATT. 

           Matt is inside his own memory.

           He watches, until-

           MATT’S FATHER emerges over a sand pile.

                                 MATT’S FATHER
                        Matthew.  Hey, buddy.

                                 YOUNG MATT
                        Daddy look.  I built a castle.  This is 
                        my castle and I am the king.

           Young Matt flexes his little muscles.

           Matt smiles a sad smile. The memory rushing back.

           Matt’s Father kneels beside young Matt. Matt’s Father’s 
           face hangs heavy with regret, but young Matt can’t detect 
           it.

                                 MATT’S FATHER
                        Everyone’s the king of their own castle, 
                        Matt. But look--

           The tide touches the sand castle’s edge, takes with it a 
           bit of sand.

                                 MATT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        The tide is going to take it. 
                                 YOUNG MATT
                        I’ll sit here and keep it safe.

                                 MATT’S FATHER
                        The tide will win, Matt.  The tide always 
                        wins.

           Matt’s father hugs young Matt.  Looks the boy lovingly in 
           the face, holding back something stronger, deeper.  

                                 MATT’S FATHER (CONT’D)
                        Hey kiddo.  I’m gonna go for a coke. You 
                        want one?

                                 YOUNG MATT
                        Sit next to me dad.  We can keep it safe.

                                 MATT’S FATHER/MATT
                              (in unison)
                        Sorry, kiddo.  Next time.

           Matt’s Father kisses Young Matt softly on the forehead.

           Matt watches his father walk off into the sunset, the last 
           time he will ever see him.

           A YOUNG BOY on the beach runs a RED KITE up into the sky.  
           Just like in Matt’s dream in the opening.  He watches it 
           flutter free against a blue sky.

                                 SSG. BAKER (O.S.)
                        Ocre.  Ocre.

           Matt’s snapped back to--

           FLIGHTLINE--SAME

           The steps of the C-130 are before Matt. Baker’s at his 
           side.

                                 SSG. BAKER
                        You, okay?

           Matt nods, smiles wide.

           As Matt walks the steps, his boots leaving Iraqi soil for 
           the last time, we slowly pull back, up and over the 
           flightline. We see Matt as only one of a hundred soldiers, 
           each with their own story of pain and loss, duck into the 
           belly of the bird that will fly them home. 

                                                           FADE TO:
           CPL. MEYERS

           Corporal Meyers was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor for 
           his actions in Baqubah on 23 October, 2003.

           SGT. BARTLES

           Sergeant Bartles spent a year recovering after the loss of 
           his right arm. In 2007 his military contract ended.  

           He re-upped for another 5 years and now works as a 
           Military Intelligence Officer.

           SSG. BAKER

           Staff Sergeant Baker left the military shortly after 
           returning from Iraq.

           He now works as a Fireman in Kansas City, MO. 

           PVT. MATTHEW OCRE

           Private Ocre also left the military shortly after his tour 
           in Iraq.

           At the urging of Sergeant Baker, Matt reconnected with his 
           father.  

           Matt and Baker remain best friends.  

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.
