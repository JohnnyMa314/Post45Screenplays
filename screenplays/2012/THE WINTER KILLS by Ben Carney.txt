           IN BLACK: THE SOUND OF RAIN.       

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT   

           Winter.  Rain falling on the quiet city.  The streets are 
           empty and narrow, the buildings and tenements are old and 
           brick, built by immigrants.        

           Across the Hudson River is a small galaxy of lights, the 
           incredible expanse of NEW YORK CITY dominates the sky.

           EXT. PALM MOTEL - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT

           A forgotten corner of the city, the Palm Motel is dark, 
           tucked away in shadows.    

           POV: Upstairs on the top floor we are outside Room 23.  
           Through the door - the sound of a bed squeaking, a headboard 
           bangs against the wall.       

           Slowly moving closer to the door, to the room number, the 
           noises continue.  The rain slowly begins to turn, until it is 
           SNOW.    

                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 THE WINTER KILLS

           FADE IN:

           INT. PALM MOTEL - ROOM 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           On the face of a young PROSTITUTE, SAMANTHA, twenty, she’s on 
           the bed, naked on her hands and knees.  She’s indifferent, on 
           drugs, here for the money. 

           DETECTIVE TOM MATHIS, 55, does a bump of COCAINE off each  
           dimple in her lower back.  He’s naked, on drugs and sweating.    

           A series of shots.  Mathis having rough intercourse with her, 
           doing cocaine.  More cocaine and harder sex crash into:

           INT. PALM MOTEL - ROOM 23 -- LATER

           Quiet.  Still.  Mathis is a fall from grace.  He’s naked, 
           sitting at the small table next to the bed.  The temporary 
           distraction of Samantha is over as he catches up with 
           himself.  He looks to her, she’s thirty-five years younger, a 
           prop in a lonely room.   
           Mathis pulls out a wad of cash and counts out ten twenties, 
           two hundred dollars.  He puts it on the table in her 
           direction.     

                                 MATHIS
                        What’s your name? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        Samantha.   
                             (re: the two hundred)
                        I’m only a hundred... 

           A beat on Mathis, he’s unsure what to say.

                                 MATHIS
                        Is Samantha your real name or your 
                        fake name? 

                                 SAMANTHA
                        My fake name... same as the last 
                        time we came here...  

           A beat on Mathis, he starts getting dressed, nods toward the 
           money.  

                                 MATHIS
                        You can take it... 

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT -- MORNING

           5 AM, dark out still.  Mathis sits by the window thinking.  
           His walls are bare.  The apartment is cramped and stagnant, 
           he’s holding a BIRTHDAY PARTY INVITATION that arrived in the 
           mail - Emily’s Turning 12! - balloons and colorful writing on 
           the cover.

           Mathis anxiously tapping his foot, he looks to the card then 
           to an empty bag of cocaine, he’s out of drugs.  Coming down 
           is hard.   

           Mathis looks to the NEWSPAPER next to him, at a PICTURE: The 
           African American Community protesting at City Hall, holding 
           signs: No Racist Cops.  Next to it is a smaller insert 
           picture of Mathis’ face.   

           It’s all under the HEADLINE: Detective To Return After 6 
           Month Suspension.  

           Mathis notices the sun is starting to rise, he looks into the 
           window of the apartment across the street - POV: a COUPLE 
           argues intensely, this is the start of their day.   

           Mathis watches, a voyeur.  The Woman gets fed up and quits, 
           she raises her hands in surrender.  The relationship is over 
           as she walks out.   
           Mathis watches the Man now sitting on the couch, alone, head 
           in his hands.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- DAY

           Sunday service.  JILL GRAY, thirty-five, sits with her 
           daughter, LILY, three years old.  Next to her is an EMPTY 
           SEAT.  She’s annoyed, someone’s missing, she checks her 
           watch.

           INT. CHURCH - BATHROOM STALL -- CONTINUOUS

           Standing in the stall, DETECTIVE DAN GRAY, thirty-five, 
           passionately watches a FOOTBALL game on his cell phone.

           The outside door KICKS open, a WOMAN'S HEELS walking toward 
           the stall.

                                 GRAY
                        Damn...

           He turns off the phone, stuffs it in his jacket.  A BANG on 
           the door.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Someone's in here.

                                 JILL (O.S.)
                        Yeah, no shit...

           INT. CHURCH -- LATER

           The service over.  Gray following Jill, Lily at their side, 
           they are leaving in a line, everyone passes by the PASTOR on 
           their way out the doors.  

                                 JILL
                        It's a great example you set for 
                        your daughter. 

                                 GRAY
                             (whisper)
                        She doesn't know...

                                 LILY
                        Did your team win, Daddy?

                                 GRAY
                        Daddy was in the bathroom praying, 
                        sweetheart.
           Gray and Jill walk by RICHARD, he’s looking at them, catches 
           them: 

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey, everybody... good to see you 
                        guys.

           Richard is fifty years old, he’s socially awkward, church is 
           his one day to shine.  Gray dreads this weekly encounter.    

           Richard shakes Gray’s hand and gives Jill a mistimed hug.  

                                 JILL
                        Good to see you too, Richard.   

                                 RICHARD
                        Hey, Dan... I took those pictures 
                        of your car for the auto-trader,  
                        I’ll get ‘em in this week’s issue.  

                                 GRAY
                        Oh, great, thank you... 

                                 JILL
                        Thank you, Richard, that’s a huge 
                        help in getting that monster out of 
                        my driveway.    

           Gray smiles at his wife.  

                                 GRAY
                        The car’s not a monster, honey.  
                        It’s family.  

           She smiles back, having won this argument a long time ago.  

                                 JILL
                        Not for long...    

           Gray silenced, he shakes Richard’s hand goodbye.  

                                 GRAY
                        That was a wonderful service.  See 
                        you next week.   

                                 RICHARD
                             (he points to Jill)
                        See you day after tomorrow at the 
                        chicken dinner set-up?

                                 JILL
                        Yeah, see you then...

           Gray sneaks his family past the Pastor, they walk out the 
           doors into a brutal cold. 
           A sign above the doors: You Are Now Entering The Mission 
           Field. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- DAY

           Cold afternoon.  Mathis is doing a bump of cocaine off his 
           wrist, a bad habit’s getting worse.  He’s sitting on the 
           grass, well hidden behind an uneven sea of tombstones.    

           He peeks around a corner.  Mathis’ POV: a WOMAN with her two 
           DAUGHTERS, holding one another, crying in front of a grave.  
           It’s hard, they leave flowers and walk away.   

           EXT. CEMETERY - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis standing at the same headstone now.  His eyes are 
           closed.  The tombstone reads: DOUGLAS B. WALSH.  1952-2002.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY'S CAR -- DAY

           Driving through Jersey City.  Gray's car is old, on borrowed 
           time.  Jill is annoyed with him for missing the service.   

                                 JILL
                        I want you to make a special call 
                        to Richard to thank him for the 
                        auto-trader thing.   

                                 GRAY
                        I’ve had the car since I was 
                        nineteen. 

                                 JILL
                        It leaks oil.  My father’s giving 
                        you a new car...

           Gray’s a provider, it rakes his ego having to take something.  

                                 GRAY
                        We can buy our own new car... 

                                 JILL
                        No we can’t.  We can’t afford 
                        anything because we bought a house 
                        out of our price range.  Remember?    

           Driving in silence.  Gray smiles, looking at his pissed off 
           wife, he knows it’s not about the car.
                                 GRAY
                        I’m sorry I missed church.  It’s 
                        just that I believe in Evolution, 
                        and that Sunday is for football.    

           Gray pretends to start crying.  Lily starts LAUGHING in the 
           back seat.  Jill trying not to smile.  They stop at a red 
           light.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        If you don't kiss me right now I'll 
                        lose strength, and if I lose 
                        strength I'll swerve.  Lily's only 
                        three, she deserves to live.

                                 LILY
                        Kiss him, Mommy!

           Jill shakes her head, a sucker for her husband.  She leans 
           over and kisses him.  He looks at her, real love.

                                 GRAY
                        Thanks.  We'll live now.

                                 JILL
                        It's green, Detective.

           Gray pulls away. 

                                 LILY
                        Daddy, what’s Evolution?

                                 GRAY
                        It means you’re a fish, baby... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COIN-UP LAUNDRY - JERSEY CITY -- NIGHT

           Midnight.  A dirty all night laundromat.  Mathis waiting on 
           his laundry tumbling dry, he’s strung out again.

           A piece of loose CHANGE comes out in the dryer... it begins 
           BANGING around.  It draws Mathis' attention and we CUT TO:

                                                             FLASHBACK:

           EXT. ROOFTOP - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- DAY

           In silence.  On the roof of an abandoned FACTORY.  Confusion.  
           Mathis RUNNING, gun drawn, YELLING orders to stop. 

           A young BLACK MAN, WINSTON SHELL is being chased to the edge 
           of the roof, Mathis running toward him, Winston stops, he’s  
           trapped, nowhere left to go.  
           Winston’s looking back and forth between Mathis and the 
           ground eight floors down.    

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        He’s comin’ off a suspension...

           Mathis stops.  A stand off now.  Behind Mathis DET. BILL 
           WEXLER, “WEX”, fifty-five, runs out onto the roof, he stops, 
           sees the situation unfolding.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           The room is silent, just the echo of pings from the heating 
           duct.  Gray and Jill in bed.  His arms around her.

                                 JILL
                        Why?

                                 GRAY
                        It was about that black kid who 
                        jumped off the roof... this guy 
                        Mathis was the one there.  He was 
                        the cop chasin’ him before he went 
                        over. 

           Jill thinking, she hesitates with this, a bad feeling.   

                                 JILL
                        I guess there’s a lot of people who 
                        don’t think that kid jumped.    

           The sound of a GUN SHOT and we return to:

           EXT. ROOFTOP -- FLASHBACK

           Series of shots: moments later now, Winston Shell is gone 
           over the ledge, Mathis is face down on the ground, he seems 
           to have been TACKLED by Wex.

           Wex lays next to him disheveled and out of breath, a 
           horrified look across his face as Mathis picks himself up.  

           Both Detectives looking at MATHIS’ GUN - five feet from them.  
           Smoking.  

                                 JILL (V.O.)
                        Do you think he threw him over?

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. COIN-UP LAUNDRY -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis staring at his clothes, the loose change still 
           knocking around.

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        I don’t know... there’s a lot of 
                        questions... he’s got a history.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROOF TOP -- FLASHBACK

           Quick flashes:  Mathis looking at Wex, both leaning over the 
           ledge and looking down to the ground at Winston Shell dead. 

           INT. COIN-UP LAUNDRY -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis’ clothes done drying.  Mathis sits still, he hasn’t 
           moved, sobered by his reflection in the glass dryer door.  
           Mathis searching in his face for anything familiar.    

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        He had a partner that was killed 
                        ten years ago... tomorrow’s the 
                        anniversary.  And he hasn't had a 
                        new one since.

           INT. GRAY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Jill closes her eyes, moves into him for the night. 

                                 JILL
                        I bet if you see enough dead bodies 
                        and enough dead kids and enough 
                        suspects jump off roofs you become 
                        numb.  And then nobody likes to be 
                        around you.

            Tension, just below the surface.

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        How come you get to be the lucky 
                        one?

           On Gray laying awake, thinking.  He closes his eyes.   

                                 GRAY
                        This is how I send my kids to the 
                        better schools.  This is how I get 
                        the better things... the better 
                        paycheck, the better house, the 
                        better Christmas.  The better 
                        everything.

                        The new fuckin’ car.       

           INT. COIN-UP LAUNDRY -- NIGHT

           Mathis hauling out his basket of laundry, the pay phone on 
           the wall RINGS and Mathis stops, moments pass on him as he 
           faces the relentless ringing.  Finally he picks up.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Hello?

           Someone on the other end.  Light breath.  No words.  Birds 
           chirp in the background.  The person hangs up.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING.

           Series of shots:  Early morning cold, the commute crawling 
           into the Holland Tunnel, everything across the city is 
           frozen. 

           EXT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- MORNING

           Mathis walks out to see “RACIST PIG” spray painted across the 
           side of his car, hot pink paint against a dark blue car.  
           Mathis looks around, people trying not to stare as they pass.    

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (V.O.)
                        As I’m sure you’ve heard... it’s 
                        his first day back.  

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING

           Mathis driving through the city, tagged a “Racist Pig” for 
           the world.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (V.O.)
                        And it was ten years ago today that 
                        we lost Doug Walsh... so give him a 
                        little space. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING

           Gray at his desk, CAPTAIN STAN BOYD, 62, standing over him.  
           Boyd is stern, a military background.  
                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        He’s our best Detective.  He gets 
                        all the good shit which means so 
                        will you from now on.    
                             (then)
                        Come in my office after he gets 
                        here, I got something for you guys 
                        already... came in this morning.  

           Boyd pats Gray’s desk as he walks away, reminds him: 

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        Give him some space.  

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, you got it, Captain.  

           Moments pass, Gray looks around: The precinct is cold, 
           sterile, cramped.  A white linoleum floor with harsh 
           fluorescent lights from the ceiling.

           DETECTIVES stir around, no eye contact, it's all business.

           Gray watches as Mathis walks in and walks through the room, 
           he's bundled, scowling.  Goliath.  He doesn’t look at anyone 
           but Wex.  

           Gray watches as Mathis and Wex shake hands, welcome back, a 
           quick hug.  Wex is rock, loyal to cops and to Mathis.  

                                 MATHIS (V.O.)
                        Because I don’t want a partner, 
                        Stan... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN BOYD'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis pacing in front of Boyd behind his desk.

                                 MATHIS
                        ...especially him, some green 
                        fuckin’ thirty year old.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        He’s thirty-five.

                                 MATHIS
                        I’m off suspension.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (V.O.)
                        I don’t know what to tell you, 
                        Mathis.  Comin' off your suspension 
                        the Department wants you to have a 
                        partner.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        They specifically chose Gray.

                                 MATHIS
                        How long we known each other...

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        ...a long time.  And my respect is 
                        river-wide.  But I’m in a position.  
                             (then)
                        Why don’t you think about retiring?

           Mathis shakes his head, doesn’t want to hear it.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        You were eligible to retire eight 
                        months ago.  Go fishin’, Mathis.  

           Gray steps up to the door, knocks.  Boyd nods him in, Mathis 
           stands straight as they’re introduced.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        Mathis, Gray.  Gray, Mathis.  
                             (then)
                        Judy, Cindy.  Cindy, Judy.  

           They shake hands, Mathis remains professional.

                                 MATHIS
                        How you doin’, Gray?  Good to meet 
                        you.

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, you too...

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Gray came up while you were away.  
                        As of today you two kids'll be 
                        playing together.
                             (he vouches for Gray)
                        Gray’s got a big brain, he just got 
                        his masters last month. 

                                 MATHIS
                        What’d you study?

                                 GRAY
                        Criminal Law.  

           Mathis looks haggard, up all night on drugs.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        You feel okay?   

           Moments pass on Mathis, he doesn’t like Gray questioning him.
                                 MATHIS
                        I forgot to get my flu shot, you  
                        better load up on Vitamin C.   

           Boyd is done with introductions, he’s handing Gray an 
           address, presenting them their first case.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Call came in this morning... looks 
                        like someone did up a pro over on 
                        the west side.  
                             (then)
                        Happy huntin’ you two.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- DAY

           Driving.  Silence.  Gray steals looks at Mathis, his face an 
           impossible wall.  Mathis negotiates through the traffic, he’s 
           calm, there’s no rush.     

           Moments passing until Mathis makes a final turn: Gray is 
           looking up the street now to the scene of a crime - COPS 
           everywhere.  

           Mathis slowing down now as his face changes.  Mathis is 
           thrown off by something, something’s not right, his heart 
           beats faster.  Gray notices.  

                                 GRAY
                        You alright?

           Mathis parks the car, shuts off the engine, he looks up at 
           the sign:  The Palm Motel.  The place we first met him.  

                                 MATHIS 
                        Yeah, I’m fine...  

           EXT. PALM MOTEL -- DAY

           We’ve been here.  The motel is only shittier in daylight. 

           The throngs parting for Mathis.  Gray sticks close behind as 
           they walk up the stairs, putting on latex gloves. 

           The location has completely disrupted Mathis, he’s on edge, 
           looking out at faces in the surrounding crowd, everyone is a 
           suspect.   

           Mathis and Gray walking past the room numbers - Mathis sees 
           the body is in Room #23.  The room he was in.

           The CORONER -  JOHN ELLIS - 48 years old, walks out.  Ellis 
           is young still, fit, today he’s overwhelmed by the crime. 
                                 ELLIS
                        I can't say for sure yet, but she's 
                        been dead about a day.  Extensive 
                        mutilation... her fuckin’ hands 
                        have been cut off.   
                             (shaking his head) 
                        And I don't see ‘em anywhere.  
                             (then)
                        We haven't seen this since...

           His eyes meet Mathis’.  Mathis doesn’t respond, he walks in.  
           Gray looks to Ellis.   

                                 GRAY
                        Since what?

                                 ELLIS
                        Since Mr. Winter.

           The Coroner nods him inside the room.  

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ll see... 

           Gray takes a breath, he goes in behind Mathis.

           INT. PALM MOTEL - ROOM 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           The room is dark, light bulbs broken, just dull light 
           struggling through pulled curtains.

           There’s blood on the walls and in the rug, a body is covered 
           in shadows on the bed.  

           Gray realizing the hell they've just walked into, he sees a 
           simple METAL PODIUM in front of the bed, a BIBLE open, blood 
           splattered across the pages. 

                                 GRAY
                             (re: the podium)
                        The killer was preachin’ to her.

           Mathis is still, unable to move, unable to look away from 
           SAMANTHA covered in her own blood, eyes open, left murdered 
           on the bed Mathis shared with her.  

           A DETECTIVE walks in behind them.    

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Was there a name?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Samantha Adler.  20 years old.  ID 
                        says she’s from Bayonne.      

           Mathis looks down.  His mind going fast. 
                                 MATHIS
                        Samantha.  That was her fake name 
                        or real name?

                                 DETECTIVE
                        That was her real name.  We don’t 
                        have a street name on her yet.    

           On Mathis.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Mathis in a stall, thinking hard, doing bumps of cocaine off 
           his key.  

                                 MATHIS (V.O.)
                        This is his first kill.  Mr. 
                        Winter’s back.  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Mathis splashing water on his face now, mind racing on drugs. 
           No coincidences.    

                                 MATHIS (V.O.)
                        Ten years to the day he killed my 
                        partner.  My first day back from 
                        suspension...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPTAIN BOYD'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           Mathis and Boyd.  Mathis has stopped moving, thinking. 
           Captain Boyd feels obligated to say.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        This could all still be a 
                        coincidence...

           Mathis looking at him, unable to share the truth about 
           Samantha and the motel.

                                 MATHIS
                        He’s talkin’ to me, Stan.  
                        Directly.    

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        How do you know?

           Mathis unable to answer. 
                                 MATHIS
                        I just... he is.  

           Boyd looking at Mathis, the dark bags under his eyes.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        I’m gonna put a car at Gray’s 
                        house.  We’re gonna tap your house 
                        and cell lines in case he calls. 

           Mathis nodding, thinking. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        I’m still gonna hope to God that 
                        today is a tragic coincidence.  But 
                        either way, you need to make an 
                        effort with Gray.  If you think 
                        Winter’s back then take him 
                        somewhere and sit him down.  Fill 
                        him in. 

           Moments on the two of them.  Boyd’s got a bad feeling now.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        You sure you don’t want to go 
                        fishin’?

           Mathis walks out of Boyd's office, past Gray engrossed in a 
           FILE, written on the lip: DET. DOUGLAS WALSH -- 2002.   

           Mathis sees the file, keeps walking.

                        We came up the same time.  We had 
                        different ways of doing things, but 
                        we got shit done...

                        started.  A fuckin’ serial killer

           Gray flipping through the files and pictures.  Five days, 
           five bodies.

                        A whole blanket of terror came down 
                        over the city.  People stayed 
                        inside.  

           Gray looking through NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS now.  Serial Killer.  
           The different headlines gage the fear of the city, the name 
           of the killer recycled over and over:  Mr. Winter. 

                                 MATHIS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The fuckin’ guy starts calling 
                        me...

           Mathis walks back into the room, he walks up to Gray’s desk, 
           starts speaking, we don't hear the words.

                                 GRAY (V.O.)
                        What was he sayin'?

           Gray gets up, grabs his coat, leaves following Mathis.

           EXT. CEMETERY -- EVENING - CONTINUOUS

           A dark sky, almost black - the last of daylight hanging over 
           bones in the ground.  Mathis and Gray standing in front of 
           Doug Walsh’s headstone - Gray shivers.

                                 MATHIS
                        Mr. Winter’s a mission killer, he’s 
                        a cliche’, he thinks he’s some 
                        divine apostle, chosen by God to 
                        cleanse the sin from the earth.
                             (then)
                        His victims all had histories, 
                        there was a wife beater, a 
                        pedophile, a slum lord... all kinds 
                        of bad fuckin’ people.  One by one 
                        he started takin’ ‘em down.      

           Mathis lives this story, the details are his life.

                        Doug turns up as the sixth victim.  

           It burns Mathis still, he collects himself for the millionth 
           time.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Doug got a call from a guy who said 
                        he had some info on the murders.  
                        He invited him to the motel where 
                        he was stayin’ and Doug went.  

                                 GRAY
                        Alone?  Where were you?

           Mathis looks at him, he can only say:  

                                 MATHIS
                        I wasn’t there.

                        Doug walked into that room and was 
                        shot once in the back of the head.  
                        He was killed instantly.  
                             (then)
                        Mr. Winter took his badge and his 
                        gun.  Trophies, I guess, I don’t 
                        know... 

           Gray looks over at Mathis, his ungovernable emotions.  

                                 GRAY
                        Why the Mr. Winter nickname?

                                 MATHIS
                        It was the coldest five days in a 
                        hundred years when he came to town.  
                        And the press likes nicknames.  It 
                        sells papers.

                                 GRAY
                        And that was it?  After Walsh he 
                        just vanished?

                        There's no shame in turnin’ back 
                        before this thing gets started. 

           Gray staring at Doug Walsh’s grave.  No turning back.

           INT. JERSEY CITY CORONER'S OFFICE -- EVENING

           Samantha’s body covered on the table.  Mathis and Gray stand 
           to the side.  Ellis warns them ahead: 

                                 ELLIS
                        Ready?

           They nod, Ellis pulls off the sheet: Gray winces, Mathis 
           numb, staring at Samantha’s face, still close and familiar.  

           Mathis loosens his tie, suddenly sweating. 

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        This girl was gutted.  Fairly 
                        cleanly.  Not something Joe serial 
                        killer knows how to do.  Her hands 
                        were removed by the same 
                        instrument.  I'm assuming some sort 
                        of hunting or cutlery knife.  There 
                        are thirty-seven different burns 
                        from cigarettes that I’ve found so 
                        far... her skull is fractured in 
                        three different places and I’m 
                        assuming right now she died from 
                        blood loss after her first and/or 
                        second hand was removed.

           Ellis holds up LARGE RUBBER STRAPS, his eyes meet Mathis’.  

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        These were tied around both her 
                        arms as half-ass tourniquets so 
                        she'd bleed, and eventually die, 
                        slower.     
                             (then)
                        Judging by the podium and the 
                        Bible, I’d say she was preached a 
                        good sermon while she suffered.  
                        Tremendously. 

           Silence in the room.  Everyone registering the details of her 
           death.  
                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        I said it ten years ago and I'll 
                        say it again now.  Winter’s 
                        special... his cuts, they're 
                        precise.  He's got extensive 
                        knowledge of the human body, he 
                        might’ve been a doctor or a surgeon 
                        at some point.

           Ellis brings the sheet back over her.  Gray makes it clear:

                                 GRAY
                        We’re not even sure it’s him yet.

           Mathis and Ellis share a look, they know better.

           INT. CORONER’S OFFICE - BATHROOM STALL -- LATER

           Mathis doing bumps of cocaine off his car keys, a sniff up 
           each nostril.  He closes his eyes, climbing stairs to heaven, 
           he flashes back: 

           MATHIS’ FLASHBACK:

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- NIGHT

           Mathis watching Samantha get in his car from off the street, 
           she closes the door. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. JERSEY CITY CORONERS OFFICE - HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis walks out of the bathroom, Gray waiting in the quiet 
           hallway. 

                                 GRAY
                        You alright?

                                 MATHIS
                        Fine... let’s get out of here...

           The Detectives walking out of the building.  

           A door opens down the hall, the quiet is stolen by the sound 
           of a WOMAN CRYING, hard tears, devastation, a mother has lost 
           a child.  Samantha’s MOTHER, Mathis’ age, is helped by FAMILY 
           down the hall.   

           Mathis and Gray stop, they let this pass, Mathis unable to 
           look at her as she moves by, his eyes break for the floor.  
           He’s still.
                                 GRAY
                        Must be the girl’s mother. 

           On Mathis, the crying is unbearable.  Mathis begins to SHAKE.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Poor fuckin’ woman. 

           Gray watches Samantha’s Mother exit the building.  The 
           hallway returns to quiet.  Mathis disengages his emotions, 
           tries to get out of this:

                                 MATHIS
                        Let’s call it a night.  Meet me at 
                        the motel at 8:00.  We’ll start 
                        there.  

           Mathis makes no eye contact, walks away.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        There’s gonna be a car at your 
                        house now for the duration.  You’re 
                        in danger.   

                                 GRAY
                        Why?

           Mathis looks back over his shoulder.  

                                 MATHIS
                        You’re my new partner.  

           Mathis keeps walking, moments passing on Gray, he asks Mathis 
           down the hallway.  

                                 GRAY
                        Why’d Mr. Winter kill Doug Walsh?  

           Mathis stops.  Turns back to him. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Why was his death warranted like 
                        the others?     

           Moments passing on Mathis’ face.  The question is too much to 
           answer.   

                                 MATHIS
                        Mr. Winter never gave a reason, he 
                        never called me again after...  

           Gray and Mathis in silence, facing each other at opposite 
           ends of a long hall.  
                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Doug was clean as a whistle.  Ask 
                        anyone.

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Gray driving home, staring out onto the city streets at 
           night.       

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Gray looking out his window at the cop car parked down on the 
           street.  The room is quiet, Jill already sleeping as he 
           climbs into bed, closes his eyes.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis is restless, pacing, the apartment is a cage.  He 
           looks out his window and notices something, he shuts off the 
           light:

           Mathis now watching his NEIGHBORS, the Couple in the opposite 
           apartment.  He notices all their things are in boxes, some of 
           the furniture is already moved, it’s a final goodbye as they 
           hug.   

           Mathis sits back in a chair.  In the dark now he is finally 
           still.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING

           Series of shots:  Gray working the street around the Palm 
           Motel, asking NEIGHBORS and STRANGERS questions.  Everyone 
           shaking their head.  No info for the cops.   

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM STALL -- MORNING

           Mathis is creating a fake urine sample.  He’s pouring urine 
           from one jar into another jar.  He twists the caps shut 
           tight.    

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis walks toward his desk holding his sample, waiting 
           there is DAVID ROSS, thirty-eight years old, young, very 
           confident, ready to make his mark.

           Mathis walks over.  David extends his hand.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        David Ross... 

           Mathis shakes his hand.

                                 MATHIS
                        Michael Jackson.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I’m with Internal Affairs...

           Mathis hands over the jar of his urine.  David takes it.    

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You just go?  It feels cold.

                                 MATHIS
                        I can put it in the microwave if 
                        you want.  

           Mathis sits back at his desk, in front of the hard PHOTOS 
           from room 23.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I wanted to talk to you about 
                        Winston Shell and the events of 
                        July 2nd.

                                 MATHIS
                        I'm off suspension and that case is 
                        closed.  I’m required to piss in 
                        the cup and that’s it.  I gotta go 
                        meet my partner.    

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Actually, I've just been given the 
                        Shell case.

           Mathis looks at him.  And?

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        And I'm gonna keep it open.

           Mathis smiles, David is looking him up and down.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Your eyes are glassy.  You okay?  

                                                              INTERCUT:
           EXT. PALM MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray standing on the street outside the motel.  He checks his 
           watch, waiting for Mathis.  He looks back to the motel, up at 
           Rm. 23.  The door.  The entrance to hell.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           David Ross staring at Mathis, he’s ready to slay the giant. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Do you read?

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Yeah.

                                 MATHIS
                        Do you read a lot?

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        As much as I can.

                                 MATHIS
                        Did you read the fuckin’ report?  
                        Because all these answers are in 
                        there.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I'm just here to see if there's 
                        anything you'd like to add... 
                        something maybe you're just 
                        remembering now.

                                 MATHIS
                        Well, there was...

           Mathis stops himself...  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                             (intrigued)
                        There was what?

           A beat on Mathis.   

                                 MATHIS
                        We saw a herd of Unicorns... they 
                        were running wild through the 
                        streets.  
           EXT. PALM MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray’s starting alone, he’s up on the second floor now, 
           walking past the rooms, he stops at 23 and begins removing 
           POLICE TAPE across the door. 

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           At Mathis’ desk.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Was there any contact between you 
                        and Mr. Shell before he went over 
                        the ledge?

                                 MATHIS
                        No.  No contact before he jumped.  
                        But the Unicorns flew off.  In a V 
                        formation.   

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Why was your gun fired?  I don’t 
                        understand that part.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Read the report.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        The report’s vague.  The report 
                        says you simply dropped your gun.  
                        I find that absolutely impossible.    

           INT. PALM MOTEL - RM. 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray slowly moving through the room, still stained in blood. 

                                 MATHIS (V.O.)
                        Why are you really here?  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           David smiles.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I wanted to come down here and look 
                        you in the eye.  I wanted to see 
                        what kind of man you were.

                                 MATHIS
                        And what's your gut tell ya?
                                 DAVID ROSS
                        My gut's sayin' that you use 
                        excessive force and you have for a 
                        long time.  And this time you took 
                        it too far.

           Mathis sits back in his chair, smiles, David Ross now here 
           for his amusement.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Why do you think he jumped?

                                 MATHIS
                        I think he was lookin' at doin’ 
                        life in prison... then I think he 
                        made a choice. 

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        A lot of these reports of abuse 
                        filed against you over the years 
                        have been with mostly African 
                        Americans.  Winston Shell was 
                        African American too.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Fuck you.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Are you a racist, Detective?

                                 MATHIS
                        Fuck you. 

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        It's just a question.

                                 MATHIS
                        And I answered it.  Twice.

           Staring each other down.  Mathis moves his FILE toward David.  
           PICTURES of Samantha’s dead body now visible.  David shifts, 
           uncomfortable. 

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        We still haven't found her hands... 

           INT. PALM MOTEL, RM. 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray stands in the middle of the room.  He notices something 
           with the wall.  The way the light hits it.

           There's a rough patch.  He rubs his hand over it.  The white 
           paint is a slightly DIFFERENT shade here.  Brighter.  Newer.  
           EXT. PALM MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gray walking back to his car, walking beside him is the 
           MANAGER, Egyptian, he’s speaking nervous, broken English.

                                 GRAY
                        When was that room painted last?

                                 MOTEL MANAGER
                        Seven months ago.

           Gray opens his trunk.  

                                 GRAY
                        Was there a hole patched at any 
                        point since?

                                 MOTEL MANAGER
                        No.  No holes.

           Gray pulls out a crow-bar.  

                                 GRAY
                        Are you sure?

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           David getting up to leave.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Ya know... it kinda feels like 
                        you’re callin’ me a murderer.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I’m not.  

           David smiles, gaining confidence.

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        Not yet.  

           INT. PALM MOTEL - RM. 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray standing before the wall, he begins chipping away at the 
           painted sheet rock.  Carefully.  Delicate.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis watching David walk away.

                                 MATHIS
                        Winston Shell killed his pregnant 
                        girlfriend with a knife.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MATHIS (CONT'D)
                        He stabbed her seven times.  It 
                        took her fifteen minutes to finally 
                        die.      

           David stops, looks back.  A beat.   

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Doesn’t mean you get to throw him 
                        off a roof.  

           INT. PALM MOTEL - RM. 23 -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray pulling away sheetrock.  The SMELL hits him.  He pulls 
           his tie up to his nose.  Gray pulling away the wall.  He 
           sticks his hand into the hole.  Feeling around.

           Gray touches something.  Pulls his hand out.  BLOOD.  He 
           SMASHES the crow bar into the wall.  Urgency now.

           Until Gray rips off a last piece. 

           He stops.  His heart pounding, racing now, his eyes don't 
           move as he starts backing up... backing up.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis turns to a MAP OF JERSEY CITY next to his desk.  The 
           map is big - 4ft. by 4ft. - a big RED TACK marking the 
           location of the Palm Motel - the 1st victim.

           Mathis’ desk phone rings.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PALM MOTEL - RM. 23 -- LATER

           Mathis standing with Gray, Wex and Captain Boyd.  The wall is 
           peeled away now.  Inside are Samantha’s TWO HANDS, they are 
           BOUND and HUNG together, a GUN, 45mm, glued and tied to the 
           palms - as if an offering to the Detectives.  

           Mathis knows right away.

                                 MATHIS
                        That’s Walsh’s gun...  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- DAY

           Mathis, Gray and Wex sitting together.  The Map of Jersey 
           City hung beside them.  Mathis staring at the lone red tack.   

           Captain Boyd getting off the phone with Ballistics. 
                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        That’s Ballistics... it’s what we 
                        knew, it’s a match, it’s Doug 
                        Walsh’s gun.  
                             (making it official)
                        It’s the return of Mr. Winter.  
                             (then)
                        There's one other thing...

           A beat, this gets their attention.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        There's fresh residue.  The gun was 
                        fired.  About twenty-four hours 
                        ago.

                                 WEX
                        Was the Prostitute shot?

                                 GRAY
                        No.

           The Detectives silent, no direction - a game has begun.    

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        How’d Winter pay? 

                                 GRAY
                        Cash.  The owner says the guy was 
                        tall.  White.  Forty-five to fifty 
                        years old.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        So he matches ninty-eight percent 
                        of the city?  Excellent.  

                                 GRAY
                        There were no other witnesses, no 
                        working cameras on the premises.
                             (then)
                        He did say the guy specifically 
                        asked for that room.  

           Mathis’ heart beats faster.  Boyd shakes his head, it all 
           adds up to a headache.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        I gotta eat somethin’... 

           Boyd walks away.  Wex walks away across the room to his desk.  
           Mathis and Gray alone in silence.  

                                 GRAY
                        So where’s he been?  Why was he 
                        dormant?  

           Mathis exhales, no ideas.  
           Mathis looks across the room, David Ross now in the building, 
           he’s sitting down across from Wex.  

           Wex and Mathis share a quick look.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Who's that?

                                 MATHIS
                        If he ever talks to you, I want to 
                        know about it.  He's from Internal 
                        Affairs.  He's the bottom of 
                        humanity, the bottom of everything.

           A beat on Gray, he chooses a moment carefully:

                                 GRAY
                        I heard they’re keeping the Winston 
                        Shell case open?

           Mathis looks to Gray, he clarifies so there’s no questions.    

                                 MATHIS
                        What happened on that roof was a 
                        murderer didn’t feel like spendin’ 
                        the rest of his life in prison. 

           David Ross turns to look at Mathis... but his eyes catch Gray 
           instead.  Their eyes meet, a long moment, Gray looks back 
           down at his file.   

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I gotta get out of here.

                                 GRAY
                        Can you give me a ride home? 

           Mathis stops, this oversteps their relationship.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        My car’s old.  It wouldn’t start in 
                        the cold this morning.  
                             (off Mathis’ look)
                        No worries if it’s out of your way.

           Mathis feels obligated. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Let’s go...

           David Ross locked in on Gray.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- NIGHT

           Quiet.  Mathis driving.

                                 GRAY
                        So you married?  Got any kids?

                                 MATHIS
                        No. 

                                 GRAY
                        Ever married?

                                 MATHIS
                        No.

           Mathis doesn’t force conversations.  They stop at a red 
           light.  A gang of TRANSVESTITES laughing as they cross the 
           street in front of Mathis’ car.  

           A beat on Gray, watching them, he smiles:  

                                 GRAY
                        When I first became a cop in the 
                        city, we were tryin’ to get rid of 
                        a trans-gender prostitution problem 
                        and I volunteered to go undercover.

           Mathis checks his watch, the light turns green, he starts 
           driving.    

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        We rented a limo and my old partner 
                        Bill Delaney was pretending to be 
                        the driver.  I was in the back as 
                        the John... and the code once we 
                        got them to proposition us was 
                        "turn right here", and then we'd 
                        pull over and book the guy.  
                        Everything was being recorded for 
                        evidence.
                             (then)
                        So we pick up this guy.  A man.  A 
                        real man-man, you know... but in a 
                        dress.  And he's comin' on to me, 
                        tryin' to kiss my neck, and finally 
                        he says his thing so I'm like "turn 
                        right here"... and... Delaney  
                        pretends not to hear me... and all 
                        the sudden I got this dude clingin' 
                        to me, this fuckin’ construction 
                        worker... tellin' me all the stuff 
                        he's gonna do and I'm like "turn 
                        right here, please."  And he's 
                        still drivin'... and it's gettin' 
                        weirder and I'm like TURN RIGHT 
                        HERE!  And Delaney’s still 
                        pretending not to hear me...
           Mathis' lips could almost smile.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        FINALLY I'm kickin' the wall with 
                        my foot... TURN RIGHT HERE, YOU 
                        FUCK, TURN RIGHT HERE!!!
                             (then)
                        And... he finally turned.  But they 
                        got it all on tape.  Everyone got a 
                        copy at the Christmas party that 
                        year. 

           Mathis is slowing down, his POV: a BLACK MAN standing back in 
           the shadows, a PROSTITUTE stands down the street. 

           Mathis shuts off his lights, pulls over, the engine still 
           running.   

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

                                 MATHIS
                        Stay here... I’m gonna talk to 
                        someone...  

           Mathis gets out of the car, Gray watching him walk to CURTIS, 
           36, Mathis’ dealer, he nods to Mathis. 

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis walks up to Curtis, there’s an exchange - a wad of 
           CASH from Mathis for a brown PAPER BAG folded up.  Mathis 
           stuffs it in his pocket.     

           Mathis walking back to his car.  He sees the PROSTITUTE’S 
           FACE, she smiles at him, he stops.   

                                 MATHIS
                        How you doin’?

                                 HOOKER
                        You lookin’ for a date tonight?  

           On Mathis, debating, looking her in the eye.  His hand 
           clenches the brown bag tighter.    

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis gets in, puts the car back in drive and pulls away.  
           Gray is on his cell phone:

                                 GRAY
                        Milk?  Okay, I’ll stop and get 
                        milk.  Love you too. 
           Gray hangs up.  Looks over at Mathis.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        That was fast.

                                 MATHIS
                        He didn’t know nothin’...    

           Mathis pulls away.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Gray in his car, the engine running, parked on an abandoned 
           dirt road, the sound of the New Jersey Turnpike echoes across 
           miles of train tracks, refineries, black marsh and wasteland. 

           Gray is tired.  A long day is almost over as he checks his 
           watch, there’s a KNOCK on the window.  Gray reaches over,  
           unlocks the door and David Ross gets in.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Nice to see you today, he say 
                        anything about me?

                                 GRAY
                        He said you were moody... and 
                        unlikable.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Funny.  Are you okay with this 
                        case?  It could snowball.  

           Gray having second thoughts, but nods, he’s fine.

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        It’s gonna hit the front page in 
                        the morning, they’re gonna go crazy 
                        with this “Mr. Winter” shit.  

                                 GRAY
                        Anything from the witness, did she 
                        call again?

           There’s a hint of desperation in Gray’s voice, he waits for 
           an answer that might rescue him.  

           David Ross shakes his head, he plays it down. 

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Like I said, she’s afraid to 
                        talk... we gotta do this on her 
                        time... we gotta be patient.
                             (re-affirming)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT'D)
                        ...but she saw Mathis throw that 
                        kid off the roof and we’re gonna 
                        take him down for it.    
                             (then)
                        No matter where this other case 
                        goes... no matter how fucked up it 
                        gets... you're working for me, 
                        you're investigating him first and 
                        foremost.  Everything else is 
                        second.

           Gray nods, it’s understood.  David reading more off him.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        What else?

           Gray thinking through a feeling.  Then

                                 GRAY
                        Doug Walsh... something’s not right 
                        about it.  He doesn’t fit.  His 
                        kill was different.  All the other 
                        deaths were long and drawn out.  
                        Walsh’s body was left alone.  He 
                        was killed instantly, a single 
                        bullet to the head.  There was a 
                        respect for him.   
                             (thinking)
                        And it was a month later... 
                        separated from all the rest.      

           David Ross dismissing it.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Look, don’t get side tracked... 
                        what’s that have to do with us?

                                 GRAY
                        What I’m saying is maybe Mr. 
                        Winter, whoever the fuck he is, 
                        didn’t kill Doug Walsh.  It was 
                        only made to look that way.  

           David listening now.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe Walsh had somethin’ on 
                        someone... and so they wanted him 
                        gone.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Or maybe Doug Walsh has some 
                        skeletons in the closet we don’t 
                        know about.  
                             (thinking)
                        You think Mathis had somethin’ to 
                        do with it?   
           Gray quiet, he dismisses it for now.

                                 GRAY
                        I don’t know, I have no idea.  It 
                        just came into my head and I wanted 
                        to say it out loud.  
                             (then)
                        Let’s get some sleep.  

           David nods, he opens his door and gets out.          

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Don't forget to stop and get us 
                        milk? 

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, sorry, he got back in the 
                        car...

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        From doin’ what?

           Gray thinking.  

                                 GRAY
                        I don’t know...

           Mathis is shady, they both know it. 

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Two percent... it’s the blue top.  
                        And get some cookies.

           He closes the door.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Mathis alone in a tremendous silence.  Cocaine on a mirror.  
           Three lines are gone.  Three remain.        

           A car horn HONKS from down on the street.  Mathis looks.

           EXT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT - STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis gets up to the drivers side window.  The Coroner, John 
           Ellis, rolls down the window of his black Mercedes.  He hands 
           Mathis a brown PAPER BAG, stealing a look into Mathis’ eyes.  

                                 ELLIS
                        Party’s started, huh? 

           Mathis doesn’t talk about it.  
                                 MATHIS
                             (re: the brown bag)
                        We’re good to go with this for 
                        awhile.  

                                 ELLIS
                        Long as you need it.  
                        I’m on your side, Mathis.   

                                 MATHIS
                        I owe you.  Anything you need.  

           Ellis sees the drugs in Mathis’ eyes.  Rolling up his window.  

                                 ELLIS
                        Just go easy...

           Ellis pulls away.  Mathis watches his taillights disappear 
           down the street.  A beat on Mathis, his breath in the air.  

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis opening Ellis’ brown paper bag.  A small jar of URINE, 
           the same kind of jar Mathis cheated from before. 

           Mathis sniffs a line of coke off the mirror, he walks to his 
           window, looks across the street to the neighbors apartment.  
           The Girl is gone now, the Guy is left alone, packing the last 
           of his things. 

           Mathis licking his lips, grinding his teeth, he looks to his 
           telephone sitting silent.   

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. PALM MOTEL -- NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Mathis having sex with Samantha, it’s maniacal, the dark side 
           of a man.   

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis is standing at the window, his eyes are running deep, 
           mind in chaos.

                                 JILL (V.O.)
                        Why is there a cop car parked in 
                        front of our house.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GRAY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Jill washes her face in the bathroom.  Gray on the bed 
           looking at PICTURES of his car in the weekly AutoTrader.  The 
           day still with him as he looks up at the ceiling and closes 
           his eyes.    

                                 GRAY
                        It’s just a precaution.  

                                 JILL
                        That you don’t get murdered?  Like 
                        his last partner?  

           Gray’s exhausted, they’ve been running through this.  

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        And I can’t talk on the phone?  

                                 GRAY
                        You can talk on the phone.  It’s 
                        just the phone will be tapped in 
                        case this person tries to make any 
                        contact with me, so people might be 
                        able to hear you.   

                                 JILL
                        So I can’t talk on the phone?

           Jill suddenly dragged into something bad.  Gray walks over to 
           her.  

                                 GRAY
                        This is just a step along the 
                        way... you know that.  When I’m 
                        where I want to be... things are 
                        gonna be great for us. 

           He pulls her into him, holds her.  She lets him off the hook 
           for now, looking at the AutoTrader on the bed.    

                                 JILL 
                        Call Richard and thank him for 
                        doing that for free.    

                                 GRAY
                        I will.  Then I’ll tell him how you 
                        only half believe in Jesus and I 
                        don’t believe at all.  

           She smiles. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll tell him about how this is all 
                        a ploy to make our daughter feel 
                        guilty about doing bad things.  
           She kisses him.  

                                 JILL
                        Call him and say thank you, tell 
                        him I’ll see him at the setup 
                        tomorrow.  And un-tap my phone.    

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE - LILY’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Gray standing in the doorway watching his daughter sleep.  

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 

           At an upstairs window, Gray looking down out onto the street, 
           rain pouring from the sky now, TWO COPS sitting in their 
           patrol car drinking coffee.  Staying up all night.  Gray 
           looks up and down the block, all clear for now.    

           Out of the silence Gray’s cell phone RINGS, it startles him, 
           he answers quickly.  

                                 GRAY
                        Hello...
                             (then)
                        This is Detective Gray speaking...

           On Gray, listening...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Gray driving through a downpour of rain, his wipers slapping 
           back and forth.    

           EXT. HILLCREST DINER -- NIGHT

           Gray gets out of his car, running through the rain to the 
           diner.  He stops.  He sees a WOMAN in the window sitting 
           alone.  We recognize this Woman as Doug Walsh’s WIFE from the 
           cemetery.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HILLCREST DINER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gray now sitting with KELLY WALSH, 55, a widow, wounded 
           still, the years have been hard.
                                 GRAY
                        Let me first say Mrs. Walsh, I’m 
                        sorry for your loss.  I didn’t know 
                        Doug but I’ve heard great things. 

                                 KELLY
                        Thank you, call me Kelly.  

                                 GRAY
                        Okay, Kelly...
                             (then)
                        So what can I do for you?

           She pulls out an OLD PIECE OF PAPER and hands it to Gray.  He 
           opens it to see written in faded pen: 

           Brook Falls  

                                 KELLY (O.S.)
                        That’s Doug’s handwriting... 

           Gray looks off the page back up to Kelly.  Confused.   

                                 GRAY 
                        What’s it mean?

           Kelly shakes her head.  

                                 KELLY
                        I don’t know... 
                             (then)
                        In our backyard there’s a tree.  
                        And sometimes Doug would go out 
                        there with a beer and just sit... 
                        and think.  It was kind of his 
                        spot.  
                             (then)
                        A couple months after he died I 
                        finally got the strength to go out 
                        there, and there was this old piece 
                        of paper.  He must’ve had it out 
                        there with him.  I don’t know what 
                        it means... or if it has anything 
                        to do with this... But after I 
                        heard they found Doug’s gun, and 
                        the killer’d come back... something 
                        told me to call you.     

           Gray nods.  He has to ask:  

                                 GRAY
                        Does Detective Mathis know about 
                        this?  Why didn’t you call him?

                                 KELLY
                        I didn’t want to give it to 
                        Mathis...  
           There’s a real disdain for Mathis, it’s impossible to hide.  

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t wanna have to see that man 
                        ever again.   

           A beat on Gray, he waits for her to explain.

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        Doug was alone because Mathis was 
                        gone... he was wasted in a bar. 
                             (then)
                        I think the killer made a mistake.  
                        I think it was supposed to be 
                        Mathis and not Doug.  Mathis is the 
                        animal.  The sinner.  Mathis is the 
                        one.  I can’t prove it but you 
                        better believe Mathis threw that 
                        kid off the roof.   Mathis is 
                        crazy.  I wouldn’t be surprised if 
                        he hears voices.    
                             (then)
                        That’s why Doug’s body was left 
                        alone.  The killer knew he’d made a 
                        mistake.  My husband died for 
                        Mathis’ sins.    

           A beat on Gray.

                                 GRAY
                        What were Mathis’ sins?

                                 KELLY
                        Then or now?

                                 GRAY
                        Both.

                                 KELLY
                        Drugs.  Murder.  Arrogance.  Abuse.

           She stops herself.  

                                 GRAY
                        Do you have proof of any of that?

                                 KELLY
                        No.  I don’t...  I just wanted to 
                        give you that piece of paper.  And 
                        tell you I hope you catch the man 
                        that killed my husband.  

           On Gray.  

                                 GRAY
                        I’m gonna have to tell Mathis about 
                        this, and that I saw you...  
                                 KELLY
                        Do whatever you want.  He knows how 
                        I feel... 

           Kelly gets up, leaving.  She looks back at Gray.

                                 KELLY (CONT’D)
                        You have a family?  

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah.

           A beat on Kelly.  

                                 KELLY
                        Stay alive.  

           Gray watches her walk out.  He looks back down to the paper: 
           Brook Falls - Doug Walsh’s handwriting.   

           Heavy breathing... someone RUNNING, we CUT TO:

           MATHIS DREAMING:

           EXT. ROOFTOP -- FLASHBACK

           Mathis’ POV: chasing Winston Shell across the factory 
           rooftop, Winston running for his life, getting closer to the 
           edge of the building, Winston Shell stops, hesitates, he 
           turns back to Mathis and their eyes meet. 

           Then Winston notices someone across the rooftop, Mathis looks 
           and sees SAMANTHA - watching them.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           MATHIS WAKING UP!

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis deep from out of a nightmare, thrown back into his 
           apartment, back into reality: The distant sound of a phone 
           RINGING.  

           Mathis on his chair, suddenly awake, the RINGING phone 
           remains as he gets up, looking around for it now, unsure from 
           which direction.  

           Mathis searching, he walks to his window, he opens it and 
           leans out onto the fire escape.  The ringing is louder now, 
           he looks down on the street, a CELL PHONE left there directly 
           below.   
           Mathis staring at the phone, he has a bad feeling, he jumps 
           out onto the fire escape. 

           EXT. MATHIS’ FIRE ESCAPE -- CONTINUOUS

           More ringing.  Mathis CLIMBING DOWN from the top floor, four 
           flights, he’s trying to get to the phone in time.  He gets to 
           the second floor, pulls the lever to drop the stairs, they 
           rattle and screech down to the street.   

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis jumps off the stairs, runs to the phone and picks it 
           up.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Hello... 
                             (then)
                        Hello...

           Silence.  Mathis losing his patience:

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello...

                                 MR. WINTER
                        I’m gonna do horrible things.

           A chill runs up Mathis, his heart drops, he pulls out his gun 
           and gets cover behind a car.   

           The voice of the killer is electrifying, Mathis is 
           speechless.  Mr. Winter remains a voice.  Always calm, clear, 
           emotionless.

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        They'll write about us one day.  I 
                        still believe that.

           Moments of silence passing, in the background the faint sound 
           of BIRDS chirping.  Mathis listening, gritting his teeth.  He 
           looks up and down the sidewalk, no sign of anyone.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Tom, are you there?

                                 MATHIS
                        I’m here.

                                 MR. WINTER
                        The Lord has spoken.  He's 
                        spoken... and I've listened.  
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. WINTER (CONT'D)
                        Keep this phone between us, you 
                        don’t want them listening to these 
                        calls.  Not with the things I know.   

           Mathis listening, he’s cornered.   

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve seen you, Tom.  I’ve watched 
                        you.  I’m the only person on this 
                        earth that you could have a truly 
                        honest conversation with.  

                                 MATHIS
                        I’m gonna find you this time.

                                 MR. WINTER
                        I’d like that very much. 
                             (then)
                        It'll get interesting now.  You'll 
                        see in the morning. 

           Mr. Winter hangs up.  

           It’s abrupt.  Mathis' left with the phone in his hand.  He's 
           frozen.  He waited ten years for that.  

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis penned in his apartment, he’s holding the cell phone 
           from Mr. Winter.  He sits, confused.    

           He walks over to the window, opens it and steps out onto his 
           fire escape. 

           EXT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis looking over the city, miles of lights spread across 
           the darkness.  A vast stage.  A killer is loose. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING

           Series of shots: the morning sky is heavy over the city.   

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT - MORNING

           The windows frosted, Mathis is asleep in his clothes, his own 
           cell phone RINGS, he wakes and grabs it fast.    

                                 MATHIS
                        Mathis.
           Mathis staring at his table, the cell phone Mr. Winter left 
           him laying there.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (O.S.)
                        You better get down here, right 
                        away.

           Mathis hangs up, grabs his coat, his gun, Mr. Winter’s phone, 
           he turns the ringer to VIBRATE and puts it in his jacket. 

           EXT. MATHIS’ BUILDING -- MORNING

           Mathis walks outside, he looks over to the NEWSSTAND next 
           door.  He sees the morning headline: BODY FOUND, WINTER 
           RETURNS.  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MORNING

           Chatter, phones ringing, Mathis walking by desks, he keeps 
           seeing the paper, the headline.   

           The other DETECTIVES in the room are uneasy, Mathis feels the 
           leering eyes.  POV: Gray, Wex and Captain Boyd waiting 
           outside Boyd’s office. 

                                 MATHIS
                        What is it?

           Captain Boyd nods them all inside.

           INT. CAPTAIN BOYD'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Captain Boyd sits at his desk.  Gray and Wex off to the side, 
           Mathis is the last to know.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        We found the bullet from Walsh's 
                        gun.

           Gray and Wex look uncomfortable, Mathis feeling it.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        Give Wexler your gun.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Why?

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Give him your gun, Mathis.  Right 
                        now.     

           Mathis looks fearful now, he hands over his gun to Wex.  Once 
           Wex has possession Boyd begins to explain: 
                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        He shot the second victim in the 
                        head.  It was an eighteen year old  
                        girl named April Owens.  She was 
                        found early this morning in Newark.  
                        John Ellis thinks she was killed 
                        yesterday.   She was baby-sitting 
                        at the time.

           Beat.  Mathis is confused.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        The girl being baby sat is missing 
                        now...

           Mathis waits.  Everyone breaks eye contact with him.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        It's your daughter... 

           Everyone braces for the impact.  Mathis looking at the floor.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        Tom?

           Mathis looks up.  Looks at Gray.  At Wex.  Gray sees Mathis 
           for the first time, emotional, shaken to the bone.  

           Mathis’ POV: his world is sucked of life and of sound -  
           everything goes to SILENCE - Mathis is still, Boyd is 
           talking, Gray and Wex touch his shoulders, he closes his 
           eyes.

           Sound would slowly fade back in on:

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD (CONT’D)
                        ...we got the whole Goddamn state 
                        looking for her right now, her 
                        picture’s on every TV station in 
                        the Northeast.  Every Detective in 
                        this building is coming on the 
                        case.    
                             (then)
                        Wexler's gonna come on with you and 
                        Gray till we get her back. 

           Mathis looks to Wex, Wex pats his back.  

                                 WEX
                        We’ll get her back. 

           Mathis is still, shoulders limp.  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Your wife's outside.
                                 MATHIS
                        My wife?  She's here?

           Gray watches Mathis walk out of the room.   

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis staring at his WIFE, KAREN, forties, waiting at his 
           desk.  She sees Mathis for the first time in years and begins 
           sobbing.

           Mathis wants to hold her but intimacy is so foreign.  He’s 
           able to touch her shoulder.   

                                 MATHIS
                        I'm gonna find her...

           Gray walking out of Boyd’s office, he catches the image of 
           Mathis touching her.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM STALL -- DAY

           Mathis snorting coke in a stall, madness setting in.     

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM -- DAY

           Mathis splashing water on his face, world unraveling.  Gray 
           walks in.  

                                 GRAY
                        You okay?

                                 MATHIS
                        I just, I don't...

           Mathis PUNCHES a stall door then KICKS it, he leans against 
           the wall, composes himself and gets back to business.    

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Whatta’ we got to go on from it?  
                        What’re they telling you?  

                                 GRAY
                        There were no witnesses to anyone 
                        coming or going from the house.  No 
                        one heard a gunshot. 
                             (beat)
                        We got nothin'.

           Moments passing on Mathis, he looks to Gray.
                                 MATHIS
                        My wife and I got divorced seven 
                        years ago.  I haven't seen my 
                        daughter since. 

           Mathis looking Gray in the eye, asking stern:

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Was there a car at your house last 
                        night?  All night? 

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah.

           The sound of VIBRATION from Mathis’ pocket.  The cell phone 
           from Mr. Winter.  Gray looks to the noise, Mathis thinks 
           fast.

                                 MATHIS 
                        It’s my phone.  I gotta take it.  

           Mathis rushes out of the bathroom.  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - STAIRWELL -- MOMENTS LATER

           The phone still vibrating, Mathis gets into the stairwell, a 
           beat as he composes himself solid and answers. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Hello...

           Moments passing.  Breath on the other end of the line.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello...

                                 MR. WINTER
                        It’s amazing what we’ll do to other 
                        peoples daughters.  Isn’t it?  
                        Mathis?  

           Mathis still.  

                                 MATHIS
                        She didn't do anything, she's not 
                        one of your fuckin' sinners.

                                 MR. WINTER
                        But you are, Mathis.  You.  Are.
                             (then)
                        Go out front right now and I’ll 
                        leave something for you...

           Mr. Winter hangs up.  Mathis runs out of the stairwell.  
           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           The rooms all buzzing, phones all ringing - Gray sits at his 
           desk in the middle of chaos - holding the paper from Kelly 
           Walsh: Brook Falls.

           Gray turns to his computer, he types into a GOOGLE search: 
           Brook Falls Doug Walsh.  He gets a screen of irrelevant 
           matches.  

           Gray scratching off a list of searches:

           Brook Falls / Tom Mathis - Brook Falls / Murder - Brook Falls 
           / Serial Killer - Brook Falls / Mr. Winter.  

           Gray shakes his head.  Chasing his tail.  He looks up and 
           catches Mathis RUNNING through the precinct, Wexler sees 
           Mathis too... they both instantly RUN after him.

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis runs out front, everything is normal - Gray and Wex 
           follow Mathis out, confused by his urgency.  

                                 GRAY
                        What’s wrong?  Mathis?   

           Mathis looking around, nothing out of the ordinary. 

                                 WEX
                        Mathis, what the fuck?

           Then a ten year old KID walks up to Mathis.  

                                 KID
                        Are you Detective Mathis?

                                 MATHIS
                        Yeah, that’s me...

           The Kid hands Mathis a folded piece of paper.  

                                 KID
                             (nodding)
                        The guy over there told me to give 
                        this to you.  

           Mathis looks, there’s no one there.  Mathis opens the piece 
           of paper.  An address: 6464 Sunset Street.  Jersey City.    

           Mathis hands the paper to Gray.

                                 MATHIS
                        What guy?  Where?

           The Kid looks.  Gray hands the address to Wex.  
                                 KID
                        He’s gone.  

                                 MATHIS
                        What’d he look like?  

           Mathis’ tone scares the Kid.

                                 KID
                        He was... in a blue jacket. 

           Mathis pulls out his gun, Gray and Wex follow.  The Kid 
           frightened stiff now.   

                                 WEX
                        Where, kid, where?  

                                 KID
                        Over there...

                                 MATHIS
                        Where over there!?

           The Kid starts to cry, unsure what’s happening.  Wex screams 
           out to every COP around him.  

                                 WEX
                        BLUE JACKET!!!

           Frantic now, Mathis and Gray looking around, no blue jacket 
           anywhere.  Mathis looks at the address.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY -- MORNING

           Mathis’ car RACING through the city, weaving fast through the 
           traffic.   

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis and Wex up front, Gray in the back, flinching at every 
           near miss.  Wex is talking to dispatch:  

                                 WEX
                        ...suspect is in a blue jacket, 
                        should still be within’ a couple 
                        blocks of the station if he’s on 
                        foot.  We are on our way to 6464 
                        Sunset Street...     

           Wex hangs up.  Mathis driving fast.  Gray thinking in the 
           back, he looks over to Mathis. 
                                 GRAY
                        Why were you running outside?

           Mathis points up ahead, saved by the address.

                                 MATHIS
                        Look at this...

           The Detectives look out up ahead - a CHURCH - the building is 
           spectral, 19th Century, gothic blacks and grays. 

           EXT. CHURCH - JERSEY CITY, NJ -- DAY

           The Detectives getting out, towered by the cathedral.  Mathis 
           pulling out his gun, starting up the long stairs.  

           INT. CHURCH -- DAY

           Candles lit at the top of the room, light is beaming through 
           stain glass windows.  Biblical murals on the ceiling.  The 
           pews are dark polished wood and empty.

           Mathis, Gray and Wex moving in slowly, ready, shoot to kill, 
           their heels echo out into the empty room.

                                 MATHIS
                             (whispers)
                        Wait... shh... stop.  

           Gray and Wex stop.  Mathis looking at them.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hear that?

           Listening close, the distant sound of RADIO STATIC, a station 
           coming in and out.   

           Wex points to a side HALLWAY in the far right corner of the 
           room, the sound coming from behind an office door.     

           INT. CHURCH - SIDE HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           The Detectives moving up to the door, the radio static is 
           louder now, the station coming in and out is of a CHRISTIAN 
           PASTOR delivering a sermon.      

           Gray’s mind racing, he’s got a bad feeling.  Mathis is 
           getting himself ready, he’s gonna bust through the door.   

           Mathis tightens the grip on his gun, BARKS OUT: 

                                 MATHIS
                        POLICE!  IDENTIFY YOURSELF!
           There’s no sounds or movement, the radio doesn’t change.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        POLICE!  

           Nothing.  Mathis looks back to Gray and Wex.  Ready?  Mathis 
           turns back and KICKS open the door.  He rushes in.  Fearless.  
           Gray and Wex follow.   

           INT. CHURCH - OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           The Detectives move into the single room, a PASTOR, 63, sits 
           behind his desk, his back to us, he’s facing the back wall.  

                                 WEX
                        Hey, Asshole, wake up...

                                 MATHIS
                        Hey... HEY!

           The Pastor is not responsive, Mathis moving around him, gun 
           aimed at his head, quickly he sees the Pastor is dead.  He’s 
           BOUND to his chair.  A pool of BLOOD beneath him.  

           Gray shuts off the radio and with the radio off they all 
           instantly turn to the sound of RUNNING WATER, a SHOWER.

           They immediately notice the office has a small bathroom.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        POLICE!

           A sense of uncertainty in his voice.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                             (screaming now)
                        POLICE!!! 

           Moving to the door.  Slowly.  Gray and Wex move to opposite 
           sides of the door, then Mathis KICKS it open.  The Detectives 
           look into the room, there’s blood dripping down a clear 
           shower curtain.

           Mathis slowly steps over and rips the curtain open. 

                                 WEX
                        Oh, fuck... 

           The Detectives are DISGUSTED, instantly turning back into the 
           room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BLACK.
           The sound of a city street in the afternoon.  Police radio in 
           the distance.  Then

           A phone line ringing:

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           On Gray’s face, further disturbed by unfolding events, he’s 
           on his CELL PHONE, the ling ringing.

           Gray looks to the car, Wex is on the radio trading 
           information.  Mathis is down the street buying a cup of 
           coffee from a lunch truck.  Gray watches him, studies him.   

                                 BROOK FALLS COP (O.S.)
                        Brook Falls Police Department...

           Gray hesitates, unsure how to say this.   

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, ahh... this is Detective Dan 
                        Gray, I’m with Homicide in Jersey 
                        City... 

                                 BROOK FALLS COP (O.S.)
                        Okay, what can I do for you, 
                        Detective?

           The Brook Falls Cop is curt, Gray feels rushed, irritated. 

                                 GRAY
                        We got a case right now involving a 
                        serial killer and the missing 
                        daughter of a Detective.  Any kind 
                        of fuckin’ respect would be nice.  

           The Cop is quiet, scolded.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        You ever hear of Doug Walsh?  

                                 BROOK FALLS COP
                        No.  

                                 GRAY
                        He was a Jersey City detective 
                        murdered.  We found a piece of 
                        paper that said Brook Falls so I’m 
                        tryin’ to see if that means 
                        anything to anyone.  I need you to 
                        ask around or put me in touch with 
                        someone who can.  

           Moments pass.  
                                 BROOK FALLS COP
                        Look, I’m sorry, I been dealin’ 
                        with assholes all day...
                             (then)
                        I’ll ask around if anyone knew your 
                        guy.  

           Gray shakes his head - it feels hopeless.  

           Gray sees Ellis coming out of the church, down the stairs 
           toward him.

                                 GRAY
                        Ask around.  I’d appreciate any 
                        help...

           Gray hangs up the phone.  

                                 ELLIS
                        You know who this is right?   
                        This is pedophile pastor Andrew 
                        Reilly, he went to trial, everyone 
                        knew he was guilty but the jury. 

           Ellis lights a cigarette.    

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Winter tied him to the chair 
                        then he cut off his genitals... as 
                        you saw in the tub.  Looks like he 
                        let him sit there and bleed to 
                        death...  

           Ellis looking at Gray, he notices his attention to Mathis 
           handing over cash to the Vendor. 

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Must be so hard to be Mathis right 
                        now.  I heard they’re keeping the 
                        Winston Shell case open... 

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, I heard that too...

                                 ELLIS
                        The way I see it... if you stab 
                        your pregnant girlfriend seven 
                        times you deserve to go off a 
                        roof... head first. 

                                 GRAY
                        You think Mathis threw Winston 
                        Shell off the roof?

           A beat on Ellis, staring at Gray.
                                 ELLIS
                        I don’t know how Winston Shell went 
                        off that roof.  I’m just glad he 
                        did.  And IA should just leave 
                        Mathis the fuck alone.  He’s the 
                        best guy we got.   

           Wex getting out of the car, walking over to them, Mathis 
           walking back with his coffee.  They huddle together.   

                                 WEX
                        I talked to Boyd, the description 
                        the kid gave is fuckin’ worthless, 
                        but Samantha Adler’s mother is 
                        talking...

           Mathis looks back up at him, waiting for details.  

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        Her daughter was a drug addict, she  
                        hung out with a lot of shady 
                        people. 

           Mathis stares back down at the ground.  

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        But she was a stripper at the Sage 
                        Lounge, that shithole out by the 
                        Turnpike.  She danced the night she 
                        was murdered.   

           Wex nods to the scene inside the church.

                                 WEX (CONT’D) 
                        You don’t need this shit, Mathis... 
                        not today.  Why don’t you and Gray 
                        go talk to some strippers and I’ll 
                        stay here.  

           Mathis looks him in the eye, nods.  The group breaks. 

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        We’ll meet back at the station... 4 
                        o’clock.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- DAY

           Mathis’ car parked in front of The Sage Lounge.  The club is 
           tucked away, a dark cave to disappear in.   Mathis watching 
           the people who go in and out. 

                                 MATHIS
                        I gotta go to the bathroom real 
                        quick.  Meet me at the bar.  
           Mathis gets out, slams his door shut.  Gray remains inside 
           watching him through the windshield.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE SAGE LOUNGE - BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis doing bumps of cocaine, breathing, getting himself on 
           track.  The music is loud through the walls, shakes the room.    

           INT. THE SAGE LOUNGE -- MOMENTS LATER 

           Mathis walks out of the bathroom into MUSIC - to NUDE GIRLS 
           dancing on stages.  Mathis doesn’t move, his eyes move from 
           girl to girl, he stares their bodies up and down.  

           Mathis looks to the bar, Gray already watching him.  Mathis 
           caught wiping his nose.  Gray sees his face, his eyes, 
           there’s no hiding it anymore.  

           Mathis walks over.

                                 GRAY
                        Manager’s over there.

           Gray nods across the room to LANCE, late forties, he’s eating 
           lunch in a booth, a STRIPPER beside him.

           INT. THE SAGE LOUNGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis and Gray come across the room, stand over Lance’s 
           table.  Lance slithers, he’s from the underworld, he works in 
           sex and money.  He knows they’re cops, he knows why they’re 
           here.

                                 LANCE
                        What can I do for you?

                                 MATHIS
                        Jersey City Homicide.  

                                 LANCE
                        Who’s dead?

           Mathis looks at the Stripper, he nods at her to get lost.  

           The Stripper gets up and goes.  Mathis sits down next to 
           Lance.  Gray remains standing. 

                                 MATHIS
                        I want to talk to you about 
                        Samantha Adler. 
                                 LANCE
                        Is she dead?

                                 MATHIS
                        Yeah, she is.  It happened two 
                        nights ago after she left here.

                                 LANCE
                        I don’t know anything about it...

                                 MATHIS
                        Who here might?  

                                 LANCE
                        Don’t know.  I don’t want to get 
                        involved...

           Lance goes to get up, leaving.  Mathis reaches under the 
           table and GRABS Lance’s balls, squeezing them hard.  Lance's 
           face clenched in pain.

           Gray is watching Mathis work.  Lance nodding, sweating now as 
           Mathis lets go.

                                 MATHIS
                        Speak.  

                                 LANCE
                        What do you want me to say?  She 
                        was just another girl, man.  They 
                        show up... who knows where they 
                        come from, and they leave, who 
                        knows where they go.  They fuckin’ 
                        dance, they fuckin’ get paid...

           Mathis grabs Lance’s balls again, now RIPPING them off.  
           Lance sings:

                                 LANCE (CONT’D)
                        Stacy... talk to Stacy, that was 
                        her friend.  

           Lance nods to the stage: STACY, 21, is dancing naked for a 
           room of hungry wolves.  Mathis gets up from the table and 
           stands next to Gray, the Detectives both watching her, the 
           way her body moves under the lights.  

           Mathis says over the music:

                                 MATHIS
                        You should know one thing about 
                        this city, Detective... if you 
                        don’t know it already... everyone 
                        is lying to you.  You do what you 
                        have to for what you need. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE SAGE LOUNGE - BACK ALLY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Stacy’s in a little outfit under a big winter coat.  She’s 
           taking a break, smoking a cigarette.   

           Mathis and Gray walk out, flash their badges.

                                 MATHIS
                        We need to talk to you about 
                        Samantha Adler.  

           Stacy drags off her cigarette, strong eye contact from a lost 
           girl.  

                                 STACY
                        Whatta’ you want to know?

           Gray notices her face, loneliness as bravado, experience that 
           drowned youth a long time ago. 

                                 MATHIS
                        It happened after she left here two 
                        nights ago.  Were you working?  

                                 STACY
                        Yeah.

           A beat on Stacy’s face, her expression, there’s something 
           more to the story and she’s hiding it. 

                                 STACY (CONT’D)
                        What’d Lance say?

                                 MATHIS
                        It doesn’t matter what he said...  
                        your friend’s fuckin’ dead, do the 
                        right thing.

           Mathis is stern, Gray jumps in, quickly, nicely, looking for 
           the quick way to answers.

                                 GRAY
                        It doesn’t matter what Lance said.
                        What can you tell us?  What 
                        happened the other night?
                             (reminding her)
                        Anything you say we didn’t hear 
                        from you.   

           Moments on Stacy, she nods, starts talking to the Detectives.

                                 STACY
                        Lance... we dance for him... and... 
                        he gets us work.  
                                 MATHIS
                        And he gets you work?  What kind of 
                        work does he get you?

           Stacy hesitates again, she lights another cigarette. 

                                 GRAY
                        It’s fine... take your time... just 
                        tell us what happened.  

                                 STACY
                        We do calls for Lance.  He sets 
                        them up.  We go.  Or if someone 
                        comes in and they want to go 
                        further, we’ll meet them at a 
                        motel.  They pay Lance, then Lance 
                        pays us.  Lance is the middle.      
                             (then)
                        Samantha left with someone that 
                        night.  Lance set it up.  

           Mathis nods, believes her.  

                                 MATHIS 
                        Okay, let’s go back inside.  

           Mathis and Stacy go back inside, Gray follows but Mathis 
           stops him.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Just wait here... I’m comin’ right 
                        back out.  Two seconds.  

           Gray waits.  As the door closes his cell phone rings, he sees 
           the number and quickly picks up.

                                 GRAY
                        Hey, I’m gonna have to go in a 
                        second...

                                 DAVID ROSS (O.S.)
                        How’s he doin’?

                                 GRAY
                        Not good.  
                             (then)
                        Listen... Doug Walsh’s wife called 
                        me last night, I met her and she 
                        gave me a piece of paper that said 
                        Brook Falls in Walsh’s handwriting.   
                        What’s that mean to you?  

                                 DAVID ROSS (O.S.)
                        Means nothin’.  What’d she say?
                                 GRAY
                        She didn’t know what it meant 
                        either.  She said maybe it means 
                        nothin’.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (O.S.)
                        What’s Mathis say?

                                 GRAY
                        I didn’t tell him yet...

           Gray’s STARTLED when:  

           The door BURSTS open and Lance is tossed out head first.  
           Mathis steps out after him - the wrath of God.    

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go... I gotta go...  

           Gray hangs up.  Walking over to them...

                                 MATHIS
                        Who the fuck did she leave with... 
                        who?

           Lance turns back to punch Mathis.  Mathis smiles.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hit me so I can beat you.  
                             (waiting)
                        Hit me so I can beat you... 

           Gray watching.  Lance is scared, nothing between him and 
           Mathis.  Mathis stops himself, calms down.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Tell us what happened, give us what 
                        we need... and we go.  

           Lance nods.   

                                 LANCE
                        She left with this dude.  White 
                        dude, he was stoic, kinda creepy, 
                        about my age.  I’d never seen him 
                        before.  He specifically asked for 
                        Samantha.  I tried to sell him 
                        another girl, but it had to be 
                        Samantha. 

                                 GRAY
                        Why did it have to be her?

           Mathis knows, he looks away guilty.  
                                 LANCE
                        I don’t know.  He didn’t say.  He 
                        just wanted her and that’s it.  

           A beat on Lance, he nods toward the Detectives, he wants 
           reassurance.    

                                 LANCE (CONT’D)
                        You gonna be cool with me, I’ll be 
                        cool with you?  

           Mathis and Gray nod.   

                                 LANCE (CONT’D)
                        I can get you his name.  

           Mathis gets back in his face.  

                                 MATHIS
                        How?  

                                 LANCE
                        The one thing unusual with this 
                        guy... he didn’t pay in cash.  He 
                        paid with credit card.  I only work 
                        in cash, but he insisted on the 
                        card.  And I don’t turn down money.    
                             (off their looks)
                        He bought a bottle of water and I 
                        charged him two hundred dollars for 
                        it.  I can get his name out of the 
                        receipts.     

           INT. LANCE’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lance obediently digging through receipts.  Mathis and Gray 
           staring down at him waiting.   

                                 LANCE
                        Here it is...   
                             (reading the receipt)
                        His name was Mathis.  Tom Mathis.  

           Mathis rips the receipt from his hand.  Sees the imprint of 
           the card, the signature: Tom Mathis.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Detectives walking back to the car, Gray is on his cell 
           phone reading the credit card info.
                                 GRAY

                        No, I’m not kidding.  Tom Mathis.  
                        We need every transaction and an 
                        address... 

           Gray hangs up.  The Detectives walking back to the car. 

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis starts the car, a moment before he pulls away, he runs 
           his face in his hands.  

                                 GRAY
                        You okay?

           Mathis looks up, far from okay.  

                                 MATHIS
                        My daughter... she’s scared, I know 
                        it.  She’s somewhere right now and 
                        she’s scared... and I remember when 
                        she was born and there’s nothing I 
                        can do.  

           Mathis shaking his head, seconds from a tear.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I was already bad... then after 
                        Doug I just went fuckin’ crazy.  
                        Everything got worse.  That was 
                        when my wife left.  
                             (then)
                        She said if I could stay clean she 
                        wanted me to be a part of our 
                        daughter's life.  She invited me to 
                        her fifth birthday party.

                                 GRAY
                        And what happened?

                                 MATHIS
                        I couldn’t stay clean.  I didn’t 
                        go.  And she's invited me to every 
                        birthday party since.  She's gonna 
                        be thirteen this year and all I 
                        know about her is that she's 
                        somewhere right now wondering if 
                        she's gonna die.

           Gray watching him.  
                                 GRAY
                        We’re gonna get her, Mathis.  We’re 
                        gonna get her back.  

           Mathis’s face carries his sins.  

                                 MATHIS
                        The truth is, I don’t know if I’d 
                        even recognize her.  
                             (he looks to Gray)
                        What’s that say about me?  

           Gray looking at Mathis - a sad and aging man, seconds from 
           self-destruction.  

                                 GRAY
                        It says you’ve had a rough road.  

           Gray’s hand comes out of his pocket, the piece of paper from 
           Kelly Walsh - he debates telling Mathis.  

           Gray’s phone rings.   

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Gray... 

           Wex’s voice coming in from the other end.   

                                 WEX (O.S.)
                        We got an address... 841 Washington

           The dregs of this city surrounding an OLD TENEMENT BUILDING.  

           Mathis and Gray pull up, get out of the car.  Wex is already 
           there, he steps right into their stride - pulling out their 
           GUNS walking into the building.   

           INT. 841 WASHINGTON STREET - HALLWAY -- DAY

           The Detectives walking old creaky floors, the lights that 
           work are pale yellow and dim.  Mathis leads,  their guns 
           drawn.

                                 GRAY
                        It's 406.

           They stop at Apartment 406.  A thick ENVELOPE nailed to the 
           door.  Mathis POUNDS on the door.
                                 MATHIS
                        POLICE... OPEN UP!

           He KNOCKS again, Mathis ready to storm the place.  The 
           Detectives looking at the envelope. 

                                 WEX
                        I’m gonna open it up...

           Wex puts on latex gloves, he carefully picks up the envelope, 
           trying to only touch edges.  He opens it. 

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        Oh, fuck...

           Mathis and Gray wait as Wex pulls out a POLICE BADGE.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Doug’s badge.  

           Mathis touches it - a piece of his dead friend.

           INT. 841 WASHINGTON STREET - APT 406 -- DAY

           SERIES OF SHOTS: Mathis kicks in the door.  The Detectives 
           pour in.  Spread out.  Clearing empty rooms.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Nobody touch anything.  

           The cell phone Mr. Winter gave Mathis begins vibrating in his 
           pocket.  Mathis freezes.   Gray and Wex look to the noise.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I gotta take this...  

           INT. 841 WASHINGTON ST. - HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis walking into the hall, he picks up.  His voice a 
           whisper, keeping this from his partners.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Hello...

                                 MR. WINTER
                        She’s scared, Tom.  It’s not 
                        pretty.      

           Mathis is devastated.   

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        It’s hard isn’t it.  Being the 
                        father of a girl who’s out there 
                        somewhere... alone... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        not knowing if she’s being taken 
                        advantage of...  

           Mathis closes his eyes and hangs his head, he doesn’t see 
           that Gray has walked out into the hallway behind him.  

           Gray watches Mathis on the phone, suspicious of the hushed 
           tone, he’s eavesdropping now, he hears:

                                 MATHIS
                        Whatta’ you want me to do?  You 
                        want me to quit, you want me to 
                        confess my fuckin’ sins, my fuckin’ 
                        demons, you want me to tell the 
                        whole world... I will.  Let her go 
                        and I will...  

           In an instant - Gray’s heart is beating fast - he realizes 
           Mathis is talking to the killer.  

                                 MR. WINTER
                        I want you to go in the kitchen.  
                        In the drawer to the left of the 
                        sink.  Inside there’s a tape.    
                             (then)
                        I was there, I saw what happened on 
                        the roof that day with Winston 
                        Shell.  The proof is there.  

           Mathis is silent.  Not believing this.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking at her.  She has your 
                        eyes.  

           Mr. Winter hangs up.  Mathis turns around, Gray frozen, 
           caught listening.

                                 MATHIS
                        What’re you doin’?

                                 GRAY
                        Waitin’ for you to get off the 
                        phone... 

           A moment between them, both unsure now of what the other 
           knows.  

           Mathis stuffs the phone in his jacket, he’s walking back down 
           the hallway into the apartment. 

           INT. 841 WASHINGTON STREET - KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis walks in fast, staying ahead of his partners.  
           Mathis opens the drawer left of the sink.  Inside the drawer 
           is messy, a black MINI-DV tape is labeled: Mathis.  

           Mathis snatches it out as Wex comes up behind him: 

                                 WEX
                        What’s wrong?

           Gray stays behind, he hangs back just outside the kitchen, 
           listening to Mathis and Wex whisper. 

           Mathis looking out for Gray:

                                 MATHIS
                        There’s a tape.  He’s got a tape.

           Wex confused. 

                                 WEX
                        Who?  A tape of what?

                                 MATHIS
                        The roof.  He’s got a tape from up 
                        on the roof.  Mr. Winter.   

           Wex’s face sinks, he’s silent, nervous.  Gray is listening to 
           gold.    

                                 WEX
                        How do you know?

           A beat on Mathis, he pats Wex’s shoulder, false reassurance.  

                                 MATHIS
                        It’s bullshit... he’s just fuckin’ 
                        with me.  

                                 WEX
                        Who’s just fuckin’ with you?  Did 
                        he call you?

           Gray walks back in, looking at two faces in trouble.  

           Gray looks into the open drawer.  Mathis quickly shuts it.  
           But Gray QUICKLY opens it back up.  First this would seem a 
           challenge to Mathis, but then Gray reaches in and pulls out 
           PICTURES:  

           They are the pictures of his car, the ones in the auto-
           trader, the ones Richard from church took. 

           Gray is swaying, slow steps backward, Mathis and Wex now 
           concerned.   

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        You okay?
           Mathis sees the pictures.

                                 MATHIS
                        Is that your car?

           A state of shock sinking into Gray, he mumbles as he puts it 
           together.

                                 GRAY
                        ...right now... at church... at a 
                        chicken dinner set up... he’s with 
                        my wife and daughter, he goes to my 
                        church.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- DAY

           Speeding FAST through the city - Mathis is driving.  Gray on 
           the verge of tears, his whole life on the tight rope.   

           Mathis looks to Gray.   

                                 MATHIS
                        Just... hang in there.  We'll be 
                        there in a second.  They're gonna 
                        be fine.

           INT. GRAY'S CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           The chicken dinner set-up.  The CHURCH PEOPLE setting up 
           tables, chairs.   

           Richard is watching Jill and Lily across the room.  His 
           expression unreadable.

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Speeding.  Time is still for Gray, on the ledge of madness, 
           tears welling.

           Mathis looks back to Wex in the rearview, their eyes 
           acknowledge bad possibilities.

           Gray pulls out his gun.   

                                 MATHIS
                        Easy.  

           INT. GRAY'S CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Jill about to lift a stack of plates.  Lily at her side.
                                 RICHARD
                        Can I help you with those, Jill?

                                 JILL
                        Sure you can, thank you.

                                 LILY
                        Can I help, Richard?

           He smiles.

                                 RICHARD
                        Sure you can.

           He hands Lily two plates. 

           EXT. CHURCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Speeding up to the church, screeching to a stop at the front 
           door.  The Detectives get out, running inside, weapons drawn.

           INT. CHURCH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gray EXPLODES into the room, YELLING, his GUN is to the 
           ground but people see it and they SCATTER, scared.  

                                 GRAY
                        JILL!  LILY!  WHERE ARE THEY!

           Mathis and Wex come into the chaos.  Guns drawn.  Jill sees 
           her husband looking for her.

                                 JILL
                        Dan...  DAN!

           Gray sees Jill, sees Lily, he pauses.  They're safe.

                                 MATHIS
                        Gray, where is he... WHERE IS HE???

           Gray turns, sees RICHARD, points.

                                 GRAY
                        THERE!  GREEN SHIRT!  

           Mathis and Gray RUSH at Richard and TACKLE HIM.

                                 MATHIS
                             (gripping Richard's neck)
                        Where's she, where's my fuckin' 
                        daughter?

           Wex shows his BADGE to the crowd.
                                 WEX
                        Police... it's okay, it’s okay, 
                        everyone’s safe.

           Gray walks over to his wife and daughter, catching his 
           breath.  Jill’s pissed, embarrassed. 

                                 JILL
                        What on earth are you doing right 
                        now?

           Gray picks up Lily, hugs Jill.

                                 GRAY 
                        He's a... he's a murderer.

                                 JILL
                             (irritated) 
                        Richard?  

           Gray calms Lily, she's crying, scared.

                                 GRAY 
                        It's okay, sweetheart.  It's okay.

           Mathis and Wex leading Richard out to the car, he’s cuffed, 
           bleeding now from the face.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go.  I'll explain later.

                                 JILL
                        Oh, I know you will.  

           Gray realizes EVERYONE is staring at them, he’s looking at 
           Jill’s face, suddenly having second thoughts on Richard.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

           Richard exhausted, beaten.  Gray doesn’t look much different.

                                 RICHARD
                        I've never been to that address.  
                        My car was broken into two days 
                        ago.  The pictures were stolen.   

                                 GRAY
                        Did you file a police report?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes.  I don't know what else I can 
                        say.  I was working at a shoe store 
                        in Albuquerque ten years ago.  
           Gray believes him, he walks out of the room.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - ADJACENT ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray walks in, he’s given up.  Captain Boyd stands next to 
           Mathis, both looking closely at Richard sitting alone.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        This guy’s a squirrel, he’s not the 
                        killer, keep him till everything 
                        checks out. 

           Boyd goes to walk out as Wex comes in, breaking news: 

                                 WEX
                        Two more bodies... a penthouse on 
                        the river. 

           Mathis waiting in suspense.  

                                 WEX (CONT’D)
                        A husband and wife.  Higher profile 
                        this time.  She’s the newscaster 
                        from Channel 11 and he’s a TV 
                        producer. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Which shows did he produce?

                                 WEX
                             (reads from the report)
                        Reality shows.  “Stealing 
                        Husbands”, ”The Fattest Loser” and 
                        “Finding Mommy and Daddy.”   

                                 MATHIS
                        What’d he do to ‘em?

           A beat on Wex - hesitant to say these things in front of 
           Mathis now:  

                                 WEX
                        He shaved off her hair... then he 
                        cut her tongue out of her mouth, 
                        they found it in the garbage 
                        disposal... 
                             (then)
                        While she bled to death, the 
                        husband was forced to video tape it 
                        all... some real reality I guess.

                                 MATHIS
                        What’d he do to the husband?
                                 WEX
                        He let the husband live.  The 
                        husband called 911 then jumped off 
                        the balcony.  The tape’s on its way 
                        here... so I guess we’ll see why.  

                                 MATHIS
                        It's all on tape?

                                 WEX
                        All on tape.  

                                 GRAY
                        Maybe he likes to tape things. 

           Looking at Mathis, Mathis looks down.   

                                 WEX 
                        It’ll be here in twenty minutes.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BATHROOM STALL -- LATER

           Mathis putting coke up his nose, it’s sloppy, he’s strung 
           out.  As he puts the vile back in his pocket, he pulls out 
           the TAPE from the apartment, his name written across the 
           label.    

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - ROOF -- LATER

           Gray and Mathis standing on the roof, waiting out twenty 
           minutes.  They’re drinking coffee, looking across the Hudson 
           River.  The New York City skyline being hit by the orange 
           glow of the sunset.    

           Gray is rattled, his family almost taken from him, Mathis has 
           a restless leg.   

                                 GRAY
                        How long you been sober?

           Mathis looks at him.  Glassy, beading eyes.  A beat. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Six months.  

                                 GRAY
                        Congratulations.

           Mathis chewing words, still staring at the sky.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Why do people say you’re a racist 
                        cop?  I don’t see it.  
                                 MATHIS
                        Because sometimes people need to be 
                        physically persuaded to tell the 
                        truth.  Like today.  Some of the 
                        people I’ve physically persuaded 
                        have been black.  Not all of them, 
                        just the ones Internal Affairs pays 
                        attention to... and on top of all 
                        that shit... Winston Shell up on 
                        the roof... he was black.    

           Moments on Mathis, the racist tag eats him.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I'm from Buffalo, NY.  I moved to 
                        New York City because I was twenty-
                        two years old and in love.  She was 
                        goin’ to college at NYU.  Her 
                        father hated me, hated my fuckin’ 
                        guts.
                             (then)
                        Wanna know why he didn't approve of 
                        me with his daughter?

                                 GRAY
                        Why?

                                 MATHIS
                        She was black.  I was white.  
                             (then)
                        And she listened to him.  She broke 
                        it off. 
                             (then)
                        So as far as Winston Shell and what 
                        happened on that roof.  I have a 
                        lot of sins...
                             (he points)
                        I have sins from here all the way 
                        over there to that streetlight.
                        But I’m not a racist, and I’d never 
                        murder someone.  I’d never throw 
                        someone off a roof.

           Moments passing on Gray, Mathis’ words are convincing.  

                                 GRAY
                        What’d you take out of that drawer 
                        today?    

           Mathis looks at him, then starts walking back inside.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Nothin’...
           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DUSK

           The room is dark.  The windows blacked out.  The Detectives 
           sit in front of a flat screen TV hung on the wall.  

           Wex pulls out a MINI-DV tape from the evidence bag.  Mathis 
           staring at the tape, the same exact kind in his pocket, it 
           makes him uncomfortable, unsure what he’s about to see.       

           The video starts, on Screen: The WIFE, early forties, is 
           crying, scared, pleading for her life through the DUCT TAPE 
           over her mouth.  

           Then a buzzing off screen, a pair of HAIR CLIPPERS come into 
           frame and move toward the Woman’s hair.  Through the tape she 
           screams.

           On Gray, the sounds of screaming and of hair being shaved 
           takes us into instant SILENCE: 

           Reactions - Gray flinches, the images suddenly becoming 
           unbearable.  Gray looking for a way out, the room closing in.      

           Mathis and Wex are stone, unable to blink, finally forced to 
           look away.    

           Gray covers his ears, he can’t stand it, suddenly shaking his 
           head, he’s breaking, his stomach turning, he gets up and 
           leaves.  Moments pass until Wex has to walk out too.  

           Mathis is left alone, the screen casting light onto his face.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Dark now.  Gray walking away from the precinct.  On his cell 
           phone.  Upset.  

                                 GRAY
                        Be there in twenty-minutes... leave 
                        now.  Because I want to talk to 
                        you...  

           Gray hangs up.  Walking to his car.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. L ST. DINER -- 20 MINUTES LATER

           Gray’s car pulling behind the diner, David Ross already 
           parked and waiting, his lights off, engine running.  

           Gray parks his car, gets out and gets into David's. 
           INT. DAVID ROSS' CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           David is patient, lets Gray speak.

                                 GRAY
                        I'm done.  I quit.  I can't take 
                        anymore of this shit... you hear 
                        me.  I can’t do it.   

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Look... listen... this isn’t gonna 
                        last much longer...

           Gray interrupts: 

                                 GRAY
                        Then you come do it... put your 
                        fuckin’ family at risk.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Hey, you knew what you could be 
                        getting into.  I warned you.  
                        Mathis warned you. 

                                 GRAY
                        If something happens to my wife or 
                        my daughter I'm gonna hold you 
                        directly responsible.  I want 
                        someone trailing them at all times.  
                        I want someone at my daughter's 
                        school, if my wife goes to the 
                        store I want someone following 
                        her... I want fuckin’ helicopters 
                        hovering over her... I’m not ending 
                        up like Mathis. 

           Moments pass, both sitting in silence - David repeats 
           himself:

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        This isn’t going to last much 
                        longer...
                             (off Gray’s look)
                        I’m going to meet the witness, 
                        we’re gonna sit down.

           Gray is happy, this is great news.  

                                 GRAY
                        She’s gonna talk?

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        We’re gonna sit down.  Off the 
                        record.  But it’s good.  It’s 
                        movement in the right direction.  

           David is hesitant, there’s more.  
                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to tell you... 
                        because I didn’t want you to act 
                        any different around him.  

                                 GRAY
                        Who?

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Look, the woman who came forward...  
                        she’s not real.  I made her up.  
                        The witness is someone else... 

           Gray is confused.  A beat on David.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        John Ellis is gonna testify against 
                        Mathis.  He says Mathis confessed 
                        the killing one night when he was 
                        drunk.  

           Gray remains still, it leaves him thinking.  

                                 GRAY
                        When’re you meeting him?

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I’m meeting him tomorrow night at 
                        his apartment.   

           Gray thinking about this, it doesn’t sit right.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        It’s good news.  It means I can 
                        pull you the fuck out of this 
                        nightmare really soon.  

           Gray thinking, then shaking his head, this is all too much 
           for him, his face falls into his hands.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 GRAY
                        Mr. Winter and Mathis are in touch.
                        Mathis has an extra cell phone he’s 
                        been carrying with him, it rang 
                        today.  
                             (then)
                        And I think there’s a tape.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        What kind of tape?
                                 GRAY
                        I think Mr. Winter’s got a tape 
                        from up on the roof with Winston 
                        Shell.  

           David smiles.  Jackpot.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Get the fuck out of here...

                                 GRAY
                        That’s what it sounds like...

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Who’s got it?

                                 GRAY
                        I think Mathis has it.  I think it 
                        was left in a drawer for him to 
                        find.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        We need the tape.  You gotta get 
                        that tape.

           David gets Gray’s eye, makes it clear.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You want this to end immediately?  
                        You gotta get that tape before it 
                        ends up in the Hudson River.  

           Gray seeing the fast ticket out of this.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You get that tape and we don’t need 
                        to wait on anybody.  Mathis goes 
                        down for murder... 

           Gray thinking hard, a feeling in his gut he has to share.  

                                 GRAY
                        There’s this part of me that 
                        doesn’t think he threw that kid off 
                        the roof.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        He did it... are you kidding?

           FLASHES OF:

           ROOFTOP FLASHBACK - David’s version: Winston Shell and Mathis 
           are WRESTLING, Winston knocks the gun from Mathis’ hand, the 
           gun FIRES as it hits the ground.  
                                 DAVID ROSS  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        I know he did, I see it in his 
                        face.  

           Mathis PICKS UP Winston Shell by the collar, he DRAGS him to 
           the edge and THROWS him off the roof in a fast moment of 
           rage.  

           David turns to Gray. 

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna bring down Mathis and 
                        Mr. Winter all at once.  And people 
                        are gonna talk about you forever.

                        Dan Gray.  Legend.  

           Gray doesn’t care, it doesn’t feel good anymore.  

                                 GRAY
                        I want to go home to my family now.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Get that tape and you will.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- NIGHT

           Mathis is at his desk, running on fumes, the tape in his 
           hands.  Behind him the large map of Jersey City looms - now 
           four red tacks marking each victims location.    

           Gray comes up to Mathis’ desk, Gray immediately sees the 
           tape, a beat as he and Mathis look at one another.  Gray asks 
           casually as Mathis places it back in his pocket.      

                                 GRAY
                        What’s on the tape?

           Mathis shrugs it off. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Some bullshit from an old case.

                                 GRAY
                        I’m gonna go.  I’m gonna call it a 
                        day.  I told my wife I was comin’ 
                        right home.  

           A buzz in Mathis’ jacket pocket, Mr. Winter’s cell phone 
           vibrating, Gray and Mathis both looking at it, then at each 
           other.   

                                 MATHIS
                        I’ll see you tomorrow.  
           Gray nods, walks away, he looks back at Mathis who’s turning 
           his back to the room, answering the phone.

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello.

                                 MR. WINTER
                        That couple was poison.   

           Mathis is still, looking around the room, Gray is gone, no 
           one notices he’s on the phone.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Every night I watched her fake 
                        face, and her fake body parts... 
                        spreading fake news.  And I watched 
                        the cancer he sold as reality.  
                             (then)
                        They both begged me not to.  Their 
                        parties and their money couldn’t 
                        save them.  Not from me. 

           Mathis listening, shaking his head.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Are you wondering if that tape’s 
                        the only copy? 

           Mathis silent.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen it yet?

                                 MATHIS
                        No.

           Mathis pulls the tape from his pocket, looking at it. 

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been sitting here wondering 
                        how it’d be possible for you to 
                        know we’d be up there that day?

                                 MR. WINTER
                        Money.  People tell you anything 
                        for the right price.  Greed is more 
                        powerful than loyalty.  It’s a 
                        reflection of our society. 
                             (explaining)
                        I paid off the people Winston Shell 
                        trusted.  That’s how I knew he was 
                        hiding out in that factory.  
                             (then)
                        There was an anonymous call that 
                        came in that morning... telling you 
                        he was up there.  Remember? 
           Mathis closing his eyes, realizing the setup. 

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        I set up a camera from another 
                        roof.  I expected things to get 
                        rough, but... I could’ve never 
                        imagined what I saw that day.  

           Mathis closes his eyes, shaking his head.  

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        There's a verse in the Bible... one 
                        that makes me think of you right 
                        now.
                             (then)
                        "He that covereth his sins shall 
                        not prosper... but he who 
                        confesseth and foresaketh them 
                        shall have mercy."

                                 MATHIS
                        You gotta fuckin’ tell me!  Do you 
                        want me to turn the tape in?  

                                 MR. WINTER
                        I want you to chase me like a fool.
                             (then)
                        I’m always with you.  Sometimes 
                        we’re feet apart.  Sometimes I 
                        watch from far away.  Your 
                        painfully mundane life.  Sitting in 
                        your car alone.  Doing your laundry 
                        alone.  Sitting in that small 
                        shitty apartment alone.  Thinking 
                        about the family you lost.  
                        Thinking about the partner that I 
                        killed.

           Mathis is taunted, breathing hard, seething... 

                                 MR. WINTER (CONT’D)
                        I see you buy fake piss... I see 
                        you buy drugs... and sex... 

                                 MATHIS
                        FUCK YOU!

           Mathis SLAMS his fist to his desk.  Everyone in the precinct 
           turns to him, he looks back at them, waves them off, 
           everything’s fine.  He lowers his voice again into the phone:

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        I want my daughter.  

                                 MR. WINTER
                        Then come and get her...
           Then in an instant, MATHIS’ DAUGHTER is put on the phone. 

                                 EMILY MATHIS (O.S.)
                        Hello...

           She’s scared, Mathis has jumped to his feet.

                                 MATHIS
                        Emily?  Is that you?  Are you okay?

                                 EMILY MATHIS (O.S.)
                        I wanna go home.  Who is this? 

                                 MATHIS
                        This... this is your father... I’m 
                        gonna get you...

           Mr. Winter abruptly comes back on the line:

                                 MR. WINTER
                        I’m gonna kill your daughter.

           Click.  Dial tone.  Mathis left alone in hell.

           Jill sitting at the table.

                        Is Richard okay?

                                 GRAY

                                 JILL
                        Did he do something wrong?

                                 GRAY
                        No.

                        You scared everyone at church.  You 
                        scared me.  You scared your 
                        daughter.
                                 GRAY
                        I'm sorry.  

                                 JILL
                        That’s not good enough.  You 
                        embarrassed me.  

                                 GRAY
                        I thought you and Lily were in 
                        danger.

                                 JILL
                        I saw the news.   Are they gonna 
                        find his daughter?

                        That poor man.  

           Gray nodding, he looks out his window.  

                                 JILL (CONT’D)
                        I want you to get off this case. 
                        I want you to ask yourself if your 
                        daughter’s next.  I see this 
                        shit... I see it on the news, I saw 
                        it on your face today, I hear it in 
                        your voice right now... and I feel 
                        like my family is in danger.  I 
                        feel like my husband will slowly 
                        start to slip away if I don’t stop 
                        this.  Get off this case.  Please.  

                                 GRAY
                        I can’t. 

                                 JILL
                        Why?

           Gray shaking his head, scratching for validity.  

                                 GRAY
                        I'm just... tired.  I just want to 
                        go to bed.  I just wanna come home.   
                        But I’m gonna be late tonight.  I’m 
                        sorry.     

           Gray’s POV: he’s parked outside Homicide Special - sitting 
           low in his car across the parking lot - suddenly he’s now 
           watching Mathis walk out of the station and to his car.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I love you.  I gotta go...  
                                 JILL

                        I love you more...

           Gray hangs up.  He watches as Mathis gets to his car.  

           Ellis’ black Mercedes pulls up behind Mathis.  Ellis gets out 
           of the car.  Gray watching this close now.  Mathis and Ellis 
           begin talking, the conversation straight, unreadable.

           Mathis and Ellis in conversation.

                                 ELLIS
                        ...I gotta talk to you.  David Ross 
                        is all over me...

                                 MATHIS
                        Forget about it...

                                 ELLIS
                        Mathis, I can’t just forget about 
                        it... I get you piss, clean piss, 
                        to hide your little tickle.  
                        That’ll cost me my job, I could go 
                        to jail...

                                 MATHIS
                        For what?

                                 ELLIS
                        For assisting a dirty cop.

           Mathis looks at him, it’s a hard title to swallow.    

                                 MATHIS
                        Just bare with me, alright.  I just 
                        gotta get through what’s goin’ on 
                        right now.  David Ross is gonna go 
                        away.   

           Ellis looks down.  He’s nervous, didn’t think this would 
           happen.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask you something...
                             (off Ellis’ look)
                        Anyone ever ask who it’s for?

                                 ELLIS
                        What?
                                 MATHIS
                        The clean stuff.  Anyone ever ask?

           Ellis smiles.

                                 ELLIS
                        Mathis, we live in the shadow of 
                        New York City... where you can get 
                        anything you want... no questions 
                        asked.  

           Ellis touches Mathis’ arm, trying to get through about the 
           drugs.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you need to go easy for a 
                        second.

           shake hands.  

           Ellis gets in his car and leaves.  Mathis gets in his car,

           Gray starts his car - he waits, then pulls out - following 
           Mathis now.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- NIGHT

           On Gray, focused, drinking coffee, following Mathis’ 
           taillights through the city.  

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis driving.  Rubbing his tired eyes.  

           Mathis pulls over in front of a PAWN SHOP, before Mathis gets 
           out of the car he looks in the display window at a stack of 
           Television sets: his DAUGHTER’S FACE on the news, the word 
           MISSING below her.  Mathis is slain.    

           INT. PAWN SHOP, JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT 

           Series of shots:  Mathis showing the CLERK the mini-dv tape, 
           then buying a cheap CAMCORDER camera. 
           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT

           Driving.  Back and forth between Mathis and Gray’s cars.  

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Parked down from Mathis’ apartment, Gray is watching him walk 
           inside.  As Mathis disappears Gray gets out of his car, 
           starts walking fast toward the building.     

           EXT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           From the street Gray watches Mathis’ light turn on.  He sees 
           the fire escape outside Mathis’ window, that’s where he needs 
           to be. 

           Gray moves quickly toward the building, thinking for a way 
           up.  The tenement rooftops are all an even level up and down 
           the block.   

           Two buildings down a WOMAN walks outside, her dog on a leash.  
           Gray pulls out his badge, shows it to her.

                                 GRAY
                        Hold that door...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS' APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis pulls out the camcorder camera, he begins plugging it 
           into his TV.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

           Gray riding the elevator up, it’s not moving fast enough.  

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           On Mathis’ TV:

           ON TAPE: Amateur footage of Mathis chasing Winston Shell 
           across the factory roof.  

           The footage is steady, clear.  It’s hard for Mathis to watch.    
           INT. BUILDING -- NIGHT

           Gray running up a flight of stairs, then out onto the roof.  

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           ON TAPE: Winston Shell has stopped at the edge of the roof, 
           Mathis has stopped, his gun drawn.   

           Mathis stares down the TV hard, in shattered disbelief now at 
           what he watches.  

           EXT. MATHIS’ ROOF -- NIGHT

           Gray running across buildings, hopping a wall onto Mathis’ 
           roof - he lands light - above Mathis now.  

           Gray hurries to the fire escape and begins climbing down, 
           slowly, quietly.   

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           On Mathis frozen.  We hear from the tape: the distant sound 
           of Mathis’ gun discharge - once.  Mathis closes his eyes.   

           ON TAPE: Mathis and Wex, alone on the roof now, Winston Shell 
           is gone.  The Detectives looking down over the ledge.  

           EXT. MATHIS’ FIRE ESCAPE -- NIGHT

           Gray spying in on Mathis now, he can’t get an angle on the 
           television.  

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis rewinding the footage, watching it again. 

           ON TAPE: Winston Shell at the ledge.  

           Mathis shuts off the tape, pacing now, he’s hot, he walks 
           over to the fire escape and cracks the window open. 

           EXT. MATHIS’ FIRE ESCAPE -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray is scared to death, he’s jumped back, he’s pressed 
           against the wall tight, praying Mathis won’t look out.

           Moments passing on Gray’s face.  Slowly he returns to the 
           window, peeking in again.  POV:  He’s scanning over the 
           apartment.  The bare walls.  The mess.    
           Gray looks into the NEIGHBORS APARTMENT across the street, 
           the Young Couple is gone.  The apartment is vacant and dark.  

           Then Gray notices someone inside.  A DARK FIGURE is standing 
           at the window looking at Gray and into Mathis’ apartment.  

           The Dark Figure raises a cell phone and makes a call, 
           instantly from inside we hear buzzing, the vibration of the 
           phone Mr. Winter gave to Mathis.  

           Gray peeks in the window, sees Mathis going for the phone, 
           Gray looks back to the building, realizing he has a visual on 
           Mr. Winter.

           In an instant Gray has no choice, he POUNDS on Mathis’ 
           window.

                                 GRAY
                        MATHIS!!! 

           Gray opens Mathis’ window all the way, climbing into his 
           apartment now.

           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray gets into the kitchen, Mathis is spooked, his gun out, 
           he’s holding the phone.  

                                 GRAY
                        He’s right there.  Look, he’s 
                        rights there...

           Mathis drops the phone, moves to the window, looks out and 
           Mr. Winter is still there.  Calm.  Still.  

           Mr. Winter hangs up the phone, turns on a light in the 
           kitchen.  He’s dressed in black clothes, black gloves, a 
           black mask.  For a moment everyone’s still, just looking at 
           each other.  Then   

           Mr. Winter takes off one glove.  He licks his fingers.  All 
           five.  One at a time.  Then he presses his fingertips against 
           the glass of the window:  Leaving a perfect set of FINGER 
           PRINTS.   

           Mr. Winter pulls off his hand and quickly RUNS AWAY...

                                 MATHIS
                        Let’s go...

           Mathis and Gray run out the door. 
           EXT. MATHIS’ BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           A series of shots: Mathis and Gray running out of the 
           building.  Across the street through traffic.  

           INT. OPPOSITE APARTMENT - 4TH FL. HALLWAY -- NIGHT 

           Guns out, Mathis and Gray running down the hall.  They slow 
           down, hesitating now, trying to figure which apartment it is.  
           They see a door left open and run toward it.

           INT. OPPOSITE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis and Gray come in.  The apartment is empty now.  They 
           both look to the window: The gold glow of a streetlight 
           shines through a perfect set of FINGER PRINTS.  Gray walks to 
           the window.

                                 GRAY
                        We got him.  

                                 MATHIS (O.S.)
                        Did you call it in? 

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah.  

           Off screen the door shuts.  Locks.  Gray turns to see Mathis 
           is aiming his gun at his head.  Gray is unnerved.    

                                 MATHIS
                        Then start talkin’ motherfucker.  
                        What’re you doin’ outside my 
                        window?  

                                 GRAY
                        Look...

                                 MATHIS
                        Answer the question. 

           Gray snaps at him, yelling now:

                                 GRAY
                        What’s on that tape?  And how 
                        long’s he been talkin’ to you?  
                        What the fuck’re you withholding 
                        from this investigation and why? 
                             (re: Mathis’ gun)
                        Get that fuckin’ thing out of my 
                        face right now.     

           Mathis points his gun away.  
                                 MATHIS
                        He and I talk...

                                 GRAY
                        Oh, you guys talk?  You’re 
                        girlfriends?  

           Mathis doesn’t answer.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Did you kill Winston Shell?

                                 MATHIS
                        No.

                                 GRAY
                        Did Wex?

                                 MATHIS
                        No.

                                 GRAY
                        Then what's on that tape?

                                 MATHIS
                        Give me your word.  As a man.  On 
                        your Daughter.  Are you talkin’ to 
                        David Ross or anyone else at 
                        Internal Affairs? 

           A moment on Gray, his conscience stands him straight.

                                 GRAY
                        No. 

                                 MATHIS
                        What’d you see through the window?

                                 GRAY
                        Maybe I saw you throw Winston Shell 
                        off the roof.

                                 MATHIS
                        Tell me what you saw... 

                                 GRAY
                        I didn’t see anything.

           Mathis reading him, calming down.  

                                 MATHIS
                        What do you wanna to know, 
                        Detective?  He jumped.

                                 GRAY
                        Bullshit.
                                 MATHIS
                        You think so?

                                 GRAY
                        Put the tape on.

                                 MATHIS
                        No. 

                                 GRAY
                        Why not?

           Mathis doesn’t answer.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Why did your gun go off?

                                 MATHIS
                        I dropped it. 

                                 GRAY
                        Bullshit.  He came at you.

                                 MATHIS
                        Why does it matter?  Why the fuck 
                        does it matter to you?  When 
                        Winston Shell was on the edge of 
                        that building... he was lookin’ at 
                        two things... the ground... and at 
                        life in state prison.  He made a 
                        choice.  He chose the ground.  
                             (then)
                        And I can’t say I wouldn’t of done 
                        the same goddamn thing. 

           Gray looking at Mathis, Mathis staring down at the floor.  

           There’s a hard KNOCK at the door, they both look up, the 
           SUPER’S VOICE.

                                 SUPER’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s goin’ on in there... open 
                        the door.  

           Mathis staring at Gray, a beat, he’s thinking.  Sirens in the 
           distance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OPPOSITE APARTMENT -- LATER

           Gray talking with Forensics, he’s standing next to Captain 
           Boyd, he’s looking at Wex and Mathis out in the hall. 
           INT. OPPOSITE APARTMENT - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Wex is pressing Mathis.  

                                 WEX
                        Did you watch the tape?  I'm   
                        fuckin' scared, man.  I'm supposed 
                        to retire in a year.
                             (then)
                        Maybe we should just talk.  Cut a 
                        deal now, tell ‘em what happened.

           Mathis is a ball of nerves, looking in and out of the room, 
           his eyes catch Gray watching him, he keeps moving.   

           Boyd and Gray walk out into the hall.  

                                 BOYD
                        It’s a clean set of prints.  I 
                        guess he wants us to know who he 
                        is.  I don’t know what else to say 
                        right now.   

           There’s a suspense, the identity of their killer is close.    

                                 BOYD (CONT’D)
                        Get some sleep.  Earliest we’re 
                        gonna get a name or answer is late 
                        tomorrow afternoon...    

           Boyd walks out.  Wex is stressed, loosening his tie.  

                                 WEX
                        I’ll see you guys in the morning.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Get some sleep, Wex.  

           Wex walks away.  Mathis and Gray left alone. 

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Just give me some space.  Okay?  
                        It’s the way he wants it for now.  
                        It could be my daughter’s life.      

           Gray staring at him.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           Gray parked in his driveway, he’s still, unable to go inside, 
           sitting in the dark alone.  The longest day of his life is 
           over.  He looks at the Police car parked on his street.      

           His cell phone RINGS.
                                 GRAY

           DETECTIVE JOE O’MALLEY, 48, he’s up working late tonight.

           Gray sits up.  Listening.

                        You got somethin’?

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Maybe.  
                             (then)
                        Your guy Doug Walsh... he died on 
                        February 22, 2002...

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, that’s right...

                                 O’MALLEY
                        We had one up here, same date.  

                                 GRAY
                        A murder?

                                 O’MALLEY
                        A suicide.  
                             (then)
                        A lot of us don’t think it was a 
                        suicide.  
                             (moments pass)
                        For whatever it’s worth... just 
                        thought I’d pass that along.

           Gray quiet, thinking about this. 

                                 GRAY
                        How’d it happen?  

                                 O’MALLEY
                        He jumped off a bridge.   

           Gray thinking, he decides.  

                                 GRAY
                        I’ll be there in the morning... 
           INT. MATHIS’ APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Mathis is sitting, displayed for himself on the table: a 
           birthday party invitation, his gun and badge, a vile of 
           cocaine, the tape with his name, a stack of twenties. 

           Mathis descending into hell, looking at death, at his guts.  
           He sees his whole life in a long single stare.    

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE - LILY’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Gray putting blankets and a pillow on the floor next to his 
           Daughter’s bed.  He’s sleeping next to her tonight.  

           He slips his gun under the pillow.      

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- MORNING

           The NEWSPAPER hits the stand, pictures of the MURDERED COUPLE 
           under a headline: Winter Continues, Police Urge Vigilance. 

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- MORNING

           Gray speeding fast, passing the Brook Falls County line, 
           miles of farms and rural New Jersey out the window. 

           INT. BROOK FALLS POLICE DEPARTMENT -- LATER

           Gray at a table with O’Malley.  O’Malley showing him files of 
           JAMES “JIMMY” CONWAY, 38 years old at the time of his death.  

                                 O’MALLEY
                        He was at the bottom of the 
                        Mayflower Bridge.  Looked like a 
                        clean jump.  

           Gray looking over the pictures and file.  

                                 GRAY
                        So why do you think it wasn’t a 
                        suicide?  

                                 O’MALLEY
                        Look, I knew Jimmy since High 
                        School, not the best, but I’d see 
                        him around every once in awhile.  I 
                        knew his fiance Ashley too.  He was 
                        a good guy, real happy, he was at a 
                        good place in his life.
                             (then)
                        No way he jumped.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 O’MALLEY (CONT'D)
                        You go ask Ashley, she’ll tell you 
                        the same thing.  

           On Gray.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - ASHLEY’S TRAILER -- DAY

           Ten years later, ASHLEY, 45 years old, she’s poor, a HUSBAND 
           and TWO CHILDREN inside.  

           Her and Gray step out front. 

                                 ASHLEY
                        Man, you’re bringin’ up the dead by 
                        askin’ about Jimmy.  

                                 GRAY
                        Someone said you don’t think he 
                        committed suicide?  

                                 ASHLEY
                        He didn’t.  No way.  He was the 
                        happiest person on earth.  

                                 GRAY
                        Well, then what do you think 
                        happened?

           Moments pass on her.  Gray waits.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        I don’t know...  I have no idea.  I 
                        been waiting for one’a you guys to 
                        come and tell me ever since.  

                                 GRAY
                        Do you know if he had any contact 
                        with a Detective in Jersey City?  

           She smiles.  Shakes her head.  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Knowing Jimmy, he probably did.  

                                 GRAY
                        Why?  Why would he do something 
                        like that?

                                 ASHLEY
                        Well, he probably thought he had 
                        some break in some murder case...

           Gray’s heart starts beating faster.  Gray steps toward her, 
           eager now for more.
                                 GRAY
                        What’re you talkin’ about?  

                                 ASHLEY
                        Jimmy was obsessed with serial 
                        killers.  He’d spend ten hours a 
                        day online... in chat rooms, on 
                        websites... he followed unsolved 
                        cases all across the country.  
                        There’s a whole community of people 
                        that do it.  Some people like 
                        cooking, some people like football,  
                        some people like to follow serial 
                        killers, I guess.    
                             (then)
                        He said his goal was to help catch 
                        a killer one day...  

           Gray is thinking hard about this, looking for pieces to put 
           together.  

           She’s staring at Gray, decides she can trust him, she looks 
           back over her shoulder, making sure her Husband can’t hear.  

                                 ASHLEY (CONT’D)
                        I still have a trunk of Jimmy’s 
                        stuff in a storage unit across the 
                        way here. 

           She nods Gray to follow her.  

           EXT. TRAILER PARK - STORAGE UNITS -- MOMENTS LATER

           A row of storage units, each trailer gets one.  Ashley moving 
           boxes, digging all the way to the back, she drags out a TRUNK 
           and leaves it at Gray’s feet.    

                                 ASHLEY
                        Jimmy’s family are either dead or 
                        long gone from this town.  
                             (she nods to the trunk)
                        Anything left of Jimmy is right 
                        here.  Good luck.  

           She walks away and leaves Gray to go through it.   

           Series of shots: Gray digging through it all, top to bottom - 
           going through junk, clothes, files.    

           Finally he gets to the bottom, he finds a FOLDER laid flat, 
           he pulls it out, the folder is thick - internet articles, 
           newspaper clippings - all to do with SERIAL KILLERS.  

           Gray’s cell phone RINGS, he answers quickly:
                                 GRAY
                        Gray...

                                 WEX (O.S.)
                        We’re expecting an ID on the prints 
                        by four.  FBI’s comin’ in.  Where 
                        are you?   

           Gray looks at his watch.  

                                 GRAY
                        I’ll be there. 

           Gray looks around - he opens his winter coat, he tucks the 
           folder inside his jacket and steals it clean. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- DAY

           A series of shots:  Jersey City, morning into afternoon, the 
           sun melting itself across the blue sky.                                                                   

           Gray driving back into the city, he looks at Jimmy Conway’s 
           folder laying on his passenger seat.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis and Wex waiting.  Wex looks anxious, he’s worried, 
           barely sitting - he’s watching Mathis who remains still. 

           Gray walks back into the room, the folder under his arm.  He 
           senses the tension between them - everyone is quiet.      

                                 WEX
                        ... they should be here any second.  

           Gray’s eyes meet Mathis’, Mathis sees the folder.

                                 GRAY 
                        I’ll be at my desk.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - GRAY’S DESK -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gray sitting at his desk.  He opens the folder, begins 
           looking through it.    

           It’s thick, stacks of material - articles, copies of public 
           police reports from all over America, all over the world.  
           Gray sifting through different cases.  Faster and faster, 
           nothing grabbing his attention.   

           Then he finds it:  Brook Falls Press - an old ARTICLE, yellow 
           newspaper - a mass animal killing in Brook Falls - 1973 - 
           Gray skimming the article, across words:  

           ...twelve animals - ritualistic killings - cigarette burns - 
           mutilation - hunting knife - no suspects - it feels familiar.  
           Gray’s hooked on this.   He picks up his phone.  Dials.  

           The line ringing, Detective O’Malley answers:

                                 O’MALLEY (O.S.)
                        O’Malley...

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah, it’s Detective Gray in Jersey 
                        City... I need a favor.

                                 O’MALLEY (O.S.)
                        What’s up?

                                 GRAY
                        I need you to get me whatever you 
                        can on an old case from up there.
                             (then)
                        July 1973 - a group of animals 
                        killed on a farm... if you can get 
                        me whatever you can find...  

           Gray looks up, sees FBI AGENT WILLIAM STAFFORD, 52, walking 
           toward Boyd’s office, he nods to Mathis and Wex, introducing 
           himself, shaking hands.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go... as fast as you can...  

           INT. CAPTAIN BOYD’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Everyone’s in.  Out the window night crawls over the city, 
           William Stafford stands in front of Captain Boyd and the 
           Detectives.  He brings a file from his briefcase and drops it 
           on the desk.   

           Stafford looking at Mathis’ empty face, black rings under his 
           eyes.  

                                 STAFFORD
                        Let me first say, Detective 
                        Mathis... I’m sorry about your 
                        daughter.

           Mathis nods.  Restless.
                                 MATHIS
                        Who is he?

                                 STAFFORD
                        His name’s Walter McKinley... an ex-
                        Marine.  A decorated Gulf War 
                        veteran.  The first Gulf War.  

           Stafford pauses.  Mathis grows impatient.  

                                 MATHIS
                        And what else?

                                 STAFFORD
                        And he’s dead.  Eleven years now. 

                                 WEX
                        He died eleven years ago?  

           Bewilderment.  A fog across their faces.  Mathis hangs his 
           head, it’s only getting worse.    

           Stafford pulls out an 8x10 picture of WALTER MCKINLEY, he 
           hands it to Mathis first. 

           Walter McKinley is Caucasian, thirty-eight years old in the 
           photo, he’s muscular, a soldier, his face is conservative and 
           cold.

           Mathis shaking, staring deeply into the picture.  Finally the 
           face of his killer.  Stafford hands out two other pictures - 
           1st: McKinley with his MARINE UNIT.  2nd: McKinley alone.

                                 STAFFORD
                        This is the first he’s turned up so 
                        this is all new, we’re tryin’ to 
                        get more pictures, more 
                        information. 
                             (then)
                        But so far what we know is he ran a 
                        fishing boat.  The boat was found, 
                        abandoned, his body never found.  
                        They declared him dead two months 
                        later after pieces of his clothes 
                        washed up.  

                                 GRAY
                        So he swam to shore. 

                                 STAFFORD
                        It was in the middle of January.  
                        Two miles off the Barnegat Inlet.  
                        He didn’t swim anywhere.     
                             (then)
                        He’s a trained kill machine... he 
                        was in an elite unit... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STAFFORD (CONT'D)
                        no one would know better than him 
                        how to just disappear.   

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Well let’s get his face out to the 
                        whole fuckin’ world...

                                 STAFFORD 
                        We will.  But I think he’s done.  
                             (then)
                        I don’t know what that means for 
                        your daughter, Mathis, but I think 
                        he’s spoken.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Why? 

                                 STAFFORD
                        Look at his locations from ten 
                        years ago...  

           Stafford pulls out a aerial photo of Jersey City - dated 2002 
           - five marked DOTS for each victims location - then lines 
           drawn connecting the dots - making a CRUCIFIX, each victim is 
           a point in the cross.

                                 STAFFORD (CONT’D)
                        The first thing I noticed... he 
                        kills in the pattern of a crucifix.  

           Mathis moved by new information, the fresh look.  

           Stafford grabs a black marker, walks over to Mathis’ map of 
           Jersey City, the red tacks marking four kill locations.  

           Stafford puts the map on its side - connects the four 
           locations making four points of the cross now - the fifth 
           point, the center - is still missing.

                                 GRAY
                        So we know the next location... we 
                        got him...

           Gray getting excited, Wex going with it too, Captain Boyd and 
           Mathis see Stafford’s not as enthused.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Well... what?  Someone’s gonna have 
                        to get murdered at that location... 
                        right?

           Stafford looks down at the ground.  Mathis walks to the map - 
           sees the location.  Realizes.  

                                 WEX
                        What is it?
           Mathis looks away.   

                                 MATHIS
                        It’s the location of the factory  
                        Winston Shell went off the roof.  

           Mathis looks up, all eyes on him.  He says calmly, stern:

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        No one was murdered there.   

           Captain Boyd walks to the window, over looking the city now, 
           he can’t deny Mathis’ black eyes, half shut.    

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Mathis, I’d love to get a word with 
                        you outside... 

           Gray sees Mathis and Wex share a quick look.  Mathis gets up 
           and follows Boyd out of the office.  Wex gets up, leaving for 
           air.  

                                 WEX
                        I gotta get a cup of coffee...

           Gray and Stafford left alone, Gray thinking - he looks across 
           the pictures of Walter McKinley.  

                                 GRAY
                        Where’s Doug Walsh fit into this.  
                        His murder doesn’t fit.    

                                 STAFFORD
                        He’s the wildcard.  He breaks the 
                        pattern.   

           Gray staring at the map of Jersey City now, the center point 
           of the cross, the location of the factory. 

                                 GRAY
                        Maybe nobody was killed there...

                                 STAFFORD
                        I don’t think so... 
                             (beat)
                        I think he’s sending a direct 
                        message about Detective Mathis.
                             (then)
                        And we had a team go through the 
                        factory about an hour ago.  There 
                        was nothin’ there.  

           Out the window of Boyd’s office Gray sees a FAX coming in to 
           his desk.   

                                 GRAY
                        Excuse me...
           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - GRAY’S DESK -- MOMENTS LATER

           Gray gets to the fax machine - the reports of the animal 
           kills coming through from O’Malley in Brook Falls.  Gray 
           picking them up, reading them.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis and Boyd. 

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Tom, what happened on that roof?  
                        What’s goin’ on with you?  I can’t 
                        look past it anymore.

                                 MATHIS
                        I got the flu...

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Bullshit... what the fuck’re you 
                        on?  I’m askin’ you as a friend... 

                                 MATHIS
                        I’m fine...  

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        Tom, we gotta get you help... and 
                        you gotta be honest about what 
                        happened... 

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - GRAY’S DESK -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray continues reading the police reports - and then he 
           FREEZES - he stops as his heart begins to race.   

           Gray looks back on the Brook Falls police report.  POV: the 
           suspect is eleven year old JOHN ELLIS.  A mug shot of the 
           Jersey City Coroner, John Ellis, as an eleven year old boy - 
           Gray sees the words “will be charged as a minor.”

           Gray stands, thinking hard about this, he walks back to 
           Boyd’s office.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BOYD’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray walks back in... Stafford on his cell phone... Gray 
           grabs the three pictures of Walter McKinley - looking through 
           them, Gray stops on the group photo of Walter McKinley’s 
           Marine Unit.

           Gray looking over the faces - then he stops - the case breaks 
           open - Gray sees Ellis was in the same unit as Walter 
           McKinley, they knew each other.  
           In an instant Gray realizes David Ross is with Ellis.  He 
           pulls out his cell phone - auto dials - the line ringing.  

           INT. ELLIS’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           David Ross sitting at Ellis’ table.  A crucifix hung up on 
           the wall above him.  David waiting while Ellis pours him a 
           drink in the kitchen.  

                                 ELLIS
                        It’ll be good to finally talk to 
                        you... 

           David gets an incoming call from Gray.  He ignores the call.  

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis and Boyd still talking in the hall.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        ...I don’t know how the fuck you’re 
                        getting around IA, but it’s gotta 
                        stop...

           Gray storms out into the hall, he’s getting David's 
           voicemail, he’s PANICING, trying to do two things at once - 
           dialing David again and screaming:

                                 GRAY
                        Mathis!  

           Mathis starts following Gray instinctively, senses something 
           is very wrong.

                                 CAPTAIN BOYD
                        What’s he talkin’ about?

           Mathis going after Gray, until, the cell phone from Mr. 
           Winter begins vibrating in his pocket.  Mathis’ priorities 
           switch.  He picks up the phone.  He looks to Boyd:

                                 MATHIS
                        I gotta get this.  

           Mathis walking away.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello...

                                 MR. WINTER
                        Hello...

                                 MATHIS
                        Walter McKinley...
           Mathis trying to get further from Boyd who watches him.

                                 MR. WINTER
                        Gray knows where to come next.

           Mr. Winter hangs up.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Outside now... Gray on his cell phone, David's line ringing.   
           Over and over.   

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELLIS’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Ellis walks back into the room, he sets a glass of water in 
           front of David.  David checking a text from Gray, it reads 
           simply: 

           GET OUT!

           David looks back up at Ellis, Ellis looking at him.

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Excuse me, may I use your bathroom?

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Mathis walking through the building.  Looking for Gray now.  
           He’s desperate, at one point he yells: 

                                 MATHIS
                        GRAY!!!

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray on his cell phone, the line ringing, finally David picks 
           up:  

           INTERCUT:

           INT. ELLIS’ BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           David Ross speaking low, running water to drown out sound. 

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        What’s the problem? 
                                 GRAY
                        Where’re you?

           David Ross smiles.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I’m talkin’ to Ellis.  This guy’s 
                        fuckin’ gold...   

                                 GRAY
                        You gotta get outta there... he’s 
                        in on it...

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        What’re you talkin’ about?

                                 GRAY
                        Mr. Winter... he’s two people.  You 
                        gotta get out of there...  

           David looks beneath the bathroom door, at the light shinning 
           in underneath from the hallway.  He notices the SHADOW of 
           Ellis walk up next to the door.  

           David says loud:

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        Okay, honey, I’ll get some milk.  
                        The blue top.  

           David staring at the shadow, a sudden bad feeling grows, he 
           instinctively puts his hand on his gun.   

                                 GRAY
                        Hang up and text me the address 
                        right now.  

                                 DAVID ROSS
                        I don’t feel so good, I’m gonna 
                        come home right now, okay... 

           David hangs up on Gray.  He’s watching the shadow, he says 
           something random to test the response.  

                                 DAVID ROSS (CONT’D)
                        You got a great place here... I 
                        like it a lot.    

           The shadow walks away.  No response.    

           EXT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- CONTINUOUS

           Gray hanging up.  Standing in the cold.  He’s breathing 
           heavy, debating how to explain this now.  
           Mathis comes barging out the door, Gray looks up to see him 
           towering at the top of the stairs.  

                                 MATHIS
                        He says you know where?

           Breaking the quiet is the CHIME of an incoming text message 
           on Gray’s phone.    

           Gray pulls out his phone - reads the ADDRESS from David Ross.  
           His eyes meet Mathis’.       

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mathis and Gray speeding through the city...

                                 MATHIS
                        How long’s he been talkin’ to you?

                                 GRAY
                        He’s not talkin’ to me...

           Mathis getting angry, sensing information is being withheld 
           from him.  

           INT. ELLIS’ APARTMENT - DINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           David Ross coming back to the table... he’s looking 
           differently at Ellis now, and Ellis is looking differently at 
           him.  

           The moment is quiet, until out of the quiet we hear THE SOUND 
           OF BIRDS CHIRPING.  It startles David.  Ellis asks him:

                                 ELLIS
                        Are you okay? 

           Ellis’ eyes shift off behind David’s shoulder, something 
           behind him. 

           David notices, he turns around to look.  He SCREAMS! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mathis is driving.  Speeding through the city, horns honking 
           all around them, tires screeching off each turn.  Mathis 
           looking at Gray, wanting answers.  Gray is giving directions 
           from off his cell phone map.     
                                 MATHIS
                        What the fuck are you not telling 
                        me?  Where we going?

                        Turn left at the light...

           Mathis making the turn.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        We’re goin’ to John Ellis’...

           Mathis confused. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Winter’s two people... Ellis is  
                        one of them. 
                             (then)
                        Doug Walsh was on to it...

                                 MATHIS
                        Wha...

           Gray interrupts him.  There isn’t the time.  

                                 GRAY
                        Listen to me.  I want you to shut 
                        up.  Shut up and listen to me.  
                        There’s a lot I need to tell you 
                        fast.... 

           Mathis waiting, tense. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Doug Walsh’s wife called me and we 
                        met for coffee.

           Mathis blows up, this is an insult...  

                                 MATHIS
                        And you didn’t tell me!  My dead 
                        fuckin’ partners wife calls you 
                        and...

                                 GRAY
                        Shut up!  What’d I fuckin’ say?  
                        Listen to me!  Listen to me... 

           Mathis shuts up. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        She gave me a piece of paper of 
                        Doug’s that said Brook Falls... she 
                        found it after he died.  She didn’t 
                        know what it meant, I didn’t know 
                        what it meant either.  So I looked 
                        into it...    
           Mathis driving FASTER, he’s getting more upset.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        There was someone killed up there 
                        on the same day Walsh died.  It was 
                        ruled a suicide but no one seems to 
                        buy that.  

           Mathis looking at him now, he’s listening.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        The guy was a ten-cent serial 
                        killer enthusiast, I think he’d 
                        contacted Walsh about the 
                        similarities of a case from up 
                        there and Mr. Winter.  

                                 MATHIS
                        What was the case?  

                                 GRAY
                        A group of animals were killed... 
                        tortured and cut to pieces.  

           Mathis looking over at Gray, waiting for more.  

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        John Ellis, our coroner, was 
                        convicted, he was eleven years old, 
                        charged him as a minor.    

           Mathis shaking his head, in denial. 

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        And Ellis served in the Gulf War.  
                        In the same unit as Walter 
                        McKinley.  They know each other.  

           Mathis is dead silent now.  Now it’s real.

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        ...that’s why Walsh was killed out 
                        of context.  One clean shot to the 
                        head.  

                                 MATHIS
                        He wasn’t a sinner.  He was just in 
                        the way.   

           Mathis is sick... betrayed.  Gray reading directions from the 
           map on his cell phone.

                                 GRAY
                        Turn left at this light... then 
                        it’s four buildings down...
                                 MATHIS
                        How do you know he’s here? 

           Gray quiet.  Mathis wants an explanation.  

                                 GRAY
                        He’s there right now with David 
                        Ross.  I think David got set up.    

                                 MATHIS
                        How do you know David Ross is 
                        there?  

           Gray is suddenly unable to lie.  Mathis looks over, a bad 
           feeling now. 

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        You guys talk? 

           Gray looks at him, Mathis knows.  It takes one to know one.        

                                 GRAY
                        Right now, this is about your 
                        daughter.

                                 MATHIS
                        Is Boyd or Wex in on it? 

                                 GRAY
                        No.   
                             (then)
                        I don’t think you threw Winston 
                        Shell off the roof. 

           Mathis looks at him, pulls over to the side of the road, to 
           Ellis’ apartment. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Go fuck yourself.

           The Detectives get out, separated now, running together  
           toward the building.    

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELLIS’ BUILDING -- NIGHT

           A series of shots:  Mathis and Gray running into the 
           building, running up three flights of stairs, down a long and 
           quiet hall.  

           INT. ELLIS’ BUILDING - HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Coming up to apartment 301.  Slowly.  Guns drawn.  Mathis 
           bangs on the door: 
                                 MATHIS
                        Ellis!

           Mathis bangs the door again.  

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        ELLIS! 

           Mathis checks the door, unlocked, he opens it to see:  David 
           Ross is hanging DEAD from the ceiling fan.  A noose around 
           his neck.  

           INT. ELLIS’ APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Clearing rooms fast, Gray is having a hard time looking at 
           David hanging dead, his eyes dull and open.  

           Out of the silence Mathis hears the BIRDS begin chirping.  It 
           sends a chill down his spine.  A CELL PHONE RINGS from 
           David's pocket.  

           Mathis and Gray STARTLED.  Mathis sticks his hand into 
           David's jacket pocket.  He picks up.   

                                 MATHIS
                        Hello... 

           Gray watching, waiting.   

                                 MR. WINTER
                        Come now.  No cops.  

                                 MATHIS
                        Where?

                                 MR. WINTER
                        On the roof of the factory where 
                        Winston Shell went off.  She’s 
                        here.  If I see one cop she goes 
                        over just like he did.  

           Mr. Winter hangs up.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Speeding across town to the factory.  Gray’s got a bad 
           feeling.    

                                 GRAY
                        We should call this in... we 
                        gotta...
                                 MATHIS
                        No cops.

           EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY -- NIGHT

           Back across several vacant lots - the old abandoned factory 
           stands as a black castle of steel and cement.  

           Mathis and Gray getting out of the car, Mathis moving 
           quickly.  Gray stops, Mathis looks back:

                                 GRAY
                        I got a bad feeling about this.  
                        It’s a trap.  He’s gonna kill us. 
                             (reasoning)
                        We’re just a part of his story, 
                        Mathis.  Let’s get some back up, go 
                        in like a fuckin’ army. 

                                 MATHIS
                        Are you not listening?  No cops.  
                        My daughter’s up there.   

           Moments pass.  On Gray, thinking about his own wife and girl.  

                                 GRAY
                        I can’t go... I can’t do it.  And I 
                        don’t think you should either.  

           Mathis thinking.  He takes out his cell phone.  His wallet.  
           His badge.  A wad of cash.  He only keeps his weapon.  

           The two detectives looking at one another, moments pass, this 
           is their ending.    

                                 GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t go.

                                 MATHIS
                        No cops.  No matter what.  You owe 
                        me that much.      

           Mathis begins walking toward the factory, then he’s running,  
           disappearing into darkness, the sound of his footsteps fade 
           away.  

           A push and pull in Gray, he wants to stay and he wants to 
           follow. 

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT

           Series of shots:  Mathis running through a vacant lot toward 
           the factory, past garbage, old furniture and scattered junk, 
           his gun out, he’s ready for anything.         
           Running up to the factory, the building is dark, condemned.  
           He looks eight stories up to the roof.  No sign of anyone.  

           At the factory - Mathis stops.  Second thoughts.  

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           On Gray, still battling himself, taking deep looks toward the 
           factory, looking for any sign of Mathis.  

           INT. FACTORY - STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

           Mathis inside now.  His FLASHLIGHT works its way around the 
           room - the STAIRWELL not far - Mathis FLASHBACKS:

           INT. FACTORY -- DAY

           In the same spot:  Mathis and Wex, right after Winston Shell 
           went off the roof - they are running down the stairs - 
           running for the body outside.  

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. FACTORY -- NIGHT

           Mathis shaking off the memory, moving through darkness, 
           quietly, slowly, the building creeks and moans around him. 

           Mathis stops, he’s still, quiet, he shuts off his flashlight.  
           He’s listening now to the echo of movement, footsteps from 
           different directions, confirmation there’s other people 
           inside.    

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           Gray’s vulnerable, looking around.  He collects Mathis’ 
           things and puts them in his pockets.  

           Mathis’ cell phone begins ringing.  Gray sees Wex’s name on 
           the caller ID.  Gray doesn’t answer, hearing Mathis in his 
           head - No cops.   

           INT. FACTORY - STAIRWELL -- NIGHT

           Mathis getting to the roof, the doorway is open to the  
           outside.  Mathis waits.  The wind whistles and howls.    

           Mathis closes his eyes, he feels it, a power comes into him, 
           a man in his last possible moments of life.  
           Mathis STEPS OUT onto the roof, gun drawn.  The roof is empty 
           - until Mathis is HIT ON THE SIDE OF THE FACE.   

           THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.  SILENT. 

           FADE IN:

           EXT. ROOFTOP -- MOMENTS LATER

           Mathis’ face pressed against the roof, bleeding from the 
           mouth and face, he’s barely conscious.   

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           Gray still waiting on edge, unsure what to do.  Mathis’ cell 
           phone starts ringing again.  Again it’s Wex.  Gray letting it 
           ring out, but finally he picks up:   

                                 GRAY
                        Yeah... Wex...

           Hearing Wex through the phone, he’s very suspect:

                                 WEX (O.S.)
                        Where’s Mathis?  Why do you have 
                        his phone?  

           A beat on Gray, he’s unsure what to say.  

                                 GRAY
                        He ahh... he just went to get some 
                        air...

           Wex can’t hold the news:

                                 WEX (O.S.)
                        Well go get him cos’ I got great 
                        fuckin’ news... his daughter just 
                        walked into the station...  

           Gray looks back toward the factory, knows now Mathis has 
           walked into a trap alone.    

                                 GRAY
                        Wexler... listen to me... 

                                 WEX (O.S.)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 GRAY
                        The factory where Winston Shell 
                        went off the roof... get here... 
                        get everyone here right now.  
                        Mathis is up there alone...
           EXT. ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

           Mathis on his back, he rolls over, focus’, gets up on all 
           fours,  coming back now into consciousness.  He looks up, 
           dazed, defenseless, he sees Ellis alone, standing in front of 
           him.  

                                 ELLIS
                        What’d you expect?  Horns and a 
                        pitch fork?  

           Mathis can barely get out the words:

                                 MATHIS
                        Where is she? 

           Ellis smiles.  

                                 ELLIS
                        They’re gonna write about us...  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY, NJ -- NIGHT

           Gun out, Gray running toward the factory.  Running through 
           the same maze Mathis did. 

           EXT. FACTORY - ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

           Mathis on all fours - crawling toward his gun ten feet away.   
           Ellis isn’t worried, letting Mathis crawl.  

           EXT. JERSEY CITY -- NIGHT

           An army of POLICE CARS racing across the city for the 
           factory.

           EXT. FACTORY - ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

           Mathis crawling, he reaches his gun, he grabs it, turns to 
           Ellis, aiming for his head now.  Ellis stands calm, he’s got 
           control.   

                                 ELLIS
                        You get a culture like ours when 
                        accountability no longer pertains 
                        to everyone. 

           Mathis standing up, barely, gun aimed at Ellis.
                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        If I’m hurt, if I’m arrested, if I 
                        don’t walk out of here alone... 
                        Walter will not stop until yours 
                        and Detective Gray’s families are 
                        dead and in pieces.  We are in full 
                        control of this, Mathis... not you.  

           Mathis is trapped, realizing his gun on Ellis is pointless.  

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        What Walter and I have started will 
                        be paid attention to now.  The news 
                        channels will show our crosses and 
                        our faces and names...   we will be 
                        a mirror held to the face of a 
                        country so sick and so lost, it’ll 
                        have no choice but to see itself. 

           Ellis sees the look on Mathis’ face, he resents the 
           dismissal. 

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        We didn’t ask for this... do you 
                        know the sacrifices we’ve made?  
                        The time it’s taken?  Walter 
                        watched his own funeral.  He 
                        watched his mother cry.  Can you 
                        imagine how hard that would be?  To 
                        watch your mother cry.  But he knew 
                        his purpose was more.  When he and 
                        I met in the war we knew we were 
                        special. 

                                 MATHIS
                        You get to examine your work after.  
                        What’s it like when you’re alone 
                        with the bodies?  In the room.  You 
                        get a feeling?  The same feeling 
                        when you were a little kid in Brook 
                        Falls?

           Ellis smiles.  

                                 ELLIS
                        I sat with Walsh’s body for eight 
                        hours.  Just me and him in the 
                        quiet.  
                             (then)
                        He came to me and told me about the 
                        guy who’d contacted him.  I got a 
                        chill because I knew they’d both 
                        have to die... and that was 
                        exhilarating.  They were both dead 
                        within’ five hours.  I waited to 
                        see if anyone picked up where they 
                        left off, but no one ever did.  
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLIS (CONT'D)
                        I’m sure you would’ve known about 
                        it had you been around... and in 
                        your right mind.  

           Mathis grinding his teeth, Ellis looking at him, pushing him 
           now...

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Turn that gun to yourself, Mathis.

           Mathis staring at him, the facts of his life clear across his 
           face...

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead... turn that gun to 
                        yourself.
                             (then)
                        Because we let your daughter 
                        live... 
                             (off Mathis’ look)
                        And now she’ll never be the same, 
                        not after what she’s been through. 
                        She will always hate you after she 
                        realizes this was all over your 
                        sins.  Think what everyone will 
                        know when they see the tape from 
                        the roof.  Or when it comes out 
                        about the drugs and the 
                        prostitutes.  What will your 
                        daughter think?  The kids at school 
                        will look at her and talk... point 
                        and laugh.      

           Mathis breaking down, shaking, stripped of energy, watching 
           blood drip from his face to the ground.    

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        I kill your daughter by letting her 
                        live.  And that monkey will always 
                        be on your back.  

           Mathis SCREAMS, falls to the ground, holding his head.

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Turn that gun to yourself, Mathis. 

           Mathis holds the gun up to his head, he’s lost his mind, his 
           finger shaking on the trigger.  

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Stop yourself right here, Mathis.  
                        No more.  

           Mathis could do it.  

                                 ELLIS (CONT’D)
                        Go, Mathis... Go...
           Mathis sweating, breathing hard...

                                 GRAY (O.S.)
                        MATHIS!   NO!  

           Ellis turn to Gray, rushing out onto the roof, his gun aimed 
           at Ellis, Gray’s yelling at Mathis:

                                 MATHIS
                        Put the gun down... MATHIS!

             Ellis has his hands up, telling Gray calmly.

                                 ELLIS
                        I walk away from here Gray... 
                        explain it Mathis...  

                                 GRAY
                        Mathis, put the fuckin’ gun down!  
                        MATHIS!  She’s safe... Wex has her 
                        at the station...

                                 ELLIS
                        She’ll wake up crazy, Mathis... 
                        afraid of the dark.  

           Mathis firms up the gun to his head.  Gray moving toward 
           Mathis, gun still on Ellis.  

                                 GRAY
                        Mathis, I will fucking shoot you, 
                        drop the gun... let it go... 

                                 ELLIS
                        We’ll be together in the story, 
                        Mathis... 

           Mathis about to commit suicide, his finger restless on the 
           trigger, he’s crying, Gray screams:

                                 GRAY
                        MATHIS!   

                                 ELLIS
                        Do it...

                                 GRAY
                        NO!!!!

           Mathis PULLS THE TRIGGER - his finger finally moves, pulls 
           back - CLICK - Mathis pulls the trigger OVER AND OVER AND 
           OVER.  Empty clicks all the way around, the bullets removed.   

           Gray JUMPS ON MATHIS - in the confusion Ellis RUNS for the 
           door.  
           Gray holds Mathis down, he turns to see Ellis getting away, 
           Gray pulls out his gun, pushes Mathis behind cover and FIRES 
           at Ellis - Ellis pulls out his gun and FIRES back at Gray.   

           A GUNFIGHT, Gray and Ellis shooting at each other.  Mathis 
           lays on his back, unable to die, too broken to move.  The 
           hiss and ping of bullets back and forth around him.   

           Ellis shoots his way to the door, Gray hiding behind cover, 
           changing his clip as he watches Ellis disappearing back into 
           the factory.    

           Gray about to run into the unknown, he gets up to follow but 
           he’s GRABBED by Mathis.  Held back.  Gray turns to Mathis at 
           rock bottom, stopping him from going.

                                 MATHIS
                        She’s safe.  You got a family.  Let 
                        him go... 

           Mathis lets Gray go, too weak to hold on.  He falls to his 
           back again, he’s breathing, staring up at the stars.  Gray 
           stays.  Staring at Mathis.  Catching his breath.  

           Mathis digs in his pocket, he pulls out the TAPE from Mr. 
           Winter, he tosses it to Gray.   

                                 MATHIS (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes this job pushes people 
                        too far.  And they do things 
                        they’re ashamed of.  
                             (re: the tape)
                        Do whatever you gotta do. 
                             (then)
                        I quit.   

           On Gray, holding the tape.  Sirens coming in the distance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAY’S CAR -- NIGHT

           Gray driving home from the factory.  The tape from Mathis on 
           the passenger seat.      

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL -- NIGHT

           Mathis walking through the desks and Detectives working late.  
           He’s bleeding, black and blue.  He walks into Boyd’s office.

           INT. HOMICIDE SPECIAL - BOYD’S OFFICE -- NIGHT

           Mathis leaves his badge on Boyd’s desk.  Boyd nods, accepting 
           his resignation.  
           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

           Gray pulls out the tape and puts it into a CAMERA hooked up 
           to the TV. 

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- NIGHT

           Mathis driving home, he’s exhausted, he’s unhealthy.  Mathis 
           closes his eyes as his car bounces over the holes in the 
           road, he FLASHES BACK TO: 

           EXT. ROOFTOP -- DAY

           Winston Shell running for his life.  Mathis chasing him.  

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Intercutting between Mathis’ flashbacks and Gray’s television 
           - the truth plays out: 

           Mathis chasing Winston Shell to the edge of the roof.  
           Winston gets to the edge and gets scared.  Mathis pleads with 
           him:  Don’t jump.  The final truth shows us a surprising 
           tenderness from Mathis.    

           Winston’s scared, looking back and forth between the ground 
           and life in prison.  

           Winston gets up on the ledge, he looks back at Mathis.  
           Mathis is telling him still: Don’t jump.   

           Winston Shell JUMPS.  In an instant he is over the ledge and 
           to the ground.  

           We remain on Mathis.  Mathis remains still.  He knows Winston 
           is dead.  

           Mathis begins to breakdown.  Cry.  Crumble.  The last bit of 
           tragedy a man can take.    

           Mathis’ emotions build to him raising his gun to his head.  
           Mathis can’t take anymore of the life.  

           On Mathis.  Gun to his head.  His finger on the trigger.  
           Every moment is closer to suicide.  Then

           Wex comes running up onto the roof.  He sees Mathis.  Sees 
           what’s about to happen.  Wex runs to Mathis and TACKLES him, 
           knocks the gun from his hand, as the gun hits the roof it 
           FIRES.  

           On Wex and Mathis, Wex on top of him, keeping him from 
           himself.  
           The shots would end on: 

           INT. GRAY’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Gray watching his television, watching the truth Mathis was 
           trying to hide.  

           INT. MATHIS’ CAR -- NIGHT

           Mathis driving, slowing down, he pulls to the side of the 
           street and stops.  

           Out from the shadows his dealer Curtis walks into the street 
           light, he comes up to Mathis’ window.  

           The window goes down, Curtis looks into the car.  

           Moments on Mathis, looking down at his steering wheel, he’s 
           exhausted, his face is beaten.  He’s thinking clearly,  
           simply.  

           Mathis looks up at the street.  Moments pass.  The car begins 
           to move forward as Mathis lets his foot off the brake.      

           Mathis slowly pulls away, idling until he steps on the gas.  
           Money in his hand.   

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER -- NIGHT

           Gray at the edge of the river, lost in the Manhattan skyline 
           across the water.

           He takes the tape from his pocket and throws it into the 
           river.  

           Gray watches the ripples fade away and we CUT TO BLACK.   

           OVER BLACK:

                                 TWO YEARS LATER

           FADE IN:

           INT. BIRTHDAY PARTY -- DAY

           Mathis is sober.  Two years now.  He looks good, he lost 
           weight.   
           He’s surrounded by teenage girls, he's awkward but present, 
           finally able to attend.  He smiles as his Daughter blows out 
           her birthday candles.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JERSEY CITY DELI - SIDEWALK TABLE -- DAY

           A warm summer afternoon.  Det. Gray, thirty-seven years old 
           here, eats a sandwich, casually he answers questions for a 
           MAGAZINE WRITER.    

                                 WRITER
                        Are you afraid?  

                                 GRAY
                        Of what?

                        That they’ll return... out of the 
                        blue.

                        No...

                                 WRITER
                        Well good for you, I almost didn’t 
                        take this assignment, I don’t want 
                        anything to do with this...

                                 GRAY
                        Well then why write it?

                                 WRITER
                        Because I’m broke...
                             (then)
                        And because it’s a great article.  
                        A lot of people talk about this 
                        case... it’s popular now.  All 
                        kinds of theories about what really 
                        happened... have you been online 
                        lately?

                                 GRAY
                        What’d Mathis say? 

                                 WRITER
                        He told me to go fuck myself.  Are 
                        you two in touch?

                                 GRAY
                        Nah... he’s retired now... he’s 
                        fishin’ up-state. 
                             (then)
                        Look, I’m sorry.  I don’t talk 
                        about cases that aren’t closed.  
           The Writer nods.  A moment passes.  

                                 WRITER
                        One last quick question.  There's a 
                        case going on up in Portland right 
                        now.  A serial killer they think.  
                        A lot of people in the blogosphere 
                        think it’s John Ellis and Walter 
                        McKinley.  There’s a lot of 
                        similarities.   

                                 GRAY
                        I don’t know anything about what’s 
                        goin’ on in Portland.     

           The Writer nods.    

                                 WRITER
                        Well I appreciate the time.     

           Gray nods, goes back to his sandwich.

                                 WRITER (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and congratulations.  I heard 
                        you made Lieutenant.      

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AIRPORT -- DAY

           Mathis walking through the terminal, he looks clear and 
           focused.  

           Mathis hands his ticket to a FLIGHT ATTENDANT and enters into 
           the boarding tunnel.  He walks past a sign - FLT 810.  Non-
           Stop service to: PORTLAND.   

           Mathis disappears into the tunnel, never giving up. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           THE END.
