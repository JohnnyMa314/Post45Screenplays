           The face of WILLIAM COSGROVE, focusing hard on something.  
           He’s handsome but haggard, tired, unshaven.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        June 15, 1928 was the greatest day 
                        of my life.  I woke up next to a 
                        brunette who smelled of glove 
                        leather.  I threw eight innings 
                        against the New York Yankees, 
                        striking out six, including Gehrig 
                        and that pudgy bastard Babe Ruth.  
                        I won two hundred dollars in a back 
                        room poker game.  And I took home a 
                        blonde who tasted like whiskey and 
                        pie apples.

           Reveal that Cosgrove is standing in:

           EXT. THE COFFEE POT/ALLEYWAY

           Cosgrove wears a smart suit, shoulder holster underneath his 
           jacket, and a fedora.  Standing next to him is a LITTLE BOY, 
           a street urchin.  Together, they stare at a DEAD BODY lying 
           in the alley behind The Coffee Pot Diner.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        That was five years ago.  Now, a 
                        good day’s so rare, you could set 
                        it in silver and marry your 
                        sweetheart. If she’s still alive.

           The boy tugs at Cosgrove’s arm.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What?

           The boy nods at the body.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        What do you want me to do about it? 
                        It ain’t my job, kid.

           Cosgrove looks behind him.  A PASSER-BY watches him curiously 
           from the other side of the street.

           From down the street, a black car approaches.  This is a 
           CLEANER CAR, a modified Dodge 4-door with a cow-catcher 
           welded to the front, and “C-57” in white lettering on its 
           sides.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (waving at it)
                        Hey!  Hey, stop, we got a...

           The Cleaner Car flies past. Cosgrove watches it disappear, 
           then looks at the Boy, still staring at him.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, goddammit. Alright.

           Cosgrove pulls his Detective Special revolver and approaches 
           the body, slowly. It’s a man, face-down, wearing a yellow 
           shirt.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Well, he’s dead, for sure.

           He points the gun at the body’s head. The Passer-by watches, 
           as does the little boy.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (to boy)
                        What, you gonna watch? Turn away.

           The boy stares.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Turn away, kid, you shouldn’t see 
                        this.

           Still staring.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Suit yourself, you little shit.

           Cosgrove FIRES A BULLET into the body’s head. He re-holsters 
           his gun and looks up: the boy’s unfazed, and the Passer-by 
           walks away.

           Cosgrove dismisses the boy with a wave and walks past him. 

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you go messin’ with it.

           He turns the corner to:

           EXT. THE COFFEE POT

           Your typical 1930s corner diner, with a large glass window 
           facing the street.  
           Papered in the window are countless Government propaganda 
           posters. One in particular shows Uncle Sam pointing at the 
           head of a person in silhouette: “DISPATCH THE HEAD! THAT’S 
           PROPER DEAD!”

           Cosgrove enters the diner.

           INT. THE COFFEE POT

           Cosgrove strides to the counter. Standing behind it, tending 
           the griddle, is SAM, late-50s, owner of the place.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Sam, there’s a body in your alley.

                                 SAM
                        Who says it’s my alley?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Well, it’s there, regardless, in a 
                        cheerful yellow shirt.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll call it in.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Don’t bother. Goddamn Cleaners 
                        drove by, didn’t even stop to 
                        compliment my hat. I handled it 
                        myself.

                                 SAM
                        Proper Dead?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (faux cheerful)
                        Just like the sign says!

           In the back of the diner, a pay phone RINGS.  There’s a small 
           group of people huddled around it.  A MAN answers, then 
           addresses the group.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                        Sandy Craig?

           The group shake their heads.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN (CONT’D)
                        Sorry mac, no Sandy here today.

           He hangs up, and the group waits in silence.
                                 COSGROVE
                        What’s on the menu today, Sam?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing for you, Coz.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Come on, I ain’t picky.

                                 SAM
                        You’re not paid up.

                                 COSGROVE
                        My brother takes care of that for 
                        me.

                                 SAM
                        Usually he does. But Ross didn’t 
                        come in last night.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Spot me, then.

                                 SAM
                        Nope.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Maybe lower your prices and then we 
                        wouldn’t be at odds.

                                 SAM
                        As long as there’s rationing, these 
                        are our prices.

           Cosgrove looks down the counter, spots MAUDE, Sam’s wife, 
           watching the exchange.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Maude, tell your husband I’m good 
                        for it.

                                 MAUDE
                        Give me ten bucks and I will.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (being clever)
                        Spot me?

           Maude just disappears into the back kitchen. Cosgrove gives 
           Sam one last long look.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m hungry, Sam.
                                 SAM
                        Don’t drink that poison for dinner, 
                        and maybe lunch wouldn’t be such a 
                        problem for you.

           Cosgrove gets up, starts to say something to Sam, but can 
           only point a finger harshly. He turns and walks out, as the 
           back pay phone RINGS AGAIN.

           EXT. THE COFFEE POT

           Cosgrove storms out and turns the corner.  As he approaches a 
           parked Packard coupe, he spots the Little Boy, poking at the 
           dead body in the alleyway with a stick.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (yelling)
                        HEY!

           The boy jumps.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        What did I tell you! Come here!

           The boy reluctantly shuffles over to him. Cosgrove frowns at 
           him, bends over to look him in the eyes.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (playful)
                        Hey, what’s that in your ear?

           He makes to ‘pull a coin’ out of the boy’s ear, but he 
           mishandles it, and the coin just hits the boy’s chest and 
           falls to the ground. The boy is puzzled.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. My brother’s better at the 
                        sleight of hand stuff. I just like 
                        throwing things.

           Cosgrove picks the nickel up and hands it to the kid.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here.

           The boy runs off, and Cosgrove gets into his car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - DAY

           Cosgrove drives through the streets of downtown St. Louis.
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Name’s William Cosgrove.  My card 
                        would say I’m a detective, but I 
                        don’t carry a card anymore. You 
                        thought the Depression was bad? Try 
                        being a private dick after Black 
                        Christmas. It seems dropping a tier 
                        on the food chain is enough to keep 
                        people from paying me to snap 
                        photos of their cheating spouses.

           He turns a corner, drives past a movie theater. It’s boarded 
           up, but the letters that remain on the marquee still attempt 
           to spell out: “PAUL MUNI IS SCARFACE!”

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Consequently, something else I 
                        don’t carry on me too often is 
                        cash. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COSGROVE’S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Cosgrove pulls up to a small brick office building and parks, 
           gets out and walks in.

           INT. COSGROVE’S OFFICE HALLWAY

           Cosgrove emerges from the stairway onto the fourth floor. A 
           long hallway, dim bulbs lighting doors on either side. He 
           walks.

           Scrawled on one door, in big black letters: “EDITH - GONE TO 
           OK CITY”. Cosgrove walks right by, eventually reaching the 
           end of the hall.

           The last door bears a sign beneath a window opening long 
           since shattered and boarded over:

           “COSGROVE & COSGROVE. PRIVATE DETECTIVES FOR HIRE”

           A logo underneath: an eye and magnifying glass, with “C&C” 
           cleverly incorporated.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        My brother used to say, “Nothin’ 
                        better than having your name on a 
                        door.” I can’t say I agree.  I got 
                        the same name, on the same door. 
                        Just another place for people to 
                        come botherin’ ya.
           He tries the door, but it’s locked.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to himself)
                        Really?

           He digs out keys and unlocks the door’s several dead-bolts, 
           opens.

           INT. COSGROVE & COSGROVE

           A simple room: two desks, both empty. Cosgrove closes the 
           door and looks around. He checks his pocket watch.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to the room, puzzled)
                        It’s two o’clock, for chrissake.

           Cosgrove walks over to the window, glances out on the street. 
           No one. He turns back to the room.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Ross and I used to run this place 
                        together. He’s the brains, I’m 
                        the... well, I suppose I used to be 
                        the brawn. But he didn’t bring me 
                        on until that was already gone.

           Cosgrove walks to a desk and looks over it: clean and empty. 
           He starts searching drawers.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Far as I knew, he still came into 
                        the office every day. Considering I 
                        was here to take out a little 
                        ‘loan’, it was a lucky break he 
                        wasn’t in today.

           He seems to know where to look: he reaches back into one 
           particular drawer and pulls out a few bills.

           A deliberate KNOCK from the door: ONE TAP, pause, TWO TAPS, 
           pause, ONE TAP - quick-like. Cosgrove jumps and SLAMS the 
           drawer closed, like he’s been caught.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (annoyed)
                        If you know I’m in here, why are 
                        you knocking?

           The door opens slowly to reveal MIRABELLE MORTIMER. In her 
           20s, a tall, stunning, well-dressed woman with a poise and 
           maturity much older than she. She stands there, backlit.
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        That certainly wasn’t my brother. 
                        Or my sister, thank god for that. I 
                        wanted to whistle at every bit of 
                        her, but I didn’t know which part 
                        to start with. My mouth had gone 
                        dry, anyway.

           Cosgrove clears his throat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ah, sorry doll. I thought you were 
                        someone else.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Mr. Cosgrove?

                                 COSGROVE
                        You’re looking at him. And he’s 
                        looking at you. Come in. And shut 
                        that door behind you.

           Cosgrove walks over to his own desk and sits. He checks out 
           her backside as she closes the door and comes to stand a few 
           feet in front of him. He looks up at her.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Sit down.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I’d prefer to stand.

                                 COSGROVE
                        If I were that tall, I’d want to 
                        show off, too. What’s the name?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Mr. Cosgrove, my name is Mirabelle 
                        Mortimer.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s a mouthful.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I handle it just fine. I found your 
                        card among my husband’s things.

           She holds out a business card. Cosgrove takes it and looks: 
           it’s Ross’s card, not his, their logo prominent. He hands it 
           back to her.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Nice of you to return it, but we 
                        make ‘em for you to keep. That’s 
                        how come they’re so small.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I’d like to hire you.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What problem could you possibly 
                        have, doll? You look to have the 
                        whole thing figured out. Plus 
                        interest.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        It’s my husband.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You need to find his will?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        No, I need to find him.

           Cosgrove LAUGHS at this.

                                 COSGROVE
                        A missing persons case?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I’m entirely serious.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Oh, I know it. A lot of people have 
                        gone “missing”. That’s just the 
                        state of things. There’s no point 
                        wasting my time, or yours, with 
                        something like searching for a 
                        missing person. Cuz we both know 
                        what probably happened.

           Mirabelle looks as if she’s just been slapped. A tiny glint 
           of remorse in Cosgrove’s eye, but not much.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        You’re cold.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m realistic. And hungry.

           Beat.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Did you lose anyone last December?
                                 COSGROVE
                        Honey, what I had to lose I lost 
                        years ago.

           Mirabelle sits down. She spots an empty ashtray on his desk, 
           takes a pack of Chesterfields out of her purse. Cosgrove’s 
           eyes widen as she lights up. She notices.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Would you like one?

           He nods. She takes one out of the pack, waves it.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you’d be willing to listen to 
                        me?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Fine, fine. 

           She tosses the cigarette to him, and he grabs it up quickly, 
           lights it and savors that first inhale.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        This husband, he got a name as good 
                        as yours?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Half as good. John Mortimer.

           Cosgrove’s eyes widen, and he COUGHS out smoke.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                        Good, you’ve heard of him.

                                 COSGROVE
                        John Mortimer? How long has he been 
                        missing?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        About a week. I went to check his 
                        office, in the Van Ness Building.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        It’s been Seized.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s disappointing.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Why?
                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s pretty obvious, don’t you 
                        think?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I can’t imagine John would’ve had 
                        much trouble with Hoods. He works 
                        with the Recovery Governor pretty 
                        frequently, even has security from 
                        time to time.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Governor Marcum sure does know how 
                        to keep the moneybags safe.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        So there’s that.

           Beat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And you can pay for my services?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Of course.

           She takes out a wad of money. Cosgrove sits up straight, 
           eyeing it. 

           Mirabelle’s eyes fall to a baseball on his desk, sitting on a 
           little display stand. She points to it.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (biting sarcasm)
                        Oh, that’s a fascinating item. See, 
                        before the world went to shit, 
                        people used to pay money to watch 
                        men try and hit that little thing 
                        with a big wooden stick. It was in 
                        all the papers.

           Mirabelle looks at the business card, then back at Cosgrove.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Ross Cosgrove?

                                 COSGROVE
                        You got me.  I’m William, his 
                        brother.

           Mirabelle gets up quickly.
                                 MIRABELLE
                        Ah. I’m sorry to have troubled you.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m also his partner. Look at the 
                        names on the door.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        You had me close the door.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And you did it so well.

           Mirabelle’s unsure what to do.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Relax, doll. I’ll take your case.

           She looks skeptical.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        How’s this: I got an old friend 
                        who’s a Cleaner. Me and him’ll let 
                        ourselves into your husband’s 
                        building and see what’s what. What 
                        do you have to lose?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        What do you charge?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ten dollars a day, plus expenses.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Then that’s what I have to lose.

           Cosgrove stands and gives his most earnest look, while 
           sneaking glances at the money in her hand.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Mirabelle. I’ll find your husband.

           A beat, as she considers. Finally, she nods and counts out 
           some cash.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Here’s ten for your first day.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Can I get another lip stick, too?

           She hands him the entire pack of cigarettes.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Now you’re talking!

           She smiles sternly and turns, opens the door and walks out, 
           closing it behind her.

           Cosgrove looks at the ten dollars in one hand, the cigarettes 
           in the other.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Now I had the kale I came in here 
                        for, and then some. Unfortunately, 
                        I had the work that came with it.

           He walks over to the window, looking down in time to see 
           Mirabelle exit the building and step into the back of a Rolls 
           Royce sedan. Her CHAUFFEUR closes the door and hustles to the 
           front seat.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        It seemed the rich still get what 
                        they want. That dame sure looked 
                        the part, though I bet even she 
                        drinks from the bottle.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY

           Cosgrove pulls up to a butcher shop with an empty front 
           window display. He walks inside.

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP

           The BUTCHER stands behind the counter, cleaning his 
           fingernails. Cosgrove walks up.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Got any normal meat today, Bud?

                                 BUTCHER
                        Just what the traps get. Pigeon and 
                        rat, mostly.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Damn. Alright, gimme some of that 
                        rat meat.  And some “tonic”.

           Cosgrove flashes a few dollar bills. The Butcher checks the 
           window, then disappears behind his counter for a moment. He 
           stands back up with a brown bag of something. Cosgrove takes 
           it.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

           He peeks into the bag: a whiskey bottle, filled with brown 
           liquid. Cosgrove smiles as the Butcher fetches the meat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - DAY

           Cosgrove drives along, the brown bag of liquor on the 
           passenger seat. He glances at it.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Prohibition is technically still 
                        the law of the land. But there’s no 
                        one to enforce it, not really, 
                        unless you’re straight-up squealed 
                        on.

           He turns a corner and runs into a small religious march. 
           Signs and placards read: “REPENT!” and “WE ARE BEING 
           PUNISHED!” Cosgrove rolls his eyes.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        It’s the religious freaks that’ll 
                        turn you in. The Doomsday bunch 
                        hates that everyone calls it Black 
                        Christmas. They figure all the bad 
                        happened because of the hooch.  But 
                        I seem to remember their carpenter 
                        fellow turning water into wine, and 
                        no Hoods showed up to tear off Mary 
                        Magdalen's face.

           Cosgrove stops the car to let the religious marchers go by. 
           He glances out his window at the gutted remains of a small 
           community clinic, heavily vandalized. 

           Someone has painted “YOU DID THIS!” on the walls.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Of course, the science bunch seems 
                        to think it was that new drug - 
                        penicillin, they call it - that 
                        started it all. What does it 
                        matter, I say. It happened.

           He drives off.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE COFFEE POT - AFTERNOON

           Cosgrove pulls up in front of the diner, glances in the front 
           window. There’s only one person at the counter, a WOMAN. No 
           one else in sight. He checks his pocket watch and drives off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COSGROVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

           Cosgrove pulls up to the front of a simple three-story 
           apartment building and stops. He gets out, grabbing the 
           liquor and rat meat. The front door of his building is 
           propped open, and from the dark foyer, HEAR MUSIC.

           A MAN flies past him in a sprint. Cosgrove watches him go, 
           then glances at the sun, halfway behind the horizon. He 
           enters the building.

           INT. COSGROVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER

           Inside the tiny foyer sits an old woman, AGNES, 82 years old, 
           a shotgun in her lap. A radio beside her plays MUSIC.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Evening Miss Agnes. Hoods give you 
                        any trouble today?

                                 AGNES
                        Ain’t a Hood yet give me trouble I 
                        couldn’t handle.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s my girl.

           Cosgrove walks up the stairs. Behind him, the MUSIC is 
           interrupted by a loud series of TONES: “BEEP BEEP BEEP”, 
           repeating.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Sundown, Miss Agnes.

                                 AGNES
                        I ain’t deaf, boy. Ain’t blind, 
                        neither.

           INT. COSGROVE’S APARTMENT  

           The door opens and Cosgrove walks in. He locks it behind him. 
           A typical bachelor’s apartment. He sits down on the couch, 
           removes his pistol and places it on the coffee table.
           A cat trots in, rubs up against his legs. He pets it.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I know what you want, Lucy.

           He unwraps the butcher paper and puts the rat meat on the 
           floor. The cat starts to eat.

           He takes the fifth of whiskey out of the bag. The label on it 
           has a logo: a letter “H” with wings on both sides. He opens 
           it, toasts the cat in faux French:

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Bon app-uh-TIGHT, Lucy my love.

           He takes a long swig.

           He sits there, smoking, taking sips. Outside it grows darker. 
           He WHISTLES the tune from the radio, softly.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. COSGROVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A HORRIFIC SCREAM wakes Cosgrove from the couch. The liquor 
           bottle tumbles from his chest to the floor. He grabs his gun, 
           looking around wildly.

           ANOTHER SCREAM. It’s from down on the street. He SIGHS: “Oh, 
           it’s just that.” He stands, still a bit drunk. The cat sits 
           on the windowsill, looking out. Cosgrove shuffles to the 
           window.

           Standing eerily still in the street is a UNIFORMED POLICEMAN. 
           He’s missing an arm, tendons and muscle hanging off.

           Cosgrove shoos the cat away, opens the window. The SOUND 
           turns the Policeman toward him: its face is mangled, bloody. 
           Its weird eyes stare up at Cosgrove.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Seven months on, and the nights 
                        still belong to the Hoods. No 
                        amount of Cleaning or Seizing has 
                        stopped that yet.

           The Policeman Hood opens its mouth and SCREAMS at Cosgrove. 
           Cosgrove’s face is expressionless.

           As Cosgrove points his gun at it, more SCREECHES from up the 
           street.
           TWO MORE HOODS come running at FULL SPRINT - FAST! - after 
           two dogs. One wears the remains of a tuxedo, the other has 
           long bloody-blonde hair. The Policeman Hood runs after them, 
           into the darkness.

           Cosgrove loses interest and closes the window.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Given any persistent condition, we 
                        tend to adapt pretty damn fast.

           He stumbles over to the couch, looking for his liquor bottle. 
           He finds it, sits and picks it up off the floor. 

           It’s empty.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Goddammit.

           He tosses it aside and rubs his eyes.

           Another SCREAM from the street.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        You and me both, pal. You and me 
                        both.

           The WHIMPER of a DOG, far off: they got one.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. COSGROVE & COSGROVE - DAY

           From behind the door, we hear Cosgrove:

                                 COSGROVE
                             (behind door)
                        Ross?

           The latches unlock, and the door opens. Cosgrove looks 
           around: still empty. He steps in.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        So Ross didn’t dine at The Coffee 
                        Pot two nights ago. Didn’t see him 
                        in there last night, either. He 
                        always has his dinner there. And as 
                        far as I knew, he hadn’t been in 
                        the office.

           Cosgrove goes to Ross’s desk, searches through some papers 
           and such. Nothing to find. He walks to the window, looks out. 
           A Cleaner Car drives by.
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        He’s a smart kid, maybe he just 
                        needed a vacation. I could use a 
                        little fun myself. Havana would be 
                        nice. Or London. I’d be curious 
                        what a limey Hood was like.

           Cosgrove picks up the baseball on his desk, grips it, then 
           sets it back down. He grabs a baseball bat leaning on a 
           nearby wall and walks to the door with it.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Ross could take care of himself. 
                        And if I waited around and he did 
                        show up, he’d want half of the 
                        Mortimer case, money too. So time 
                        to beat it.

           Cosgrove walks out, turns, and leans the bat against the 
           inside of the door as he slowly pulls it shut.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        But it didn’t hurt to be sure.

           The door shuts completely, with the bat leaning up against it 
           under the doorknob.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - DAY

           Cosgrove drives, smokes.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Had to check out the Van Ness, 
                        before I got too far ahead of 
                        myself. John Mortimer was the 
                        richest man in St. Louis, and the 
                        Cleaners only started Seizing 
                        buildings a month ago. If he was so 
                        chummy with the Recovery Governor, 
                        then maybe a Seizure Notice on his 
                        front door might not mean what it 
                        does for us peasant-folk. Maybe he 
                        just pays for privacy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VAN NESS BUILDING

           Cosgrove steps out of his car and looks up: a six-story brick 
           office building, like dozens of others in downtown St. Louis.
           He walks up to the doors. Chains and a padlock secure them, 
           and plastered across the front is a large poster:

           “DANGER! DO NOT ENTER! SEIZED BY THE CENTRAL REGION RECOVERY 
           OFFICE, UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL RECOVERY ACT OF 
           1933. -WILBUR RANDALL MARCUM, GOVERNOR.”

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to himself)
                        Looks Seized to me.

           He gives the doors a pull: nothing. He walks over to a front 
           window and peers in. It’s dark inside.

           Suddenly, a VOICE behind him.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey! Get away from there!

           Cosgrove turns to see OFFICER O’NEILL, a uniformed policeman.

                                 COSGROVE
                        O’Neill?

                                 O’NEILL
                        Jesus, Cosgrove, what do you think 
                        you’re doing?

                                 COSGROVE
                        What does it look like? I want to 
                        see the window treatments. Is that 
                        velvet?

                                 O’NEILL
                        Don’t be smart, you don’t want 
                        nothing to do with what’s in there.

           Cosgrove walks over, the two men shake hands.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey-ya, Irish. You back on the 
                        beat?

                                 O’NEILL
                        Aye, it’s just for appearances, 
                        really. 

                                 COSGROVE
                        How long ago they Seize this 
                        building?

                                 O’NEILL
                        The Van Ness? Oh, five, six days. 
                        Maybe longer. What’s up?
           Cosgrove pulls out his Chesterfields, offers one.

                                 O’NEILL (CONT’D)
                        Damn, boy-o, where’d you go and get 
                        those?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Have one.

                                 O’NEILL
                        I ain’t the one to bribe no more.

           O’Neill takes one anyway, Cosgrove lights it for him. They 
           stand there, looking at the Seized notice.

                                 O’NEILL (CONT’D)
                        You really want inside?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Call me an explorer.

                                 O’NEILL
                        I’ll call you an idiot and an arse. 
                        Only Cleaners are allowed in there.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I figured as much.

           Beat.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Elizabeth alright?

                                 O’NEILL
                             (appreciative)
                        She’s alive, thank ya for askin’.

           Cosgrove nods.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RECOVERY BUILDING - DAY

           A large public building, with tall granite steps out front. 
           We see people milling about on the sidewalks and steps, the 
           first time the city hasn’t seemed empty.

           Cosgrove’s Packard pulls up and parks, he gets out, takes it 
           in. 

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Roosevelt’s New Deal formed three 
                        Recovery Regions.

                        Francisco. Both port towns. You’d 
                        think Chicago would be the natural 
                        choice for Central, but in St. 
                        Louis we got that tiny trickle 
                        called the Mississippi. Those 
                        Rationing Shipments gotta dock 
                        somewhere.

           A RELIGIOUS MAN, waving pamphlets, rushes up.

                                 RELIGIOUS MAN
                        My friend, do you believe in 
                        angels?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Had one in my office just 
                        yesterday.

                        Had a pair of legs you’d want to 
                        stir a Manhattan with.

                                 RELIGIOUS MAN
                        A Manhattan? But sir...

                                 COSGROVE
                             (smiling wide)
                        This was fun.

           Cosgrove waves the confused man away and starts up the steps.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECOVERY OFFICE/CLEANERS DIVISION

           Cosgrove walks up to a desk, behind which sits CINDY, a 
           pretty red head eager to help.

                                 CINDY
                        Hello sir, welcome to the Recovery 
                        Office, are you here to report a 
                        disturbance?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m looking for a Cleaner.

                                 CINDY
                        If you are reporting a disturbance, 
                        I’d be happy to -
                                 COSGROVE
                        No, I need one specific guy.

                                 CINDY
                             (a little impatient)
                        I’m sorry, but it’s against the law 
                        for Cleaners to be hired on an 
                        individual basis.

                                 COSGROVE
                        He’s a friend, Red. Just an old 
                        friend I’m looking for.

                                 CINDY
                        Oh. Of course. Today’s orders are 
                        right over there along the wall.

           She points to a series of papers posted up along a side wall. 
           Cosgrove walks over to them.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll need his name to tell you 
                        which team he’s on.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Anthony Jackson.

                                 CINDY
                        One moment.

           She smiles and disappears through a side door. Cosgrove looks 
           over the lists:

           “TEAM FOUR - 1620 Washington Ave.
           TEAM FIVE - 300 N. 16th
           TEAM SIX - 901 N. Broadway”

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        No wonder Cleaners don’t stop to 
                        help some haggard dick like me. 
                        There’s Hoods all over this 
                        bellicose burg.

           Cindy returns.

                                 CINDY
                        He’s on Team Eight.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Thanks doll.

           He checks the lists for Team Eight.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        2400 block of Terry Street. Lovely 
                        neighborhood.

           He smiles at her and leaves.

           INT. RECOVERY BUILDING ATRIUM

           Cosgrove exits the elevator, his heels CLICK CLICKing in the 
           marble-floored atrium. He stops suddenly.

           Walking toward him is a huge ENTOURAGE OF MEN with shotguns, 
           calmly escorting WILLIAM RANDALL MARCUM. Marcum’s a large, 
           confident, dashing politician. Big enough you’re afraid not 
           to vote for him, handsome enough you’re happy to anyway.

           Cosgrove watches him approach.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        His honor, the Central Recovery 
                        Governor, Mister William Randall 
                        Marcum. Even before Black 
                        Christmas, politicians were a hard 
                        second on the list of Things I 
                        Hate. Number One used to be the 
                        Chicago White Sox.

           Cosgrove turns to walk past when Marcum spots him, his eyes 
           lighting up with recognition.

                                 MARCUM
                        William Cosgrove?

           Cosgrove is surprised.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s me, Guv, but I don’t believe 
                        we’ve had the pleasure.

                                 MARCUM
                        I know your brother.

           Cosgrove hears this way too much.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Of course you do.

                                 MARCUM
                        How is the good detective doing?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (annoyed sarcasm)
                        Oh, the good detective? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSGROVE (CONT'D)
                        He’s got a Hood in the Kentucky 
                        Derby. Runs well in the mud, so 
                        we’re hoping for rain.

                                 MARCUM
                        Ah. Excellent.

           Cosgrove checks out the large group backing up Marcum.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Nice grouping. Did I miss the 
                        parade?

                                 MARCUM
                        No, a rally.

                                 COSGROVE
                        A rally? Don’t you already have the 
                        job?

                                 MARCUM
                        The good Lord will need someone to 
                        step in when Roosevelt resigns in 
                        shame.

           Hearing the religious talk, Cosgrove also notes a PRIEST 
           among Marcum’s entourage.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (re: priest)
                        Cute. I usually make my padre wait 
                        in the car.

                                 MARCUM
                        What can we do for you? On a case?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Confidential.

           Cosgrove smiles cockily at the man.

                                 MARCUM
                        You used to pitch for the Browns.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s what they paid me for.

                                 MARCUM
                             (shaking his head)
                        Promising young career, tragically 
                        cut short by the drink. God bless 
                        you.

           Cosgrove’s smile drops at this dig at him.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Good day.

           Cosgrove turns and walks away, Marcum smiling after him.

           EXT. RECOVERY BUILDING  

           Cosgrove slams out the front doors.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (grumbling)
                        Cocksucking religious windbag.

           He gathers himself and lights a cigarette, looking down at 
           the street. Parked on either side of his Packard are several 
           BLACK CARGO TRUCKS, each with a Cleaner number painted on the 
           sides.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        So Marcum jumps to first on my 
                        little list. He was probably a 
                        Cardinal fan. Everyone in St. Louis 
                        loves a former Brown, except 
                        Cardinal fans.

           Cosgrove spots DANNY REED, a reporter from the Post-Dispatch, 
           jogging up the steps toward him, press pass on his hat. 

           Cosgrove gives a wave, Danny flips him off.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        And the goddamned press.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TERRY STREET - DAY

           Cosgrove turns onto a residential street lined with houses. 
           Parked in front of one is Cleaner Car C-46.

           On the lawn stand two AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN and a CAUCASIAN 
           WOMAN, talking together.

           As Cosgrove pulls up, the woman and one man split up and 
           start circling the house, one on either side. Each holds a 
           shotgun at the ready. The third man turns to watch Cosgrove 
           walk up.

           This is ANTHONY JACKSON, 26 years old, tall and confident, 
           with a single patch of gray in his otherwise youthful dark 
           hair.
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        I spotted Anthony a few years back, 
                        throwing in the Negro League. 
                        Pitching arm like an angry 
                        bullwhip. You ask me, if he hadn’t 
                        been colored, he wouldn’t have just 
                        played in the big leagues, he would 
                        have ruled them.

           Cosgrove joins Anthony by the house’s front door, smiling. 
           Anthony looks him up and down.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Holy hell, if it isn’t the shadiest 
                        shamus in Missouri.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And they say it’s dangerous in the 
                        shade these days.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What do you want?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Who says I want anything?

           Anthony raises a skeptical eyebrow. Cosgrove changes the 
           subject, points out Anthony’s Cleaner shotgun: a flashlight 
           has been welded underneath the barrel.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (re: shotgun)
                        Standard issue?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeah, not bad, huh? 

                                 COSGROVE
                        Gets dark in these places, I bet.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Well, that, and the sickness keeps 
                        their eyes dilated, so you can 
                        sorta blind them with it.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Great. I know just the place. I 
                        need to get inside the Van Ness 
                        Building.

                                 ANTHONY
                        So go inside.
                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s been Seized.

                                 ANTHONY
                        If it’s been Seized, then why the 
                        hell would you want inside?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Why, there’s a little lost puppy in 
                        there.

                                 ANTHONY
                        It’s crazy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey, you don’t even know that 
                        puppy. Come on, there’s three of 
                        you. Plus me, that ought to be 
                        enough. I mean, you’re just 
                        standing here.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coz, Cleaning a one bedroom house 
                        is different than Cleaning a Seized 
                        commercia...

           WHAM!  Something inside the house slams against the front 
           door, that INHUMAN SCREAM WAILING. Cosgrove jumps back, 
           startled, pulling his pistol and pointing it at the door. 
           Anthony pulls Cosgrove’s hand down.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        No, don’t shoot through the door.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Why the hell not?

           From either side of the house come running the other two 
           Cleaners: WAYLON, 50-something, and DOROTHY, early 30s tough 
           girl.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I saw at least one in there!

                                 WAYLON
                        Me too!

                                 ANTHONY
                        The same one?

           They shrug. Anthony pulls Cosgrove back as Waylon grabs the 
           doorknob and turns. Dorothy kicks the door open, sending the 
           HOOD INSIDE flying backwards.
                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get the back!

           He runs around the house.

           INT. TERRY STREET HOUSE

           Dorothy enters, blinds the Hood with her gun’s flashlight and 
           shoots it in the chest. It falls to the floor, and she fires 
           another round into its head.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (from outside)
                        God damn.

           Silence. She looks at the end of her shotgun. Her flashlight 
           is merely taped on, and the tape is SIZZLING from the 
           barrel’s heat. Waylon enters, looks at the body.

                                 WAYLON
                        That’s the one I saw.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Me too. Go ahead, Waylon.

           Waylon darts off into another room, gun and flashlight 
           raised.  Dorothy looks back at Cosgrove, gesturing to her 
           taped flashlight.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Adapt to survive, huh?

           Just past her, Cosgrove sees ANOTHER HOOD tearing around the 
           hallway corner. His eyes widen and he raises his pistol.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey!

           She turns in time to step away, but trips over the dead Hood 
           and falls backwards to the ground, shotgun sliding away. The 
           second Hood’s momentum carries it past her. It stops and 
           turns on her.

           This Hood was once a woman, in a dressing gown and the 
           remains of its hair in curlers. Its breathing is RASPY and 
           HEAVING. Its right arm is backwards at the elbow, clearly 
           broken. 

           It lunges for Dorothy, the broken arm CLICKING and BENDING in 
           unnatural ways. Dorothy raises her hands in defense.

           BLAM! Cosgrove fires ONE SHOT into its head. It falls down, 
           dead.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (lowering his pistol)
                        Jesus.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TERRY STREET HOUSE - LATER

           Cosgrove and Dorothy each smoke a cigarette, watching Anthony 
           and Waylon drag the Hood bodies to the street and cover them 
           with gasoline. 

           Dorothy pats Cosgrove on the shoulder.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Thanks.
                             (re: cigarette)
                        For this, too.

           She walks away as Anthony and Waylon walk up.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Cosgrove, this is Waylon. Waylon, 
                        William Cosgrove.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey-ya.

                                 WAYLON
                        Cosgrove, like Ross Cosgrove?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Oh, for chrissake.

           They shake hands.

                                 ANTHONY
                        That’s Dorothy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Bet she misses the Land of Oz.

                                 WAYLON
                        You sure saved her butt today, bud. 
                        Thanks.

           Cosgrove shrugs.

                                 WAYLON (CONT’D)
                        Anything we can do to repay you...

           Cosgrove grins.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Waylon, it’s funny you should ask.

           Dorothy drops her cigarette butt on the bodies, and as they 
           light up with a WHOOSH:

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Cosgrove emerges from the stairs and walks down the hall.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Anthony said he and his team would 
                        meet me at the Van Ness around two. 
                        That gave me time for a little 
                        lunch. Shooting Hoods sure does 
                        work up a man’s appetite. But 
                        something was nagging at me first.

           He reaches his office door, tries the knob. Locked. He 
           unlocks all the deadbolts, turns the knob. He slowly pushes 
           the door open.

           CLANG! The baseball bat falls to the floor.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Shit.

           He watches the bat roll away from the door, and for the first 
           time, some legitimate concern in his eyes.

           Cosgrove picks the bat up and sets up his little alarm again, 
           slowly closing the door with the bat up against it. It shuts, 
           and he re-locks everything.

           He walks away, glancing at the “EDITH - GONE TO OK CITY” 
           scrawled on the wall.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Where’s Ross gone to, Edith?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VAN NESS BUILDING - DAY

           The lobby of the building is nearly pitch dark. From outside, 
           the sounds of CHAINS AGAINST WOOD.
           The door opens slowly. Daylight pours in, silhouetting 
           Dorothy, shotgun raised, light on. Behind her stand the other 
           two Cleaners and Cosgrove.

           She steps in, they follow. The Cleaners spread out to check 
           immediate doors/halls, as Cosgrove (with his own shotgun now) 
           waits by the door. The Cleaners return.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Clean.

                                 WAYLON
                        Yep.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Clean.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Doesn’t look overrun.

                                 WAYLON
                        You can smell ‘em.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Or what’s left of them.

           Cosgrove spots the building directory on the wall, walks over 
           and scans it.

                                 COSGROVE
                        There it is. Five-oh-seven.

           At the back of the lobby is a big winding staircase, 
           spiraling up around a five-story tall atrium. Sunlight shines 
           down from a skylight at the very top, a rectangle of light at 
           their feet. They walk over to it.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Fifth floor?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Yep.

           Anthony SIGHS.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it won’t be so bad.

           Right on cue, from above, a HOOD SCREAM.

                                 DOROTHY
                        You just had to say it, didn’t you?
           The SCREAM AGAIN, only it’s GETTING LOUDER FAST. Cosgrove 
           sees a shadow on the floor moving about, too. They look up to 
           see a Hood plummeting down the atrium, head first, SCREAMING 
           its descent.

                                 WAYLON
                        Move!

           They dash to all sides as the Hood SLAMS into the floor, 
           BONES CRACKING. It starts to crawl around for them.

           Dorothy FIRES her shotgun into its head, and it stops. 
           Cosgrove winks at her.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hell hath no fury like a woman with 
                        an Ithaca double-barrel.

           Suddenly, countless MORE SCREAMS from above. There must be 
           scores of Hoods up there. Multiple shadows dancing on the 
           floor, and they look up to see:

           CHAOS. Hoods are raining down from the top floors.

                                 ANTHONY
                        The stairs!

           They run for the staircase as the bodies start SLAMMING into 
           the floor.

           INT. VAN NESS BUILDING STAIRWAY

           The foursome run up the stairs, around and around, with Hoods 
           falling past them down the center. SCREAMS everywhere, THUDS 
           from below. Limbs and bodies clipping the banisters as they 
           fly past.

           Some bounce onto the stairway itself. A few Hoods have hit 
           the banisters dead on, gruesomely folded in half, still 
           clawing and reaching for the foursome. Some run down the 
           stairs properly. The Cleaners’ guns are BLAZING to clear the 
           way. 

           INT. VAN NESS BUILDING/FIFTH FLOOR

           Anthony reaches the fifth floor first, to find two or three 
           Hoods remaining. The railing on the fifth floor landing is 
           gone: it’s where they’ve been leaping from.

           Anthony and Dorothy dispatch the remaining Hoods, and wave 
           Cosgrove up. Waylon watches the rear.
                                 COSGROVE
                        What was that about?

           Anthony points to the missing railing.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Fastest way from A to B. They 
                        must’ve been starving. Which way?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Five-oh-seven.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Over there.

           They run down the hall and find 507, a closed wooden door 
           with the words “JOHN MORTIMER, FINANCES”. The door has been 
           clawed and scratched horribly.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (re: scratches)
                        Look at that.

                                 ANTHONY
                        That must be why they were all up 
                        here.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What must?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Whatever’s in there.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Great.

           Cosgrove does the KNOCK: one-two-one.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Are you kidding me?

           She pushes him aside and gives the door a solid kick. The 
           frame BREAKS, but the door doesn’t budge, and she falls back.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (helping her up)
                        Jesus, you alright?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Bully.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Something must be blocking it from 
                        the inside.
           Cosgrove peeks through the cracked frame.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You’re right. Count of three, let’s 
                        all push.

           They find their place along the door, as Waylon keeps his 
           eyes on the stairs.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        One. Two. Three!

           They all shove, and the door slowly opens, the sound of 
           something heavy SKIDDING away.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        You got me this far. I’ll go first.

           He readies his shotgun and steps into:

           INT. JOHN MORTIMER’S OFFICE

           Cosgrove squeezes his way in, past a large file cabinet that 
           was blocking the door. Anthony and Dorothy follow. Once 
           again, the tape holding her flashlight SIZZLES from the 
           barrel’s heat.

           The office is dark, save for the light shining through a 
           window. A figure sits in front of the window, face down on a 
           large desk. Cosgrove walks over as Anthony shines his light 
           on it.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Well?

           Cosgrove looks it over. It’s a man, an exit wound in the back 
           of his head. A pistol on the floor, just under a dangling, 
           limp hand.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Lovely.

           Cosgrove carefully reaches toward the body. Just before he 
           touches it, Dorothy’s flashlight falls off, the tape burning 
           through.  It CLANGS to the floor, causing Cosgrove to jump.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Sorry. We all knew it was coming.

           Cosgrove carefully reaches his hand into the dead man’s suit 
           jacket, pulls out a wallet and opens it.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Yep. It’s Mortimer. Damn.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coz, step away.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Step back!

           Anthony shines a light on Mortimer’s other arm: it’s torn 
           open from a Hood bite.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Relax, Tony. He’s Proper Dead. Did 
                        it himself.

           Cosgrove points to a point high on the window behind the body 
           - a bullet hole and blood - then mimics a gun under his chin.

           Waylon appears at the office door.

                                 WAYLON
                             (re: door)
                        Would you look at this.

           He fingers the countless claw marks on the door.

                                 DOROTHY
                        No doubt they knew a meal was in 
                        here.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Just like a rich guy: give the 
                        dregs a free taste, then take it 
                        away from ‘em.

           From afar, the SOUND OF HOOD SCREAMS. Waylon peeks down the 
           hallway.

                                 WAYLON
                        Those that can still move are 
                        moving back up, I’d bet.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hurry up, Coz.

           Cosgrove looks over Mortimer’s desk, spots a sheet of paper 
           and pen underneath John’s bitten hand. He carefully removes 
           the hand and picks it up. It’s a list of some sort.
                                 DOROTHY
                        Well?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Dorothy my dear.
                             (he tips his hat)
                        Case closed.

           He smiles. Another SCREAM from afar. Waylon reappears.

                                 WAYLON
                        I found us another way down. Fire 
                        escape at the end of the hall.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Fabulous. I love heights.

           Cosgrove folds the list into his pocket and heads toward the 
           door.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - DAY

           Cosgrove drives along, smoking. He smiles, a job well done.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        I couldn’t remember the last time 
                        I’d closed a case.  Well before 
                        December, that’s for sure, and even 
                        then I shared the credit with Ross. 
                        Now it was all mine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MORTIMER MANSION - DAY

           Cosgrove pulls up behind Mirabelle’s Rolls Royce and gets 
           out.  He takes a look at the giant house and WHISTLES, 
           impressed.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Unfortunately, the “Sharing of the 
                        Bad News” was always Ross’s job. 
                        Now that was all mine, too.

           He lifts the giant door-knocker to pound on the door, TWICE.

           Nothing happens.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hello?!
           Beat.  Finally the door opens, revealing Mirabelle’s butler, 
           WESTCOTT.

                                 WESTCOTT
                        Yes sir?

           Cosgrove pushes his way in.

           INT. MORTIMER MANSION/ENTRY HALL

           Cosgrove walks into the grand entryway, with a staircase 
           leading up to the second floor landing.

                                 WESTCOTT
                        Can I help you?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Lady of the house.

                                 WESTCOTT
                        And you are?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m the gumshoe.

                                 WESTCOTT
                        Ah. Yes sir.

           From the landing above, Mirabelle appears, in a dress, 
           stunning as ever.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        William?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey-ya angel.

           She slowly descends the staircase, and he doesn’t deny 
           himself the chance to watch her do it.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        What is it?

           Beat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let’s talk.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MORTIMER MANSION/DRAWING ROOM - DAY

           Mirabelle sits in a high-backed chair, having just heard the 
           news of John’s death. She’s calm, focused. Cosgrove stands 
           nearby, smoking a cigarette.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You okay?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I am, thank you.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You’re taking this surprisingly 
                        well.

           She EXHALES LOUDLY and looks at him.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Mr. Cosgrove, my husband and I were 
                        unhappy for quite some time, but I 
                        am nonetheless upset to learn of 
                        his passing.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (raising his hands)
                        Hey, this is why I don’t do divorce 
                        cases.

           Cosgrove digs the list out of his pocket, unfolds it.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        I found this on his desk, like he’d 
                        just written it. It’s a list of 
                        addresses.
                             (reads it)
                        300 South 9th, 1620 Olive.  About 
                        twenty more. Mean anything to you?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Maybe it’s where he stashed all his 
                        girls.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (ignores that)
                        What about the letters L.P.I.?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        What about them?

                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s written at the top here.
                                 MIRABELLE
                             (losing patience)
                        Does it matter?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Eh, I guess not.

           He tosses the list on a nearby table. An awkward silence. 
           Somewhere in the house, a PHONE RINGS.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Phone service, huh? Nice to have 
                        connections, I guess. Pun intended.

           She’s still just staring. He glances about the room, eyes 
           finding a half-filled brandy decanter.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Spare a little giggle water, angel?

           She waves consent, and he strides over. He picks up the 
           bottle and looks at it closely. He notices Mirabelle watching 
           him.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Just checking for lipstick.

           He pours himself a cup. He takes a long swig.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        They always said prohibition’s for 
                        the poor, not the rich.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Or the degenerates.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (brushing off her jibe)
                        Cheers.

           He finishes it off, comes to stand in front of her.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        As for the matter of the bill.

           She nods and stands.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Of course.  You did the job rather 
                        quickly, and I thank you.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Two days.
                                 MIRABELLE
                        I wouldn’t think getting paid by 
                        the day is a strong incentive.

                                 COSGROVE
                        A buck in the hand, two in the 
                        bush, et cetera.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Twenty dollars. Plus expenses.  
                        Westcott!

           The butler comes in.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                             (to Westcott)
                        Please give Mr. Cosgrove seventy-
                        five dollars in cash, would you?

                                 WESTCOTT
                        Very good.

           He leaves, Cosgrove’s shocked.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey, angel, I...

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Included in the expenses are the 
                        considerable danger you put 
                        yourself in, for me.  Thank you.

           She extends a hand, and he takes it. They shake.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                        Westcott will see you out.

           She turns and leaves, giving him once last glance as she 
           does. 

           Cosgrove isn’t sure what to do next. Westcott appears in the 
           doorway, holding quite a few bills. Cosgrove sees them, and 
           smiles wide.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Cosgrove is in good spirits, driving through the streets at 
           night. He smokes, HUMS to himself.
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        It was a good moment for me, in a 
                        world starved of good moments. And 
                        with a fresh wad of shekels burning 
                        up my pockets, I knew just where to 
                        go to celebrate.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT

           Cosgrove’s Packard weaves among the big industrial buildings.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE  

           Cosgrove parks, gets out and walks up to a giant steel door. 
           At the end of the street, about 200 yards away, stands a lone 
           Hood. It’s facing the other way, and far enough to be only a 
           minimal threat.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to himself, re: Hood)
                        Hey there, you old goof.

           He KNOCKS - one/two/one - on the door. A window above the 
           door cracks open, closes, and the door opens.

           A GOON with a Tommy Gun steps out, looking Cosgrove up and 
           down. From down the street, the Hood SCREAMS. Cosgrove 
           smiles.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Table for two?

                                 GOON
                        Very funny, Coz. Get inside 
                        already.

           Cosgrove enters.

           INT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY

           Cosgrove descends a stair into a dimly lit hallway. The sound 
           of MUSIC gets louder and louder as he approaches a pair of 
           velvet curtains.

           Painted on the walls of the hall are the same winged “H” logo 
           from his liquor bottle.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        That light at the end of the tunnel 
                        was one of my favorite spots in the 
                        world. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It’s where I won that two hundred 
                        dollars back on my Greatest Day.

           He reaches the curtains and parts them. MUSIC blares, and 
           light drenches his smiling face.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        The best damn speakeasy this side 
                        of the Mississippi. And they named 
                        it “Heaven”.

           He enters:

           INT. HEAVEN SPEAKEASY

           A giant, windowless room that looks like every gin joint you 
           could imagine. Three-piece band JAMS on a stage, a few 
           couples dancing. A long bar populated with drinkers, as 
           waitresses serve others sitting in dark booths. 

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        When you’re in here, there’s no 
                        such thing as Hoods.

           He heads to the bar, greeting waitresses and regulars along 
           the way. He finds a stool and sits, as a giant BARTENDER 
           greets him.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Coz.

                                 COSGROVE
                        The usual.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Times two?

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s the usual, ain’t it?

           The Bartender fills a high ball with whiskey, and Cosgrove 
           throws some bills down, finishes the lot in one long pull.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s do it again. Daddy’s 
                        celebrating tonight.

           The Bartender refills him, and Cosgrove takes a smaller sip, 
           settling in. From behind him:

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey there, Lefty.
           Standing behind Cosgrove is a tall, handsome man in an 
           expensive pin-striped suit. This is DOUGLAS WARIMAN, 
           proprietor of Heaven and intimidator of many.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I was a righty, Douglas.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Not when you drink.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Douglas Wariman. Bootlegger, 
                        gangster, snappy dresser. He’s the 
                        high cloud around here.

           Cosgrove raises his left hand, with drink, toasting Douglas.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I thought you were in Chicago.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Some pressing business pulled me 
                        away.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And we poor country folk sure is 
                        glad to see ya, yes indeedy.

           Douglas looks Cosgrove up and down.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        How’s Ross?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Jesus H. Christ. Even in my 
                        favorite gin joint my brother gets 
                        first billing, and the man doesn’t 
                        even drink.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Touchy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        For your information, Ross isn’t 
                        the only Cosgrove that can do the 
                        work. I wrapped up a case just 
                        today.

           Cosgrove toasts himself, finishes his second whiskey. Douglas 
           does a little faux-clap for him.

           From the stage, the jazz band finishes up to some APPLAUSE. 
           Then, the sultry voice of a woman:
                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey ya’ll.

           HOOTS AND WHISTLES. Cosgrove’s eyes widen and he turns to see 
           ADDIE on the microphone: a sexy young blonde, mid-20s, so 
           good looking she must be trouble.

                                 ADDIE
                        My name’s Addie, and I’m gonna sing 
                        a little song for ya.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Mother of god, the star of the 
                        show. We called her Addie, short 
                        for... who cares, look at her.

           CHEERS as she begins to SING an upbeat song.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I tell you what, Douglas, bottle 
                        that and you’ll be a very rich man.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I’m already a very rich man.

           Douglas signals the Bartender.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                             (pointing to Coz)
                        His next two are on me.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Yes sir, Mr. Wariman.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Holy shit, you should come down to 
                        “St. Louie” more often!

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Enjoy the show, Coz.

           Douglas pats him on the shoulder and walks off, winking at 
           Addie as he walks by the stage. Cosgrove watches him walk 
           down a back hallway and turn a corner.

           Cosgrove finds his next drink waiting for him. He grabs it, 
           takes a sip, and watches Addie dance and wiggle through her 
           SONG.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        I had money in my pocket and hooch 
                        in my hand. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And if we were lucky, Addie’d 
                        wiggle her way right out of that 
                        dress. This was turning into a 
                        goddamned good day.

           He drinks, Addie SINGS, the place is swinging.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. COSGROVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cosgrove lies sleeping on his couch, his cat asleep on his 
           chest. Sounds of HOOD SCREAMS from outside don’t seem to 
           bother either of them.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. COSGROVE’S OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Cosgrove, clearly hungover, slowly trudges up the stairs to 
           his floor. He shuffles down the hall, head down, until:

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                        Hey, shamus!

           Cosgrove is both startled and pained by the sudden shout. He 
           looks up to see Anthony standing in front of his office.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (weary sarcasm)
                        What do ya know. Cab Calloway, in 
                        my building!

                                 ANTHONY
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Oh, just a little ring-a-ding-ding 
                        last night.

                                 ANTHONY
                        You’re hungover?

                                 COSGROVE
                        No, I went into extra innings.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Well, I’m glad someone’s happy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Thank you, Tony, I’m glad, too.
                                 ANTHONY
                        Me and my team got fired today.

           Cosgrove stops in front of Anthony, looking to see if he’s 
           serious. Anthony just stares sternly.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Well, shit, friend, that’s... 
                        that’s too bad.

           Cosgrove turns to unlock the door. Anthony blocks it with an 
           arm. 

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit, I need my headache powder.

                                 ANTHONY
                        We show up at the Recovery Office 
                        today to get our assignment, and 
                        Team Eight’s not up on the board. 
                        We ask where it could be, and they 
                        pull us into the back room. Tell us 
                        our “services would no longer be 
                        required”.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Those government folks are always 
                        so nice and formal.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Took our badges right there, sent 
                        us away.

           Anthony waits for a response from Cosgrove, who doesn’t think 
           he needs to give one. Beat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Did you hear me?

                                 COSGROVE
                        You’re no longer a Cleaner, I heard 
                        ya. You want a letter of 
                        recommendation? Let me in my 
                        office.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Do you know anything about it?

           Cosgrove is puzzled at that.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Why would I have -

                                 ANTHONY
                        I don’t know. We’ve been Cleaning 
                        as a team for six months, day in 
                        and day out. Only time anything 
                        changed was yesterday, when you 
                        came along and we did you a favor. 
                        So I have to think it’s something 
                        to do with you.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s specious reasoning.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What does that mean?

           Beat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I don’t know. My brother always 
                        said it to me. I think it’s an 
                        insult.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Fantastic.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (repeating, to himself)
                        My brother...

           He pushes Anthony’s arm away and unlocks the door. He pushes 
           it open a bit, and the bat CLANGS to the floor behind it.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Shit.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What was that?

           Cosgrove pushes the door open, revealing the bat rolling 
           across the floor.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s a bat, dummy.

                                 ANTHONY
                             (had enough)
                        Shamus, I swear to God.
                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s troubling news, is what it is.

           INT. COSGROVE & COSGROVE

           They enter. Anthony picks up the bat as Cosgrove scans the 
           room: nothing’s different.

           Anthony spots the baseball on Cosgrove’s desk, does a slow-
           motion swing at it with the bat.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You busy today?

                                 ANTHONY
                             (indignant)
                        Of course not! Have you been 
                        listening to a word I...

                                 COSGROVE
                        Great, let’s go.

           Cosgrove strides past Anthony and out the door. Anthony 
           follows, frustrated.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Well, leave the bat.

           Anthony, exasperated, tosses it back in and storms down the 
           hall, as Cosgrove closes the door and locks it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROSS’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A quiet, simple house, dark but for the light from the 
           windows. From the front door, the KNOCK: one/two/one. 
           Silence. The KNOCK again. Nothing.

           The door opens slowly to reveal Cosgrove, shotgun raised, and 
           Anthony, holding Cosgrove’s revolver.

           They stand there, listening.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ross?  Brother, you home?

           Not a sound. The pair step into the living room. Anthony 
           takes the lead, signaling for Cosgrove to go right. Anthony 
           goes left.
           They search the front rooms, and meet by a closed door. 
           Cosgrove signals that he’ll open it. He readies himself, then 
           KICKS it open.

           An empty bedroom. He EXHALES with relief.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Clean.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And how.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROSS’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Cosgrove stands alone, staring at a framed photograph on a 
           side table.

           It’s a photo of ROSS and Cosgrove, standing in front of their 
           office door. They’re both smiling. The sign says “COSGROVE & 
           COS”, and Ross is painting the logo on the door.

           Ross is definitely younger, and very good-looking.

           Cosgrove smiles, almost a little wistful in his eyes... which 
           he hides when Anthony walks in with a glass of water.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I found this. You needed headache 
                        powder, yeah?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Brilliant.

           Anthony hands him the glass and a packet of headache powder, 
           which Cosgrove pours into his mouth dry and chases with 
           water.

           Anthony spots the photograph.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Nice photo. Ross paints, too?

                                 COSGROVE
                        The man does it all.

           Cosgrove CHUCKLES to himself.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        You know that baseball on my desk?
                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeah.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ross gave me that. You know what it 
                        is?

                                 ANTHONY
                        What?

                                 COSGROVE
                        One of my first games with the 
                        Browns.  Not my first pitch, or 
                        first strike out. It’s the first 
                        home run I gave up.

                                 ANTHONY
                             (disbelief)
                        It’s not.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Paul Easterling, Detroit Tigers, 
                        9th inning, April 18, 1928.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Why would he give you that?

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s what I said. He told me he 
                        was proud of me in success and 
                        failure. That was just one ball, 
                        and I had my whole career in front 
                        of me. He ran out and bought it off 
                        the kid who caught it.

           Beat.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Back when I thought I had my whole 
                        career in front of me.

           Thinking of it pains Cosgrove, and he walks away, shaking it 
           off. Anthony doesn’t prod.

                                 ANTHONY
                        So, what now?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let the detective detect.

           Cosgrove walks over to Ross’s home desk. It’s much messier 
           than his office desk, papers and pens and notes all over the 
           place.
           Cosgrove starts searching through it, as Anthony walks into 
           another room.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        This is all personal stuff.

                                 ANTHONY (O.S.)
                             (from kitchen)
                        Hey Coz. Take a look.

           Cosgrove gets up and walks into:

           INT. ROSS’S KITCHEN

           Anthony points to a single piece of paper on the counter.

                                 ANTHONY
                        You ain’t the only one that can 
                        ‘detect’.

           Cosgrove looks at it. At the top, it reads: “NOTES FOR J. 
           MORTIMER”.

                                 ANTHONY (CONT’D)
                        Mortimer. Isn’t that the fella we 
                        found up in the office?

                                 COSGROVE
                        The very same.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Was Ross working on something for 
                        the guy?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (annoyed)
                        If he was, he didn’t tell me.

           Cosgrove picks it up. It’s another list, but this one of 
           names of companies, about ten.  All but three are crossed 
           out:

           GRANTHAM INDUSTRIES 
           LITTLE PEACE INC. 
           ROBERTS & ROBERTS LTD.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Looks like he was narrowing it 
                        down.

           Cosgrove reads it over again. He grabs a nearby pen.
           CLOSE-UP DOCUMENT

           He circles the letters L, P, and I in “Little Peace Inc.”

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 COSGROVE
                        Little Peace Incorporated. That 
                        list I found in Mortimer’s office 
                        had the letters “L.P.I.” at the 
                        top.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coincidence.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ross tried to teach me there’s no 
                        such thing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE COFFEE POT - AFTERNOON

           Cosgrove and Anthony stand outside The Coffee Pot, Cosgrove 
           smoking. 

           Mirabelle’s Rolls pulls up, and she lets herself out of the 
           back.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Hello, William.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey angel.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Where did you telephone me from?

                                 COSGROVE
                        The Coffee Pot is a Meeting Point.

           She nods, and peeks in the front window at the pay phone in 
           the back. As usual, a group of people are standing around it, 
           waiting for it to ring.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Just about everybody’s phones were 
                        still kaput, except the big wigs 
                        like Mortimer. I guess all the 
                        switchboard girls got themselves... 
                        you know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        FDR set up Meeting Points, public 
                        places where the phones would work 
                        first, and published the list. At 
                        the start, people got scattered, 
                        fleeing every which way. Once the 
                        initial panic stopped, and they 
                        were trying to find each other 
                        again, you could just check the 
                        list and call the last known town 
                        your loved one was in.

           Through the glass, she sees the group react to the phone 
           ringing, answering, asking the group, and hanging up in 
           disappointment.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        So sad.

                                 COSGROVE
                        This here’s Anthony.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Ma’am.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Hello. Will, I brought that list 
                        you wanted.

           She takes the list out and hands it to Cosgrove. He glances 
           at the “L.P.I.” up top, then pockets it. He smiles at her.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You holding up?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I’m fine, thank you.

           Beat, an awkward silence. Cosgrove checks his pocket watch.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Spare a few minutes?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Sure.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Walk with me.

           He signals Anthony to wait, and Cosgrove and Mirabelle walk 
           down the street together.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THEATER ALLEYWAY - AFTERNOON

           The pair come upon an alley, sheltered from the low sunlight, 
           where someone is projecting an old horror movie onto the side 
           of a building, without the sound. A small crowd, including 
           some kids, watch, as a ragged MUSICIAN plays a three-stringed 
           guitar as ACCOMPANIMENT.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Oh, now this is nice.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I thought you’d like a little 
                        escape.

           They watch for a while. During the scary moments, the crowd 
           CHUCKLES or outright LAUGHS.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I remember this being a lot 
                        scarier.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Well, the horror pictures have 
                        become comedies, haven’t they?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        And the comedies have become sad.

           Beat. 

                                 COSGROVE
                        Remember, back before it got really 
                        bad, before we had an idea how bad 
                        it would get, the newspapers would 
                        run little stories about which 
                        movie star had gotten sick?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Ugh, I do.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Lillian Gish. Douglas Fairbanks. 
                        Clara Bow. Like that gossip was 
                        fun.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I wouldn’t have known Clara Bow if 
                        she jumped up and bit me.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s probably just what she 
                        would’ve done.
           Mirabelle LAUGHS.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Looking back, we shoulda known then 
                        we were doomed. 

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I don’t know. Look at these people.

           She looks over the faces of the people watching the film.

                                 MIRABELLE (CONT’D)
                        They’re smiling, aren’t they?

                                 COSGROVE
                        They know the ending already, 
                        that’s why they can smile.

           She looks at him; he’s frowning.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        What is it?

                                 COSGROVE
                        My brother is missing.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Didn’t you say to me it was a waste 
                        of time looking for a missing 
                        person?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I did.  Sorry.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        It’s okay.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Did John say anything? About Ross 
                        working for him?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        No. I just found your brother’s 
                        card in John’s study. Didn’t that 
                        give you an idea?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Nah, everyone has Ross’s card. He 
                        was the best. Is the best.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Will that list help you?
                                 COSGROVE
                        I hope so. It looks like your 
                        husband’s death and my brother’s 
                        disappearance are maybe part of 
                        something bigger.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        But what?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I don’t know. It was always Ross 
                        who figured that stuff out.

           She puts her hand on his shoulder, he smiles, eyes still on 
           the horror movie.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        You can do it.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I need my brother to find my 
                        brother.

           They stand there, watching the film together.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - DAY

           Cosgrove drives, Anthony sits shotgun.  They pull up in front 
           of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch building.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Gonna take out a want ad?

                                 COSGROVE
                        There’s a reporter in there that 
                        could probably help.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Probably?

                                 COSGROVE
                        If you haven’t noticed, I’m the 
                        kinda dick who relies on favors and 
                        bribes. This guy never played that 
                        way.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Oh, so it’s up to your charm? I’ll 
                        wait in the car then.

           Cosgrove smiles and gets out, Anthony follows.
           EXT. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH

           Posted near the front entrance is a giant board, with papers 
           tacked up under the headings “CLEANED” and “SEIZED”. A few 
           people read over them. One YOUNG MAN spots Cosgrove and runs 
           over.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Say mister, do you know when the 
                        700 block of...

                                 COSGROVE
                        Sorry, kid, we’re just visiting.

           The man frowns, walks away.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        The Dispatch wasn’t back up and 
                        running like a true newspaper, but 
                        it’s still where people turned for 
                        important matters.

           The pair enter the building.

           INT. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH LOBBY

           They cross the lobby and walk up the nearby stairs to the 
           second floor.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Whenever the Cleaners do a building 
                        or a block, the Dispatch posts it 
                        as Cleaned. Seized, too, as of the 
                        last month or so. You come back to 
                        the city and want to go home, you 
                        best check the lists first.

           INT. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH NEWSROOM 

           Cosgrove and Anthony walk into the mostly empty newsroom.  
           Among the few REPORTERS here and there, Cosgrove spots Danny 
           Reed on the phone and heads over.

           Danny sees him and frowns. Cosgrove just smiles.

           Nearby sits JAKE DEL RIO, tossing a baseball in the air.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey Del Rio, tell me, how do they 
                        keep a sports writer employed with 
                        no sports to cover?
                                 JAKE
                        I’m good with numbers, slick. ERA, 
                        RBI, monthly deaths.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Monthly deaths? So you are still 
                        covering sports.

                                 JAKE
                        Exactly.

           Jake tosses the baseball to Cosgrove.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Want me to sign it?

                                 JAKE
                        Oh sure. Then it’ll be worth 
                        bupkis.

           Cosgrove tosses it back as Danny hangs up.

                                 DANNY
                        The hell do you want?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (coy)
                        I saw you flirting with me at the 
                        Recovery Office. How could I 
                        resist?

                                 DANNY
                        Go screw.

           Cosgrove disregards this, takes the list out of his pocket.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I wonder if you couldn’t tell me...

                                 DANNY
                        Just because I’m pals with your 
                        brother doesn’t mean I’ll help you. 
                        You goddamned drunk.

                                 JAKE
                        Take it easy, Danny.

           Danny snatches the list from Cosgrove.

                                 DANNY
                        What is this, for a case?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Yeah.
                                 DANNY
                        Why would Ross send you to see me?

                                 COSGROVE
                        He wouldn’t.

                                 DANNY
                        Then where is he?

           Cosgrove just gives a solemn look, shrugs. Danny’s face 
           drops.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FILE ROOM - DAY

           Cosgrove stands among piles of old newspapers and files.  He 
           thumbs through a few old papers, with headlines like: 
           “MYSTERY FLU CAN’T BE STOPPED!”, “FDR NAMES Marcum RECOVERY 
           GOVERNOR”, and “STRANGE SICKNESS AMONG POOR, COLORED”.

           Danny appears with Cosgrove’s list.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Well?

                                 DANNY
                        All these addresses, save for two, 
                        have been Seized in the past two 
                        weeks and sold at auction.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Sold?

                                 DANNY
                        That’s part of the process. Seize a 
                        hopelessly overrun building, sell 
                        it, new owner rebuilds.

                                 COSGROVE
                        The Van Ness, too?

                                 DANNY
                        Nope, that one’s not on here. But 
                        here’s the other thing: the highest 
                        bids for each of these were from 
                        Little Peace, Incorporated.

                                 COSGROVE
                        “L.P.I.”

           Cosgrove starts to light a cigarette as he mulls it all over.
                                 DANNY
                        Coz, we’re standing in a room 
                        practically made of paper.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (puts lighter away)
                        Right, sorry.

           Danny leads Cosgrove out of the file room.

           INT. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH NEWSROOM

           Jake and Anthony toss Jake’s baseball back and forth.

                                 JAKE
                             (calling to Cosgrove)
                        I didn’t know you knew Anthony 
                        Jackson, of the St. Louis Stars!

                                 COSGROVE
                        I didn’t know you followed the 
                        Negro League.

                                 JAKE
                        Sports is sports, buddy.

           Danny sits at his desk. Cosgrove lights his cigarette, 
           signals Anthony to join him. Jake does as well.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Alright, Tony and I will check out 
                        the two remaining buildings on the 
                        list.  Danny, can you find out who 
                        owns L.P.I.?

                                 DANNY
                        Municipal records are still a low 
                        priority, but I’ll try.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Great. Jake?

           Cosgrove pulls out a fresh cigarette, tosses it to him.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Have a cigarette.

                                 JAKE
                        You’re a man among men, Coz!

           Cosgrove tips his hat to Jake. 
                                 COSGROVE
                        Those that are left, anyway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAYMORE BUILDING - DUSK

           Cosgrove and Anthony sit in the Packard, in an alley with a 
           view of the Raymore Office Building. The radio plays MUSIC, 
           softly.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        We flipped a coin - heads - and 
                        started with the Raymore Building 
                        on Locust Street. I used to love 
                        sitting on a house overnight, 
                        waiting for some husband dipping 
                        his wick to slip up. Ross let me do 
                        it all the time.

           The Sundown Warning’s “BEEP BEEP BEEP” comes through the 
           radio. Cosgrove turns it off. Night is coming.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Sitting in the dark didn’t have the 
                        same draw it used to.

                                 ANTHONY
                        This is crazy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey, even us pitchers gotta step up 
                        to bat.

           Cosgrove lights a cigarette and settles into his seat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAYMORE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Cosgrove and Anthony play some sort of card game across the 
           front seat, when they spot headlights approaching.

           They slump down as a Cleaner Car passes by, followed by a 
           Cleaner Cargo Truck. They pull up to the Raymore’s entrance 
           and park. About six or so Cleaners, armed with shotguns, get 
           out and enter the building.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Those are Cleaners!
                                 COSGROVE
                        You guys work at night?

                                 ANTHONY
                        No way, too dangerous.  We show up 
                        at the Recovery Office every 
                        morning to get our assignments, but 
                        nothing like this.

           A few Cleaners come back out and get into the Cargo Truck, 
           pull away. Cosgrove starts the car.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Looks like our stakeout has become 
                        a tail job.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Thank god. I’ve had enough of your 
                        cheating at cards.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey, an ace can be high or low.

           Cosgrove pulls away and follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Cosgrove tails the truck, his headlights off. Up ahead, the 
           truck’s headlights are off, too.

                                 COSGROVE
                        These guys are gonna hit something. 
                        Why would they drive with the 
                        headlights off?

                                 ANTHONY
                        You’re doing it, too.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I don’t want to be spotted.

                                 ANTHONY
                        There’s your answer, then.

           The truck turns one last corner and stops. Cosgrove stops 
           short, backs up, and the two of them get out.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           They creep up to the corner and peek around. 
                                 ANTHONY
                        The Hooverville!

           The truck is backed up to a wooden fence that surrounds the 
           immense maze of shanties, shacks and lean-tos that make up 
           St. Louis’s Hooverville, like the dense slums of Mumbai.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        One thing I love about this 
                        country. Even in the pain of the 
                        Depression, Americans were sons a’ 
                        bitches enough to name their shanty 
                        towns after ex-President Hoover.

           The Cleaners are SHOUTING and BANGING on the fence. From 
           somewhere inside, HOOD SCREAMS and WAILS rise up.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        St. Louis had the biggest 
                        Hooverville in the country. In this 
                        town, it’s where people first 
                        started to get sick. And, it would 
                        seem, where a lot of Hoods still 
                        remain.

           Hoods begin to run from the Hooverville through a corral of 
           sorts into the back of the Cargo Truck.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ever seen that before?

                                 ANTHONY
                        They’re herding them like cattle.

                                 COSGROVE
                        How much you wanna bet they’re 
                        taking them back to the Raymore 
                        Building?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAYMORE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Sure enough, Cosgrove and Anthony watch from the alley as the 
           Hoods are unloaded into the Raymore Building’s front doors. 
           Cosgrove sucks on a cigarette.

           The Cleaners finish up, securing the front doors and 
           plastering the Seized notice on the front. Cosgrove tosses 
           the butt.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I hate being right.
                                 ANTHONY
                        Really? I would have thought it’s 
                        pretty new to you.

           Cosgrove CHUCKLES at Anthony’s dig.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let’s go.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR - NIGHT

           The two drive along.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Where are you staying these days?

                                 ANTHONY
                        There’s a shelter, an old school, 
                        out in Clayton.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You better lay low for a while.  I 
                        know you’re not corrupt, but once 
                        this thing hits, I don’t want you 
                        to get lumped in with the Cleaners 
                        who are. 

                                 ANTHONY
                        They fired me, remember?

                                 COSGROVE
                        All the better.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m still trying to find Ross in 
                        all this.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE COFFEE POT - DAY

           Cosgrove sits at the end of the counter, smoking a cigarette, 
           fedora low over his eyes, watching the back pay phone.

           Maude walks over to him.
                                 MAUDE
                        You gonna have anything else?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let a man digest, Maude.

                                 MAUDE
                        Take your hat off when you’re 
                        inside, you damn ruffian.

           He politely sets his hat on the counter. The pay phone in the 
           bag RINGS, Telephone Man answers it.

                                 TELEPHONE MAN
                             (calling out)
                        William Cosgrove?!

           Cosgrove jumps up and heads to the back. Sam watches him with 
           disapproval.

                                 SAM
                        This ain’t your personal office 
                        line, Will!

           Cosgrove takes the phone from Telephone Man.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Thanks sport.
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

           INT. ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH NEWSROOM

           Danny sits on his desk, phone to his ear.

                                 DANNY
                        Hey, it’s me.

           INTERCUT

                                 COSGROVE
                        What do ya got?

                                 DANNY
                        The ownership certificate for 
                        Little Peace Inc isn’t on file 
                        there.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Goddammit.
                                 DANNY
                        That’s not a surprise. If something 
                        were to happen at the Records 
                        Office, you don’t want to lose the 
                        only proof of ownership, especially 
                        if what you own is worth so much. A 
                        lot of people would hold onto it.

                                 COSGROVE
                        So what now?

                                 DANNY
                        I did find the auction records for 
                        the Seizures. When the deeds were 
                        transferred a few days ago, someone 
                        from L.P.I. had to sign for them.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Who?

                                 DANNY
                        Douglas Wariman.

           Cosgrove’s eyes widen.

                                 COSGROVE
                        The bootlegger?

                                 DANNY
                        Friend of yours, no? If he’s the 
                        owner, then he’ll have that 
                        document on him somewhere.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Could you piece together a 
                        corruption charge with it?

                                 DANNY
                        Sure can’t without it.

           Beat, as Cosgrove thinks.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’ll go take a look.

                                 DANNY
                        He’ll have it somewhere secure. Be 
                        careful.  And Cosgrove?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Yeah?
                                 DANNY
                        Remember, you’re not going to 
                        Heaven for fun this time. Take it 
                        easy.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Go screw, buddy.

           Cosgrove hangs up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s quiet outside those steel doors.

           INT. HEAVEN SPEAKEASY

           Cosgrove sits alone at a table, nursing a small drink. A 
           WAITRESS comes by.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You want anything with that tonic 
                        water?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m fine, thanks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        You a cop or something?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Please.

           She leaves.  Cosgrove watches Addie sing on stage, and 
           Douglas entertaining some people at the bar, schmoozing big 
           time.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        The one time I needed him gone, 
                        Douglas seemed compelled to hang 
                        around Heaven.

           Cosgrove’s eyes light up; something’s occurred to him. He 
           looks at the Heaven “H”-with-wings logo on the wall.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to himself)
                        Little Peace.  Little Peace of 
                        “Heaven”, Incorporated. Clever 
                        bastard.
           He remains fixated on Douglas. Suddenly, Addie sits down next 
           to Cosgrove.

                                 ADDIE
                        Hey there, handsome.

           Cosgrove’s jaw is agape.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Addie. Hi.

                                 ADDIE
                        Buy a girl a drink?

           Cosgrove eagerly waves down the waitress and orders a drink.

                                 ADDIE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.  So, what’s your name?

           Cosgrove is about to answer, when Douglas jumps up on stage, 
           takes the microphone.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Good evening, everyone.  Some 
                        friends of mine have asked me to 
                        play a little something for you. 
                        And, ever your host, I have agreed.

           Light applause as Douglas sits at the piano. Cosgrove sees 
           his chance and gets up.

                                 ADDIE
                        Hey, where ya goin?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Shit. I’m sorry, I’d love to stay, 
                        really, but I can’t. Enjoy the 
                        drink.

           He walks to the back hallway. Checking that no one’s looking, 
           he darts around the corner.

           INT. HEAVEN HALLWAY

           There’s the door to Douglas’s office.  He tries the knob: 
           locked.  He starts picking the lock. Just as he unlocks it:

                                 ADDIE
                        Hey!

           He stands, startled. She gets right up in his face. He’s not 
           sure what to say, when she kisses him, hard, long. It’s all 
           he can do not to melt.
                                 ADDIE (CONT’D)
                        Come on back. I’m lonely.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (really wants more)
                        Jesus Christ, I... I can’t. I’ve 
                        got something to do.

                                 ADDIE
                        Breaking into Douglas’s office?

                                 COSGROVE
                             (feigning surprise)
                        I thought this was the can.

           She leans right up to his face again, lips almost touching.

                                 ADDIE
                             (seductive)
                        Hey. Forget about it, honey.

           She starts to kiss, but Cosgrove grabs her forearm quickly.

                                 ADDIE (CONT’D)
                        Easy on the rough stuff!

                                 COSGROVE
                        Did someone tell you to keep me 
                        busy?

                                 ADDIE
                        Douglas said you might need some 
                        company.

           Cosgrove opens Douglas’s office door and pulls her in after 
           him, slamming it shut.

           INT. DOUGLAS’S OFFICE

           He pulls her over to a file cabinet in the corner, pushes her 
           against the wall.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Stay there.

                                 ADDIE
                        Geez, what’s your problem?

           Cosgrove ignores her, starts searching through files.
           INT. HEAVEN SPEAKEASY

           Douglas plays the piano, a great jazzy piece.

           INT. DOUGLAS’S OFFICE

           Cosgrove finds a folder, opens it.  He looks over the 
           documents inside.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        An inventory list of next month’s 
                        Central Region Rationing Shipment. 
                        Douglas had circled corn, rye, 
                        yeast. All the stuff he needed to 
                        keep Heaven’s juices flowing.

           He smiles.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to himself)
                        Something else you’re stealing, 
                        Douglas?

                                 ADDIE
                        What?

           Cosgrove SHUSHES at her.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Just stand there, looking pretty.

           Cosgrove puts that aside and keeps thumbing through files.  
           He finds one marked “L.P.I.” and opens it.  Empty.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.

                                 ADDIE
                        It’s about time.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What did I just tell you?

           But she’s not talking to him.

                                 DOUGLAS (O.S.)
                        You’re the second Cosgrove I’ve 
                        caught snooping around in here.

           Cosgrove turns. There’s Douglas, gun in hand, smiling at him. 
           Cosgrove stands up, still holding the folder.
                                 COSGROVE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Your pest of a little brother. He 
                        was in here just a few days ago, 
                        looking for the same thing.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What did you do to him?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Same thing we did to that Good Ol’ 
                        Boy Mortimer. We introduced him to 
                        the Hooverville Dead.

           This hits Cosgrove like a freight train. Douglas loves it.

           Long beat. Cosgrove struggles to speak.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Once they find out what you’re 
                        doing, they’re gonna have your ass.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Really?

           Douglas gives a look, like ‘you can’t be that dumb’. Cosgrove 
           holds up the folder.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Where’s the L.P.I. document?

                                 DOUGLAS
                        It’s not even my name that’s on it. 
                        I just...

           Douglas looks at the folder, instantly puzzled.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        It’s not there?

           Cosgrove notices, holds it open.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Where is it?

           Douglas thinks, then it comes to him.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Your goddamned sticky fingered 
                        brother!  I swear to - 

           GUNSHOTS from somewhere in the bar. 
           INT. HEAVEN SPEAKEASY

           The whole room has fallen quiet, all eyes on the velvet 
           entrance curtains: “what was that?” A PATRON slowly steps 
           toward the curtains to investigate the noise. As he parts 
           them to peek - 

           A dozen Hoods fly into the speakeasy, attacking the Patron 
           and everyone else.

           CHAOS.

           - A HOOD IN OVERALLS rushes the stage. The MUSICIANS try to 
           fight it off with their instruments, but the weak brass of 
           the trumpet and trombone just collapses, and it pounces them. 
           ANOTHER HOOD leaps on the piano, feet playing dissonant 
           chords as it attacks the PIANIST.

           - A NURSE HOOD, uniform still eerily stark white, makes a 
           sprint for the bar, leaping over it at full speed and tacking 
           the Bartender, smashing countless liquor bottles.  The mirror 
           behind the bar lets us watch it shred the bartender apart on 
           the floor, the nurse’s whites turning crimson with blood.

           - A YOUNG GIRL HOOD - she couldn’t have been more than eight 
           when she turned - is threatening a WEASELY MAN. He hits 
           it/her again and again. From across the room, a MALE HOOD 
           almost seems to come to the Young Girl Hood’s rescue.  It 
           grabs the Weasely Man’s arm and rips it off, takes him to the 
           ground. The Young Girl Hood joins in.

           - A fallen cigarette ignites the liquor spilled on the bar, 
           flames erupting up. 

           - The microphone on the stage is knocked to the floor, right 
           next to a PRIEST HOOD tearing into a WOMAN. Her SCREAMS and 
           its SNARLING broadcast loud and clear through Heaven’s 
           speakers.

           - A BURNING HOOD, flames consuming it, sprints across the 
           room and, unable to see, slams hard into a wall. It gets up 
           and tries again, and again.

           INT. HEAVEN HALLWAY

           Douglas steps out to see the carnage. Patrons screaming, 
           Hoods everywhere, bar alight. He’s furious.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        No!
           A Hood spots him and runs right at him. Douglas FIRES his 
           pistol many times, but none find the head. It tackles him to 
           the floor.

           INT. DOUGLAS’S OFFICE

           Addie SCREAMS as she and Cosgrove watch the Hood tear into 
           Douglas’s neck. 

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to Addie)
                        Where’s the back exit?

                                 ADDIE
                        What?

                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s a speakeasy, I know it has 
                        another way out!

                                 ADDIE
                        To the right!

           He starts for the door, his gun drawn. 

                                 ADDIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave me here!

           She runs after him.

           INT. HEAVEN HALLWAY

           The Hood still wrestles with Douglas, until a HEADSHOT from 
           Cosgrove. It falls to the side, dead.  Cosgrove stands over a 
           bleeding Douglas.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Proper Dead, Doug.

           Cosgrove steps over him and runs to the back. Addie appears, 
           disgusted at Douglas’s body, and follows.  

           A small EXPLOSION from the bar. 

           Douglas, weak, bleeding, slowly brings his pistol up to his 
           head. 

           He pulls the trigger. CLICK. Empty.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. WAREHOUSE BACK DOOR

           The door flies open. Cosgrove runs out, Addie right behind 
           him.  His car is parked nearby, among many others.  He looks 
           to the front entrance and sees a Cleaner Cargo Truck pulling 
           away from the doors.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Come on!

           They run to Cosgrove’s Packard and jump in. He tears off 
           after it, as a few terrified Patrons stumble out of Heaven’s 
           front steel doors.

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR

           Cosgrove floors it, following the Cleaner Truck at top speed.

                                 ADDIE
                        Why aren’t they stopping to help?!

                                 COSGROVE
                        Because they brought the Hoods 
                        here! Switch with me.

                                 ADDIE
                        What?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Take the wheel!

           Cosgrove pulls Addie over to him, and they awkwardly switch 
           places. She’s clearly not comfortable behind the wheel.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (pointing at Cleaners)
                        Floor it!

           EXT. COSGROVE’S CAR

           Cosgrove opens the passenger door and gets out on the running 
           board. He aims his pistol over the car’s roof at the Cleaner 
           Truck and FIRES. Miss. 

           Cosgrove bends his head into the window.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Get alongside it!

           Addie floors it, and they get closer to the Truck. Up ahead, 
           a Hood in the street. The Cleaner Truck’s cow catcher sends 
           it flying up and to the side, right at Cosgrove’s car.
           Addie SCREAMS as the Hood crashes into the windshield and 
           bounces up over the roof, almost taking Cosgrove with it. The 
           car swerves a bit.

           She pulls close to the passenger side of the Truck. Cosgrove 
           fires over the top of his car. The PASSENGER CLEANER ducks, 
           then points his Cleaner Shotgun at Cosgrove.

           Cosgrove ducks the blast, his only free hand holding on to 
           the door handle. Addie swerves again, the force keeping 
           Cosgrove’s body hanging way out over the road. Up ahead, a 
           Hood runs to them. Cosgrove pulls himself up just before he 
           would’ve clipped it with his head.

           Addie starts to slow down. Cosgrove leans in.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?!

                                 ADDIE
                        I can’t do this! I can’t!

           Cosgrove notices a severed leg in the passenger seat, left 
           there by the windshield-crashing Hood. He picks it up and 
           throws it out.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Drive! Drive!

           She reluctantly floors it as Cosgrove stands back up on the 
           running board. Just as he looks over at the Cleaner Truck, he 
           can see the Passenger Cleaner smiling at him.

           The Cleaner Truck slows a bit until they’re right along 
           Addie’s side. Cosgrove points his pistol at the Passenger’s 
           face, but then the Cleaner truck swerves and BUMPS them. 
           Addie SCREAMS. 

           Cosgrove almost falls off, but recovers. He stands back up, a 
           victorious smile on his face. But the Passenger’s not looking 
           at him, he’s looking ahead and pointing. Cosgrove looks, too.

           A group of THREE HOODS, standing in the street. Cosgrove’s 
           eyes widen: the Cleaner Truck is going to bump his car right 
           into them.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Addie, stop the...

           Too late. Another sideswipe from the Truck bumps the car onto 
           a collision course with the Hoods. Without a cow catcher, the 
           Packard suffers the full brunt of the Hoods’ weight.
           CRASH. Cosgrove goes flying off the running board and into 
           the street, his pistol sliding away. The car comes to a hard 
           stop, the engine cutting out. The Cleaner Truck gets away.

           INT. COSGROVE’S CAR

           Addie recovers, her forehead bleeding from a cut. Stuck on 
           the grill of the car is a single Hood, clearly not pleased 
           with being hit. The other two have been thrown, limbs broken, 
           crawling around. 

           The grill Hood looks at her, SNARLING. Something grabs Addie 
           from the driver’s window and she SCREAMS. It’s Cosgrove.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (getting in)
                        Move over, dammit.

           He shoves her over, starts the car. The grill Hood starts to 
           crawl toward them, but Cosgrove hits reverse and it falls 
           off. He spins the car around and speeds off.

           Silence, as Addie whimpers.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Where do ya live, I’ll drop you 
                        off.

           She just weakly points straight ahead. He drives on.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you learn to drive, huh? 
                        The Conservatory of Music?

           EXT. CITY STREET

           They drive on down the street.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE COFFEE POT - DAY

           Cosgrove sits, his hat on the counter next to him. A plate of 
           uneaten food in front of him. Maude comes by to top off his 
           coffee, but it’s still full.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        My brother was dead. And all 
                        because he was the “good one”. John 
                        Mortimer needed help, and Ross was 
                        the one to do it. Not me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COSGROVE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And he was killed, not me. He was 
                        dead because he was great, and I 
                        was alive because I was shit.

           A LADY hangs up the pay phone in the back. 

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        I thought Douglas was behind it 
                        all. Maybe Mortimer and Ross 
                        thought so, too. It was easy, 
                        Douglas was a bad guy. But once 
                        Ross got his hands on that 
                        document, and saw the name of the 
                        real owner of Little Peace, he 
                        must’ve realized even he might be 
                        in over his head.

           In the back, the phone rings again. The Lady answers.

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        I still needed that document to 
                        prove it.

                                 PHONE LADY
                        William Cosgrove?

           Cosgrove looks up. 

                                 COSGROVE (V.O.)
                        Someone else needed it, too.

           Cosgrove stands and walks to the back. Sam frowns at him.

                                 SAM
                        Dammit, Will, what did I tell you?

           Cosgrove just raises his hands innocently as he takes the 
           phone from the lady.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (on phone)
                        Hello?

                                 MARCUM (O.S.)
                             (phone)
                        Hello Mr. Cosgrove.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey there, Guv. I’ve been waiting 
                        for you to call.

                                 MARCUM
                        I think you have something I want.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Is that so? Maybe I like the way it 
                        looks framed on my wall.

                                 MARCUM
                        Your reputation precedes you, 
                        Cosgrove. I thought you might like 
                        to play.

           The sound of the phone SHUFFLING, then:

                                 MIRABELLE
                             (on phone)
                        Will?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Mirabelle?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I’m okay.

           HEAR Marcum take the phone back.

                                 MARCUM
                        Isn’t that fun?

                                 COSGROVE
                        What are you doing with Mirabelle?

                                 MARCUM
                        It’s only fair that I have 
                        something you want, too.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I barely even know her.

                                 MARCUM
                        Oh, come now. One doesn’t take just 
                        anyone to the movies.

                                 COSGROVE
                        You really have every Cleaner in 
                        the city as your eyes and ears, 
                        huh? And fire the ones who don’t 
                        play along. Why are you doing this?

                                 MARCUM
                        Why? Look around you, Cosgrove. 
                        That phone’s a Meeting Point, so 
                        I’m sure there are quite a few 
                        people standing there.  Look at 
                        them.
           Cosgrove glances around at the Phone Lady and the others 
           standing nearby. They’re watching him. One MAN even smiles, 
           hopeful.

                                 MARCUM (CONT’D)
                        They’re desperate for good news, 
                        desperate for any glimmer of hope.  
                        They’ll do anything for it. They’d 
                        pay for it if they had the money. 
                        Because they’re afraid, and they’ll 
                        do anything not to be.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And you have the power to help 
                        them.

                                 MARCUM
                        I have the power for a lot of 
                        things, and that’s exactly the 
                        point, my friend. The Lord saw to 
                        it to put me here, it’s my duty to 
                        exercise the full reach of my power 
                        to do his Work. The only wrong path 
                        is to not continue.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Killing people?

                                 MARCUM
                        Millions died already to put me in 
                        this blessed position. Every 
                        Seizure is a victory. Every action 
                        I’ve taken is one step closer to 
                        His plan. And mine.

                                 COSGROVE
                        And the buildings you’re stealing?

           A beat, Cosgrove can almost hear Marcum smiling.

                                 MARCUM
                        If He wants me to get rich in the 
                        process, I’m not one to question.

           Cosgrove shakes his head. Beat.

                                 MARCUM (CONT’D)
                        I need that document.

           Cosgrove thinks.

                                 MARCUM (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Cosgrove?
                                 COSGROVE
                        Alright, where you want to meet?

                                 MARCUM
                        My office, after dark.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Feeling romantic, huh? I’ll see you 
                        there.

           Cosgrove hangs up, walks back over to the counter. 

                                 SAM
                        Who was it, then?

           Cosgrove still just thinks.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Will?

           Finally, Cosgrove grabs his hat and starts out the door.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Either the end of a tragedy, or the 
                        beginning of a hero’s tale.

           And he’s gone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DUSK

           Cosgrove walks into the public school building that is now 
           being used as a shelter.  It’s a sight to see: scores of 
           families, all poor, mostly black, living and sleeping side by 
           side, filling the room like evacuees.

           Cosgrove scans the crowd, spots Anthony. He waves him over.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hey shamus.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Jesus, this is where you live?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Ah, it ain’t so bad.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Ain’t so bad?! Where’d you live 
                        before Christmas?

                                 ANTHONY
                        The Hooverville.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Oh. Shit.

           Cosgrove takes in the sight again, looking at all the people.

                                 ANTHONY
                        So what’s up?

                                 COSGROVE
                        I need your help. Again.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’m flattered. And wary.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECOVERY BUILDING ATRIUM - NIGHT

           Cosgrove and Anthony enter the building to find two Cleaners 
           waiting to frisk them. Then they lead them to the elevators.

           INT. ELEVATOR

           Our heroes stand, flanked by the two Cleaners.  Awkward 
           silence as they ride up. Finally:

                                 COSGROVE
                        Lovely night, huh?

                                 ANTHONY
                        The best. Not too humid.

                                 CLEANER ONE
                        Shut-up.

           INT. MARCUM’S OFFICE

           Cosgrove and Anthony are led into the large office of 
           Governor Marcum. A enormous picture window overlooks the 
           entire city.  Marcum leans on his desk, smiling, surrounded 
           by FOUR MORE CLEANERS.

                                 MARCUM
                        Welcome.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Where’s Mirabelle?

                                 MARCUM
                        One thing at a time.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Fair enough. How about this: when 
                        you gonna rebuild Heaven? This is 
                        thirsty work.

                                 MARCUM
                        Where’s the document?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Tell me, was Douglas compensated by 
                        having his pick at the Ration 
                        Shipments we get every month? 
                        Smuggling Rations to support a 
                        bootlegger doesn’t make for nice 
                        headlines. Especially for a “God-
                        fearing” politician.

                                 MARCUM
                        Mr. Cosgrove, it seems you’ve found 
                        yourself standing at home plate 
                        thinking you’ve hit a home run, 
                        when the truth is you haven’t even 
                        swung the bat yet. If the city’s 
                        best businessman, savviest 
                        gangster, and smartest detective 
                        couldn’t stop me, what hope does a 
                        drunk ex-ballplayer have?

           Marcum draws a pistol, points it at Anthony.

                                 MARCUM (CONT’D)
                        Where is it, or I shoot your nigger 
                        friend.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hey, I’m a voter.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Easy, Marcum. That whole “whites 
                        and coloreds” thing has gotten a 
                        bit stale, what with this whole new 
                        category running about.

           Marcum SHOOTS Anthony in the arm.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, alright! Jesus Christ, I 
                        don’t have it!
                                 MARCUM
                        The hell you don’t. My men saw you 
                        speeding away from Heaven last 
                        night.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I should think so, I made a point 
                        for them to see me. But I didn’t 
                        swipe it. My brother did, the night 
                        you guys killed him.

           Marcum’s eyes go wide.

                                 MARCUM
                        What?

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s right.  Ross has it on him.

                                 MARCUM
                             (to Cleaners)
                        Where did you take the detective?

                                 CLEANER TWO
                        To the Hooverville, boss. Like you 
                        said.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s a predicament.

           Marcum thinks, then stands up.

                                 MARCUM
                        Grab him.  The nigger, too.  Let’s 
                        go.

           Marcum strides out as the Cleaners grab Cosgrove and Anthony 
           and follow.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RECOVERY BUILDING - NIGHT

           The group stride out a side door toward multiple Cleaner 
           Cars. Cosgrove spots a Cleaner escorting Mirabelle to one of 
           the cars.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey there, angel. Alright?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Starring in my own comedy.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Can’t wait to see how it ends.

           He smiles at her as he and Anthony are shoved into the back 
           of another car. The whole convoy pulls away.

           EXT. STREETS

           The three-car convoy winds through the streets.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           They pull up to the outer fence and stop.  Marcum gets out, 
           the Cleaners push Cosgrove and Anthony out as well.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What is this?

                                 MARCUM
                        You’re going to go get it for me.

                                 COSGROVE
                        In there? At night? You’re insane.

                                 MARCUM
                        No, I’m just impatient. And I want 
                        what’s mine.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What if we can’t find it? What 
                        if...

                                 MARCUM
                        Then you can take it up with God.

           The Cleaners push Cosgrove and the wounded Anthony forward.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Alright, but not Tony. He’s hurt.

                                 MARCUM
                        That’s your fault.

                                 ANTHONY
                        I’ll be alright, Coz.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Can we at least get some weapons?

                                 MARCUM
                        No. My Cleaners will go with you.
           The Cleaners don’t like that.

                                 CLEANER ONE
                        Hey, boss, you serious?

                                 MARCUM
                        Go! NOW!

           Reluctantly, the Cleaners grab shotguns and Tommy Guns and 
           walk toward the fence. One of them unlocks a chain, where 
           they corralled Hoods from before, and slowly opens a gate, 
           peeking in.  Nothing in sight. 

           Cosgrove turns back to see Marcum standing by the car with 
           Mirabelle. She looks at him grimly through the back window.

                                 MARCUM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I’ll stay with her. 
                        She’ll be here if you get back.

           Cosgrove looks right at Mirabelle.

                                 COSGROVE
                        When I get back.

           She forces a smile back to him. He turns and walks into the 
           Hooverville, followed by Anthony and the five Cleaners, 
           closing and chaining it behind them.

           INT. HOOVERVILLE  

           A somewhat open clearing, beyond which lies countless shacks, 
           with narrow corridors between them leading off into the maze 
           of the slum.

           Anthony favors his wounded arm.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Tony, you sure you’re alright?

                                 ANTHONY
                        “A touch, a touch, I do confess.”

                                 COSGROVE
                        Okay, stop showing off.

           He turns to the Cleaners.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, which one of you brought 
                        him here?
                                 CLEANER ONE
                        What does that matter?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Because, I want to know what he was 
                        wearing. Was he injured, shot in 
                        the leg or something? You know, 
                        things that will help us find him 
                        in here.

                                 CLEANER THREE
                        I brought him.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Come here.

           Cleaner Three steps forward. Cosgrove punches him in the 
           face, hard. The other Cleaners raise their guns on him. 

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Now that’s out of the way, 
                        continue.

                                 CLEANER THREE
                             (recovering)
                        I don’t remember. A suit or 
                        something. We just shoved him in.

           Cosgrove looks around. Eerie, but no Hoods in sight. Yet.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Tony?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Look, don’t use the guns. One shot 
                        will alert the whole population in 
                        here to our presence. If you have 
                        to kill a Hood, try to bash the 
                        skull. Remember, Proper Dead.

           Cosgrove finds some blunt metal rods nearby, amongst the 
           slum’s junk. He hands one to Anthony.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let’s go.

           They walk into one corridor.
           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PASSAGEWAY

           Cosgrove checks inside a few shacks: empty. He opens the door 
           to another to find a FEMALE HOOD, wearing a once gorgeous and 
           expensive dress, its back to him. He quietly closes that 
           door.

           At one point, an ARMLESS HOOD crosses their path ahead. They 
           all freeze, watching it pass. Cosgrove shakes his head - 
           “it’s not Ross” - and they continue on.

           Cosgrove walks past another shack, and suddenly not two feet 
           beside him is a FAT MALE HOOD. It opens its mouth for him, 
           but Cosgrove hits it with the end of his pipe, impaling it in 
           the face. It falls, twisting the pipe out of Cosgrove’s hand 
           as it does. Cosgrove pulls it back out.

                                 CLEANER TWO
                             (whispering)
                        I can’t do this.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Shhhhh.

                                 CLEANER TWO
                             (getting louder)
                        No, I can’t do this.  I can’t do 
                        this, I need to leave.

           He waves his Tommy Gun about, freaking out. Cosgrove keeps 
           trying to quiet him, grabs him. 

                                 CLEANER TWO (CONT’D)
                             (shouting)
                        Let go of me!

           From off, a more casual HOOD GROAN startles Cleaner Two, and 
           he FIRES the Tommy Gun wildly in that direction.

           Silence.  Then, from all around, countless SCREAMS rise up. 
           The Hooverville has awoken.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (grabbing the panicky 
                              Cleaner)
                        Now you’ve done it!

           Cleaner Two doesn’t care, drops his Tommy Gun and runs off 
           into the night. Cosgrove picks the gun up, the other Cleaners 
           react.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Easy, fellas. It’s every man for 
                        himself now.
           A Cleaner in the back of the group is suddenly side-tackled 
           by a PAIR OF HOODS, out of nowhere.  Instantly, the group 
           runs every which way. Anthony follows Cosgrove.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE CORRIDOR

           Cosgrove and Anthony run between the shacks.  Cosgrove shoots 
           a few Hoods with the Tommy Gun when needed.  Anthony, with 
           his one good arm, still manages to whack one or two with his 
           iron rod. They duck into a lean-to and close the door.

           INT. LEAN-TO

                                 COSGROVE
                        Tony, you lived here, right?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Yeah.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ross knew this Hooverville. He knew 
                        everything, he was good like that. 
                        Where would he go?? 

           Anthony thinks.

                                 ANTHONY
                        There’s a clearing, about a hundred 
                        yards that way. The “Central 
                        Square”, if you could call it that. 
                        That’s where I’d go.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Lead the way.

                                 ANTHONY
                        What if he went Hood?

           Cosgrove frowns.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Even if he got bit, he’d have time 
                        to secure himself inside somewhere. 
                        He wants to be found.

           They peek out the door, and slowly slip out when it’s clear.

           INT. HOOVERVILLE

           From off, HEAR a GUNSHOT or two, and the FAINT CRY of one of 
           the Cleaners. 
           Cosgrove and Anthony avoid a few Hoods running to the source 
           of the shots, and slowly weave their way along the maze of 
           corridors.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE CLEARING

           They reach the clearing, a courtyard of sorts. Shacks along 
           the perimeter. Anthony points to one in particular, with a 
           tall spire on top of it.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coz, look.

           Cosgrove looks over: the Cosgrove & Cosgrove logo has been 
           drawn on the door, in blood.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ross.

           They look around - it’s clear for now. The two men sprint 
           over to the door. Cosgrove listens, hearing LABORED BREATHING 
           inside.

           He checks the door. It’s latched, but a makeshift doorknob 
           allows him entry. He pushes it open carefully.

           INT. SHACK

           Facing into the far corner of the tiny one-room shack is a 
           figure in a tattered and torn suit. Cosgrove’s breath leaves 
           him for a moment as he steps in, quietly, gun at his side.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (quietly)
                        R-Ross?

           Nothing. The Hood just stands there, BREATHING.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (a bit louder)
                        Ross?

           It perks up, head raises. Slowly it turns to face Cosgrove.

           It’s Ross. We’ve only seen a picture, but it’s unmistakably 
           him, though battered, bloody; a Hood, through and through. A 
           bite mark on his neck, rotting over. That vacant look in his 
           eyes.

           When Cosgrove sees him, his eyes tear up. The Ross/Hood does 
           not move, just stands there, looking at him.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Ross. It’s me.

           Still it stands there, BREATHING RAPIDLY. 

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s me. William.

           Cosgrove takes a step forward.

                                 ANTHONY
                             (warning)
                        Hey, careful.

                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s okay. Ross, you’d be so proud 
                        of me. I did it. I found you.

           The Ross Hood takes a sidestep.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        I found you, brother. Maybe I ain’t 
                        so bad at this after all.

           A long beat, as they stare at each other. Maybe it’s not so 
           bad. Cosgrove smiles.

           Suddenly, Ross lets out a terrifying SCREAM and begins to 
           charge.  Cosgrove FIRES the Tommy Gun, just a quick burst, 
           and Ross falls dead.

           This is almost too much for Cosgrove to bear, and he turns 
           away, shaking with grief. Anthony lets him have a moment, but 
           steps in and closes the shack door behind him.

           Beat.

           Anthony goes over to the body, reaches out.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Don’t touch him!

           Anthony is startled.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry. I didn’t mean... 

                                 ANTHONY
                        It’s okay.

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’ll do it.
           Anthony steps back. Cosgrove kneels down next to the body. 
           His aim was true, only a bullet hole or two in the top of 
           Ross’s head; his face is still, for the most part, all Ross.

           Cosgrove takes a final moment to look at his brother, then 
           searches the pockets of Ross’s ragged suit. He finds the 
           document, gives it a quick look and pockets it.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (to Ross’s body)
                        You were always so good at that 
                        sleight of hand. Clever bastard.

           He smiles, takes his fedora off and places it over Ross’s 
           face. He looks around the shack. There’s a window, made of 
           colored bits of glass: beer and Coke bottle shards.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (to Anthony)
                        What is this place?

                                 ANTHONY
                        This was our church.

           Cosgrove stands, nodding. He looks down at Ross’s body, face 
           covered in his fedora.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What was that flowery “I do 
                        confess” shit?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Shakespeare. Hamlet.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Anything appropriate for this?

           Anthony thinks.

                                 ANTHONY
                        “Good night, sweet prince. And 
                        flights of angels, sing thee to thy 
                        rest.”

                                 COSGROVE
                        Not bad.

           He smiles, then it hits him.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        “Angels”. Mirabelle! We gotta go!

           Cosgrove turns as Anthony peeks out the door: a Hood or two 
           wandering the clearing.
                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        How is it?

                                 ANTHONY
                        Two or three, so far. More will be 
                        coming, the ones that heard your 
                        gunshots.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Let’s go then.

           They burst out of the shack.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE CLEARING

           They run out, away from the few Hoods wandering about. But 
           Hoods are coming out of practically every corridor 
           surrounding the clearing. Cosgrove tries to SHOOT a few, but 
           there are too many.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coz! The roofs! There!

           Anthony darts toward a low-hanging shack, and leaps up, 
           pulling himself up onto the tin roof, despite the pain in his 
           arm. Cosgrove follows, tossing the Tommy Gun up to him and 
           jumping up in one smooth move. 

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE ROOFS

           Now above the fray, they can see the expanse of the maze. 
           Cosgrove can just see Marcum standing on the outside of the 
           perimeter, by the cluster of Cleaner Cars.

           HOODS gather below them, SCREAMING up at them.

                                 COSGROVE
                             (to Anthony)
                        Good idea.

           Off, they can see Cleaner One standing on a roof, too. They 
           wave to get his attention, then point towards Marcum. The 
           Cleaner acknowledges and starts leaping the rooftops. Anthony 
           and Cosgrove do the same.

           They leap gaps between shacks, sprinting across the top of 
           the Hooverville.

           Nearby, a fallen shack provides a ramp of sorts to the roof, 
           and two Hoods happen upon it and up on the roofs with them.
                                 ANTHONY
                        Watch it! To the left!

           Cosgrove fires the Tommy Gun, getting one, missing the other.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Forget it, just run!

           They run, leaping across a wide gap between shacks.  The Hood 
           behind them doesn’t leap, falling and slamming into the next 
           shack, the tin roof edge slicing it in half. The top half 
           continues pulling itself along the roof with its arms.

           More and more Hoods below notice our heroes running above, 
           and follow through the weaving passageways below. Cleaner One 
           is close to meeting up with them.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                             (to Cleaner One)
                        Come on!

           Cleaner One jumps across a gap, but the flimsy tin roof gives 
           way and he falls through with a CRASH.

           Hear his SCREAMS as he’s pounced on.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Christ. Maybe let’s watch our step?

                                 ANTHONY
                        I think so. Keep to the edges. 
                        Carefully.

           They continue on. Nearing the perimeter fence, Cosgrove calls 
           out.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Marcum!

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           Marcum hears them first, then sees them approaching on the 
           roofs.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Marcum, get ready!

           Marcum grabs his own Tommy Gun and approaches the fence.
           EXT. HOOVERVILLE ROOFS

           Cosgrove and Anthony near the last shack. A huge gap between 
           them and the fence means they’ll have to jump down and run 
           the final distance. They stop, eyeing Marcum just beyond.

                                 MARCUM
                        Did you find it?!

                                 COSGROVE
                             (showing it)
                        Right here.

                                 MARCUM
                        Give it to me!

           From behind them, the Hoods are catching up, their SCREAMS 
           getting louder.

                                 COSGROVE
                        What, you want I should make a 
                        paper airplane out of it? Let us 
                        out of here, first.

                                 MARCUM
                        Give it to me now!

           INT. CLEANER CAR

           Mirabelle watches the stand-off from the back of the car.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE

           Cosgrove puts the document away.

                                 MARCUM
                        Goddamit, Cosgrove!

                                 COSGROVE
                        I’m not stupid, Marcum. I give it 
                        to you and you’ll...

           Marcum loses his patience and fires his Tommy Gun at them. 
           They fall to the ground to avoid it, behind the fence.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           Marcum, filled with rage, begins SHOOTING the Tommy Gun 
           through the wooden fence, over and over again.
                                 MARCUM
                             (screaming)
                        I’ll kill you, Cosgrove! And I’ll 
                        take it from you!

           INT. HOOVERVILLE

           Cosgrove and Anthony lie flat on the ground, bullets hitting 
           everywhere around them.  By the time Marcum runs out of ammo, 
           the section of fence is swiss cheese, with huge splintered 
           holes.

           Cosgrove and Anthony huddle against the wall of the last 
           shack.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           Marcum tosses his empty machine gun aside and pulls his 
           pistol. He walks over to the large shredded hole in the fence 
           and peers in. He sees the two men.

                                 MARCUM
                             (angrily calm)
                        Give me. What is mine.

           He points the pistol at them, but then he looks past them: 
           the swarm of Hoods have finally broken through to the source 
           of all this noise. SCORES OF THEM pour out of the nearby 
           corridors, and all they see is Marcum.

           Marcum FIRES at them, but it’s pathetically useless. They 
           just keep coming.

           He turns and runs, toward the cars, when the first of the 
           Hoods hits the splintered fence hard: they SMASH through, 
           tearing off flesh and limbs but powering on toward him.

           INT. HOOVERVILLE

           Cosgrove and Anthony don’t move, pressed up against the 
           shack, as the stampede of Hoods swarm past them, all heading 
           for Marcum.

           INT. CLEANER CAR

           Mirabelle sees Marcum running toward her, and the swarm of 
           Hoods behind him.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Oh my god.
           She crawls into the front seat and starts the car.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           As Mirabelle takes off with a jolt, Marcum SCREAMS at her.

                                 MARCUM
                        Stop stop, you bitch!

           She drives away, and Marcum makes for another Cleaner Car. 
           The Hoods are hot on his tail.  He dives into the driver’s 
           seat and closes the door just as a FLAPPER HOOD hits it hard, 
           shattering the glass.

           INT. MARCUM’S CAR

           Marcum wrestles with it/her as more and more HOODS slam into 
           it. The car rocks with their impacts. Marcum’s flailing elbow 
           hits the gear shift, knocking it into Neutral, and it starts 
           to roll backwards.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           Marcum’s car picks up speed, rolling down the inclined street 
           toward a nearby building.  The Hoods chase after it, jumping 
           onto it and smashing the windows.

           INT. MARCUM’S CAR

           They’re crawling in after him, through the broken windows. 
           Shards tearing their flesh off, but it doesn’t stop them. 
           They want him. 

           Countless Hoods - white/black, old/young, tall/short. They 
           all claw at Marcum, tearing into him.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE PERIMETER

           The car, now so covered with Hoods it’s barely recognizable, 
           rolls toward the storefront of a nearby building, faster and 
           faster.  It CRASHES through the glass and comes to rest 
           inside. More Hoods sprint in after it. HEAR Marcum SCREAMS.

           The old sign above the now-infested store reads: “EMPLOYMENT 
           OFFICE. WHITES AND COLOREDS WELCOME.”

           A pre-Black Christmas Depression poster still hangs on the 
           remains of the front window: “WE CAN DO IT TOGETHER!”
           We hear Marcum no more.

           EXT. HOOVERVILLE

           Cosgrove and Anthony sit up as the wave of Hoods ceases. They 
           can hear them CRASHING about the store/car.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That didn’t sound good.

           Anthony notes the now-giant hole in the fence, and all the 
           Hoods beyond it.

                                 ANTHONY
                        And that’s why we never shoot 
                        through the door.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Good thinking. What now?

           Before Anthony can answer, sudden headlights through the 
           slats in the fence, and a CRASH as Mirabelle drives the 
           Cleaner Car through, coming to a stop. She smiles at Cosgrove 
           as he stands.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Now I see why you have a chauffeur.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Be smart with me later, let’s go.

           They jump into the car, and Mirabelle tears off, the cow 
           catcher grill of the Cleaner Car tearing away more fence and 
           a few Hoods.

           INT. CLEANER CAR

           They glance at the storefront, overflowing with Hoods, as 
           they drive past. Anthony smiles, satisfied. Cosgrove just 
           turns to look out his window at the city solemnly.  

           Mirabelle takes one hand off the wheel and puts it on his. He 
           takes it, but keeps staring out his window.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. ST. LOUIS CITYSCAPE - MORNING

           The sun rises on a new day. The sound of RADIO STATIC, 
           TUNING.
           EXT. STREETCAR - DAY

           A GROUP OF PEOPLE stand around an idle street car.  They 
           watch it expectantly. Suddenly, it powers up, and starts to 
           move slowly along the tracks.  They all APPLAUD and CHEER.

           Over this, the sound of the radio finding an FDR Fireside 
           Chat in progress:

                                 FDR (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        We are rebuilding. Normalcy will 
                        come, but to be sure, it must be 
                        steady. For those who shout for a 
                        quicker recovery, remember...

           INT. NEWSPAPER PRESSES - DAY

           Danny stands in the giant room, Jake beside him smoking. They 
           watch the newspaper presses running at FULL SPEED.

                                 FDR (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        ...that speed is difficult to 
                        control. The clamor and confusion  
                        of moving too quickly provide ample 
                        cover for corruption and fear.

           Danny pulls a paper off the line. The front page’s giant 
           headline: “NEW RECOVERY GOVERNOR SWORN IN! PROMISES TO UNDO 
           MARCUM CORRUPTION!”

           INT. HEAVEN SPEAKEASY - DAY

           The place is empty, dark. Blackened by fire and dusty with 
           months of neglect. Overturned chairs, a bloody piano, but no 
           bodies.

                                 FDR (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        There were dark times. There was 
                        darkness, and there was the light 
                        some chose to snuff out, for 
                        personal gain.

           INT. COSGROVE’S OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           A YOUNG WOMAN walks down the hallway, approaches Cosgrove’s 
           office door. The door’s window has been replaced, and the 
           lettering on the glass reads: “COSGROVE, JACKSON, & 
           COSGROVE”, with the same private eye logo.
                                 FDR (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        Do not hate these people. They 
                        feared as you feared. They long for 
                        a new life, a new start, as you 
                        long for it.

           The Young Woman opens the door to reveal the office, with a 
           third desk to one side.  Sitting at this desk is Anthony 
           Jackson, wearing a suit. He stands upon her entering.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Hello, may I help you, ma’am?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE COFFEE POT - DAY

           It’s busier than usual. In the back, the PHONE RINGS, is 
           answered, and handed off to a YOUNG WOMAN.  For once, it’s a 
           good call; she smiles with joy.

                                 FDR (V.O.)
                             (on radio)
                        We will always have villains. We 
                        needed no darkness to tell us that. 
                        Instead, let it remind you that we 
                        will also always have heroes.  And 
                        together, we...

           Sam reaches over to the radio behind his counter and turns 
           the dial.  HEAR THE STATION CHANGE to a BASEBALL GAME.

           EXT. SPORTSMANS PARK - DAY

           Cosgrove sits on the first base side, watching the St. Louis 
           Browns play. The stadium is only half-full, but people are 
           happy.

           From behind, a fedora is plopped on his head.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey now.

           Mirabelle sits down next to him, smiling.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Hi.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Hey-ya, angel.
           He takes off the fedora and looks at it.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        I needed one of these.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        I know you did.

                                 COSGROVE
                        It’s sharp. Where’d you get it?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Barney’s Chapeaus.

                                 COSGROVE
                        Barney’s back in town?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        He and his wife, both.

                                 COSGROVE
                        That’s great.

           As he puts it on, the CRACK OF A BAT, and a CHEER as the 
           Browns get a hit. Cosgrove offers Mirabelle some peanuts. She 
           shakes her head.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Saving room for dinner tonight?

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Where you taking me? The Coffee 
                        Pot?

                                 COSGROVE
                        As nice as that place is, I do know 
                        of some other joints in town.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        Ooo, someplace posh, no doubt? 
                        Strawberries and champagne?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Ginger ale for me. But basically, 
                        yeah. Posh.

           Anthony, in suit and fedora, trots down the stands and kneels 
           next to them.

                                 ANTHONY
                        Coz.  Let’s go, I got a lead on 
                        that Juniper lady.
                                 COSGROVE
                        Tony, it’s only the sixth inning!

           Anthony just gives a ‘you know better’ look and walks away. 
           Cosgrove feigns frustration.

                                 MIRABELLE
                        More missing persons?

                                 COSGROVE
                        Pays the bills.

           Cosgrove stands, CLAPS for the team.

                                 COSGROVE (CONT’D)
                        Take over for me, angel.

                                 MIRABELLE
                             (imitating him shouting)
                        “Hey Burns, where’d you learn to 
                        throw? Sears and Roebuck?!”

                                 COSGROVE
                        Classy dame. See you tonight.

           He kisses her on the hand and runs up to join Anthony.

           He turns back to look at the crowd and the game. Another 
           CHEER for another hit.  Cosgrove smiles at Anthony, then they 
           turn and disappear into the tunnel.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
