           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A mediocre-looking teenage boy, GREG, is staring in frozen 
           horror at a computer monitor, the only source of illumination 
           in the room.

           He is lost in thought, and his thoughts are hell.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        I have no idea how to tell this 
                        story.

           He types. His typing is labored.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        I don’t even know how to start it. 
                        Like: I guess I could use one of 
                        those classic story-beginning 
                        sentences.

           He examines the screen. There’s one line written: “It was the 
           best of times; it was the worst of times.”

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                             (becoming agitated)
                        But what would that even mean? I 
                        mean, obviously somewhere in the 
                        world it’s the best of times for 
                        someone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SOME GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Some EXTREMELY FORTUNATE GUY is benefitting from all these 
           things that Greg is describing.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Like he’s eating all of this insane 
                        Vietnamese food that he just got 
                        for free and the woman who 
                        delivered the food looks exactly 
                        like Penelope Cruz circa Volver and 
                        now she’s situated in the corner 
                        playing unspeakably beautiful 
                        melodies on the harp. While he’s 
                        just going to town on that food. So 
                        yeah. That’s the best of times. 
                        Meanwhile,

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. NORTH KOREAN DUNGEON - NIGHT - ALTHOUGH WHO REALLY KNOWS 
           WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS IN THIS HORRIBLE GODDAMNED DUNGEON

           A COMPARABLY UNFORTUNATE GUY is the recipient of Greg’s 
           imagined parade of horrors.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        ...some other guy is being tortured 
                        by the North Korean government 
                        specifically by being suspended 
                        over a crocodile-infested pool of 
                        acid, and because it’s acid these 
                        crocodiles are just pissed, and 
                        they’re also piping in that gross 
                        smell you get when they spill a 
                        bunch of milk in the school parking 
                        lot, and this beefy torturer dude 
                        is just punching the hell out of 
                        him. Worst of times. Check.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GREG stares screenward. He has typed the words, “I have no 
           idea what I’m even doing right now.”

           He erases them and begins typing again.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        All right. Look. I’ll just start. 
                        This is the story of my senior year 
                        of high school, and how it 
                        destroyed my life, and how I made a 
                        film so bad it literally killed 
                        someone.

           Greg finishes typing. The screen says:

           “I made a film so bad it literally killed someone.”

           Greg is staring blankly at the screen, again.

           TITLE CARD: ME & EARL & THE DYING GIRL.

           Penelope Cruz is back on harp.

           INT. BUS - 6:07 A.M., FIRST DAY OF SENIOR YEAR

           GREG is slumped in a seat, yawning and absentmindedly eating 
           something, as the bus rumbles through the darkness.
           SUPER: The part where I begin senior year.

                                                                CUT TO:

           I/E. BENSON HIGH SCHOOL - BEFORE CLASS

           As GREG walks through the school - down hallways, in and out 
           of the band room, etc. - we trail him.

           ON THE STEPS IN FRONT OF CLASS:

           Greg gives a brief head nod to THE ONE KID who is sitting on 
           the steps, yo-yoing.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Here’s how to think about it: Like 
                        the actual world, Benson High 
                        School is divided into nations.

           IN THE FOYER:

           Greg gives a fist bump to a lone JOCK.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Jock Nation.

           IN A VAST GRITTY HALLWAY:

           Greg is patiently listening to TWO BLATHERING STONERS.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Kingdom of Stoners.

           FURTHER DOWN THE HALLWAY:

           JUSTIN HOWELL THE THEATER KID is laughing uproariously and 
           flirtatiously at a thing Greg has said.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        The People’s Republic of Theater 
                        Dorks.

           IN THE STAIRWELL:

           Greg observes, unnoticed, as two STONERS pelt a JOCK with 
           ketchup packets and then book it out of there.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        In the typical high school life, 
                        you belong to one nation, which can 
                        never guarantee you total security.

           IN THE HALLWAY:
           A group of GANGBANGERS smoking cigarettes exchanges sullen 
           what’s-up nods with Greg.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        There’s a way out, though. Get 
                        citizenship in EVERY nation. Get 
                        passports to EVERYWHERE.

           IN THE BAND ROOM:

           Greg briefly plays the bass drum in an impromptu jam session 
           with FOUR OR FIVE BAND KIDS.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Just be on low-key good terms with 
                        everyone. Casually interact with 
                        them once in a while, in a way that 
                        is invisible to everyone else.

           FREEZEFRAME.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        This may appear simple.

           REWIND to the FRONT STEPS of school, where this scene began.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        In fact, it requires thousands of 
                        social calculations per second.

           REPLAY the interactions with the YO-YO- KID and the JOCK, 
           again in slow-motion, but this time from GREG’S POV.

           In his field of vision are SCI-FI VISUALS: bars and charts. 
           It’s the data with which a high-functioning autistic person 
           might negotiate the terrifying social world of high school.

           Overlaid are dozens of Greg’s voices making observations, 
           barking commands, etc.:

           INT. HALLWAY

           Three MEDIOCRE-LOOKING GIRLS are in GREG’S path. One is 
           quietly but utterly miserable.

                                 FRIEND OF MISERABLE GIRL
                        The test was today?

           The miserable girl nods, wordless; her friends hug her 
           fiercely, protectively.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        You can’t commit to an interaction 
                        that won’t be casual or mellow. 
                        It’s like sending troops to 
                        Afghanistan. The result: quagmire.

                                 GREG
                             (cheerily, hastily)
                        Ugh! Tests! I’ve been there.

           He speeds away.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

           GREG is watching with polite interest as two GOTHY DORKS, 
           including SCOTT MAYHEW, play Magic cards.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Citizens of the most dicked-upon 
                        nations are the most difficult to 
                        establish trust with. For example, 
                        Scott Mayhew, the Gothy dork I’m 
                        sitting next to here.

           Scott plays a card entitled “Odin’s Berserker.”

                                 GREG
                             (murmuring respectfully)
                        Scott, nice berserker.

           Icy and sinister, Scott turns his gaze to Greg.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        Thank you.
           EXT. NEAR THE DUMPSTERS BEHIND THE SCHOOL

           GREG is patiently listening to the violent freestyle rapping 
           of ILL PHIL, a runty neck-tattooed ne’er-do-well.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Then there are nations of one: Kids 
                        whom no group will accept. Like Ill 
                        Phil here.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        They call me Ill Phil /
                        I’ll bend you to my will /
                        my will is ill /
                        and my name is Phil /
                        for real /

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, that’s good.

                                 ILL PHIL
                             (interrupting him)
                        take you out back behind the mill / 
                        force you to eat a pill /
                        now you like “what’s the deal” /
                        “I just got killed”

                                 GREG
                        It’s all really great.

                                 ILL PHIL
                             (refusing to stop)
                        I got a friend named Bill /
                        who I also killed /
                        blood got spilled /
                        shot him on a hill /
                        he was all like, “Ill Phil” /
                        “what’s the deal”

                                 GREG
                        Some great rhymes in there.

           INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCHTIME

           GREG, holding a bagged lunch, is standing inconspicuously at 
           the entrance of the cafeteria. He is peering at A PLACE OF 
           TOTAL CHAOS: crowded, dirty, and lawless.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        And it’s never, ever a good idea to 
                        eat your lunch in the cafeteria. 
                        Every last square inch of it is 
                        disputed territory. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It’s the Gaza Strip, South Ossetia, 
                        and the valley of Kashmir all 
                        rolled into one. Also the part of 
                        the Indian Ocean with the pirates.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE

           GREG is eating his lunch in a teacher’s office, next to a 
           DIMINUTIVE BLACK KID.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        That’s why I eat lunch in my 
                        history teacher’s office.

           MADISON, probably the hottest girl in school and yet somehow 
           a legitimately good person at the same time, opens the door.

                                 MADISON
                        Oh hey guys.

                                 GREG
                        Hi Madison.

                                 MADISON
                        Greg, how was your summer.

           She touches his arm. Greg’s eyes involuntarily bug out.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        One last thing. Hot girls destroy 
                        your life. That’s just a fact. It 
                        doesn’t matter if the hot girl is 
                        also a good person. She’s a moose, 
                        you’re a chipmunk, she’s just 
                        wandering through the forest, 
                        oblivious, and she doesn’t even 
                        know that she stomped your head.

           Back in Mr. McCarthy’s office, Greg is trying to be charming.

                                 GREG
                        Summer. What does that word even 
                        mean? Is it like, more “summ”?
                             (beat)
                        Or is, like, winter more “wint”?

           Mercifully, the black kid cuts in, in a chainsmoker’s rasp.

                                 BLACK KID
                        If you’re looking for McCarthy, 
                        he’s in room 318.

                             (brightly)
                        Thanks guys!

           She leaves. Greg gazes wistfully at the closed door.

                                 BLACK KID
                             (still without looking up)
                        Titties.

           Greg continues to stare, lost in thought.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

           TITTIES are indeed what Greg is staring at, on his computer. 
           A KNOCK ON THE DOOR sends him into panic.

                                 GREG

                                 GREG’S MOM
                             (entering)
                        Honey? Can we come in?

           GREG’S PARENTS are in the room now.

           GREG’S MOM is a forceful Jewish mom. She believes her son is 
           the most wonderful person in the world, and also that she 
           must take frequent intrusive measures to redirect his life.

           Because this is a movie, she is probably sort of hot, but not 
           egregiously so.

           GREG’S DAD, holding the family cat, is a muumuu-wearing 
           classics professor, a man of profound spacey weirdness. He is 
           often making a face of thoughtful concentration. This is to 
           conceal the unfathomable strangeness within.

           Why is he thrusting the cat out at Greg? What is the cat’s 
           role in this impromptu family meeting? Unclear.

                                 GREG
                        What do you want.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Your father and I wanted to talk to 
                        you about something kind of sad.

                                 GREG
                        What? What happened?
                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I just got off the phone with 
                        Denise Kushner. Rachel’s mom? You 
                        know Denise?

                                 GREG
                        Not really.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        But you’re friends with Rachel.

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. BENSON SCHOOL HALLWAY - EARLIER THAT DAY

           The very sad mediocre-looking girl from earlier today? The 
           one being comforted by her mediocre-looking friends?

           Yes. That was RACHEL.

                                                        CUT BACK TO THE 
                                                               PRESENT:

                                 GREG
                        We’re not friends, we’re like... 
                        acquainted.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Honey, Rachel has been diagnosed 
                        with leukemia. They just found out.

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

                                 FRIEND OF MISERABLE GIRL
                        The test was today?

           Hug of sadness.

                                 GREG
                        Ugh! Tests! I’ve been there.

                                                        CUT BACK TO THE 
                                                               PRESENT:

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (mortified at himself)
                        Oh God.
                             (beat)
                        Is that serious?
                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Oh honey. They don’t know. They’re 
                        doing tests, and they’re gonna do 
                        all they can. But they just don’t 
                        know.

           She is crying now, and Greg is not really sure what to do. He 
           goes over to give her a hug.

           Greg’s dad joins the hug. He is working the cat into the hug.

           They are all squat-hugging on the floor of Greg’s bedroom.

                                 GREG
                        Dad, Cat Stevens is biting me.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        He’s very upset about all this.

           The hug stops. Cat Stevens scampers angrily away.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Honey, Rachel is going to need her 
                        friends now more than ever.

                                 GREG
                        Okay, but again, we’re not really--

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        NOW more than EVER. Where’s your 
                        phone? Here. Give Rachel a call.

                                 GREG
                             (panicking)
                        Mom. What do you want me to say? 
                        Hey, it’s that random guy from 
                        school who’s never really paid 
                        attention to you? But now you have 
                        cancer, so let’s hang out?

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        That’s not going to work. She’ll 
                        think you’re being sarcastic.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Honey, you’re a smart, sensitive 
                        young man.

                                 GREG
                        That’s clearly not true--

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I’m sure you can think of something 
                        nice to say.
           Greg looks his mom in the eye. She means business. Nothing he 
           can say will get her to stop pursuing this annoying thing.

           Greg pretends to be dead.

                                                       GREG’S DAD
                                              Greg, your mother is adamant 
                                              that you make this call.

                                              No amount of passive 
                                              resistance can sway her.

                                              We’ve seen this tactic of 
                                              yours fail before.
                    GREG’S MOM (CONT’D)
           Nuh-uh. No sir. If you think 
           you can pretend-to-be-dead 
           your way out of this, you are 
           wrong, buster. Call Rachel. 
           Honey, this is not the right 
           time to do the pretending-to-
           be-dead thing, anyway. 
           Actually, this is really 
           inappropriate. Honey.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           GREG is on the phone, and his parents have left the room. The 
           phone is ringing. RACHEL picks up.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hi, this is Rachel.

                                 GREG
                        Hey it’s Greg Gaines.

                                 RACHEL
                             (unexcitedly)
                        Hi.

                                 GREG
                        Yo.
                             (beat)
                        Uh, I called a doctor. He said you 
                        needed a prescription of Greg-acil.

                                 RACHEL
                        What’s that.

                                 GREG
                        Uh. It’s me.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, in convenient gel-tab form.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh.
                                 GREG
                        Yeahhhhh.

           This is excruciating.

                                 RACHEL
                        So I guess you heard I’m sick.

                                 GREG
                        Yeahhhhh.

                                 RACHEL
                        Did my mom tell you.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, my mom told me.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh.

                                 GREG
                        So, uh.
                             (beat)

                                 RACHEL
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 RACHEL
                        What were you going to say?

                                 GREG
                        Uhhh.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, what?

                                 GREG
                        I was calling... to see... if you 
                        wanted to hang out.

                                 RACHEL
                        Right now?

                                 GREG
                        Uh... sure.

                                 RACHEL
                        No thanks.

                                 GREG
                        Uh. You don’t want to hang out?
                                 RACHEL
                        No, thanks anyways.

                                 GREG
                        Okay, uh... bye.

                                 RACHEL
                        Bye.

           She hangs up. Greg feels like a colossal douchebag.

           INT. TELEVISION ROOM - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

           GREG is watching a movie, his face still registering the 
           shame of his exchange with Rachel.

           GREG’S MOM stomps into the room and switches off the TV.

                                 GREG
                        Mom. She doesn’t want to see me.

           They size each other up.

                        GREG’S MOM
                                                          GREG
                                                (increasingly frantic)
                                              Mom. Can I just say something 
                                              for one second?
                                                (beat)
                                              Mom. Just let me say 
                                              something. Just for like one

           I’m sorry to be the one to 
           tell you this, Gregory, but 
           you do not have a choice in 
           this particular matter and 
           the reason for that is that 
           you have been given the 
           opportunity to make a very 
           real, positive difference in 
           someone’s life, and if what 
           you’re choosing to do instead 
           is just lie around the house 
           all day like a dead slug then 
           I quite frankly have to step 
           in and inform you that that 
           is completely unacceptable, 
           completely unacceptable, and 
           if you think that any of 
           these excuses you’re giving 
           me is more important than the 
           happiness of a girl with 
           cancer, a friend with cancer, 
           then you have got another 
           think coming, buddy, because 
           you are going to pick up that 
           phone, you are going to call 
           Rachel, you are going to 
           arrange to spend some time

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RACHEL’S DOORSTEP - TEN MINUTES LATER

           GREG is standing on the doorstep. He looks terrified.

           Super: The part where I meet a dying girl

           The door opens. It’s DENISE, Rachel’s mom. Denise is a tough 
           woman in impossible circumstances.

           She looks Greg up and down. He returns her gaze with ill-
           concealed terror.

           Then suddenly she envelopes Greg in her wiry arms.

                                 DENISE
                        Gre-e-e-e-eg.

                                 GREG
                             (slightly muffled)
                        Hi Mrs. Kushner.

                                 DENISE
                        Denise, Greg. To you, I’m Denise.

                                 GREG
                             (nervously)
                        Okay! Good.

           Denise leads him inside. On a table in an adjoining room is a 
           bottle of something, and a glass. Dr. Phil is on.

                                 DENISE
                        You’re a good kid. You know that? 
                        You’re just a sweet, good-hearted 
                        kid. And handsome.

                                 GREG
                        Pretty sure I’m not handsome.

                                 DENISE
                        And so modest.

                                 GREG
                        I guess I’m a modest mouse.

                                 DENISE
                        HA. GREG.
                             (teetering a little)
                        Where do you come up with this 
                        stuff?

                                 GREG
                        I think that’s the name of a band, 
                        or someth--
                                 DENISE
                        RACHEL. THERE’S A MODEST LITTLE 
                        MOUSE HERE TO SEE YOU.

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

           GREG and RACHEL are observing each other from opposite sides 
           of her doorway. He is anxious; she is guarded.

                                 GREG
                        Rachel-l-l-l.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, what are you doing here.

                                 GREG
                        Uh... So the doctor really 
                        recommends a strong dosage of Greg-
                        itor. He thinks you should start 
                        taking it immediately.

                                 RACHEL
                        You already used that joke.

                                 GREG
                        No, because last time it was about 
                        Greg-acil, which, if you recall, 
                        comes in convenient gel-tab form--

                                 RACHEL
                        Look. I don’t want you hanging out 
                        with me. I don’t need your stupid 
                        pity. I’m fine. You can just go.

                                 GREG
                        No no no. You’ve got it all wrong. 
                        I’m not here because I pity you.

                        I’m here because my mom...
                             (realizing that this is 
                              worse)
                        ...is, uh... making me.

           Hmmmm.

                                 RACHEL
                        That’s actually worse.

                                 GREG
                             (beginning to panic)
                        I know. Look. Uh. I know.
                                 RACHEL
                        Just leave, okay? Honestly. I’m 
                        fine.

                                 GREG
                             (desperately)
                        Rachel. Please listen to me.
                             (he gathers himself)
                        My mom is going to turn my life 
                        into a living hell if I don’t hang 
                        out with you. I can’t overstate how 
                        annoying she’s being about this. 
                        Rachel.

           He realizes he has to beg.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Look. I understand that I’m not 
                        doing you a favor here. What I’m 
                        asking is for you to do me a favor.

                                 RACHEL
                        You want a favor from me?

                                 GREG
                        Yes. Please. Let me hang out with 
                        you for one day. I can tell my mom 
                        we hung out. Then we’ll both be out 
                        of each other’s lives. Deal?

           Rachel considers this with narrowed eyes.

                                 RACHEL
                        Deal.

                                 GREG
                        Word.

                                 RACHEL
                        What are you doing now.

           Greg looks down at his hands. He is going for a fist pound.

                                 GREG
                        I think I’m going for a fist pound.

           Rachel grudgingly touches his fist with her limp half-closed 
           hand. They enter her room.

           It’s a girly room--the bed is covered in pillows, the walls 
           are thick with magazine cutouts of actors. But it’s also 
           somewhat dark and cavelike, and there’s not a lot of pink.

           They sit down.
           Neither of them says anything.

                                                           JUMP CUT TO:

           Super: EIGHT MINUTES LATER

           They are still on the bed, in slightly different positions.

                                 RACHEL
                        So. Here we are. Hanging out with 
                        each other.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah.

           Silence.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s really everything I ever hoped 
                        it would be.

                                 GREG
                             (indicating bed)
                        So, uh. Lot of pillows in here. How 
                        many pillows is that?

                                 RACHEL
                        I don’t know.

                                 GREG
                        I wish I had that many pillows.

                                 RACHEL
                        So ask your parents for some.

                                 GREG
                        No, uh... they’d be suspicious or 
                        something.

                                 RACHEL
                        That you’d sleep all the time?

                                 GREG
                        They’d probably assume that I was 
                        going to masturbate all over them.

           A long beat. It’s not immediately clear that Rachel is about 
           to have a huge snorting laugh attack.

                                 RACHEL
                        That is disgusting.

                                 GREG
                        That’s my parents. They’re gross.
                                 RACHEL
                        They won’t get you pillows because 
                        they’d think you’d masturbbBB

           Rachel snorts when she laughs. She now is having difficulty 
           talking because she is snorting so hard.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. They have some really gross 
                        ideas about me. But it’s also their 
                        fault for getting sexy pillows.

           Rachel is on the floor. Greg is examining one of her pillows.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        This is a nice pillow. This pillow 
                        reminds me of Francesca. Francesca 
                        was a pillow we eventually had to 
                        give away, because I just got too 
                        aroused. It was a bad scene.

           Rachel is now begging Greg to stop.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I used to call Francesca the 
                        dirtiest names. I used to say, “You 
                        slutty pillow, you’re so filthy. 
                        You slut. Stop toying with my 
                        emotions.”--okay okay I’ll stop.

           Rachel tries to get her breath as Greg shuts up.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        That was a monster laugh.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah.

           Beat.

                                 GREG
                        The thing with monster laughs is, 
                        there’s like a huge silence 
                        afterward.

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah, I dunno. It’s okay to just be 
                        quiet for a while.

                                 GREG
                        Cool. Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        Yeah, this is cool.
           Greg’s cell phone buzzes.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (reading text message)
                        Oh man. I have to go. I’m really 
                        sorry.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s okay. Who sent you that text?

                                 GREG
                        Uh... That was Earl.

                                 RACHEL
                        Who’s Earl?

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL - LUNCHTIME

           We’re back to the first day of school, where GREG was eating 
           lunch in a teacher’s office with a DIMINUTIVE BLACK KID.

           That’s who EARL is.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        You may remember Earl from twenty 
                        minutes ago. He was the kid I was 
                        eating lunch with.

                                 EARL
                        Titties.

           He continues to eat his lunch, looking pissed.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Earl’s my friend. Actually he’s 
                        more like my coworker.

           SNAPSHOT of GREG AND EARL IN KINDERGARTEN. Greg is a little 
           chubster. Earl is scowling like a vampire.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        We’ve been classmates since 
                        kindergarten.

           EXT. IN FRONT OF EARL’S HOUSE - ONE DAY MANY YEARS AGO

           Earl lives in a ramshackle house with gutters falling off.
           His much-tattooed brother DERRICK slouches and smokes on the 
           porch. Derrick watches with menace as YOUNG GREG, wearing a 
           backpack, cautiously approaches from the sidewalk.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        His house is a short walk from 
                        mine, but in a much tougher 
                        neighborhood. His dad’s in Texas, 
                        his mom is depressed and never 
                        leaves her bedroom, and his brother 
                        Derrick is the most terrifying 
                        human being on earth.

           Derrick snaps his fingers and a GIANT DOG explodes through 
           the front door, barking furiously. The dog chases Greg off-
           camera. YOUNG EARL comes running out after them.

                                 YOUNG EARL
                        Doopie! Chill out! Doopie.

           EXT. IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE

           Similar shot, except of a much nicer house in a leafy 
           neighborhood. YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL stroll up the walk, 
           past Cat Stevens, who is asleep.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        So over the years we’ve really only 
                        hung out at my place.

                                 YOUNG EARL
                             (to the indifferent cat)
                        Yeah, what you got. You wanna 
                        fight? Didn’t think so.

           INT. GREG’S TV ROOM

           YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL happen upon GREG’S DAD, who is 
           watching Aguirre, the Wrath of God.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        My house has better stuff to do 
                        anyway.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        Boys, you’ll want to pay close 
                        attention to this. The insane 
                        conquistador Aguirre is raging 
                        through the jungle, in search of a 
                        golden city that does not exist.

           The boys are transfixed. On-screen, Aguirre is freaking out.
                                 GREG’S DAD (CONT’D)
                        It’s a classic of foreign cinema.

                                 YOUNG EARL
                             (happily)
                        That’s a crazy dude.

           INT. GREG’S KITCHEN

           GREG’S DAD is serving the BOYS cuttlefish.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        In addition to the best films, my 
                        house also had the weirdest food.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        This is cuttlefish, a sea creature 
                        much like a squid. It is a favorite 
                        East Asian snack food.

                                 YOUNG EARL
                        Staaaaaaank.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        Yes, the smell is odd and repellent 
                        to our Western noses.

           All three of them sit there chewing the rubbery cuttlefish.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Obviously we came from pretty 
                        different backgrounds. But somehow 
                        we liked most of the same things.

           INT. GREG’S TV ROOM - DIFFERENT DAY

           YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL are eating more cuttlefish and 
           trying to watch The Seventh Seal.

           Next to them, however, three of their CLASSMATES are munching 
           Doritos and watching a fourth classmate play Game Boy.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        And it turned out, we were the only 
                        ones who liked them. Especially 
                        classics of foreign cinema.

           EXT. A PARK NEAR GREG’S HOUSE - DAY

           YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL are trying to recreate a scene from 
           Rashomon. Young Greg has a camera and a boom mike.
           Young Earl, dressed like a samurai, is sort of spazzing out.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        In fact, we loved classics of 
                        foreign cinema so much that we 
                        started making our own.

           INT. GREG’S LIVING ROOM

           Now we are watching one of their films. YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG 
           EARL, dressed like samurai, are murdering each other and 
           knocking over living room furniture.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        We’ve made 42 films. They’re all 
                        pretty horrible, but for some 
                        reason we keep making them. They 
                        all have the same signature ending.

           Young Earl has murdered Young Greg. He yells something in 
           fake Japanese at the camera.

                                 YOUNG EARL (SUBTITLE)
                        Life is a meaningless dream, 
                        floating in eternal silence.

                        Life is the shadow of death.

           BLACKOUT, plus the giant words, “NOW YOU ARE DEAD.”

           INT. INSIDE THE ACTOR’S STUDIO WITH JAMES LIPTON

           JAMES LIPTON is interviewing an unimpressed, periodically 
           hostile, raspy-voiced, cigarette-puffing EARL.

                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        Earl Jackson. Your collaborations 
                        with Gregory Gaines have been wide-
                        ranging... ambitious... and 
                        completely delightful. And yet 
                        they’ve been seen by an extremely 
                        limited audience.

                                 EARL
                        They ain’t been seen by nobody. We 
                        don’t want nobody seein em.

                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        And why is that?

                                 EARL
                        Cuz they suck donkey dick.
                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        I beg to disagree with you.

                                 EARL
                        Man you don’t know shit. We ain’t 
                        got no actors, no lighting, no 
                        money for no beat-ass props. Our 
                        films suck a donkey’s hairy-ass 
                        dick half the time.

                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        Joseph Campbell writes, “If you 
                        follow your bliss, the life you 
                        ought to be living is the one you 
                        are living.”

                                 EARL
                        I do not know who the hell that is.

                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        Where can I satisfy my 
                        uncontrollable craving for your 
                        peculiar species of genius?

                                 EARL
                        Hell if I know. I ain’t givin you 
                        my copies. And Greg sure as hell 
                        ain’t givin you his. Dude’s 
                        insecure as hell.

                                 JAMES LIPTON
                        Earl Jackson. It has been pure 
                        pleasure.

                                 EARL
                        The fuck, man.

           EXT. GREG’S FRONT PORCH - PRESENT

           EARL sits, waiting, holding a tripod and defiantly munching 
           STEAK TIPS OUT OF TUPPERWARE. Greg approaches him sheepishly.

                                 GREG
                        Sorry I’m late.

                                 EARL
                        Hangin with Rachel again, huh.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. It sucks.

                                 EARL
                        You tryna get with that?
                                 GREG
                        That’s the whole thing. No. But 
                        what if I’m expected to? I mean, 
                        what if this is her last chance, 
                        to, uh... to be with a man?

                                 EARL
                             (scornfully)
                        Call yourself a man. Look at your 
                        pussy ass.

                                 GREG
                        Earl, seriously. What if I’m her 
                        only chance to experience sex? 
                        Before she dies of cancer? I’m 
                        pretty sure I won’t even be able to 
                        get a boner in those circumstances.

                                 EARL
                        Gettin a hard-on seem like the 
                        least you can do.

           Greg gets a HANDFUL OF STEAK TIPS and eats them sadly.

                                 GREG
                        I can’t even enjoy these. This 
                        whole cancer thing is depressing 
                        the hell out of me right now.

                                 EARL
                        What kinda cancer she got.

                                 GREG
                        Acute myelogenous leukemia.

                                 EARL
                        Naw. I mean where is this cancer 
                        located. People be getting lung 
                        cancer, brain cancer, dick cancer. 
                        Where do your girl have cancer at.

           Greg realizes that he doesn’t know the answer to this.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Super: The part where I am even more of an idiot than normal

           The bell has just rung on the history class of MR. MCCARTHY, 
           a young teacher with a shaved head and arms sheathed in 
           tattoos. He is notable for his paradoxically mellow 
           intensity, and for his LOVE OF FACTS.

           He is, to Greg, the only reasonable teacher in all of Benson.
                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        All right, people. Tomorrow, I need 
                        you to come armed with an epic 
                        fact. Just one fact. But it must be 
                        epic. CLASS. RESPECT THE RESEARCH.

                                 CLASS
                             (half-heartedly)
                        Respect the research.

           Mr. McCarthy punches his own biceps.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        FACTS.

           Greg approaches him as his classmates file out of the room.

                                 GREG
                        Mr. McCarthy?

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                             (kindly)
                        Beast. What can I do for you.

                                 GREG
                        Do you know anything about, uh, 
                        leukemia?

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Yes. Leukemia is cancer of the 
                        blood and/or bone marrow.

                                 GREG
                        So it’s like in your entire body.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        You are demonstrating ownership of 
                        that fact.

                                 GREG
                        So how long does it take to kill 
                        someone?

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Well, it doesn’t kill everyone, 
                        bud. There are ways to treat it. 
                        Why do you ask?

                                 GREG
                        You know Rachel Kushner has 
                        leukemia, right?

           MADISON HARTNER is passing as Greg says this. Shocked, she 
           grabs Greg’s arm.
                                 MADISON
                        Rachel has what?

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

           GREG is back in RACHEL’S pillow-infested room. She is not 
           happy. He has his head in his hands.

                                 GREG
                        I’m so sorry. I’m such an idiot. 
                        I’m like, relentlessly stupid.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s okay. People at school were 
                        going to find out anyway. I’m just 
                        not excited to have to talk about 
                        it all the time.

           Greg is trying to think of a way to help.

                                 GREG
                        One thing you can do when you don’t 
                        want to deal with people is just 
                        enter a subhuman state.

           Rachel looks at him expressionlessly.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Here, pretend you’re someone 
                        annoying.

                                 RACHEL
                             (impersonating an annoying 
                              classmate)
                        Hi, Rachel. I’m really sorry you 
                        have cancer.

                                 GREG
                             (cross-eyed, sort of 
                              zombie-like)
                        urrrrjj jjjunhjh uuhjjghjnj 
                        gnngnngh

           Rachel does not know what to think of this. It’s definitely 
           cute. It’s also deeply stupid.

                                 RACHEL
                        Does that ever work?

                                 GREG
                        It works all the time. It’s passive 
                        resistance. That’s what Gandhi was 
                        all about.
                                 RACHEL
                        I’m pretty sure Gandhi never did 
                        the subhuman thing.

                                 GREG
                        I’m going to be as nice as I can 
                        with this: you have no idea what 
                        you’re talking about. Gandhi did 
                        this all the time. How do you think 
                        India achieved statehood? Here, try 
                        it. Go: uurrrnng nnnurrrrjjrjjjj.

                                 RACHEL
                             (smiling)
                        Nope.

                                 GREG
                        Come on! It’s easy. Or another 
                        thing you can do is just flat-out 
                        pretend to be dead. Check it out. 
                        Say something annoying to me.

                                 RACHEL
                             (impersonating another 
                              annoying classmate)
                        Hi, Rachel. I just wanted you to 
                        remember that your cancer is all 
                        part of God’s plan.

           Greg is being flamboyantly dead. Rachel is enjoying this. But 
           behind her head, a cut-out of HUGH JACKMAN glares at Greg.

                                 HUGH JACKMAN
                        Yo. Asshole. Just so we’re straight 
                        on this: You’re advising a girl 
                        with cancer to pretend to be dead?

                                 GREG
                             (nervously trying to 
                              ignore Hugh Jackman)
                        urrngh

                                 HUGH JACKMAN
                        No, seriously. Think about what 
                        you’re doing here, dickhead. Jesus.

           Greg is now lying there with a horrified look on his face.

                                 HUGH JACKMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been here in this girl’s room 
                        for five and a quarter years, and 
                        I’m goddamned if I’m gonna just let 
                        a little punk like you waltz in 
                        here stupiding up the place--
                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, what’s wrong?

                                 GREG
                        Uh...
                             (foolishly)
                        Sorry, I shouldn’t have told you to 
                        pretend to be dead. It was really 
                        insensitive.

           Rachel doesn’t respond immediately. Greg, you idiot.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (panicking)
                        And now I’m being all weird about 
                        it, which is obviously just going 
                        to make you feel worse, because I’m 
                        clearly just sitting here thinking, 
                        “death death death, cancer cancer”--

           Suddenly Rachel enters a subhuman state.

                                 RACHEL
                        huuurnnrnnnrnnh hurrnrnnrngghjh

           Greg processes this.

           For the first time in his life, a girl has understood him.

                                 GREG
                        THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM TALKING 
                        ABOUT.

           Super: The part where Rachel and I become actual friends 
           a.k.a. THE POINT OF NO RETURN

           DAYS PASS. They are hanging out in Rachel’s room, sitting in 
           various positions, and Greg is doing most of the talking.

           Super: Day 2 of Doomed Friendship

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        ...lickable technology, like I 
                        could text you a sandwich. I think 
                        that’s where phones are headed.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        ...Daniel Craig’s thing is, he’s 
                        got an accent, so he’s used to 
                        talking with his mouth in a weird 
                        shape. So that’s why he has these 
                        pouty lips like a woman.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Animals just live in our homes and 
                        everyone’s cool with it. Animals.

                                 RACHEL
                        It is kind of strange to think 
                        about.

           Silence.

                                 GREG
                        I think you’re too good of a 
                        listener. Because when we hang out, 
                        I do an insane amount of talking.

                                 RACHEL
                             (giggling)
                        You just have a lot more to say 
                        than I do.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, but it’s quantity versus 
                        quality. The stuff I have to say is 
                        idiotic. Have you not picked up on 
                        that? Maybe actually you’re a 
                        terrible listener.

                        Anyway, you should talk. Go.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, it’s weird to just tell 
                        someone, in a conversation, to 
                        start talking.

                                 GREG
                        I mean, if you want to, like, talk 
                        about stuff, I dunno... that you’re 
                        like going through... right now...

                                 RACHEL
                        You want me to talk about having 
                        cancer?

                                 GREG
                        Only if you want to.

           He really wants to be a good friend and listener. He just has 
           no idea how. Rachel takes pity on him.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sure, I can give you five minutes 
                        of cancer.
           EXT. THE PARK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           They’re walking through the forest, passed occasionally by 
           dog walkers and old people.

                                 RACHEL
                        ...So I’m optimistic. Honestly. I’m 
                        sick, but everyone gets sick.

                                 GREG
                        I’m sick all the time. I’m 
                        seriously congested right now.

           Rachel smiles but does not laugh.

                                 RACHEL
                        The hardest part is watching my mom 
                        try to deal with it. And sometimes, 
                        I mean, I do think... if it ends up 
                        that she’s alone, in that house... 
                        She has no one. She and my dad hate 
                        each other, she has no siblings... 
                        I don’t know what she’d do.

           Rachel is somber, but dry-eyed.

                                 GREG
                        Uh... Don’t cry.

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m not crying.

                                 GREG
                        Right.
                             (beat)
                        You can cry if you need to.

                                 RACHEL
                        I thought you just said don’t cry.

                                 GREG
                        I want you to start crying, so I 
                        can comfort you into not crying.

                                 RACHEL
                        Probably, you shouldn’t become a 
                        therapist. Hey. I wanted to ask you 
                        something. What group am I in?

                                 GREG
                        What?
                                 RACHEL
                        Yesterday you were saying, you’ve 
                        mapped out the entire high school 
                        by group. So what’s my group?

                                 GREG
                        Seriously?

                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah.

                             (disgusted)
                        Ugh.

                                 GREG
                        Please appreciate how honest that 
                        was just now.

                                 RACHEL
                        You’re an asshole. What group are 
                        you in?

                                 GREG
                        I’m not. I wouldn’t last long in 
                        any group that doesn’t suck. I’m 
                        terminally weird and I have a face 
                        like a groundhog.

                                 RACHEL
                        You can’t really think that!

                                 GREG
                        I don’t think that, I know that. 
                        That’s how it is in high school for 
                        kids as weird as me. I’m just 
                        trying to survive until college.

                                 RACHEL
                        You think college is going to be 
                        different?

                                 GREG
                             (carefully)
                        I think there will be a few 
                        critical differences.

                                                              SEQUENCE:
           INT. COLLEGE SMOKING ROOM - FANTASY SEQUENCE

           In Greg’s head, college looks vaguely like an UPSCALE 
           GENTLEMEN’S CLUB from the 1920s: elegant, dimly lit, 
           furnished with expensive-looking armchairs. Clusters of TWEED-
           WEARING TEENAGERS are smoking cigars, drinking Scotch, and 
           having witty conversations.

           GREG is leading RACHEL around and telling her about it, 
           intermittently addressing his various urbane friends.

                                 GREG
                        At college, first of all, there’s a 
                        highly selective admissions process 
                        that weeds out the mean and the 
                        stupid. So unlike high school, 
                        there are no morons. Franklin, 
                        would you agree?

                                 FRANKLIN
                             (throwing darts)
                        I’m afraid today I’m more off, not 
                        more on.

           Ha ha! Get it? “More on”/”moron”? Oh ha ha ha, ha. Delighted 
           laughter by all within earshot.

                                 GREG
                        You’re finally spending your time 
                        with smart, interesting people, in 
                        a place that’s not disgusting. 
                        Alessandro, back me up on this.

                                 ALESSANDRO
                        It can’t be that disgusting. Your 
                        mother is nowhere in sight.

           Good one, Alessandro. Greg genially slaps him on the back.

           Greg takes an open seat at a poker table. Rachel observes.

                                 GREG
                             (sorting his cards)
                        It’s the first time in your life 
                        that you’re in a sophisticated, 
                        stimulating environment. Which is 
                        fun, and interesting, but most 
                        importantly, it makes you better. 
                        At life.

           Greg gets back out of his chair, momentarily confusing the 
           OTHER CARD PLAYERS.
                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (addressing the table)
                        I’m sorry, guys, I have to go back 
                        to the bathroom. I forgot to flush.

           He puts down his five cards, face up. It’s a KING-HIGH FLUSH. 
           Everyone at the table bursts into appreciative laughter.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. THE PARK - PRESENT

           RACHEL is nonplussed by GREG’S notion of college.

                                 RACHEL
                        You’ve been to a college that was 
                        like that?

                                 GREG
                        I’ve never been to a college that 
                        wasn’t like that.

           They walk. It does not take Rachel long to figure this out.

                                 RACHEL
                        You’ve never been to a college.

                                 GREG
                             (defensively)
                        Going to colleges is my number one 
                        priority this winter. I have a 
                        whiteboard in my room, with twenty-
                        two college visits on it. You want 
                        to see it?

                                 RACHEL
                        Not even a little bit.

                                 GREG
                        Listen. I’ve got a whole ranking 
                        system ready to go. Wittiness. 
                        Urbanity. Intellectualism. Uh... 
                        Cigar Deliciousness. Median Scotch 
                        Age. Tolerance of Chubby Kids. I’m 
                        gonna show you this whiteboard.

                                 RACHEL
                             (panicked by the 
                              boringness of this)
                        We have to find something else to 
                        talk about.

           An OLD COUPLE, taking little steps, comes into view.
                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey. That old couple there. What do 
                        you think their lives are like?

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 RACHEL
                        I see them in this park all the 
                        time. I feel like they have a 
                        thousand specific little routines 
                        together. Like he wakes up first, 
                        every morning, and warms milk in a 
                        little pot, and pours it over some 
                        muesli in her favorite bowl, and he 
                        brings it upstairs to her and reads 
                        her the sports section in a low 
                        scraggly voice while she eats.

                                 GREG
                        Huh.

                                 RACHEL
                        Now your turn.

                                 GREG
                        Honestly, I think they probably 
                        have chronic pain and smell weird.

                                 RACHEL
                        Ugh. Greg.

                                 GREG
                        That’s just old people. They 
                        usually don’t smell that great.

                                 RACHEL
                        Maybe when you’re old. I’m gonna be 
                        a cute old person, and I’m not 
                        gonna smell weird.

                                 GREG
                        Of course I’m gonna smell weird. I 
                        already smell weird.

           Rachel gazes at this weird kid with the self-esteem deficit.

                                 RACHEL
                             (decisively)
                        Congratulations, Greg. Tomorrow, 
                        you’re eating lunch with Boring 
                        Jewish Senior Girls Subgroup 2a.

           Greg does not know how to resist this nightmarish idea.
           INT. CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY

           Now RACHEL and GREG are wading through the HORRIFYING CHAOS 
           that is the Benson cafeteria.

                                 RACHEL
                        So where do you usually sit?

           ROBO-GREG’S POV. Greg’s system is going haywire. His field of 
           vision is disastrously cluttered with LABELS and DATA.

           The giant red words “SYSTEM FAILURE” are flashing over 
           everything and making that BURMP BURMP BURMP sound that means 
           that a computer is about to explode.

           BACK TO THE THIRD-PERSON.

                                 GREG
                        This is literally like trying to 
                        have lunch in Kandahar.

           They sit at a table with ANNA and NAOMI, two of Rachel’s 
           NONDESCRIPT-LOOKING FRIENDS.

                                 ANNA
                        Rachel, we just found out the theme 
                        of this year’s prom! It’s “A Knight 
                        To Remember.”

                                 NAOMI
                        Knight with a “K.”

                                 ANNA
                        Medieval prom-m-m-m!

                                 GREG
                        Isn’t prom like six months away?

           They turn their gaze to Greg. Who is this schmuck who’s gonna 
           talk trash on medieval prom?

                                 RACHEL
                        Hi guys. Greg’s sitting with us 
                        today. Anyone want ketchup? No?

           Rachel goes to get ketchup, leaving Greg to fend for himself.

                                 GREG
                        Hello.

                                 NAOMI
                             (fake-nice)
                        So Greg, why are you sitting with 
                        us today?
                                 GREG
                        Uh... you know. Lunch. Gotta sit 
                        somewhere. You can’t stand and eat.

                                 NAOMI
                        You and Rachel seem very... 
                        friendly all of a sudden.

           Naomi is patiently, cleverly devising some sort of rhetorical 
           trap. Anna does not share this patience or cleverness.

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah. You’re only hanging out with 
                        Rachel because she has cancer.

                                 GREG
                        What?!

                                 NAOMI
                        Greg, it’s obvious. You’ve never 
                        hung out with Rachel once. Now 
                        you’re befriending her just to feel 
                        good about yourself. It’s okay. You 
                        can admit it.

                                 GREG
                        No! I’m not! Who even does that?

           Enter MADISON HARTNER. She touches Greg’s arm.

           A MOOSE STOMPS A CHIPMUNK

                                 MADISON
                        Hi guys. Can I sit with you?

           Anna and Naomi gaze at her with coolness, if not hostility.

           But RACHEL has re-arrived with her ketchup, so they can’t be 
           mean to her outright.

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course.

           Greg is relieved that someone else has shown up who is more 
           of an irritating do-gooder than him.

           Madison puts a PILLOW on the table.

                                 MADISON
                        Sorry, I have to carry this pillow 
                        around and pretend it’s a baby. For 
                        health class. This is a safe place 
                        to put it, right?
                                 RACHEL
                             (playfully)
                        A pillow? Greg, what do you think?

                                 GREG
                             (trying to play along)
                        Yeah, you better not put it too 
                        close to me, because I might, uh, 
                        just masturbate all over it.

           No one understands this inside joke except Greg and Rachel.

           A horrified silence settles over the table.

                                 ANNA
                        GREG, THAT’S WEIRD AND GROSS.

           Greg panics. He needs to change the subject. He sees SCOTT 
           MAYHEW loping clumsily around, his TRENCH COAT flapping.

                                 GREG
                        Um! Everybody! Check out Scott 
                        Mayhew’s tyrannosaurus walk. It’s 
                        probably the most effective way of 
                        getting from point A to point B. I 
                        think we should all try it.

           Success! Rachel giggles. Emboldened, Greg continues.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        And wearing a trench coat indoors: 
                        also a great move. The earth’s 
                        climate is just weird now. It might 
                        start raining in the cafeteria.

           Scattered giggling. This is actually working. Greg goes in 
           for the kill.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        And someone please tell me what is 
                        up with this guy’s hair! It looks 
                        like an orc’s pubes!

           No one laughs. Oh Jesus.

                                 MADISON
                        Greg, you’re being mean.

                                 RACHEL
                        I think he heard you!

           He did. He is staring at Greg coldly. Their gazes meet.

           Greg grabs his stuff and flees.
           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           GREG is sweaty and out of breath. EARL is eating a lunch of 
           Airheads, Skittles, Coke, and some chocolate chip cookies.

                                 GREG
                        And just like that, eight years of 
                        carefully cultivated invisibility: 
                        Gone. Fin.
                             (taking a cookie)
                        Where’d you get these cookies?

                                 EARL
                        Won em off Ill Phil playin tonk. 
                        Tired a whoopin his dumb ass.

                                 GREG
                        Do you do anything in Scholar

           MR. MCCARTHY enters, holding his thermos.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Earl. Greg.

           Sup McCarthy.
                                              Hello, Mr. McCarthy.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Earl. Fact: that lunch is garbage.

                                 EARL
                        Least I ain’t eatin no funky 
                        seaweed-lookin... tentacle soup.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Indeed, I was just coming in here 
                        to replenish the oracle.

           From a tureen on his desk, Mr. McCarthy ladles soup into his 
           thermos.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Boys, behold wisdom’s very source. 
                        Gaze into the waters of the oracle.

           Greg and Earl peer into the tureen. Earl’s description is 
           accurate. It is a funky seaweed-looking tentacle soup.
                                 MR. MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        It’s Vietnamese. They call it pho.

                                 EARL
                        Lemme try some one time.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                             (closing pot)
                        Can’t give you food. Totally 
                        verboten. How’s the college process 
                        going for you both? Earl?

                                 EARL
                        Want some damn soup.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Noted. Greg?

           From his backpack, Greg unearths a MAMMOTH COLLEGE DIRECTORY. 
           It is bristling with color-coordinated Post-Its, which he has 
           put on pretty much every page. He flicks a magenta Post-It.

                                 GREG
                        I’ve got a big wave of applications 
                        going out in two weeks. Magenta.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Greg, your Post-Its are simply 
                        ferocious, and you are a beast. 
                        Gentlemen! Respect the research.

                                 GREG AND EARL
                        Respect the research.

           Once Mr. McCarthy has left, Greg and Earl immediately ladle 
           SOUP into their mouths.

                                 GREG
                        I can’t believe what an ass I made 
                        of myself in the cafeteria.

                                 EARL
                        No more’n usual.

                                 GREG
                        Earl. I threatened to sexually 
                        assault a fake baby. Then I pretty 
                        much challenged Scott Mayhew to a 
                        duel. We’re mortal enemies now.

                                 EARL
                        Son, that’s a average day for your 
                        dumb ass.
                                 GREG
                        And obviously none of this would 
                        have happened if Rachel weren’t 
                        complicating my life right now. But 
                        then I’m a dick for even 
                        complaining about it. What the hell 
                        is wrong with me? Am I a human?

           Earl stares at him doubtfully. Greg eats another spoonful.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (thoughtfully)
                        Does this taste strange to you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MATH CLASS - LATER THAT DAY

           GREG is sitting in class. Something is wrong with him. He is 
           staring dully forward, a look of muted horror on his face.

           Slow agonizing ZOOM on his face, scored to the eerie, 
           melancholy descending chords of movement XIII., “Crucifixus,” 
           of the Mass in B Minor by J.S. Bach.

           SPLICE with Greg’s POV of the TEACHER, droning distantly and 
           unintelligibly as if underwater.

           GREG’S CLASSMATES all seem to be staring at him.

           A cartoon badger image flickers over his field of vision.

           Greg looks at his phone. Earl has texted him a message: that 
           soup had drugs . Greg looks up in horror.

           Super: The part where I accidentally am on drugs

           The bell rings. Greg jumps to his feet. Then, immediately, he 
           falls down.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Greg is in a crowded hallway, attempting to make his way out 
           of school. His eyes are wild and his movements clumsy.

           SPLICE with his ROBO-GREG POV, which is distorted and 
           malfunctioning. The badger image continues to blip over his 
           field of vision. Sometimes the badger has tentacles.

           EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

           GREG emerges through Benson’s front doors. He gapes fearfully 
           at the CLUSTERS OF STUDENTS gathered in front of the school.

           From his POV, they are all fixed in place, staring at him 
           hostilely. A few are even pointing ACCUSING FINGERS at him.

           The scoring here could be the dramatic choral opening to 
           Movement I. Of Bach’s Mass in B Minor, “Kyrie Eleison.”

           One of the students is EARL, impatiently beckoning him over.

           Greg points to himself, as if to say, “Me?”

           Earl nods his head with exasperation bordering on rage.

           Greg, with absurd delicacy, navigates the territory between 
           them, fearful of attracting further attention from his 
           classmates. At one point he tries to be inconspicuous by 
           WALKING BEHIND A BUSH. He gets stuck in the bush.

           Earl watches with unconcealed disgust.

           Eventually Greg makes it over to Earl.

                                 GREG
                        What’s going on?!

                                 EARL
                        McCarthy puts weed in his soup. We 
                        drank the soup. So now we both lit.

                                 GREG
                        Oh my God. That’s why everyone is 
                        staring and pointing at me.

           Earl glances quickly at the other students, who are of course 
           paying them NO ATTENTION AT ALL.
                                 EARL
                        Ain’t nobody starin at your goofy 
                        ass.

                                 GREG
                        Oh.

                                 EARL
                        Naw. You’re just high as hell. 
                        Paranoid, son.

                                 GREG
                        That’s a relief.
                             (worriedly)
                        I think.

                                 EARL
                        C’mon, let’s go to your house. Mack 
                        on some grub.

           INT. BUS ON THE WAY HOME - TEN MINUTES LATER

           GREG is still wild-eyed and looking around suspiciously, and 
           trying to be less conspicuous by slouching in his seat. This 
           behavior is extremely conspicuous.

           EARL is trying to distract him.

                                 EARL
                        This shit is lights-out. Damn. 
                        McCarthy be using this all the 
                        time, huh.

                                 GREG
                             (nodding)
                        uunnnggh.

                                 EARL
                        Do he act all stoned and shit? 
                        While he teaching?

                                 GREG
                        Uh. I guess he, uh... Not all the 
                        time, but like, sometimes... or not 
                        sometimes, but... You know how he 
                        is, he’s uh... Huh.

                                 EARL
                        Goddamn, son. You can’t even put a 
                        goddamn sentence together.

           Something tickles Greg and he giggles. It’s his cell phone.
           It’s a message from Rachel: “just found out im having chemo 
           on thurs :( ... i could use a little cheering up ...”

                                 GREG
                        Chee... mo.

                                 EARL
                             (reading the text)
                        Chemotherapy, son.

                                 GREG
                        Ohhhh.

                                 EARL
                        You get injected with chemicals and 
                        all your hair fall out.

                                 GREG
                        Ohhhh.

                                 EARL
                        You basically get sick as hell.

                                 GREG
                        I guess we have to go there now.

                                 EARL
                        Yup.

           They’re both silent.

                                 GREG
                             (loudly)
                        It’s insane that Mr. McCarthy puts 
                        drugs in his soup.

                                 EARL
                        Keep your damn voice down.

           Indeed. Sitting behind them is SCOTT MAYHEW.

           He has heard everything.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RACHEL’S DOORSTEP

           Greg and Earl are standing on the doorstep. They both look 
           terrified. Denise opens the door, swaying a little.

                                 DENISE
                        It’s my humble little mouse! And 
                        who is his little mouse friend?
           Neither Greg nor Earl says anything. Then they both say 
           something at the same time.

                                 DENISE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry?

                              confrontational)
                        Earl Jackson.

                                 GREG
                        Earl’s just, uh, you know, he’s my 
                        coworker, and he’s a great guy, and 
                        we were just hanging out, uhhh... 
                        and not really doing anything, and 
                        Rachel sent us this, uh, text, and 
                        we just wanted to say hey, you 
                        know, what’s up. Say goodbye to her 
                        hair. She’s gonna look great 
                        without hair. That’s a fact. So we 
                        just wanted to say, what’s up.

           But Denise isn’t sober enough to realize they’re being weird.

                                 DENISE
                        RACHEL! We’ve got two cute little 
                        mouse boys on our doorstep.

                        No! This room is great! What are 
                        you talking about?
                                 EARL
                        Course it’s girly. My room don’t 
                        have no pictures of James Bond in 
                        no... thong.

                                 GREG
                             (laughing nervously)
                        Heh heh.

           An uneasy silence.

                                 EARL
                        So Rachel, we came to... see how 
                        you was doin.

                                 RACHEL
                        Thanks.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, chemotherapy. That really 
                        sucks.

                                 EARL
                             (shoving Greg)
                        Dude. What the hell.

                                 GREG
                        What?!

                                 EARL
                        Don’t say it sucks.

                                 RACHEL
                        It does kind of suck.

                                 EARL
                        Yeah, but you gotta do it, and it 
                        might help you out.

                                 RACHEL
                        I guess.

           By this point Rachel and Earl are both staring at the ground. 
           Clearly Greg has to say something.

                                 GREG
                        Uhhhhh.

           Earl and Rachel look at him expectantly. Greg literally 
           cannot think of a thing to say. He opens his mouth and hopes 
           words will come out.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Buhhhhhh.
                                 RACHEL
                             (beginning to sound 
                              tearful)
                        You guys can go if you want.

           Greg panics.

                                 GREG
                        We’re on drugs.

                                 EARL
                             (face in hands again)
                        Goddamn.

                                 RACHEL
                        Why are you on drugs?

                                 GREG
                        We’re accidentally on drugs.

                                 RACHEL
                        Accidentally?

                                 EARL
                        McCarthy gave us some of his soup--

                                 GREG
                             (hastily)
                        Mr. McCarthy gave us some of his 
                        totally normal soup. But it was, 
                        uh, the last of the soup. So we had 
                        to go get more. From a restaurant. 
                        On the fifth floor of an office 
                        building. And in the same building 
                        there was a Jamaican embassy.

           No one knows where this is going.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        We got trapped in an elevator with 
                        a Rastafarian. He just hotboxed the 
                        whole elevator. We were in there 
                        for twenty-five minutes. We had to 
                        breathe the weird marijuana air. 
                        Earl. Am I right.

           Earl is utterly disgusted. But he has to go along with it.

                                 EARL
                        Yeah. Sure. That’s what happened.

           But thank God: Rachel thinks that these confused, lying boys 
           are being kind of sweet.
                                 RACHEL
                        You guys had quite an adventure, 
                        huh.

                                 GREG
                        I hate being on drugs. I feel like 
                        an ass right now. I’m sorry we came 
                        over while we were on drugs.

                                 EARL
                        Man, what the hell’s wrong with 
                        you. All apologetic and shit. Makin 
                        errything about your sorry ass. 
                        That ain’t why we came over here.
                             (to Rachel)
                        I’m in the mood for some damn ice 
                        cream. You like ice cream?

           EXT. TABLE OUTSIDE ICE-CREAM PLACE

           EARL and RACHEL are chatting. GREG is utterly absorbed in his 
           ice cream, holding it several inches in front of his face.

           Super: The part where Earl betrays our entire creative 
           partnership

                                 RACHEL
                        So you know Greg from class?

                                 EARL
                        I known Greg ever since we was 
                        little. You know I was in y’all’s 
                        kindergarten, right?

                                 RACHEL
                        Really?

                                 EARL
                        Yeah. I remember you. You were the 
                        girl who called Justin Jones 
                        perverted, for showing girls the 
                        birthmark on his butt.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oh my God! I remember that!

                                 EARL
                        I was right there. Dude came 
                        running up to you and showed you 
                        his butt. You was all calm. You 
                        said, “Justin. Only perverts show 
                        their butts.”
                                 RACHEL
                        It’s amazing you remember that.

                                 EARL
                        I’ll never forget it. “Only 
                        perverts show their butts.”

                                 RACHEL
                        So you and Greg are coworkers?

                                 EARL
                        Naw, we friends. But he don’t say 
                        that.

                                 RACHEL
                        Why?

                                 EARL
                        Dude’s got issues...

                        Look at his home life. Dude’s mom 
                        always tellin him how handsome he 
                        is, which he ain’t. So he think he 
                        can’t trust what anybody says. 
                        Dude’s weird-ass dad don’t 
                        socialize with nobody cept the damn 
                        cat. So that’s a role model ain’t 
                        got no friends. Add it up. 

                        Bottom line, dude’s biggest fear 
                        is, one day he gonna call somebody 
                        his friend, and they gonna tell 
                        him, I ain’t your friend.

                                 RACHEL
                        Wow.
                             (beat)
                        But how are you “coworkers”?

           Earl regards her and silently comes to a decision.

                                 EARL
                        Well, we uh... we make films.

                                 RACHEL
                        Movies?

                                 EARL
                        Yeah. We been makin em for years. 
                        We made like 42 films in total.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, you never told me!
           GREG’S POV:

           Rachel’s voice is indistinct, underwater. He cannot hear much 
           over the “MURMF ORMF RUMF” sound of his own rapturous eating.

           Also the beautiful harp music is playing.

           BACK TO THIRD-PERSON:

           Greg nods briskly, goes “mm-hmm,” and goes back to eating.

                                 EARL
                        We ain’t told nobody about em. They 
                        ain’t that good. And Greg self-
                        conscious as hell.

                                 RACHEL
                        They’re probably really good.

           Again, Earl appraises Rachel before speaking.

                                 EARL
                        Well, you can see em for yourself 
                        if you want.

                                 RACHEL
                             (knowing that this is a 
                              big deal)
                        Are you sure?

                                 EARL
                        Hell yeah, don’t even worry bout 
                        it. Just don’t be tellin nobody.

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course I won’t.

           Earl stands up, pulling Greg up with him.

                                 EARL
                        Aight, son. Get on your feet.

                                 GREG
                        Sounds good.
                             (beat)
                        Where are we going?

           INT. GREG’S TV ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

           The three of them are watching a Gaines/Jackson film. EARL is 
           stony-faced. RACHEL is enjoying it hugely.

           GREG looks ill.
           EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - AFTERWARD

           RACHEL is about to walk back to her house.

                                 EARL
                        Aight Rachel. I’ll see you round.

                                 RACHEL
                        Earl! Thank you so much!

           Delighted, she hugs him.

                                 GREG
                        Bye Rachel.

                                 RACHEL
                        Bye Greg.

           She walks happily away.

                                 GREG
                        Goddammit Earl--

                                 EARL
                        Son, don’t even start.

           They sit there in silence, Earl serene, Greg fuming.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        So we’re pretty far into this 
                        stupid story now, and you’re 
                        probably saying to yourself, “Hey. 
                        I like this girl Rachel, and I’m 
                        gonna be pissed if she dies at the 
                        end.” So I’m just telling you: 
                        Don’t freak out. She survives. When 
                        I said someone dies, I meant 
                        someone else.

                        So hopefully that reassures you. 

                        Although actually, why would it.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

           MR. MCCARTHY sips from his thermos.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Guys. I’m asking for one fact. This 
                        is probably the easiest thing you 
                        have been asked all day. Anyone. 
                        Greg, thank you.
           GREG has his hand raised. He is sitting next to MADISON.

                                 GREG
                        Fact: I want to nuzzle my face in 
                        Madison’s boobs like an 
                        affectionate panda cub.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        That is a fact, but it has pretty 
                        limited historical relevance. Maybe 
                        you can dig deeper.

                                 GREG
                        Fact: I’m never going to get to 
                        nuzzle Madison’s boobs because she 
                        dates college students. She’s 
                        dating one right now.

                                 MADISON
                        It’s true. He has a really great 
                        penis.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        The problem is that you’ve combined 
                        the factual with the speculative. 
                        You think you’re not going to get 
                        with Madison, but can you actually 
                        call that a fact? Greg? Greg. 
                        Hello. Greg.

           Greg snaps out of his DAYDREAM--he’s had his hand up, but he 
           hasn’t actually said any of those boob-related things.

                                 GREG
                        Uh! Fact: The Berlin Airlift lasted 
                        322 days.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Greg Gaines explodes out of his 
                        coma with a devastating fact. Now 
                        can Scott Mayhew keep the fact 
                        train rolling.

           Scott Mayhew has had his hand up in the air. He points to Mr. 
           McCarthy’s thermos.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        Fact: Greg was telling everyone 
                        that your soup has marijuana in it.

           The class is stunned/giggly. Greg does not know what to do.

                                 GREG
                        I didn’t tell anyone!
                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        Greg, you are a liar and a coward. 
                        I heard you bellowing about it on 
                        public transportation.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Greg? Is that factual?

                                 GREG
                             (defensively)
                        Look. I’m sorry. But yesterday, 
                        Earl and I got stoned somehow. And 
                        it was after we both ate your soup. 
                        And we didn’t smoke any marijuana 
                        out of anything. So, your soup must 
                        have had drugs in it. Because other 
                        than the cookies that Earl got from 
                        Ill Phil, the drug dealer, that was 
                        the only thing we, uh... that we 
                        both ate...

           EXT. IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - THAT AFTERNOON

           GREG and EARL are exiting the school together.

                                 GREG
                        How did you not realize it was the 
                        cookies?

                                 EARL
                        Shut your stupid ass up and let’s 
                        go to your house. I need to get my 
                        grub on.

           But behind them, MR. MCCARTHY, a VICE PRINCIPAL, and a 
           SECURITY GUARD burst through the door, escorting an angry, 
           struggling ILL PHIL off the premises.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        Greg! Did you rat me out?

                                 GREG
                        What? Uh, no.

           SCOTT MAYHEW has positioned himself nearby.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                             (to Ill Phil)
                        He did rat you out. I was there.

                                 GREG
                        Scott, what the hell.
           Scott draws close to Greg. He is a lot taller than Greg.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        I heard you ridiculing me in front 
                        of your loathsome harem.
                             (whispering intensely)
                        Greg, I trusted you. You betrayed 
                        my trust. You trampled my dignity.

                                 GREG
                        It was like one time.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        You have made a mortal enemy. I 
                        will never stop hounding you.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        You got two mortal enemies.
                             (whispering into Greg’s 
                              other ear)
                        I stabbed a dude.

                                 GREG
                        Jesus.

                                 ILL PHIL
                             (breaking determinedly 
                              into a flow)
                        Kill you twenty different ways / 
                        Stab you with blades /
                        Shoot you with death rays /

           The security guard starts dragging him away.

                                 ILL PHIL (CONT’D)
                        Abandon you in a maze /
                        Drown you in mayonnaise /
                        Trample you under the Macy’s 
                        Thanksgiving Day Parade /

           Greg and Earl turn to Scott Mayhew.

                                 SCOTT MAYHEW
                        He, too, will never stop hounding 
                        you.

           Scott Mayhew spits on the ground near them and strides away.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

           GREG is visiting RACHEL. She is pale and weak-looking. Her 
           head has been recently shaven. All of the horizontal surfaces 
           of the room are overflowing with flowers and cards.
                                 GREG
                        Oh dammit. I should’ve brought 
                        flowers.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s probably better that you 
                        didn’t. The only place left to put 
                        them is the barf bucket.

                                 GREG
                        Harf!
                             (composing himself)
                        Sorry, I wasn’t expecting you to 
                        make me laugh. That’s why the laugh 
                        came out weird.

                                 RACHEL
                        Don’t sweat it.

                                 GREG
                        So you, uh... you look good.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, clearly I don’t look good.

                                 GREG
                        Nope.
                             (hastily)
                        I mean, you look good for someone 
                        doing chemo. It’s obviously 
                        relative. You’re actually the chemo 
                        equivalent of Mila Kunis right now.

                                 RACHEL
                        So your cousin Joel’s showing you 
                        his college tonight?

           Greg is trying to hide how pumped he is for this.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. I mean, it’ll probably be 
                        pretty lame. Like just a bunch of 
                        boring intellectuals, discussing 
                        Lionel Trilling or something.

           Beat.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hey. I had a really great time on 
                        Monday, with you and Earl.

                                 GREG
                        Oh yeah? Yeah. Me too.
                                 RACHEL
                        Yeah. Look. I know you don’t like 
                        the idea of people seeing your 
                        films. But what if you know for a 
                        fact they’re enjoying them?

                                 GREG
                        That’s like an impossible thought 
                        experiment.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, it’s lonely and boring in 
                        here. I’d just really like 
                        something to watch.

           It takes Greg a moment to realize what she’s asking.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to show them to 
                        anyone. I promise.

           Greg considers pretending to be dead.

                                 GREG
                        You know what sucks? I can’t even 
                        pretend to be dead right now. I’m 
                        in a stupid hospital. Someone might 
                        actually think I’m dead.

                                 RACHEL
                        Please, Greg?

                                 GREG
                        UGH. FINE.

           Rachel beams, briefly; for a moment, joy flushes the 
           suffering and exhaustion from her face. Then a NURSE enters.

                                 NURSE
                        Visiting hours are over, Romeo.

                                 GREG
                        Okay. See you tomorrow.

                                 RACHEL
                             (calling after him)
                        Have fun with the intellectuals!

           INT. DORM ROOM - THAT EVENING

           COUSIN JOEL is farting six inches from the face of his 
           unconscious roommate, KEV-DOGG, as a third roommate, FAT 
           STEVE, videotapes it.
           GREG, in the hallway, slams the door shut in horror.

                                 JOEL (O.S.)
                        Greg! Get in here! I’m pwning Kev-
                        Dogg!

                                 FAT STEVE (O.S.)
                        PWNAGE!!

           Greg leans back against the wall. He has just seen his 
           favorite cousin fart on a dude’s face.

           He is trying to come to grips with that.

           JOEL and FAT STEVE emerge from the room and lead Greg away. 
           They are headed to their frat. A night of horror has begun.

                                 JOEL
                        Cuz! Welcome to college! Time to 
                        get rowdyyyyyy!!!!!!

                                 GREG
                        Wait. I didn’t know we were getting 
                        rowdy.

           INT. FRAT KITCHEN - TEN MINUTES LATER

           A spattered reeking crowded hellhole of a kitchen. FAT STEVE 
           is duct-taping 40 oz. bottles of King Cobra to Greg’s hands.

           The music is loud and everyone has to SHOUT OVER IT. Perhaps 
           it is LCD SOUNDSYSTEM - DAFT PUNK IS PLAYING AT MY HOUSE.

                                 JOEL
                        It’s called Edward Fortyhands. Once 
                        you finish both of them, you get 
                        your hands back.

           Elsewhere in the kitchen, some LONG-HAIRED GOATEED ASSHOLE is 
           spanking ANOTHER DUDE’S ASS with a staff made out of beer 
           cans. A THRONG of ONLOOKERS are wildly excited about this.

                                 ONLOOKERS
                        ALL HAIL KING DIRK! ALL HAIL KING 
                        DIRK!

           GREG sneaks to the SINK to pour out his forties. He is seen 
           by the goateed dickbag, a.k.a. KING DIRK.

                                 KING DIRK
                        PARTY FOUL. Who’s this loser?

           JOEL elbows his way to Greg’s side.
                                 JOEL
                        All hail King Dirk. This is my 
                        cousin Greg. He’s still in high 
                        school. But he’s a solid bro, man.

                                 KING DIRK
                        Pouring out your forties is very un-
                        bro behavior. FILL THEM WITH VODKA.

           FRATTY DUDES hustle over and slosh vodka into Greg’s bottles.

                                 KING DIRK (CONT’D)
                        HA HA HA HA HA.

                                 ONLOOKERS
                        ALL HAIL KING DIRK!

           EXT. GAMMA GAMMA BACK PORCH

           GREG is woozy. JOEL is furtively helping him drink the vodka.

                                 JOEL
                        He’s the president of Gamma Gamma. 
                        He’s actually a totally solid guy, 
                        he’s just rough on newcomers.

                                 GREG
                        Everyone has to call him King?

                                 JOEL
                        Yeah, he’s a total bad-ass.
                             (drinking)
                        College, man! This is gonna be your 
                        life next year! Can you believe it?

           INT. GAMMA GAMMA KITCHEN

           GREG is alone, sitting splay-legged on the floor. He has the 
           handle of a giant kitchen knife in his mouth. With grim 
           determination, he slashes at the duct tape tying his hands to 
           the bottles. He cuts one away. Success!

           He slashes at the second one.

           He has done some kind of damage to his hand. It is difficult 
           to tell what. There is some blood.

           He looks up. KING DIRK has just wandered into the kitchen.

           Their eyes meet.

           Greg hiccups.

           BROTHERS are pinning GREG to the ground, face-up. KING DIRK 
           is lecturing him in the manner of an ARCHVILLAIN.

                                 KING DIRK
                        We meet again, noob. Looks like 
                        someone’s never even seen the movie 
                        Edward Fortyhands. What do you have 
                        to say for yourself?

                                 GREG
                             (slurring speech)
                        I’m giving you guys a low score... 
                        in Intellectualism.

                                 KING DIRK
                        PWNAGE.

           He lowers his pants over his buttocks and squats down over 
           Greg’s face as the ONLOOKING FRAT BROTHERS erupt in delight.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. JOEL’S COMMON ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           JOEL and GREG are drinking beers out of cans and watching FAT 
           STEVE play CALL OF DUTY.

           Greg’s hand is wrapped in a bloody gym sock.

           Joel and Greg are stuporous with hangovers. They sit. They 
           watch. Fat Steve gruesomely murders five people.

           Suddenly Greg topples over.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - HOURS LATER

           GREG’S POV. He’s in a hospital bed. His MOM is gazing at him 
           with motherly anxiety. A DOCTOR is in there with her.

           Super: The part where I am lying in a hospital bed with no 
           more faith or interest in my future ever again

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Oh my sweetie. My poor brave boy. 
                        Everything’s gonna be fine, 
                        sweetie.
                                 DOCTOR
                             (reassuringly)
                        Greg, with therapy, your left thumb 
                        should recover up to 90% of its 
                        original range of movement. But our 
                        more immediate priority is to fight 
                        the infection.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        They wrapped it in a gym sock.

                                                            GREG BLINKS 
                                                           HEAVILY, AND 
                                                          WHEN HE OPENS 
                                                              HIS EYES:

           Now it’s EARL visiting him, reading from a list.

                                 EARL
                        You gotta write a essay. You gotta 
                        do a list of problems out of some 
                        book. You supposed to take some 
                        kinda test while you in here. I got 
                        no idea how the hell that supposed 
                        to happen so my advice is don’t 
                        worry about it.

                                                            GREG BLINKS 
                                                                 AGAIN:

           And now it’s his DAD, clutching a stack of applications with 
           MAGENTA POST-ITS.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        My wayward son. Early-action 
                        deadlines approach. So you’ll want 
                        to get a move on these.

                        You’re probably wondering where Cat 
                        Stevens is. It seems that this 
                        hospital enforces a kind of 
                        apartheid against cats. History 
                        will not judge them kindly for it.

                                                           GREG BLINKS:

           And it’s his MOM again, plus MR. MCCARTHY.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Sweetie, I just thought it would be 
                        a good idea to bring Mr. McCarthy 
                        to talk to you a little about 
                        colleges.
                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Hey bud. I heard you had kind of a 
                        rough time, and

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        You’re thinking, no matter where 
                        you go, college will be like that 
                        horrible fraternity. But that’s 
                        just not true. Sorry. Go ahead.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Yeah, I guess I just want to say

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        The most important thing is, no 
                        matter where you go, everyone is 
                        going to accept you for the 
                        intelligent talented, handsome 
                        young man that you are. Sorry.

           Mr. McCarthy is realizing that he will not get all that many 
           words in.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Bud. All I want to say is: You’re a 
                        beast. 

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        You are. You are a very handsome 
                        young beast.

                                                           GREG BLINKS:

           EARL again.

                                 EARL
                        I just saw your girl. She bald as 
                        hell right now. She look like Darth 
                        Vader without the helmet. She axed 
                        me for some of our films so I lent 
                        em to her.

           Earl reacts to what must be a look of unease on Greg’s face.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        Better not gimme shit about it. 
                        I’ll whoop your nasty infected ass.

                                                           GREG BLINKS:

           Now MADISON is in the room.

                                 MADISON
                        Booooooooobs
           We snap out of Greg’s POV.

                                 GREG
                        Huh?

                                 MADISON
                        I said “yo.”

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Yo.

                                 MADISON
                        I was just visiting Rachel and I 
                        thought I’d come see you too.

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Thanks.
                             (attempting nonchalance)
                        You should have told me you were 
                        coming, I would’ve tried not to 
                        smell as weird.

                                 MADISON
                        Do you smell weird?

                                 GREG
                        I’m assuming I do. I have chronic 
                        congestion problems, so I can never 
                        really tell how weird I’m smelling.

           Jesus, Greg. What are you doing.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        But hey. Enough about me.

                                 MADISON
                             (cheerfully ignoring this)
                        So I just wanted to say: I was just 
                        in Rachel’s room, and she was 
                        watching one of your movies, and I 
                        think it’s really sweet what you’re 
                        doing for her.

           Greg is frozen with horror.

                                 GREG
                        Which, uh... Did... Did you get to 
                        see... ooh.

                                 MADISON
                        I just wanted to tell you how 
                        touched I am. You’re being an 
                        amazing friend to her.
           Greg decides that now is the time for excessive modesty.

                                 GREG
                        I’m probably not being that good of 
                        a friend.

                                 MADISON
                        No, really. Greg. You’re being a 
                        good friend to her.

                                 GREG
                        No I’m really not.

                                 MADISON
                        Are you serious right now? Greg. 
                        Why are you arguing about this.

                                 GREG
                        No, when I’m with her I basically 
                        just talk about myself the whole 
                        time. I’m a bad listener.

                                 MADISON
                        Well it’s really cheering her up.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, I really doubt it.

                                 MADISON
                        Greg. Oh my God. She told me. That 
                        you’ve been a great friend.

                                 GREG
                        She was probably lying.

                                 MADISON
                        Why would she lie?

                                 GREG
                        I don’t know. Girls are weird.

                                 MADISON
                        No. You’re weird.

                                 GREG
                        No, you’re weird. I’m the only 
                        normal one.

           Madison stares at him, then suddenly giggles.

                                 MADISON
                        Oh my God, you’re so weird. I love 
                        that about you. You’re just so 
                        weird.
           Greg’s eyes widen.

                                 MADISON (CONT’D)
                        Anyway. I just think it’s really 
                        sweet that you’ve been showing 
                        Rachel your secret movies, and I 
                        was sort of thinking... what if you 
                        made Rachel a movie?

           Brief BLACKOUT with the words “NOW YOU ARE DEAD.”

                                 GREG
                        That’s a terrible idea.

                                 MADISON
                             (sweetly)
                        Greg, it’s obviously a great idea. 
                        Your secret movies are Rachel’s 
                        favorite thing in the world.

                                 GREG
                        No, seriously--the films we make, 
                        they’re not--

                                 MADISON
                        Greg. Ugh. I get it. You have 
                        issues with being complimented. You 
                        need to learn how to take 
                        compliments.

           Greg is incredulous that she has actually taken the time to 
           make an insightful observation about him.

                                 GREG
                        Word.

                                 MADISON
                        Did you just say, “Word”?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, word, like, I agree.

                                 MADISON
                        So you agree! To make a movie! For 
                        Rachel!

           She clutches his arm. MOOSE CHIPMUNK STOMPING.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I’ll definitely, uh... start 
                        thinking about it.
           EXT. THE GAINES FAMILY CAR - THE NEXT DAY

           GREG’S DAD is driving GREG home from the hospital.

                                 GREG
                        Hey Dad. That crazy party that Joel 
                        took me to--that’s not typical for 
                        college, right?

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        The binge culture you experienced 
                        is quite typical. Most of my 
                        students are drunken imbeciles.

                                 GREG
                             (desperate to keep hope 
                              alive)
                        But they’re not all like that, 
                        right?

                                 GREG’S DAD
                             (oblivious to Greg’s 
                              worry)
                        No, no. Some of them are sober 
                        imbeciles.

           Greg’s dad laughs at his own joke.

           Greg peers miserably out the window.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

           GREG is erasing the colorful table of college visits on his 
           WHITEBOARD. Goodbye, colleges.

           He contemplates his meticulously, beautifully organized 
           COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

           With a heavy heart, he begins stripping it of its Post-Its.

           INT. RACHEL’S HOSPITAL ROOM - A DAY OR TWO LATER

           GREG enters. His hand is bandaged up.

           RACHEL is wearing a pink fuzzy hat and is watching a 
           Gaines/Jackson film: Star Wars, with sock puppets.

                                 GREG
                        Yo.
                                 RACHEL
                             (quoting the film)
                        May the farts be with you.

                                 GREG
                             (despondently)
                        Yeah.

           He slumps into a chair. She pauses the film.

                                 RACHEL
                        I haven’t seen you in a while.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. My college tour didn’t get a 
                        great start. Actually, I don’t want 
                        to talk about it.
                             (beat)
                        How’s, uh... chemo and stuff.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s not much fun. But at least I 
                        get to watch these.

                                 GREG
                             (bitterly)
                        Yeah. I’m glad Madison gets to 
                        watch them too. That’s so great.

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you serious?

                                 GREG
                        Sorry, I know I’m not allowed to 
                        complain. Because then I’m a dick.

                                 RACHEL
                             (hurt)
                        Greg, Madison walked in without 
                        knocking. I shut the movie off and 
                        she didn’t see any of it. Jesus.

           Greg realizes that he has been a dick.

                                 GREG
                        Urrrnrrnnnngh.
                             (after no response)
                        Urrrnnnrnrnnnnnrnggggghggh.

                                 RACHEL
                        What is that noise.

                                 GREG
                        Regretful Polar Bear.
           Against her will, Rachel snort-laughs a little bit.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Polar bears have the purest 
                        expressions of regret in the animal 
                        kingdom. Listen to how haunting and 
                        plaintive they sound. Urrrrnnrnngh.

                                 RACHEL
                        Actually Greg you shouldn’t try to 
                        make me laugh.

                                 GREG
                        Oops sorry.

                                 RACHEL
                        No, I like the polar bear, but when 
                        I laugh it kind of hurts.

           Another silence.

                                 GREG
                        I’m being a dick about the films. I 
                        do want you to see them.

                                 RACHEL
                        It’s fine if you don’t.

                                 GREG
                        No, I’m gonna bring you a film a 
                        day. It’s called Gregflix. Plus for 
                        free you get annoying director’s 
                        commentary, as a bonus.

                                 RACHEL
                        Is there a button to shut it off?

                                 GREG
                        Gregflix is still working on that. 
                        If you stick some ice cream in the 
                        machine, that usually stops the 
                        commentary for a minute.

           They watch the Gaines/Jackson movie.

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - DAYS GO BY

           GREG and RACHEL watch movies together, in her bedroom. The 
           days melt into each other. Fall becomes winter. Rachel 
           becomes sicker.

           Super: Day 24 of Doomed Friendship
           ON THE SCREEN: Greg is dressed like Batman, Earl is dressed 
           like Spiderman. They fight.

           ON THE BED: Greg is holding popcorn; Rachel is nibbling some.

           Super: Day 31 of Doomed Friendship

           ON THE SCREEN: Greg, playing James Bond, has woken up in bed 
           with a sock puppet.

           ON THE BED: Greg eats popcorn; Rachel holds a barf bucket.

           Super: Day 45 of Doomed Friendship

           ON THE SCREEN: Earl is Anton Chigurh, from No Country for Old 
           Men. Greg is the hapless gas-station guy.

           ON THE BED: Greg, holding popcorn, looks at Rachel. She has 
           fallen asleep.

           He fades the volume to silent, takes the barf bucket out of 
           her hands, and pulls her blanket over her.

           He stays in the room, watching the muted (and increasingly 
           violent) movie, sitting next to the sleeping girl.

           “NOW YOU ARE DEAD,” the screen tells him.

           He has a sudden worry. Discreetly, he puts his hand over her 
           mouth, to see if she is dead.

           She is not, thank God.

           INT. BENSON SCHOOL HALLWAY - ONE DAY IN JANUARY

           GREG is walking through a little-used corridor, wincing from 
           the weight of his backpack. A RANDOM GIRL is putting up 
           medieval decorations in the hall.

                                 RANDOM GIRL
                        Buy tickets for prom! A “Knight” to 
                        “Remember”! Only four months away!!

                                 GREG
                             (to himself)
                        Why are there even quotation marks 
                        around “Remember”?--

           Greg is AMBUSHED mid-mutter by MADISON.

                                 MADISON
                        Hi Greg. So how’s the movie for 
                        Rachel coming?
           She smiles hopefully at Greg.

           FANTASY SEQUENCE in which Greg briefly envisions telling 
           Madison the truth:

                                 GREG
                        It’s not. I’m not making a film for 
                        Rachel.

                                 MADISON
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I said I’d start thinking 
                        about it, and, you know, I stopped 
                        thinking about it.

           Beat.

                                 MADISON
                        Is that a motherfucking joke?

           END FANTASY SEQUENCE. Madison is continuing to smile 
           hopefully at Greg.

                                 GREG
                        I’m doing it. I’m really making 
                        that film.

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah, I know. How’s it going?

                                 GREG
                        Really, uh. Really good.
                             (hastily)
                        Pretty good. I mean, not that good. 
                        You’re probably gonna hate it.

                                 MADISON
                        I cannot wait to see it. So how 
                        soon do you think--

                                 GREG
                             (panicking)
                        So, prom, huh? Can you believe it’s 
                        in just four months?

                                 MADISON
                        Ugh, my boyfriend doesn’t want to 
                        go. He’s being such a dork.
                             (playfully)
                        Maybe I should take someone else. 
                        Greg, you’re probably a good 
                        dancer. What do you think?
           Greg simply stares at her in bewilderment.

                                 MADISON (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        I’m kidding!

                                 GREG
                             (terrified)
                        Ha ha!

                                 MADISON
                             (departing)
                        I can’t wait to see the movie.

           Greg, semi-catatonic, gapes at her as she walks away.

           A MOOSE IS JUST PSYCHOTICALLY JUMPING UP AND DOWN ON A 
           CHIPMUNK.

           INT. GAINES KITCHEN - THAT AFTERNOON

           EARL is eating pate. GREG is freaking out.

           Super: The part where I try to convince Earl to help me make 
           The Worst Film Ever Made

                                 GREG
                        So if we make this film, everyone’s 
                        gonna be like, oh, Greg Gaines, 
                        he’s that weird filmmaker. He’s 
                        always filming stuff. It’s so 
                        creepy. He probably sneaks up to 
                        your house at night and films you 
                        while you’re asleep.

                                 EARL
                             (chewing)
                        This is nasty as hell.

                                 GREG
                        But people probably already think 
                        that. Because you decided we should 
                        give those stupid films to Rachel. 
                        So basically I’ve become completely 
                        conspicuous, like, all the time. 
                        People look at me, they think, 
                        filmmaker, and they think, cancer 
                        girl’s boyfriend.

                                 EARL
                             (examining container)
                        The hell even is this. This taste 
                        like a dog’s funky-ass butthole.
                                 GREG
                        And furthermore, we’ve agree to do 
                        this film, that I don’t even have 
                        any idea what it should look like, 
                        or be. What the hell film can we 
                        even make?

                                 EARL
                        Man, you agreed to this bullshit. 
                        Not me.

                                 GREG
                        What was I thinking.

                                 EARL
                        You were thinking, that girl 
                        Madison got big-ass titties. I like 
                        the titties.

                                 GREG
                        Here’s the thing. How can you say 
                        to anyone, “No, sorry, I’m not 
                        going to make a film for my friend 
                        who is dying of cancer.”

                                 EARL
                        You say it exactly like you just 
                        said. “No. I ain’t makin that 
                        ridiculous-ass film.”

                                 GREG
                             (suddenly worried)
                        Wait. Are you not gonna help me 
                        make this?

           Earl stares him down while eating another pate-laden cracker.

                                 EARL
                             (finally)
                        What can we even do, son? The same 
                        kinda film we always make? With 
                        some dumbass sock puppets beatin 
                        the hell out of each other?

           They contemplate this.

           Leukemia.

                                 GREG (O.S.)
                        Ow. Okay Earl stop. Earl chill out 
                        for a second.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM

           They’ve just finished watching the footage.

                                 EARL
                        It’s like a fucked-up version of 
                        Sesame Street or some shit.

                                 GREG
                        It definitely sucks, but I’m having 
                        trouble pinpointing why exactly.

                                 EARL
                        You’d have to be dumb as hell to do 
                        a cancer movie with sock puppets. 
                        That’s why it sucks.
                                 GREG
                        We have to try something different. 
                        Look. I think we have to do a 
                        documentary-type thing.

                                 EARL
                             (scornfully)
                        What, like: Rachel, you about to 
                        die, so we summarized your life. 
                        Here it go.

                                 GREG
                        No. Come on. It’ll be like: here’s 
                        your life! Look how great it is! 
                        So, maybe you should keep living.

           Earl is skeptical.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        We just have to make it look like 
                        her life doesn’t suck.

           INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           EARL is working the cameras while GREG, holding a notebook, 
           is attempting to interview DENISE, who is openly drinking.

           It’s not entirely clear that Denise knows that they’re making 
           a film, or cares.

                                 GREG
                        So, Denise, I just want to ask you 
                        a few questions for this film we’re 
                        making about Rachel. Can you tell 
                        us a little about Rachel’s birth?

                                 DENISE
                        Rachel’s birth. What an ordeal.
                             (beat)
                        Greg, listen to me. Listen. I’ve 
                        been a good mother to her. Some 
                        single moms, their kids have to 
                        grow up too fast. But I’ve tried to 
                        protect her from that. I have.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, right.

                                 DENISE
                        And now I’m learning, some things, 
                        you can’t protect your kid from. No 
                        matter what you do.
           Denise sips from her glass of bourbon, her gunmetal eyes 
           reflecting some tiny part of the crushing horror of it.

                                 GREG
                        So did she have a favorite toy?

                                 DENISE
                        Promise me one thing. You’re gonna 
                        grow up, become an adult. Promise 
                        me you won’t have a baby unless 
                        you’re ready to love that baby’s 
                        mother, your whole life.

                                 GREG
                        So, no favorite toy.

           Denise starts pouring drinks for Greg and Earl.

                                 DENISE
                        Have a little taste with me. You’re 
                        old enough to have a little taste.

                                 GREG
                             (desperately)
                        Do you maybe have any home videos 
                        we could use?

           EXT. A COLD BEACH ON AN OVERCAST DAY - 2002

           (This is a HOME VIDEO that Greg and Earl are watching.)

           SIX-YEAR-OLD RACHEL is sitting heavily on a towel, doing 
           nothing, facing the sea.

                                 DENISE (O.S.)
                        Hi honey!

           Rachel turns, but says nothing. Her face is expressionless.

                                 DENISE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Here we are on beautiful Prince 
                        Edward Island. There’s little 
                        Rachel, and there’s Bill.

           Pan to BILL, Rachel’s now-estranged father. He is in a beach 
           chair with two beer holders, both holding beers.

                                 BILL
                        We’re having a GREAT TIME.

                                 DENISE (O.S.)
                        Bill’s a little grumpy because of 
                        the weather!
                                 BILL
                        Denise, can you just turn that 
                        thing off.

                                 DENISE (O.S.)
                        Can you at least try to enjoy 
                        yourself.

                                 BILL
                        What the heck does it look like I’m 
                        doing.

           Pause.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GREG’S TV ROOM - EVENING

           EARL has paused this unspeakably saddening video.

                                 EARL
                        We probably shouldn’t even be 
                        watchin this.

                                 GREG
                        Jesus, that was depressing. Jesus.

                                 EARL
                        That the only video?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. Look, I was wrong. We have to 
                        come up with something else.

           Earl is sullenly eating some kind of jerky.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        We’re just too weird. That’s the 
                        problem. We need to think about 
                        what a normal person would make, 
                        when someone is dying. What do 
                        normal people do?

           INT. MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

           The room is empty, save for GREG and EARL sitting in chairs 
           with clipboards and a STUDENT, sitting in a chair, facing a 
           camera on a tripod.

           Greg is trying to mask how depressed and upset this is making 
           him. Earl physically cannot stop scowling.
                                 GREG
                        ...So just think of it like a get-
                        well card, except it’s a video. And 
                        just start whenever you’re ready.

                                 TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #1
                             (with glib, smiley 
                              insincerity)
                        Uh. Hi, Rachel. I guess I don’t 
                        know you that well, but uh... I 
                        believe in you.
                             (beat)
                        You can do it!

           That is all that this kid has to say.

                                 EARL
                             (sullenly)
                        That’s real nice.

           POV of camera on tripod:

                                 TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #2
                        It’s so sweet that your boyfriend 
                        is doing this for you! He must 
                        really love you.
                             (Greg says something 
                              inaudible offscreen)
                        Oh.

                                 TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #3
                        I know you’re Jewish, but I just 
                        want you to know, God has a plan 
                        for you.

                                 TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #4
                             (can’t stop crying)

                                 TESTIMONIAL STUDENT #5
                        Greg’s a fag. I guess he’s in love 
                        with you, so that makes him 
                        bisexual or something. I hope they 
                        find a cure for whatever you have.
                             (to Greg, offscreen)
                        That’s all I got, fag.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - LATER

           GREG and EARL have just finished watching the footage.

                                 EARL
                        Damn.
           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           RACHEL sitting stiffly on the bed, GREG sitting next to her 
           with her barf bucket on his lap.

           Super: The part where I am a dickbag

                                 RACHEL
                        So which color of Post-It are you 
                        on right now?

                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 RACHEL
                        Your color system for applying to 
                        college. Have you heard from 
                        anywhere yet?

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Uh... I kinda put that system 
                        on hold for a while, after the Joel 
                        thing.

                                 RACHEL
                        On hold?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I guess I just don’t know 
                        about the whole college scenario.

                                 RACHEL
                        Wait, are you kidding? Greg. You 
                        have to go to college.

                                 GREG
                        Do I? It’s not gonna be better than 
                        high school. People aren’t gonna be 
                        smarter or nicer. And I’m not gonna 
                        fit in. I’ll just be a weird fat 
                        kid that people can make fun of.

                                 RACHEL
                        What is wrong with you? You’re not 
                        even fat.

           Greg lifts his shirt over his stomach. He grabs two folds of 
           his stomach and tries to make them talk like lips.

                                 GREG’S STOMACH
                             (in a Southern accent for 
                              some reason)
                        I STRENUOUSLY BEG TO DIFFER.
                                 RACHEL
                        You’re not fat. But you are stupid 
                        if you’re not going to college.

                                 GREG’S STOMACH
                        YOU CALLIN ME STUPID?? WHEN’S THE 
                        LAST TIME YOU SAW A STOMACH WHAT 
                        COULD FORM WHOLE SENTENCES??

           But Rachel does not laugh at this. And it pisses Greg off.

                                 GREG
                        Fine. I’ll just go where you’re 
                        going. Where are you applying?

           Rachel does not reply to this, and her eyes now are faraway.

           Greg, awash in regret, rolls down his shirt.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Look. I mean... it’s fine if you’re 
                        not applying right now. But maybe 
                        that means I shouldn’t be applying 
                        anywhere either. So I can like, 
                        stick around.

                        I’m sorry I aimed my stomach at

                                 RACHEL
                             (interrupting)
                        I’m not gonna let you use me as 
                        some pathetic excuse not to apply 
                        to college. Because guess what? I’m 
                        applying to college. Right now.

                                 GREG
                        But... I mean, this is a massive 
                        process. You can’t just now start--

                                 RACHEL
                        Go get me your college directory. 
                        I’m gonna find some places.

                        GO.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

           GREG, wearing his bike helmet, walks into his room. His MOM 
           and DAD are on his bed, waiting for him.

           His mom holds the college directory; his dad clutches Cat 
           Stevens. Next to them is a massive stack of Post-Ited 
           applications.
           Greg’s parents are looking at him like They Mean Business.

                                 GREG
                        How long have you guys just been in 
                        here, like, glaring at the door--

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Gregory, I discovered today that 
                        you haven’t even started your 
                        college application. And some of 
                        the deadlines have already passed.

                                 GREG
                        How did you “discover” that?

                                 GREG’S MOM
                             (unapologetically)
                        I went through all of your stuff.

                                 GREG
                             (horrified)
                        Don’t go through my stuff!

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        We discussed it, and we decided, 
                        she gets to go through your stuff.

                                 GREG
                        Jesus!

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        We left you alone about college, 
                        because we figured you could handle 
                        it. But clearly, we were wrong. So 
                        we’re confiscating your cameras 
                        until you fill these out.

           Greg is enraged, and powerless.

                                 GREG
                        You know what I’m going to do? I’m 
                        gonna go through your stuff!

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        I hope you like tampons.

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER

           ON THE SCREEN: Greg and Earl are the apes from the beginning 
           of 2001. Earl is the one with the bone.

           IN BED: RACHEL has dozed off, again. She is snoring a little.
           IN A CHAIR NEXT TO HER: GREG is furiously scribbling out a 
           college application.

           He notices she is asleep, and starts muttering to her.

                                 GREG
                             (quietly)
                        Let me tell you how messed up this 
                        is. I’ve just finished thirteen 
                        college applications. Just so I can 
                        get my cameras back, and continue 
                        making a film, for you, that is 
                        gonna suck.

           Snore.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        You’re probably the worst thing 
                        that has ever happened to my life.

                                 RACHEL
                             (waking up; weakly)
                        What?

                                 GREG
                        Hey. I’m done. You can have my big 
                        horrible book now.

                                 RACHEL
                        Thanks.

                                 GREG
                        There are a couple schools in here 
                        I want you to look at--I noticed 
                        they have really strong Guilt 
                        Studies departments.

                                 RACHEL
                        Okay.

                                 GREG
                        So I figured, you’d be like the 
                        perfect candidate for that. Guilt 
                        Studies. Topics and techniques in 
                        advanced shame.

                                 RACHEL
                        Uh-huh.

                                 GREG
                        I guess we’re not laughing at Guilt 
                        Studies right now.
                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, I’m just sick. I don’t feel 
                        good right now. Maybe I’ll feel 
                        better next time.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        But as it turns out, she didn’t.

                        Look. I know Rachel keeps getting 
                        sicker. And you’re really bracing 
                        for this sweet girl, that you 
                        probably like a lot, to die. Just 
                        please bear with me. She doesn’t. 
                        She gets better. I promise.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           GREG has created a STOP-MOTION SET out of PIRATES LEGOS. He 
           is putting tape markers on his floor when EARL walks in.

                                 EARL
                        The hell’s all this.

                                 GREG
                        Stop-motion.

                        I think it could look pretty good--

                                 EARL
                        You know how long this shit takes, 
                        right?

                                 GREG
                        Earl, this is the only thing we can 
                        do that might possibly not look 
                        retarded.

                                 EARL
                        How much time you think we got to 
                        make this?

           Greg can’t bring himself to answer this question.

                                 GREG
                        Can we please just give this a 
                        shot.

           EXT. LEGO PIRATE SET - WEEKS GO BY

           PIRATES are wandering around, talking to the camera, getting 
           eaten by sharks. They’re voiced by GREG and EARL, but we 
           can’t hear what they’re saying.
           Supers over these frames: Day 86 of Doomed Friendship, Day 87 
           of Doomed Friendship, Day 88 of Doomed Friendship, etc. Each 
           day is about a half-second of stop-motion time.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        This is pretty much all I remember 
                        from that winter. Entire months of 
                        my life, where all I remember is 
                        making little pirates move around. 
                        And yeah, I’m aware of how 
                        cosmically depressing that sounds.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - SUNNY SPRING AFTERNOON

           GREG is walking to Rachel’s house on a glorious afternoon.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        I mean, obviously I remember 
                        visiting Rachel too. And if this 
                        was a normal story about a girl 
                        with leukemia, I would probably 
                        talk a bunch about all the 
                        meaningful things Rachel had to say 
                        as she got sicker and sicker. But 
                        it’s retarded for you to want that. 
                        She didn’t have meaningful things 
                        to say. She basically just went 
                        from irritable to quiet.

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM

           RACHEL looks terrible. There’s no way to get around it.

                                 RACHEL
                        So what’s going on at school.

                                 GREG
                        The entire school looks like a 
                        castle, because medieval prom is 
                        about to happen. I guess everyone 
                        is trying to figure out how to bump 
                        and grind, like, medievally.

                                 RACHEL
                        Are you going?

                                 GREG
                        Of course not.

                                 RACHEL
                        You should go.
                                 GREG
                        No way. Have you seen me in a tux? 
                        It’s like when they make a dog wear 
                        human clothes. It just makes you 
                        sad to look at it. Anyway, I don’t 
                        have anyone to go with.

           Greg realizes that he is talking to a girl.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (with great effort)
                        I mean, uh... unless you... wanted 
                        to, uh...

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, I’m not going to prom.

                                 GREG
                        No, you totally could. It could be 
                        this awesome statement, like--

                                 RACHEL
                             (cutting him off)
                        Hey. When are you gonna finish your 
                        next movie?

                                 GREG
                        Uh... I dunno. I haven’t actually 
                        been working on anything recently.

                                 RACHEL
                        Earl told me you guys were making a 
                        movie for me.

           Somehow it hurts a lot, that this surprise has been ruined.

                                 GREG
                        He... yes, I guess he probably did.

                                 RACHEL
                        Sorry. I’m just asking because--

                                 GREG
                        Goddamn Earl. It was supposed to be 
                        a surprise for you. It’s just taken 
                        forever, because we really want to 
                        get it right--

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg? I’m probably gonna stop 
                        treatment pretty soon.

           It is very quiet in the room for a moment.
                                 GREG
                        What?

                                 RACHEL
                        It just isn’t doing me any good. 
                        All it’s doing is making me even 
                        sicker.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, but if you stop...

           He can’t finish this sentence.

                                 RACHEL
                        We’ll just see what happens.

                                 GREG
                        We know what’s gonna happen.

           Rachel studies him.

                                 RACHEL
                        I know who you can take to prom.

                                 GREG
                        Who?

                                 RACHEL
                        This sexy pillow here.

                                 GREG
                        Oh my God. Please don’t make jokes 
                        right now. I can’t deal with that.

                                 RACHEL
                        Oooh, Greg. This pillow’s name is 
                        Francesca. She’s a filthy Italian 
                        woman.

                                 GREG
                        PLEASE STOP.

           It is the first time he’s ever shouted at her.

                                 RACHEL
                        Don’t yell at me.

                                 GREG
                        So you’re just gonna give up. 
                        That’s it. To hell with college. To 
                        hell with growing up.

                                 RACHEL
                        Greg, don’t--
                                 GREG
                        You’re just gonna give up and die. 
                        What the hell is wrong with you? 
                        It’s your life.

                                 RACHEL
                             (spurred to anger)
                        Yes, it is my life. And it’s me 
                        lying in bed all the time, with a 
                        shaved head, and getting weaker and 
                        uglier and more miserable--I’m the 
                        one who has to suffer through this, 
                        not you. So don’t yell at me.

           They are trembling with anger at each other.

                                 GREG
                        I’m sorry. I’m not going to get 
                        comfortable with watching you die. 
                        I’m just not. So don’t ask me to.

                                 RACHEL
                        If you can’t accept that I’m going 
                        to do what I want to do, with my 
                        life, then you’re a terrible 
                        friend.

                                 GREG
                        I’m a terrible friend? I’m not 
                        giving up. I’m not ruining my 
                        friend’s life by giving up on the 
                        whole world.

                                 RACHEL
                        Please. Greg, you should be 
                        overjoyed. Now you can go back to 
                        your life of being invisible and 
                        detached and self-hating.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. And you can go back to your 
                        life of being dead.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mature.

                                 GREG
                             (infuriated)
                        This is gonna kill your mom. Have 
                        you gotten comfortable with that? 
                        It doesn’t bother you anymore, 
                        thinking about your mom?
                                 RACHEL
                             (nastily)
                        Get out of here, Greg. You’ve done 
                        your time. You don’t have to hang 
                        out with the sick girl anymore.

                                 GREG
                        How can you--how can you even say 
                        that?

                                 RACHEL
                        Your mom forced you to hang out 
                        with me. Earl forced you to show me 
                        your movies. Madison forced you to 
                        make a movie for me. So yeah. What 
                        part of any of that did you 
                        actually want to do?

           Greg opens his mouth--but he has no response to this.

                                 RACHEL (CONT’D)
                        Do something nice for me for once. 
                        And get out.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DIRECTLY AFTERWARD

           Greg is walking to Earl’s house, through Earl’s dilapidated 
           neighborhood. He is muttering furiously to himself. All of 
           his anger and frustration is now channeled at Earl.

           Super: The part where I get in my first fight ever

                                 GREG
                        Earl. EARL. This is it. You’ve gone 
                        too far.

           A tough-looking kid watches Greg pass.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        The foundation of any good working 
                        partnership is trust. I can no 
                        longer trust you in any way.

           He takes a clumsy tripping step on the broken pavement. He 
           begins to hyperventilate.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        You’ll leak anything to anyone. 
                        It’s like working with Julian... 
                        Assange.

           Greg does not know how to pronounce “Assange.” This only 
           serves to infuriate him further.
                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Ass-andge.
                             (beat)
                        Assangggeh.
                             (beat)
                        DAMMIT.

           He is in front of Earl’s house now. He thumbs Earl an angry 
           text. EARL’S BROTHER DERRICK saunters out onto the porch.

                                 DERRICK
                        Hell you want.

                                 GREG
                        I’m just waiting for Earl.

           Derrick eyes Greg. Greg’s anger is now vying with his fear.

           It is a relief, but not really, when Earl appears.

                                 EARL
                        Sup. You gonna come in?

                                 GREG
                        No, I’m good.

                                 DERRICK
                        Oh no.

           Uh-oh.

                                 EARL
                        The fuck you want.

                                 GREG
                        Uh, I was just talking to Rachel, 
                        and she, uh, told me you told her, 
                        uh, about the uh, the film. We were 
                        making. For her.

                                 EARL
                        Yeah?

                                 GREG
                        You’re like, uh, Julian Ass-andge.

                                 EARL
                        The fuck is that.

                                 GREG
                        It’s just, you know, I mean, you 
                        always do this, because you want to 
                        be a better friend than me or 
                        something. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG (CONT'D)
                        So you just tell Rachel about 
                        everything, and it’s like, it 
                        doesn’t even matter what I want.

                                 EARL
                        You know what? Shut the hell up. 
                        You need to shut the hell up right 
                        about now. I’m tired of this, man. 
                        I’m about to lose my shit with you.

           Earl advances down the steps of his porch on an increasingly 
           trembly, weepy Greg.

                                 GREG
                             (trying hard not to cry)
                        I just, I can’t trust you, and I 
                        don’t know if I can work with, with 
                        you again--

                                 EARL

                                 DERRICK
                        Whoop his ass!

                                 (MORE)
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                        I want to bust your ass. I want to 
                        beat the hell out of you right now.

                                 GREG
                        Go for it.

                                 EARL
                        You want me to?

                                 GREG
                        I don’t care.

                                 EARL
                        Motherfucker, you want me to?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, Earl, I fucking want you 
                        tOOOONGH

           Earl socks Greg in the stomach. Greg immediately keels over.

                                 DERRICK
                        Yeah! JACK THAT LITTLE DUDE UP.

           But Earl does not jack that little dude up. He storms back 
           inside his house, furious.

           Wheezing and choking back sobs, Greg gets to his feet. He 
           looks at the house. Derrick gazes coolly back at him.

                                 DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        I’da whooped the hell out of you.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           GREG is sullenly eating alone. MR. MCCARTHY walks in to 
           refill his thermos.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Beast. Where’s the other beast?

                                 GREG
                        Earl? I don’t know. He’s not here.

           Mr. McCarthy gamely tries again.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        So what’s the latest with colleges?

                                 GREG
                        I don’t know.
                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        Seems like you should’ve heard back 
                        from some by now.

                                 GREG
                        Well, I haven’t.

           Mr. McCarthy observes Greg.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        How’s Rachel doing?

                                 GREG
                        Well, she’s really... not great.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        You know, I was fifteen when my Dad 
                        died. Couple years younger than 
                        you.

           Greg is startled by this.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        You know what I remember about it? 
                        My whole childhood I just thought 
                        of him as this big, quiet, kind of 
                        asshole guy. Didn’t laugh much. 
                        Liked his sons to wear ties.

                        And then at the wake, all his old 
                        buddies are there telling me about 
                        him, and it’s like they’re talking 
                        about a complete other guy. Like, 
                        he knew every European pop song 
                        from the 70s, from when he was 
                        stationed in Germany. He’d just sit 
                        around memorizing songs to sing at 
                        German girls in bars. His go-to was 
                        this Dutch song called Ding-A-Dong.

                                 GREG
                        So what does that mean.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        It just means that, even if someone 
                        dies, you’re still gonna keep 
                        learning about them. You know? 
                        Their life keeps unfolding to you, 
                        if you keep paying attention to it.

                             (sullenly)
                        What, if you’re like a historian? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG (CONT'D)
                        Are you seriously trying to make 
                        this into some stupid sappy lesson?

           Mr. McCarthy smiles at Greg and gets to his feet.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        You’re a good kid, Greg.

                                 GREG
                        I’m not.

                                 MR. MCCARTHY
                        You’re a good goddamned kid.

                                 GREG
                             (gathering his stuff)
                        Look. I’m going home. I’m cutting 
                        school right in front of you. I’m 
                        not a good kid.

           Mr. McCarthy says nothing.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (leaving)
                        I’m not.

           INT. GREG’S KITCHEN - A HALF-HOUR LATER

           On his way in, GREG passes his DAD.

                                 GREG’S DAD
                        Earl came by earlier, but has since 
                        departed. Were you two supposed to 
                        work on something?

           Greg does not respond.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM

           GREG finds a DVD on his desk. ON it is scrawled, in Sharpie, 
           “IM OUT.”

           He plays the DVD. It’s of EARL, talking to the camera, in 
           Greg’s room.

                                 EARL
                        Hi Rachel. We tried a bunch of 
                        different ways of making a film for 
                        you, and all of em turned out 
                        goofy, and irrelevant, and not like 
                        we wanted. So now I’m just gonna 
                        talk to you directly.
                                 (MORE)
                                 EARL (CONT'D)
                             (collects himself)
                        I’ma be honest here. White girls 
                        are usually stupid. I mean errbody 
                        stupid, but white girls got they 
                        own kind of stupid goin. Think they 
                        smarter than errbody. Self-centered 
                        but pretendin like they ain’t. But 
                        you ain’t been like that.
                             (collects himself again)
                        It’s just crazy how patient you 
                        been. That’s all I wanted to say. 
                        If it was me at had cancer, I’d be 
                        angry as hell, and... and hurtful, 
                        and just tryna beat errybody’s ass 
                        half the time. So I’m just amazed 
                        at how patient you been. And you’ve 
                        made me feel, uh, blessed.
                             (now pissed off; also a 
                              little husky-voiced)
                        Greg, I ain’t workin on this no 
                        more. Do whatever the hell you 
                        want. I’m out.

           Earl switches off the camera and the clip ends, leaving Greg 
           alone in his room.

           Greg holds his head in his hands.

           Then he flips on the camera. And tries to do a testimonial of 
           his own.

                                 GREG
                        Hi Rachel. Uh... Earl’s right. All 
                        the ways we tried to make a film 
                        for you turned out completely 
                        horrible. So, yeah. It got me 
                        thinking about the reason I wanted 
                        to do this film.

           He pauses. The fact is, he never wanted to do this film.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        And that reason is, when you come 
                        right down to it, and just say it, 
                        simply, without screwing around:

           He has to say something.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Uh... I believe in you.

           He is quoting the first video testimonial, from that stupid 
           kid. He’s not even saying his own meaningless clichéd thing. 
           It’s something else’s.
           He can’t bring himself to look at the camera. He’s looking 
           down, at his hands.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (finally, sadly)
                        You can do it.

           He is silent. Then he shuts off the camera.

           INT. BENSON HALLWAY - THE NEXT DAY

           GREG opens the door to Mr. McCarthy’s office. EARL is in 
           there, eating one of his all-candy lunches. On a screen 
           behind him plays MY BEST FIEND, KLAUS KINSKI.

                                 GREG
                        Oh. Are you eating lunch in here 
                        still?

                                 EARL
                        Not if you are.

                                 GREG
                        Well, I’m not eating in here if you 
                        are.

                                 EARL
                        Well, good. Cuz I like it in here.

                                 GREG
                        So I guess I’ll just go. Or, you 
                        could go.

                                 EARL
                        Nope. I like the air-conditioning, 
                        and I like the comfortable chairs.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I like those too.

                                 EARL
                        Well, that’s your damn problem.

           INT. CAFETERIA - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS

           GREG trudges sadly through his personal hell: the cafeteria. 
           One flying bit of food hits his face, then another.

           He finds a place to sit alone. Over his head, a banner reads: 
           BENSON SENIOR PROM “2013” A “KNIGHT” TO “REMEMBER” !!!
           INT. CAFETERIA - DAYS PASS

           He eats alone in the same seat, day after day, forlorn and 
           withdrawn.

           Then someone sits down in front of him.

           It is MADISON.

           Arm touch/MOOSE SMUSHES CHIPMUNK WITH HOOVES.

                                 MADISON
                        Greg. I need to talk to you about 
                        the movie.

                                 GREG
                        It’s not done yet.

                                 MADISON
                        Greg. You’ve been working on this 
                        movie for like four months.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, we tried a bunch of things. 
                        They just aren’t very good.

                                 MADISON
                        UGH. Greg. Now is not the time for 
                        your whole, I’m-Greg, I-suck, 
                        nothing-I-do-is-any-good thing. I’m 
                        sure what you have is awesome and 
                        Greg I really think it can make a 
                        difference if you just put it 
                        together and give it to her.

                                 GREG
                             (bitterly)
                        Madison, she’s stopped treatment. 
                        She gave up. She quit.

           Madison gazes at him. Her eyes glisten.

                                 MADISON
                             (icily)
                        So maybe that’s a good reason to 
                        finish the fucking movie. And give 
                        it to her.
                             (more so)
                        You know what? Whatever.

           She stalks away.
           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

           GREG is watching his testimonial to Rachel. He watches 
           himself mumble, “I believe in you.” Pathetic. He rewinds it 
           and plays it again. “You can do it.” Excruciating.

           His MOM enters the room.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Honey?

                                 GREG
                        What.

           He looks up. His mother looks stricken.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Honey, Rachel’s back in the 
                        hospital.

                                 GREG
                        Wait--is she starting treatment 
                        again?

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        It’s not for treatment, honey.

                                 GREG
                        Oh.

           His mom waits for him to say something.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Mom, what.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I just thought we could go--

                                 GREG
                        You just figured this was your last 
                        chance to force me to hang out with 
                        her?

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Greg, come on--

                                 GREG
                        Don’t worry, mom. I’m sure you can 
                        find some other girl with cancer 
                        after Rachel dies. Which, by the 
                        way, she’s decided to do. She’s 
                        decided to die. So maybe I can 
                        decide not to visit her.
                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I promise you you will regret it, 
                        if you don’t visit her. You will 
                        regret it for the rest of your 
                        life.

                                 GREG
                             (exploding)
                        Yeah. That’s probably true. But you 
                        know what? I have a shitload of 
                        things to regret. I regret not 
                        having a date for tomorrow’s stupid 
                        prom. I regret being too weird to 
                        make friends. I definitely regret 
                        making those shitty films with 
                        Earl. And check this out.

           He opens a drawer and pulls out a bunch of APPLICATIONS. He 
           throws them at his mom.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I’m probably gonna regret never 
                        mailing these!

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Are you honestly telling me you...

                                 GREG
                        Never applied to college! Not one! 
                        Whoops! I’m really regretting that 
                        now! You were right, Mom! You 
                        probably should’ve gone through 
                        more of my stuff!

           His mom, horrified, says nothing.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        So just do me a favor right now. 
                        Just leave me alone. I just want to 
                        sit here and regret stuff. I’m 
                        gonna think of everything I’ve ever 
                        done, and everything I haven’t 
                        done, and just regret the living 
                        shit out of it.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

           GREG is watching his stop-motion pirates and listening to HIS 
           PARENTS argue through the walls.

                                 GREG’S MOM (O.S.)
                             (tearfully)
                        The deadlines have passed, Victor!

                                 GREG’S MOM (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        What’s he going to do next year? Is 
                        he just going to waste his year?

                                 GREG’S DAD (O.S.)
                        He is grieving, honey. You have to 
                        let him grieve.

                                 GREG’S MOM (O.S.)
                        How can you tell me to just do 
                        nothing while he ruins his life?

                                 GREG’S DAD (O.S.)
                        That’s not what I’m saying.

                                 GREG’S MOM (O.S.)
                        That little prick Joel and his damn 
                        fraternity. If he hadn’t--

                                 GREG’S DAD (O.S.)
                        It certainly didn’t help.

           The conversation continues as Greg watches his video.

                                 PIRATES
                        Yaarrrr. Avast. I love leukemia. 
                        It’s me favorite.

           INT. CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY

           Once again, GREG is eating alone under the prom banner, which 
           now has the word “TONIGHT !!!!!” added to it. And maybe even 
           more gratuitous quotation marks.

           And again, Madison comes to sit with him.

           Super: The part where I get in my second fight ever

                                 MADISON
                             (hesitantly)
                        Greg? Can I talk to you?

           Greg gathers his things and gets up.

                                 GREG
                        Nope.

                                 MADISON
                        It’s not what you think.

           Madison touches his arm, but he shrugs it off.
                                 GREG
                             (raising his voice)
                        Let me ask you something--what is 
                        this? What is up with the arm-
                        touching?

           Greg is backing away from her now. She is following.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Are you just being friendly? Or is 
                        it, like, this calculated tactic? 
                        To get me to do whatever you want? 
                        Because you have to understand what 
                        it does, when the most beautiful 
                        girl in school touches the arm of a 
                        chubby pasty guy with a rodent 
                        face. It’s an act of cruelty.

                                 MADISON
                        Are you done?

                                 GREG
                        Yeah, I’m done with you. And I’m 
                        done with the stupid film.

           He backs into ILL PHIL.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        But you ain’t done with me.

                                 GREG
                        Oh come on.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        You’ll never escape me. Nobody rats 
                        me out and lives to tell about it.

                        I’m back for my revenge /
                        Stab you in the dick, pardon my 
                        French /
                        Shove your body under a bench /

                                 GREG
                             (frantic)
                        Are you honestly gonna stab me? 
                        Fine. Go for it. You’re gonna go to 
                        jail for your entire life, but, 
                        it’s probably worth it. Stab away.

           Ill Phil is not prepared for this. He was hoping Greg’s 
           reaction would be more along the lines of running away.
                                 ILL PHIL
                        You lucky I ain’t got my knives. 
                        Stead you gotta fight me, punk.

                                 GREG
                        Sure. I’ll fight you. Just stop 
                        rapping.

           They square up. Neither one makes a move for a long time.

           They actually have no idea how to fight.

                                 ILL PHIL
                             (muttering rap)
                        Break your eyeball with a fist I 
                        got clenched /
                        Take your teeth our with a wrench /
                        Hit you with a stone from 
                        Stonehenge /

                                 GREG
                        STOP RAPPING.

           Finally Ill Phil swings and Greg grabs his arm. But then Greg 
           doesn’t know what to do with it.

                                 ILL PHIL
                             (thrashing a little)
                        Leggo my arm.

                                 GREG
                        Okay. Jesus.

           More circling. The onlookers are becoming restless. Finally 
           Greg rushes Ill Phil and grabs him around the waist. Ill Phil 
           panics and grabs Greg around his waist.

           They stay like that for a while.

           And then, suddenly, EARL flies in and starts whooping ILL 
           PHIL’S ass.

           The CROWD goes berserk.

           Almost immediately, a VICE PRINCIPAL separates the fight.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL
                        BREAK IT UP.

           INT. BENSON HALLWAY

           The VICE PRINCIPAL and a SECURITY GUARD are leading/dragging 
           EARL, GREG, and ILL PHIL to the nearest school exit.
                                 GREG
                             (to Earl)
                        I thought you were eating lunch in 
                        Mr. McCarthy’s office.

                                 EARL
                        He all sad. Talkin bout German 
                        music or something. I was like, 
                        dude. This is boring as hell.

           EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL

           The VICE PRINCIPAL, SECURITY GUARD, GREG, EARL, and ILL PHIL 
           emerge from the doors.

                                 VICE PRINCIPAL
                             (to Greg and Earl)
                        Two days’ suspension for fighting. 
                        Two days’ suspension for fighting.
                             (to Ill Phil)
                        Two days’ suspension for fighting 
                        to be added to your lifetime 
                        suspension for drug dealing. Please 
                        leave school property.

                                 BOYS
                        Yes sir/Awright.

           As they begin walking away, Greg’s COUSIN JOEL comes rushing 
           up to the school.

                                 JOEL
                        Greg! Greg. You gotta help me.

                                 GREG
                        Joel? What are you doing here?

                                 JOEL
                        Your mom came to my dorm and 
                        started screaming at me. Apparently 
                        I ruined your life and now you 
                        won’t go to college.

                                 GREG
                        Oh yeah.

                                 JOEL
                        You gotta help me make this stop.

                                 GREG
                        Sorry, man.

           And now MADISON exits the school and joins them.
                                 MADISON
                        Greg, wait!

                                 JOEL
                        Madison?

                                 GREG
                        How do you know Madison?

                                 JOEL
                        She’s King Dirk’s girlfriend.

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. GAMMA GAMMA DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT

           KING DIRK is squatting over GREG’s face as ONLOOKERS go nuts.

                                                        CUT BACK TO THE 
                                                               PRESENT:

           EXT. IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL

           Greg is horrified. He turns to Madison.

                                 GREG
                        Your college boyfriend is... the 
                        guy with the wizard beer-can staff?

                                 MADISON
                        Ex-boyfriend. He dumped me last 
                        night.

                                 JOEL
                        Yeah, well, you shouldn’t have 
                        tried to make him go to a high 
                        school prom.

                                 MADISON
                        Yeah, that was really dick of me.
                             (she turns to an 
                              astonished Greg)
                        Anyway, Greg, I was just seeing if 
                        you wanted to go.

           Even Earl does not know what to say here.
                                 MADISON (CONT’D)
                        Look. You were right. This whole 
                        movie situation has been really 
                        difficult for you, and I feel like 
                        it’s my fault. I want a chance to 
                        make things up to you a little bit.

                                 ILL PHIL
                        Yo, you can make things up to me.
                             (beat)
                        You wanna call me one time? You 
                        want my number?

                                 EARL
                             (to Ill Phil)
                        I’ma kick you in your damn head.

                                 GREG
                        What, so I’m like, a replacement 
                        prom date for you?

                                 MADISON
                        You’re not a replacement, Greg.

           She smiles.

                                 MADISON (CONT’D)
                        I think we’d have fun.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING

           GREG is putting on his tuxedo. He is having some trouble with 
           the pants.

           His MOM is standing by the door.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I told you you would get a date.

                                 GREG
                        Yup.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        So, you’re welcome. For the tuxedo 
                        and everything.

                                 GREG
                        Thanks Mom.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        I am very unhappy about this 
                        college thing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG’S MOM (CONT'D)
                        But your father and I can wait 
                        until you’re ready to talk about 
                        it.

                                 GREG
                        I appreciate that.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Let me help with your corsage.

           She does.

           Greg examines himself in the mirror.

                                 GREG’S MOM (CONT’D)
                        My handsome boy, going to prom. 
                        Take lots of pictures, okay?

           Greg does not answer. He’s busy looking into the mirror. An 
           anxious boy in a tuxedo stares back out at him.

           EXT. IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - EVENING

           GREG, holding flowers, walks stiffly into a limousine.

           INT. LIMOUSINE

           GREG is alone in the back of a cavernous limousine. His 
           immigrant-of-some-kind DRIVER is shouting cheerfully to him 
           from the front.

                                 GREG
                        302 Halket Street.

                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        Very good, very good.

           They drive.

                                 LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        You love this girl?

                                 GREG
                        Uh. I dunno if I would go that far.

                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        Will you be making love to her 
                        tonight?

                                 GREG
                        I think the odds are against that.
                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        But possibly yes?

                                 GREG
                        It’s really gonna depend on what 
                        she wants.

                                 LIMO DRIVER
                        If you truly love her, she will 
                        want to make love to you.

           Greg does not respond to this.

                                 LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
                        This girl, she is very beautiful?

                                 GREG
                        No, she is not.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

           GREG exits the limo, holding his bouquet of flowers.

           He is not in front of Madison’s house. He is front of the 
           HOSPITAL.

           He takes a deep breath.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           RACHEL is suffering from pneumonia, a complication of end-
           stage AML. She is extremely pale and having difficulty 
           focussing. But she smiles when GREG walks in.

           Super: Day 209 of Doomed Friendship

                                 GREG
                        Hey.

                                 RACHEL
                        Hey.

           Her voice is weak and whispery.

                                 GREG
                        I passed your mom out there. She 
                        thought I looked pretty good.

           Rachel snort-laughs, weakly.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I’ll arrange these flowers for you.
                                 RACHEL
                        Thanks.

           He puts the flowers in the barf bucket. From his pocket he 
           pulls out a DVD.

                                 GREG
                        Before we watch this, uh... look. 
                        I’m really sorry it took so long to 
                        make. But the reason for that is, 
                        we couldn’t figure out how to not 
                        get it to suck. And after all that 
                        work, it still completely sucks. 
                        And it’s not actually what I wanted 
                        to say to you. But let’s just watch 
                        it first. Okay?

           She nods.

           He puts the film in and sits next to her, the barf bucket of 
           flowers on his lap, and they watch for a while.

           The film does, as advertised, suck.

           First, there are the TESTIMONIALS: students sitting in a 
           classroom, saying clichéd things, or unhelpful things. So 
           those suck.

           Then there are the SOCK PUPPETS beating up on each other. 
           It’s hard to even tell what they’re saying. It’s just violent 
           and irrelevant. That sucks, too.

           DENISE’S INTERVIEW has been jarringly edited so as not to be 
           depressing, but of course this makes it even more depressing. 
           It goes without saying that this sucks.

           And now there are LEGO PIRATES wandering around, talking 
           about how much they love leukemia. Also an inexplicable 
           ROTATING TARANTULA PAPERWEIGHT. How could this possibly not 
           suck?

           As they watch, Rachel begins to cough, weakly. Greg ignores 
           this for a few coughs.

           Then he realizes that it isn’t going away.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Do you want me to, uh, get a nurse?

           Rachel, nods, coughing, in pain.
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SLIGHTLY SLOWED DOWN, SOUND MUFFLED

           GREG emerges from the room and says something to DENISE, who 
           rushes into the room, stricken.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        That was the last time I saw 
                        Rachel. She went into a coma 
                        shortly after that, and died about 
                        ten hours later.

           Greg flags down a passing NURSE and says something to her. 
           Irritably, she walks into Rachel’s room, shutting the door 
           behind her.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Yeah. I know I told you she didn’t 
                        die. But I mean... This is a story 
                        about a girl with cancer.

           Greg is left alone in a hospital hallway.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        What the hell did you think was 
                        going to happen?

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - THE NEXT DAY

           GREG, EARL, and MR. MCCARTHY are sitting all in a row, near 
           the back. A forceful inner-city PRINCIPAL is speaking.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        It is indeed a difficult time... 
                        for the Benson High School family. 
                        We are mourning... a family member. 
                        But we have an unexpected and 
                        touching opportunity... to turn our 
                        thoughts to her... in a unique way.
                             (with God’s own voice)
                        EARL JACKSON. GREGORY GAINES. 
                        Please come to the stage.

           Greg’s heart skips a beat. His eyes widen with terror.

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LAST NIGHT 

           Denise’s attention is drawn to the film that Greg has left 
           playing.
                                 PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
                        These boys made a film... that they 
                        delivered to Rachel last night.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

           Earl has his head deep in his hands.

                                                                 CUT TO 
                                                             FLASHBACK:

           INT. TEACHER’S CONFERENCE ROOM - EARLIER THAT DAY

           TEACHERS, and the PRINCIPAL, are watching the film and 
           looking moved. They are watching a sock puppet part.

                                 PRINCIPAL (V.O.)
                        And her mother has given us 
                        permission... to show you this film 
                        now.

                                                        CUT BACK TO THE 
                                                               PRESENT:

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM

           Greg and Earl are up on stage. Cataclysm. It is, literally, 
           the stuff of nightmares.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Before we show the film... Is there 
                        anything you would like to say... 
                        to the Benson High School family.

           Earl walks to the lectern. The mic is nowhere near his head.

           The PRINCIPAL, noting this, removes the microphone and holds 
           it to Earl’s mouth.

                                 EARL
                        Naw.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        You will let this audacious film 
                        speak for you. Very good. Gregory?

           Greg staggers to his feet. He takes the mic. He gazes out at 
           his classmates.
           He has nothing to say to them. But he can’t just say nothing.

           Suddenly he begins speaking.

                                 GREG
                        This film sucks. And after you 
                        watch it, you’re gonna think I’m 
                        this pathetic untalented loser. But 
                        here’s the thing: I don’t care what 
                        you think about me. I’ve spent the 
                        last four years obsessing over how 
                        everyone sees me, and I just 
                        realized, I don’t care anymore. The 
                        only person whose opinion I care 
                        about is dead. So, whatever.

           He puts the mic down, then decides to pick it back up.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        I’ve always wanted never to be 
                        noticed by anyone. But the best way 
                        not to be noticed is to be dead. 
                        And I don’t want to be dead.

           He puts the mic back. The principal, glowering, walks over to 
           reclaim the mic.

           Then Greg abruptly grabs it a third time.

                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Here’s why our film sucks. 
                        It’s not the film we should have 
                        made. Okay? Because I wasn’t even 
                        friends with Rachel before she got 
                        sick. And then she got sick and we 
                        spent all this time together, but 
                        it wasn’t enough. It just wasn’t.

                        To make the film we should have 
                        made, we should have gotten her to 
                        tell us every single thought she 
                        has ever had. Because it’s all just 
                        lost, now. We should have had a 
                        camera on her, constantly, since 
                        the day she was born. Because her 
                        whole life, now, it’s just lost. We 
                        should have had a camera inside her 
                        head, because all of her specific 
                        thoughts and ideas and dreams and 
                        phobias and impressions of the 
                        whole stupid world, they’re all 
                        about to be lost, and the film we 
                        should have made would keep her 
                        from being lost.
                                 (MORE)
                                 GREG (CONT’D)
                             (forcing back tears--semi-
                              incoherent)
                        It sucks. Nothing sucks more than 
                        this. It sucks.

           He puts down the mic and runs offstage and out of the 
           auditorium. The students are baffled. Some of them are 
           giggling.

           Earl has his head in his hands.

           The lights go down.

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - MORNING

           Rachel’s memorial service is held in a little Reform 
           synagogue. There is no casket. The RABBI is leading the 
           congregation through the burial kaddish, in Hebrew. Greg is 
           near the back, with his parents.

                                 RABBI
                        Yitgadal v’yitkadash sh’mei raba.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen.

           Greg does not join in.

                                 RABBI
                        B’alma di vra chir’utei v’yamlich 
                        malchutei, v’chayechon u’vyomechon, 
                        u’v’chayei d’chol beit yisrael, 
                        ba’agala uvizman kariv, v’imru.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen.

           Again without Greg.

           INT. RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERWARD

           MOURNERS wander around Denise’s house, sitting shiva.

           GREG spots MADISON and SCOTT MAYHEW together holding hands, 
           talking to DENISE. Surprised and sickened, he avoids them.

           Then he is cornered by an OLD PERSON.

                                 ELDERLY MOURNER
                        I heard you made a very nice little 
                        movie about Rachel’s life.
                                 GREG
                        Oh. Uh, yeah.

                                 ELDERLY MOURNER
                        When will it be in theaters?

           Greg does not have the heart to set this doddering old person 
           straight.

                                 GREG
                        Soon. Really soon. I’m sure Denise 
                        will let you know. Can you excuse 
                        me for a moment?

           Greg sneaks out into the hallway. He looks around for a place 
           where he can escape all human contact. He gazes up the stairs 
           at the door to Rachel’s room.

           INT. RACHEL’S BEDROOM

           Greg is sitting on Rachel’s bed. Surrounded by pillows.

           He gazes at the walls. Daniel Craig, Hugh Jackman.

           A figure appears in the doorway. Denise.

                                 DENISE
                        Greg.

                                 GREG
                        Mrs. Kushner. I mean, Denise.

           She blinks, but is silent.

           She steps toward him. Does she want a hug? Greg sticks his 
           arms out awkwardly.

           No, she does not want a hug. She just wants to give him back 
           his COLLEGE DIRECTORY.

                                 DENISE
                        I’m supposed to give this back to 
                        you.

           She does. And retreats back to the doorway.

                                 DENISE (CONT’D)
                             (smiling sadly)
                        Squeak squeak.

                                 GREG
                             (agreeing)
                        Squeak.
           He is alone. He holds the college directory and almost 
           doesn’t open it. But he does.

           There’s a message on some Post-Its on the inside cover.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        Thank you for lending this to me. I 
                        marked up a few film programs for 
                        you and Earl to look at. They all 
                        have high ratings in Wittiness,

                        Goodbye, Greg. You’re a good 
                        friend. Although if you don’t go to 
                        film school, you’re also an idiot. 
                        But you already knew that. Love, 
                        Rachel.

                        P.S. I’d also like for you to take 
                        Francesca. She’ll want a good home 
                        where she’ll be loved.

           Greg picks up Francesca.

                                 RACHEL (V.O.)
                        P.P.S. Not in the way you’re 
                        thinking. That’s disgusting.

           EXT. RACHEL’S BACKYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           EARL has spent most of the shiva outside smoking irritably.

           GREG finds him, holding the book.

                                 EARL
                        Look who it is.

                                 GREG
                        Sorry, I haven’t been out of my 
                        room for a few days.

                                 EARL
                        Yeah. I know. You smell terrible.

                                 GREG
                        I can’t really smell myself.

                                 EARL
                             (matter-of-factly)
                        You smell like a homeless dude. And 
                        you bout to fail all your classes. 
                        McCarthy all pissed at you.
                                 GREG
                        Yeah, well. Whatever.

           Something in Greg’s attempted nonchalance moves Earl’s heart 
           to pity.

                                 EARL
                        Son, look. I hate to get on you for 
                        this, but I’m just tellin you. This 
                        a tragic thing, that happened. It 
                        make me sick. But listen. 

                        You can’t let it tear up your life. 
                        You can’t be making these terrible 
                        decisions. You gotta take care a 
                        your own shit.

                                 GREG
                        Yeah. About that...
                             (cautiously)
                        You ever think about applying to 
                        film school?

                                 EARL
                        Oh hell no, son. I ain’t goin to no 
                        film school. Films, man... that 
                        ain’t gonna be my life. That’s a 
                        hobby. I ain’t puttin my life on 
                        hold, goin a hunnert thousand 
                        dollars into debt for no hobby.

           Greg looks miserable.

                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                        Son, I can’t be doin this film shit 
                        no more.

                                 GREG
                             (bitterly)
                        I guess I had this kind of stupid 
                        dream that we were gonna go to film 
                        school and then start a production 
                        company together or something.

                                 EARL
                        I’ma level with you. I never even 
                        liked makin the damn films. I like 
                        your house, I like eatin your food. 
                        I like watchin crazy-ass films. But 
                        I hated makin em.

                                 GREG
                        So what do you want to do?
                                 EARL
                        I don’t know.
                             (beat)
                        I kinda just want to end up like 
                        your dad.

                                 GREG
                        What?!

           Greg peers through the window at his DAD, who is alone in the 
           middle of the living room, scratching himself.

                                 EARL
                        Listen, son. I’m just tellin you. 
                        Your dad’s around. He around all 
                        the damn time. Fact he around too 
                        much. Talking to the cat, starin at 
                        the wall. But that’s a hell of a 
                        lot better than the opposite. 

                        That’s what I’ma give my kids. Dude 
                        who’s around. Servin em crazy-ass 
                        food, showin em films with 
                        subtitles. I ain’t getting there by 
                        spendin a hunnert K on no film 
                        school. I gotta get a career.

                                 GREG
                        Oh.

                                 EARL
                             (getting fired up)
                        You can be some broke-ass artist. 
                        You too weird to be a dad anyway. 
                        Me, I’m getting a job. Savin up for 
                        a family. Buyin a big-ass home, 
                        fillin it up with my weird-ass kids 
                        and a damn dog. I’m out.

           GREG’S MOM appears in the doorway.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Hi boys. 

                        Earl, it’s a little inappropriate 
                        to smoke cigarettes outside of 
                        someone’s shiva. Seeing as that 
                        person died of cancer.

           Earl stubs it out.

                                 EARL
                        Sorry, Ms. Gaines.
                                 GREG
                        We’ll be inside in a sec.

                                 GREG’S MOM
                        Okay.

           She returns inside.

                                 GREG
                        I’m out too. I’m not making films 
                        anymore either. I’m retired.

                                 EARL
                        Son, you ain’t even listenin to me.

           This next thing is hard to say.

                                 GREG
                        Earl. Look. If you quit, I quit.

           Earl looks Greg in the eye.

           Greg means it.

                                 EARL
                        Son. You’re the filmmaker. That’s 
                        always been you. Know who I am? I’m 
                        just your dumbass friend. 

                        You’ll be all right. You gonna find 
                        someone else to make films with. 
                        Who know what they doin, for once.

                        And from now on, I’ma be your 
                        audience. I’ma watch errything you 
                        make. And I’m probly gonna hate it. 
                        You probly ain’t shit without me. 
                        But I’ll still watch that shit. 
                        Awright?

                                 GREG
                        All right.

                                 EARL
                        Goddammit stop cryin.

                                 GREG
                        I’m not c-crying.

                                 EARL
                        Cryin like a bitch.

           Earl, after a resentful pause, puts his arm around Greg. He 
           pats Greg on the shoulder a few times.
                                 EARL (CONT’D)
                             (irritably)
                        Feel like we’re having a goddamn 
                        breakup right now.

           INT. GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           We’re back to where we started: GREG staring at a computer 
           monitor, breathing loudly through his nose.

                                 GREG (V.O.)
                        Rachel’s ashes were scattered in a 
                        park behind her house. Apparently 
                        she ran away from home once and 
                        tried to live there.

                        It was this story her aunt told at 
                        the funeral. She was trying to 
                        become a squirrel. She thought she 
                        could turn into one by just being 
                        in the forest and wanting it really 
                        bad.

                        I guess maybe that’s what Mr. 
                        McCarthy meant, about someone’s 
                        life continuing to unfold.

                        It was weird to be learning 
                        something new about Rachel after 
                        she died. But somehow it was 
                        reassuring as well.

           The printer has just stopped printing the story we have just 
           been told. On the back we see the words, “Somehow it was 
           reassuring as well. FIN.”

           He puts it in an envelope addressed to the American Film 
           Institute Conservatory.

           And then he puts a DVD in a jewel case. And then he sticks a 
           Post-It on top of the case, and writes, “WARNING: THE LAST 
           PERSON WHO SAW THIS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A COMA AND DIED.” 
           And he puts that in the envelope as well.

           He seals the envelope.

           He stares directly at us. We look into his eyes.

           He crosses them, briefly.

           BLACKOUT.

           FIN.
