           INT CAR LATE AFTERNOON

           Leia, early twenties, blond, willowy but strong willed,
           slight but not subtle, is slouched in the backseat of a car
           as it drives. She wears a short sleeved mock turtleneck and
           nondescript pants of no determinate year or fashion. The
           sedan exits off the highway and onto suburban streets. Trees
           give way to mailboxes as they pull into more residential
           roads. It is August in Pennsylvania.

           Driving the car is a man in a suit. Beside him is a
           uniformed police officer. Leia looks out the window with
           equal parts curiosity and caution. There is a duffle bag
           beside her.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON.

           The soft silence of a carpeted living room. Marcy and Glen
           sit on a sofa. They are both well dressed, in freshly
           pressed khaki. There are fresh flowers and a cheese plate.
           We see photos around the house of the younger happier them.
           A clock’s second hand makes a distant click. A rhythmic
           sprinkler is heard watering a lawn through the window. They
           hold hands in the quiet. After a moment...

                                 MARCY
                        Maybe we should have music playing.

           She gets up and clicks on a near by stereo. She sits. She
           gets back up and changes the radio station. She puts on a
           jazz CD. She sits.

                                 MARCY
                        This doesn’t seem appropriate.

           She gets up and turns it off. Sits back down. A moment. Glen
           takes her hand. They hold hands on the couch.

           INT CAR LATE AFTERNOON

           The car turns onto a cul de sac of similar homes, the pace
           slows. Leia notices the slowing, she takes a new interest in
           where she is. She looks out the window at nothing in
           particular and everything there is.
           INT DARGON HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON.

           Marcy and Glen hold hands. We hear a car pull up outside, we
           hear the doors open and close. MARCY and GLEN look at each
           other. They stand. They straighten out their clothes.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh my god.

                                    GLEN
                        Here we go.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE LATE AFTERNOON

           The sedan has pulled into a driveway behind two modest cars,
           in front of a modest two level house. Leia doesn’t move, the
           Uniformed Officer opens her door, she takes her bag and
           looks at the house. They make their way to the front door.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, LATE AFTERNOON.

           The doorbell rings. Glen opens the door. On the other side
           stand Detective Timms, a silver haired plain clothes
           detective and LEIA. The officer has stayed by the sedan.

                                 DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        Mr. and Mrs. Dargon.

                                 MARCY AND GLEN
                        Detective.

                                 GLEN
                        Come in. Please.

                                 MARCY
                        Both of you.

           They enter the room.

                                 DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        (To Leia) Leanne, do you remember
                        Mr. and Mrs. Dargon?

                                 GLEN
                        (Indicating) Glen and Marcy.

                                 MARCY
                        Are we doing first names?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        We talked on the phone, from the
                        hospital. Right?

                                 GLEN
                        Yes. We called as soon as we heard.

                                 MARCY
                        We came to see you but, they
                        wouldn’t let us in. -Until the test
                        came back. And now it’s back. So
                        here you are.

           Marcy covers her mouth and her eyes fill with water.

                                 LEIA
                        Okay. Hi.

                                    DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        Well, charges have been pressed and
                        McKay will be held without bail. So
                        far, Leanne’s hospital records are
                        clean, though she refused a full
                        examination-

                                 LEIA
                        That’s private.

                                 DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        Of course.

           As Detective Timms Speaks we follow Leia’s face as she takes
           in the room around her.

                                 DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        (To Glen and Marcy) As discussed a
                        court appointed psychologist is to
                        meet with Leanne once a week, or
                        more if needed. Dr. Andrews, her
                        card is here. (He hands Glen a
                        folder) You have my number, should
                        anything else come up. I’d advise
                        to steer clear of the news (He
                        subtly indicates Leia) for a
                        variety of reasons.

                                 GLEN
                        OK. Thank you.

                                 DETECTIVE TIMMS
                        I only wish it were sooner. (To
                        Leia) Take care of yourself.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Timms exits, closing the door behind him. Leia is now fully
           here. In a new place, with new people. Everyone else is
           gone.

                                 MARCY
                        Can I hug you?

                                 LEIA
                        Um. Sure?

           Marcy reaches out to LEIA, first grabbing onto her arms as
           if to confirm she is real and then pulling into a hug. A
           long strong hug. We see Marcy’s face in Leia’s hair. Leia’s
           face in Marcy’s shoulder. Marcy’s hand clasping Leia’s shirt
           fabric, and Leia’s arm against her own body as it hangs by
           her side. Marcy’s breathing shifts into repressed tears.

           Glen looks at Marcy and Leia. He joins the hug.

                                 MARCY
                        You’re real. You’re really here.
                        Really really here.

                                 GLEN
                        We’ve thought about this moment for
                        years. Welcome home.

           The hug lasts a long silent moment.

                                 LEIA
                        Is it okay if we stop hugging?

                                 GLEN
                        Yes. Yes. Of course.

           Glen Stops first. Guides Marcy out of the hug.

                                 MARCY
                        You are so tall.

           Glen touches Marcy’s arm, snapping her back into the room.
           She wipes her eyes.

                                 MARCY
                        Can we get you anything to drink?
                        We have lemonade.

                                 GLEN
                        And tea. And a variety of juices.

                                 MARCY
                        And a variety of teas.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        Water?

                                 GLEN
                        Coming right up.

           Glen exits to the kitchen to get water. Marcy stands with
           Leia anticipating a change, Leia just stands. Marcy steps
           back and offers the room to her.

                                 MARCY
                        Make yourself comfortable. Please.

           Leia walks around the room, slowly. She looks at photos.

                                 LEIA
                        Is this you?

           A photo of MARCY at 30. Happy. Healthy. With Glen

                                 MARCY
                        Yes.

                                 LEIA
                        And him? (Points off in the
                        direction Glen went)

                                 MARCY
                        Yep.

           The camera opens a little on the photo. We see and angelic
           little girl 4 years old.

                                 LEIA
                        And. This. This is me, then?

                                 MARCY
                        Yes. (Beat) We had taken some of
                        the pictures down, after a while. A
                        long while. It was difficult. To
                        see them all the time. And it was
                        difficult not to. But now we put
                        them back.

           Glen returns with two glasses of water. He hands Leia a
           glass, she sips. He hands Marcy a glass, she places it down.

                                 LEIA
                        You look so young.

                                 MARCY
                        I was.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Leia looks at another string of pictures. One of a tiny
           smiley girl suited up and on top of a horse, a near by Marcy
           clapping in the background, with dated hair.

                                 LEIA
                        I rode horses?

                                 MARCY
                        You had just started. You were only
                        4, but you kept asking. And your
                        friend Caroline had taken some
                        lessons, so you just couldn’t let
                        it go. Horses this and horses that.
                        Do you remember Caroline?

                                 LEIA
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        Your birthdays were only ten days
                        apart, so we always had joint
                        parties.

                                 GLEN
                        You two always had a costume party,
                        being so close to Halloween. You
                        insisted on two costumes, you were
                        always a princess for your party
                        and something else for Halloween.

                                 LEIA
                        Isn’t my birthday is March 15th?

                                 MARCY
                        No. It’s October 21st.

                                 LEIA
                        I celebrate it on March 15th.

           Marcy picks up one of the framed photos and shows it to
           Leia. It is two young girls, one is a princess, another is a
           cat. They sit smiling in front of a sheet cake, candles lit,
           various adult bodies hovering around them.

                                 MARCY
                        See here, that’s you and that’s
                        Caroline. You’re about to blow out
                        the candles. Look at all the
                        pumpkins. The leaves.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Leia abandons the photos and drinks her water. Glen and
           Marcy make a move to the couch. They sit.

                                 GLEN
                        We made a cheese plate, if you’re
                        hungry. There is a pie in the oven.
                        Do you still like pie?

                        Sure.

                                 MARCY
                        Please sit. Be comfortable. Let us
                        know if we can get you anything.

           Leia sits in an arm chair. After a moment she eats a
           piece a cracker. Glen and Marcy sit on the sofa, on the
           side closest to the chair.

                                 GLEN
                        You look good. Healthy.

                                 LEIA
                        I feel healthy.

           Marcy smiles with relief. A huge comfort. A lifted weight.

                                 MARCY
                        Leanne. (To Glen) Leanne is here.

           She takes Glen’s hand as they sit. Parents again.

                                 LEIA
                        Actually, my name is Leia.

                                 GLEN/MARCY
                        What?

                                 LEIA
                        My name. Is Leia.

                                 MARCY
                        Leia?

                                 GLEN
                        You changed your name?

                                 LEIA
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        We named you Leanne. That’s what
                        we’ve always called you.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t remember that. I only know
                        my name is Leia.

                                 GLEN
                        From the movie?

                                 LEIA
                        What movie?

                                 GLEN
                        You don’t know?

                                 LEIA
                        Know what?

                                 MARCY
                        Your name.

           Beat.

                                 MARCY
                        Leia.

                                 LEIA
                        Yes?

                                 MARCY
                        No. I was just saying it. Your
                        name.

           A long moment. Marcy and Glen have adjusted on the couch,
           they no longer look like fawning parents but suddenly like
           they are interviewing a new roommate.

                                 GLEN
                        So. Tell us about yourself.

                                 LEIA
                        I’m tired.

                                 MARCY
                        Would you like to lay down?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes.

           Leia stands but does not know where to go. Marcy and Glen
           also stand.

                                 MARCY
                        You can go right up to your room.
                        We haven’t changed a thing.
           INT LEIA’S ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           A bedroom. It is the room of a four year old girl. Pink and
           full of out-dated toys. Frilly and cute. Piled in a corner
           there are missing posters with an iconic photo of Leia as a
           small girl, some boxes labeled “Leanne” with various years
           on them. The door opens, Leia comes in unsure, she sets her
           duffel down on the bed, which is small. There are some adult
           sized pajamas laid out with a note, "Welcome home! Sweet
           dreams!" She looks around, rummages in a box of toy blocks,
           finds a green triangular block and wedges it under the door
           so it can;t be opened. She sits on the bed and reaches in to
           one of the boxes labeled “Leanne 1991”, pulls out a small
           girls t-shirt. She holds it up to her, it sticks to her own
           shirt. She sits there a moment with this little shirt pinned
           to her. She takes it off. The room around her and the world
           outside get dark, sun has fallen and she sits in the grey
           leftovers. She turns on a bedside lamp, it is a night light
           and projects sea-creature shapes along the wall and rotates.
           It plays a lullaby. Leia sits as the music plays and the
           shapes dance over her.

           INT KITCHEN EVENING

           Marcy is wearing an apron. She puts a vase of flowers on the
           table. Looks at it. Moves it a little. Looks. Takes it off
           the table and puts them on a counter. Looks at the empty
           table. Puts the flowers back in the center.

           INT KITCHEN EVENING

           The three of them sit around the dinner table. They eat.
           Leia watches. She inspects the napkin rings.

                                 MARCY
                        I made macaroni casserole.
                        (Nothing) It’s your favorite.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh.

                                 GLEN
                        I would like to propose a toast.
                        (Marcy raises her glass, Leia
                        catches on) We have waited for this
                        moment for uncountable years.
                        Unknowable hours. To know you are
                        ok, to have you with us, is the
                        most amazing gift. Thank you. A
                        thousand thank you’s. My heart is
                        twice the size of the moon tonight

                                 GLEN (cont’d)
                        and our family is three times as
                        bright, thanks to you.

           They clink glasses and sip, Leia has never done this before.
           Marcy and Glen start to eat. Leia clasps her hands close to
           her chest and whispers a little prayer. It starts "Dear
           Universe" and ends "Sincerely Leia". In the middle somewhere
           she says "Watch Ben for me. If you can see him through those
           walls" but we barely barely hear it.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh. We’re sorry. We are being rude.
                        Are you saying Grace?

                                 LEIA
                        I’m doing a Dear Universe.
                        (Nothing) It’s a kind of prayer.
                        "Dear Universe, thank you for the
                        food I am going to be eating and
                        the thoughts I am going to be
                        thinking. Thank you for this moment
                        we are making." Then you make
                        wishes.

                                 GLEN
                        Wishes?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes. (She looks up, reiterating her
                        wishes to The Universe itself) I
                        wish for you to keep me honest.
                        Help me know who I am and ...(Back
                        to the table) anything else you
                        want. Sincerely, Leia. You can add
                        a PS if you feel necessary.

                                 MARCY
                        What church is that?

                                 LEIA
                        No church. Church is for people who
                        can’t believe in themselves. The
                        Universe is for when you believe in
                        everything. (She eats)

                                    GLEN
                        You must be hungry. It’s been quite
                        a couple of days. The police. The
                        hospital. Hospital food can’t be
                        good.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARCY
                        And all the beeping. Who can eat
                        with all that beeping.

           They eat. Leia uses a napkin with the napkin ring still in
           place, holding it like a handle.

                                 MARCY
                        I remember when I was in the
                        hospital after I had you, they
                        brought me some food, this was when
                        they let you stick around more than
                        45 minutes, you stayed the night.
                        Sometimes two. And they brought me
                        some food and I couldn’t identify
                        it. Literally had no idea. It was
                        like astronaut food, I swear.
                        Freeze dried squares in sauce. I
                        only ate the Jello.

                                 GLEN
                        I remember that. I had some Rolos
                        in my pocket you went just nuts
                        for. (To Leia) She went bananas. I
                        had never seen anyone eat half a
                        tube of Rolos like that before.

                                 MARCY
                        I was starving. They should have a
                        turkey dinner waiting for you after
                        you give birth, I mean really, it’s
                        like body Olympics, except there is
                        only one athlete for the entire
                        thing. A hyperventilating woman in
                        a paper dress.

           Marcy and Glen laugh. Leia does not.

                                 MARCY
                        I guess Olympians eat Power Bars,
                        but we didn’t have Power Bars back
                        then. We had barely just discovered
                        Pita Bread.

           The laugh fades into a joint sigh. They eat.

                                 MARCY
                        When we came home your father had
                        made me lasagnas. More than one.

                                 GLEN
                        My mother made them. I was too
                        nervous, running around putting

                        safety plugs in the outlets. As
                        though you’d be anywhere near the
                        outlets. God, what was I, 16?

                                 MARCY

                                 GLEN
                        Was I ever 26?

           Marcy and Glen laugh. Leia eats without joining in. The
           laugh fades into just a feeling Leia’s not a part of.

           INT KITCHEN LATER

           The water runs. Marcy does dishes. Glen puts more dishes in
           the sink. Marcy shuts the water off. Just the sound of water
           sloshing as she scrubs. Glen puts dinner rolls back into
           their plastic bag. She stops washing and just looks at the
           water. She takes a big breath in. Glen spins the plastic bag
           closed and fastens it. Marcy smiles and cries. They hug.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM NIGHT

           Leia Lays in bed and writes in a notebook.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DIFFERENT DAY

           Leia gets dressed out of pajamas and then sits on her bed.

           INT LIVING ROOM DAY

           Marcy sorts mail while Glen reads the newspaper. We hear
           Leia’s bedroom door open and a few footsteps, Marcy stops
           what she is doing in anticipation. We hear the bathroom door
           close. Marcy puts the mail down, neatens the pile. Toilet
           flushes, water runs. We hear the bathroom door open, foot
           steps and then Leia’s door close. Marcy waits. Nothing.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DIFFERENT DAY

           Leia looks out the window.
           INT KITCHEN DAY

           Marcy, Glen and Leia eat an egg breakfast, Glen is dressed
           for work. They both smile. Leia, after a moment, smiles
           back.

           INT DR ANDREWS OFFICE DAY

           The sterile yet cluttered interior office of court appointed
           psychologist DR ANDREWS. Folders, paperwork, two boxes of
           tissues, one on a side table for her guests, one at her desk
           for her to reach forward and offer. One window. Mostly
           bookshelves. DR ANDREWS is a focused and pleasant African
           American woman in her 40’s. She is appropriately patient but
           in no way maternal. There is a long moment before anyone
           talks.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Okay. So, would you say that your
                        first week home has been a positive
                        experience?

                                 LEIA
                        Sure.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        I’ve noticed you say that a lot.
                        "Sure".

                                 LEIA
                        We just met.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        But over the last half hour; would
                        you like to sit, can I get you some
                        tea, have you been sleeping on a
                        regular schedule, do you find

                        Maybe you should ask different
                        questions.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Maybe you’re right. How would you
                        describe your first week home?

                                 LEIA
                        As a positive experience.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Do I make you uncomfortable?

                                 LEIA
                        No. Do I make you uncomfortable?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Of course not.

                                 LEIA
                        OK.

           As Dr Andrews goes on, Leia’s focus shifts around the office
           to the bindings of books about disorders, a model head with
           half of the skull cut away revealing a plastic labeled
           brain, a quote-a-day calendar with "It is our light, not our
           darkness that most frightens us -Marianne Williams"in bold
           type.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        "Sure" is a noncommittal statement,
                        even as an affirmative. If I say
                        "Do you want some tea" and you say
                        "sure", it says to me that you want
                        tea because I offered it. Not
                        because you want it.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        I want you to feel free to express
                        definites. Concrete feelings. This
                        is a safe environment.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok. I don’t really want this tea.

           Leia puts her tea on the desk.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Everything you say here is
                        confidential.

                                 LEIA
                        Really?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Of course.

                                 LEIA
                        But you keep writing things in that
                        folder.

                                 LEIA
                        It is the same kind of folder they
                        have about me in the police
                        station. And they are the ones
                        making me talk to you.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        I am court appointed. I work for
                        the state. But this is a standard

                                 LEIA
                        But there is a trial, right?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        There will eventually be a trial,
                        yes.

                                 LEIA
                        Will you talk at it?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Are you concerned about the trial?

                                 LEIA
                        Should I be?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        You haven’t done anything wrong, so
                        no. Not at all.

                                 LEIA
                        But you’ll talk at it?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        If they call me as a witness I have
                        to.

                                 LEIA
                        Witness to what? You didn’t see
                        anything. No one saw anything.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        How do you feel about that?
                        (Silence). My only true concern is
                        how you are doing. How you are
                        feeling. That you feel supported.

                        make that clearer to you, do not
                        hesitate to tell me. I am here for

                        "Leanne"? Everyone keeps calling me
                        "Leanne".

                        Leia (She writes in the folder)
                        Done. And why Leia?

                                 LEIA
                        Because that’s my name.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Did Mr. McKay give you that name?

                                 LEIA
                        I guess so.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        (She writes more, stops) It’s
                        pretty.

                                 LEIA
                        Thank you. (Beat) Also, can you
                        stop calling it "home", like my
                        "transition back home"

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Alright. Does it not feel like home
                        to you?

                                 LEIA
                        Would a place you don’t remember

                        was supposed to?

                        Like a place I don’t remember. Like
                        a neighbor’s house.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Did you spend a lot of time at
                        neighbor’s houses when you were
                        with Mr. Mckay?

                                 LEIA
                        No. I spent time at home.

           They look at each other. Andrews writes.

           INT CAR LATE AFTERNOON

           GLEN drives, LEIA sits in the passenger seat. Cars are still
           a new experience, she can count the number of times she has
           been in a car on one and a half hands. She alternates
           between looking out the window, looking at the mechanics of
           what Glen is doing (a blinker, a turn, mirrors). Glen talks
           but only after he realizes Leia isn’t going to.

                                 GLEN
                        How was it?

                                 LEIA
                        Long.

                                 GLEN
                        Is she nice?

                                 LEIA
                        Sure.

           The suburb rolls past them; houses, street lights, kids
           playing in a park - Leia cranes her neck a little like she
           might be looking for herself in the group.

           EXT ROAD WITH A SMALL SHOPPING CENTER

           The car drives and pulls into a shopping center.
           INT CAR

                                 GLEN
                        We just have to stop in here for a
                        sec.

           EXT SHOPPING PLAZA

           Glen and Leia get out of the car and walk into the store.
           Glen talks about how he forgot the cloth bags at home and
           how he should really just keep them in the trunk. We don’t
           really hear him because there is a loud metal sound on the
           pavement, amplified. A guy in a red uniform vest pushes a
           long line of carts past them, Leia is confused and fixated.
           The guy and her make eye contact, Leia’s brow furrows into a
           knot and she looks away immediately nervous.

           They walk through the automatic sliding doors, Leia more
           tentative than Glen.

           Once they are inside the grocery store, the sounds, the
           displays, the enormity of it all seems both muffled and
           amplified, like a seashell held to your ear. This grocery
           store is huge. To her. And so well lit. So bright. With so
           much inside. So many shelves of so many things. What are all
           these things. What are these wheely carts. Why are so many
           people wearing red vests. Leia focuses on everything and
           nothing all at once.

           They move through the store, Leia trails slightly behind
           quietly observing the little details of the store, the
           music, the packages, the lobster tank. What the fuck is this
           tank of living things doing here. This is the first time she
           has seen a lobster in person. She is riveted with a
           determined restraint not to let on. Glen is oblivious,
           saturated in the normalcy of it. He holds up a container of
           ice cream

                                 GLEN
                        Dessert?

                              (Nods)

           As they look around the store we see a customer look at Leia
           a little longer than a glance. A woman looks and then
           whispers to her husband who turns to look.

           They get to check-out and as they stand in line Leia sees a
           newspaper, THE PENN GAZETTE with a photo of her as a child
           and the headline "A Family Reunion Holds Hope Against
           Heartbreak" and another paper with a large picture of Leia’s

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           missing poster and BEN’s mugshot with the headline "Found
           Alive; Leanne Dargon Survives 17 Years of Captivity as Her
           Abductor faces a Lifetime Behind Bars". Leia looks. And
           looks. GLEN catches her.

                                 GLEN
                        You don’t have to look at that.
                        It’s just. It’s just there.

                                 LEIA
                        Can I have this?

                                 GLEN
                        No. Not right now. Okay?

           The PERSON ahead of them in line has been stealing glances
           and finally leans in and whispers..

                                 PERSON
                        It’s just amazing. A miracle.

                        begins) Thank you.

                        trying to get Leia’s
                        attention) You are so

           Glen gets their groceries and they nudge past her

                        Have a good day, Ma’am.

           They walk out of the store with a small plastic bag of
           groceries and into the parked car. Once inside...
           INT CAR EVEN LATER AFTERNOON

                                 GLEN
                        Sorry about that. People have a lot
                        of questions. And it gets the
                        better of them sometimes.

                        ....The unknown.

                                 LEIA
                        I could ask everyone else the same
                        question.

                                 GLEN
                        Yes. I guess you could.

                                 LEIA
                        But I don’t.

           INT KITCHEN, LATER

           Marcy stands looking at the wall where there are three paint
           chips taped, all of them a different shade of the same
           neutral color. She looks and looks. She takes one down.
           Looks. Puts it back up. Looks. Glen comes in, puts down his
           keys and the groceries. Marcy remains involved in her
           decision making.

                                 GLEN
                        What’s this?

                                 MARCY
                        I want to paint the kitchen.

                                 GLEN
                        Ok.

                                 MARCY
                        Make it nicer. And maybe the living
                        room.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Glen puts ice cream in the freezer, gets something out of
           the fridge. Nibbles.

                                 GLEN
                        When?

                                 MARCY
                        We have to pick colors first.

           Glen comes and looks at the colors.

                                 GLEN
                        I like the middle one.

           Marcy takes the other two swatches down. They look. He
           chews.

                                 GLEN
                        We should redo Leia’s room. She’s
                        outgrown what it looks like now.
                        Make her more comfortable.

                                 MARCY
                        We want to get her out of her room
                        Glen. Not keep her in there.

                                 GLEN
                        It might make her feel more at
                        home.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know.

                                 GLEN
                        I think it would be nice.

                                 MARCY
                        Lets worry about down here first.

           Glen looks at Marcy. He moves to the back of the kitchen and
           then out of the room. Marcy puts the other two paint chips
           back up.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM LATER

           Leia enters and shuts the door behind her, she lifts up her
           shirt, revealing a newspaper tucked into her waistband. She
           takes it out and unfolds it carefully, she reads. She reads.
           Her eyes fill with water. Her face registers whispers of
           concern, confusion, surprise, defiance and then defeat. She
           reads, she looks. Big fat tears hit the print, She wipes
           them away. One falls on Ben’s photo, then another. She tries
           to blot them off without ruining the picture.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           From off camera we hear a little voice. The voice of a
           little girl.
                        "You are ruining it. You are
                        ruining everything"

           Leia looks up and over, we follow her gaze and there are Ben
           and a 7 year old Leia. Their clothes are slightly dirty, and
           out of date. Where they sit on Leia’s carpeted floor, it
           feels slightly different from the rest of the room, the
           basement bleeding into her present. Ben is younger and less
           haggard than his mug shot from the paper, he is average
           looking, not at all creepy. He has a commanding presence but
           not that of a bully, more of a politician. A politician in
           blue collar clothes with dirt under his nails. We alternate
           between watching just them and watching Leia as she watches
           them too.

                                 BEN
                        Don’t say that.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        Ruiner!

                                 BEN
                        That’s not very nice Leia.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        You are not very nice.

                                 BEN
                        Who do you know that’s nicer than
                        me?

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        (Stops crying. Thinks) No one.

                                 BEN
                        That’s right.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        Not fair. I only know you.

                                 BEN
                        I think it’s more than fair. You
                        can only judge niceness comparably.
                        You have nothing to compare to. So
                        you wouldn’t know if I was nice or
                        not. However, I know lots of people
                        and I can tell you that you are not
                        being very nice to me right now, at
                        all.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        (Cries again) I don’t want to be
                        nice to you! You are hurting him!
                        Let’s take him to the hospital! He
                        has to go to the hospital.

                                 BEN
                        Leia. We all know he can’t go to
                        the hospital. And Why?

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        But he has to!

                                 BEN
                        Yes. Why? You can’t just say
                        something is bad without knowing
                        why.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        (Reciting) They have no confidence
                        in the nature of things. And no
                        respect for the mystery of life.

                                 BEN
                        Yes. And part of the mystery of
                        life is death, and part of the
                        nature of things is accepting that.

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t want him to die.

                                 BEN
                        Well well, look who’s lost their
                        confidence in me.

           Young Leia pouts with rebellion. Ben finishes what he is
           working on. It is a teddy bear. A Teddy Ruxbin. Ben has
           reattached a broken arm.

                                 BEN
                        There.

           Ben holds the bear up, moves the arm. Moves the other arm.
           Turns the bear on. Both it’s arms move. It says something
           like "Hello, I’m Teddy Ruxbin". Ben shuts the bear off.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        That’s what I told you I was doing.

                        I thought you were hurting him.
                        Like a doctor.

                                 BEN
                        No. I was fixing him, like a Ben.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        (Laughs) You are the best Ben ever.

                                 BEN
                        I know.

           Ben moves some hair out of Leia’s face. Wipes her cheeks,
           they are all wet from crying.

                                 BEN
                        You are a mess.

                        You get so worked up.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        Sorry.

                        You don’t have to apologize. We
                        can’t help how we feel. But we can
                        help what we think. Why would you
                        think I was hurting Teddy?

                                 YOUNG LEIA

                        I thought you were mad at me.

                                 BEN
                        Why would I be mad at you?

                        I don’t know. (Beat) For looking
                        out the window.

                                 BEN
                        I was concerned about you looking
                        out the window. I don’t want you to
                        see something scary. But I fixed
                        it. Now we don’t have to worry
                        about that.

           We see a part of Leia’s wall has a small basement-sized
           window suddenly, it is boarded up, taped over and painted
           shut.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        I know, but you yelled.

                                 BEN
                        I know. But, even if I was mad at
                        you I wouldn’t hurt you by hurting
                        Teddy.

                                 YOUNG LEIA

           Young Leia puts her head on Ben’s shoulder and wipes her
           nose on his sleeve. Leia wipes her own nose on her own
           sleeve. She looks back and they are gone, as are any relics
           of the basement.

           INT LIVING ROOM NIGHT.

           Marcy, Glen and Leia sit watching TV and eating ice cream.
           Light flickers on their faces. Marcy and Glen laugh. Leia
           does not.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE DAY

           Someone rides by on a bike.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DAY

           She closes a notebook and reads a tattered copy of "The Frog
           Prince"
           INT DARGON HOUSE, HALLWAY

           Marcy hovers outside of Leia’s door. Finally she knocks. We
           hear Leia say "Yes?" from the other side. Marcy cracks the
           door open a bit, then a bit more and sticks her head
           through.

                                 MARCY
                        Hi. It’ a beautiful day.

           EXT DARGON YARD DAY

           Leia sits outside, on the ledge of a patio. We hear Glen
           mowing the lawn in the distance. She watches a bird in a
           tree. She picks up a leaf from the ground. Holds it in her
           hands. The bird flies away. Marcy comes into sight and hands
           Leia a glass of lemonade. Leia takes it but only holds it.

           INT KITCHEN LATER

           LEIA quietly looks through drawers and cabinets for tools to
           make a sandwich, the way you look through someone else’s
           kitchen. The paint swatches are still taped to the wall,
           next to sample spots painted on hastily. We hear Marcy call
           in...

                                 MARCY
                        Let me know if you need a hand in
                        there!

           Leia assembles a sandwich using pre-made tuna salad in the
           fridge. It’s clumsy but not an obstacle.

           INT LIVING ROOM

           Marcy looks through a photo album from their earlier life.
           The smoke alarm in the kitchen goes off. Marcy jumps up-

                                 MARCY
                        You ok in there? I’ll get it.

           INT KITCHEN

           When Marcy goes into the kitchen she sees that there is a
           sandwich on fire on the stove-top, in the flame. Leia is
           looking up and around for where the sound might be coming
           from and why, she has covered her ears and says "I’m sorry,
           I’m sorry" over the beeping.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCY
                        Ooh, I think I see the problem.

           She puts the sandwich in the sink, pats the fire out and
           then unscrews the alarm, which shuts off.

                                 LEIA
                        I like them warm. I like the bread
                        toasty, sorry. I just. Sorry.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s ok. (Catches her breath) It’s
                        ok. The toaster is right here.

           Leia looks blankly.

                                 MARCY
                        So you can toast the bread first
                        and then make the sandwich.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh. Yeah.

                                 MARCY
                        Here, why don’t we start over.

           Marcy hands Leia some bread. Leia holds it. Goes to the
           toaster. Lays the bread on top for a second then after
           thinking it through pokes it into the slot. Then just stands
           there looking at it. Marcy watches.

                                 MARCY
                        And then you turn it on.

                                 LEIA
                        Right.

           Leia stares. Then moves a dial. Waits. Marcy leans over and
           presses the lever down.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh.

                                 MARCY
                        Have you ever used a toaster
                        before? (Leia does not answer.
                        Marcy looks at the stove, the very
                        messy kitchen) Have you ever cooked
                        at all?

                                 LEIA
                        This is the first kitchen I’ve been
                        in.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCY
                        The first kitchen you’ve been in?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes.

                                 MARCY
                        Ever? Or I mean, since...?

                                 LEIA
                        I guess.

                                 MARCY
                        Mr. McKay didn’t have a kitchen?

                                 LEIA
                        We had a kitchen. Obviously. Just I
                        never went in there. It was in a
                        different part of the house. Ben
                        always cooked for me. Mr. McKay.

                                 MARCY
                        What part of the house was it in?

                                 LEIA
                        The top part.

                                 MARCY
                        So you never left the basement at
                        all? You weren’t allowed in the
                        other parts of the house?

                                 LEIA
                        We didn’t call it a basement. It
                        was where we lived.

                                 MARCY
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 LEIA
                        That’s ok. It’s an honest mistake.

                                 MARCY
                        What is?

                                 LEIA
                        Calling it a basement.

                                 MARCY
                        I meant for everything. I’m sorry
                        for everything.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        That’s ok. You’re trying.

           They look at each other. The toast pops.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM, EVENING

           Leia sits looking out the window. We can hear Glen and Marcy
           talking downstairs.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s just, we don’t know what she
                        is going through, we don’t know
                        what she knows.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s a process.

                                 MARCY
                        Glen, she set fire to a sandwich on
                        the stove. That was her
                        understanding of toast.

                                 GLEN
                        But now she knows. Progress.

                                 MARCY
                        You don’t make progress just
                        because you realize you’re wrong.
                        You have to learn to be right.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM NIGHT

           Marcy reads "Connecting With Our Children : Guiding
           Principles for Parents in a Troubled World", she makes a
           note on a legal sized pad of paper.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, EVENING

           The three of them eat dinner quietly. Leia looks at Glen, he
           smiles, she politely returns the gesture.

                                 GLEN
                        Good?

                                 LEIA
                        Yeah. It’s good.

                They eat. Silverware on plates.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Brussel Sprouts get a bad rep, but
                        I like them.

                                 LEIA
                        I hated them when I was little and
                        Ben said that growing to like them
                        was a mark of maturity. He called
                        them "Sophistication Sprouts".

           Glen and Marcy look at each other.

                                 LEIA
                        It has to do with Chemicals. (beat)
                        Brussel Sprouts have a chemical in
                        them that only kids can taste.
                        (Beat) The same way there are
                        sounds that only a dog can hear.
                        But as you get older you can’t
                        taste the chemical anymore and only
                        taste the vegetable.

           Marcy clears her throat.

                                 GLEN
                        Oh.

                                 LEIA
                        It’s pretty interesting.

           Leia eats another green bite. The table feels sullen. Marcy
           talks to the plate in front of her.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know if- (switches gears) I
                        don’t know if anyone wants more
                        salad, but I’ll bring some out.

           Marcy gets up from the table.

           Leia Lays in bed and says a Dear Universe in the dark.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE MORNING

           Glen leaves for work. We see him get into his car with a
           coffee and a brief case.
           INT LEIA’S ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Leia sits on her bed fully dressed. She gets up. Looks out
           the window. Leaves her room.

           INT HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER.

           The house is quiet. We hear the shower running in the
           bathroom. Leia walks past the sound downstairs.

           INT DOWNSTAIRS MOMENTS LATER

           Leia walks into the kitchen. Takes two cookies off a plate
           in the kitchen. Eats one. Loiters. Looks out the kitchen
           window. Goes out to the backyard.

           EXT DARGON YARD MORNING

           Leia eats her cookie. She sits with her back against the
           house. After a moment a bird lands on the ground. Leia
           tosses some cookie crumbs at it. It eats them. She tosses
           more.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM MOMENTS LATER

           Marcy finishes getting dressed. Her hair is still wet. She
           leaves her room

           INT DARGON HOUSE HALLWAY, MOMENTS LATER

           Marcy walks by Leia’s door and hovers there. She hesitently
           knocks. Nothing. She knocks again.

                                 MARCY
                        Leia?

           She knocks again. She politely opens the door. Sees the
           empty room and goes downs stairs without closing the door.

           INT DARGON HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS

           Marcy comes down into the living room excited.

                        Leia?

           Nothing. She goes into the kitchen.

           Nothing. She looks out the window into the yard, nothing.

           EXT DARGON YARD DAY

           We see Leia against the house feeding a bird and eating a
           cookie while Marcy looks out across the yard with increased
           anxiety.

           INT DARGON HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS

           Marcy peels through the living room again and back up the
           stairs.

           INT DARGON HOUSE HALLWAY

           Marcy looks into Leia’s room again and then the bathroom and
           then her own bedroom and then back down the stairs.

           INT DARGON HOUSE DOWNSTAIRS

           Marcy comes down stairs and opens the front door, she looks
           up and down the street.

           INT DARGON HOUSE KITCHEN

           Marcy peels into the kitchen again and looks around for her
           next step. She picks up the phone and looks at the key pad.
           What. What. What. She goes for the 9. The back door opens
           and Leia comes through it.

                                 MARCY

                        I didn’t see you out there.

           Marcy catches up to herself. Thinks a second.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        You know what we are going to do
                        today, we are going to get you an
                        ID. So that. You have an ID.

           Marcy picks up the phone and dials "411" Leia watches. We
           hear the muffled sound of an automated operator "City and
           state please"

                                 MARCY
                        Salem, Pennsylvania.

           The automated voice says "What listing?"

                                 MARCY
                        Department of Motor Vehicles.

           Marcy writes down a number, then the operator says "I will
           connect you" and the phone rings. Another muffled voice says
           "Department of Motor Vehicles"

                                 MARCY
                        I am calling to see what I need to
                        bring in today to get my daughter a
                        state ID card...

           Marcy writes down notes as the voice muffles on the other
           end. Leia has been watching carefully.

           INT DMV SAME DAY

           Marcy and Leia reach the head of a window, Marcy places a
           completed form, a social security card and a birth
           certificate down and slides them to a teller. Leia looks
           around at people in line, filling our forms, teenagers
           waiting for a driving test, small children growing restless
           waiting for their parents. Marcy takes Leia’s arm and she
           snaps out of it.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok. Now you go stand right over
                        there.

           Leia is suddenly standing in front of a plain back ground
           while a stranger says "Ready"? Then the repeated frantic
           blinks of a digital flash. Marcy watches. After the photo is
           taken, Leia is called over to the woman who took it. Marcy
           notices a small toddler of a girl hiding behind her mothers
           legs as she fills out a form. The little girl makes eye
           contact with Marcy. Marcy waves and says a tiny "Hi", the
           girl looks away. Leia returns to Marcy’s side.
           INT CAR LATE AFTERNOON

           Marcy and Leia drive down the street. Leia holds her ID card
           in her hands. It reads "Leanne Louise Dargon 10/21/198(her
           thumb covers the last digit) 426 Sycamore Drive, Salem
           Pennsylvania 00135" and has her height and weight etc.

                                 LEIA
                        What’s "Louise" mean?

                                 MARCY
                        It’s your middle name.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM NIGHT

           Leia has propped her ID against her vanity mirror and is
           looking at it, then her reflection.

           INT MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

           Marcy is propped up in bed reading "Like Glue; Crafts for
           Creating Bonds" she dog ears a page. Glen is getting
           undressed for bed. He slips into the covers.

                                 GLEN
                        Well, it sounds like you had a good
                        day.

                                 MARCY
                        Mmm-hmm. Sounds like it.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE MORNING

           Glens car is just pulling away.

           INT DARGON HOUSE MORNING

           Marcy is in the living room setting up a bunch of beading
           supplies. She lines everything up on the coffee table,
           making two "stations" of supplies, string, scissors,
           over-sized needles, beads. She sits and waits.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON
           INT DARGON HOUSE SAME TIME

           Marcy and Leia sit on the couch beading. For a while it is
           just the sound of beads.

                                 MARCY
                        Thanks for doing this with me.

                                 LEIA
                        You’re welcome.

           Beat. Beat.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s supposed be be therapeutic.
                        Meditative. (Beat. Beat. Beads.
                        Beads.) You used to love beads.
                        Your aunt Jill had a bead shop
                        before she moved to Santa Fe and
                        you loved sinking your hands into
                        the bins of glass beads. I wanted
                        to get you some but, I was always
                        worried you’d eat them when I
                        wasn’t looking. I figured it’d be
                        something I could get you for your
                        tenth birthday.

           They string beads.

                                 MARCY
                        What are you making?

                                 LEIA
                        A string of beads.

           The sound of beads. Marcy looks at a handful of beads.

                                 MARCY
                        It looks like I can only fit 6 more
                        beads on my bracelet but I have 10
                        left. Which beads should I leave
                        out?

           Leia looks at the beads in Marcy’s hand. They are all
           different, but not drastically so.

                                 LEIA
                        Any of them.

                                 MARCY
                        Well. Help me out. Which ones?

           Leia looks at the beads. Then at Marcy.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        I know things.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh - I know, I-

                                 LEIA
                        I wasn’t nothing to him. He raised
                        me.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok.

           They look at each other. Leia gets up.

                                 LEIA
                        Also, "ones" isn’t a word.

           She walks away, upstairs.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

           Marcy and Glen are getting ready for bed.

                                 MARCY
                        -and she spends so much time alone.

                                 GLEN
                        She is used to being alone. We
                        think. Give her time.

                                 MARCY
                        I just. I want to be a part of it.
                        What she is going through. I want
                        to know what she knows and. Just be
                        a part of it.

                                 GLEN
                        We are.

                                 MARCY
                        She. I don’t know. I’m - Not doing
                        this right.

                                 GLEN
                        All we’re supposed to be doing is
                        being here. We’re here. She’s here.
                        We’re doing fine.

                                 MARCY
                        Are you going to undercut
                        everything I say?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GLEN
                        You want me to agree that you’re
                        not doing this right?

                                 MARCY
                        I just want us to be on the same
                        page.

                                 GLEN
                        We are. I am just seeing it from a
                        different side. Don’t take it
                        personally. She will let us in, in
                        time.

                                 MARCY
                        It is our responsibility to figure
                        out how to involve her. Make her a
                        part of things. It is our job to
                        give her the world.

                                 GLEN
                        We will. But we just need to let it
                        unfold, on it’s own. This is a long
                        road. It has been and will be a
                        long road.

                                 MARCY
                        I know that. And I think the road
                        gets a lot longer if you’re not
                        moving forward.

                                 GLEN
                        It’ll happen.

                                 MARCY
                        Are you not worried?

                                 GLEN
                        No. And if I was, I’d just be happy
                        to have her here to worry about.

                                 MARCY
                        You’re right, right? Ok. Me too.

           They turn off their bedside lights. From the dark...

                                 MARCY
                        But I still want to give her the
                        world.
           INT LEIA’S ROOM DAY

           Leia gets dressed out of pajamas and then sits on her bed.

           INT DR ANDREWS OFFICE ANOTHER DAY

           We pan along Dr Andrews office, taking in the room again, we
           follow the floor and we hear...

                                 BEN

                        Ben thinking about you all day.

           We see a our Young Leia again, in different clothes sitting
           on the floor of the office, coloring. Again, the line
           between the basement and the present bleed. We are still in
           Andrews’ office, but so is a ratty chair and a speak and
           spell, and maybe a boarded up, taped shut, painted over
           window. Ben stands behind her, we only see him from the
           waist down, his arms are behind his back. Young Leia looks
           up at him.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        What is that!

                                 BEN
                        I don’t know.

           Ben sits in one of Andrews’ chairs, Young Leia at his feet,
           he is holding a present.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        It says my name I see it!

           She grabs the present and opens it. She takes out a view
           finder and some slide reels.

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        What is it?

                        Look through it.

           Young Leia figures out where to look and looks through, she
           is breathless

                                 YOUNG LEIA

                        up. (They do. Ben replaces the reel
                        and peeks through the view finder
                        and then hands it to Leia) That’s
                        Ursa Major, which means The Great
                        Bear. Next to it is Ursa Minor,
                        which is the Little bear.

                        Yes, like us. They are up in the
                        sky together forever. Looking down
                        over everything.

           Leia looks at them on the floor, laying side by side.

           Our view opens and we see Leia, Young Leia, Ben and Dr
           Andrews all in the same shot. Ben and Young Leia looking up
           towards the sky, Leia looking at them and Andrews looking at
           her. Andrews takes her glasses off and sets them on her
           desk.

                        Sorry.

                        Nothing. (Beat) Just about how cold

                        Yeah. I’m not used to the cold. I’m
                        used to being inside.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE, DIFFERENT DAY

           Leaves are just starting to change color. A breeze blows.
           Marcy gets out of her car and walks around to the backseat,
           she gets something from the car and holds it in both arms.
           She walks up to the front door and clumsily opens it.

           INT DARGON HOUSE LIVING ROOM

           Glen and Marcy stand near the couch, Marcy is almost giddy.
           Glen is pleased. Leia comes down the stairs.

                                 LEIA
                        What did you want to see me about?
                        Are you making me make beads again?

                                 GLEN
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        Not right now. Here, sit.

           She guides Leia to the couch, Glen follows. Leia sits and
           looks at them.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok. Now close your eyes.

                                 LEIA
                        Why?

                                 GLEN
                        We have a surprise.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok.

           Leia closes her eyes and Marcy goes into the other room,
           talking as she goes...

                                 MARCY
                        Well. It’s your birthday soon and
                        also we never got you a coming home
                        present...

           Marcy has returned she has something, we can;t see it.

                                    MARCY
                        ...So this is kind of a early
                        birthday, belated homecoming gift
                        from us both.

                                 GLEN
                        We are very proud of you.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok.

           We see Leia on the couch, eyes closed. Marcy says

                                 MARCY
                        Open your eyes!

           As we see a puppy climb into frame, it is gangly and just
           old enough to be a little rowdy. It has a big bow on it’s
           neck and paws at Leia’s lap. Leia opens her eyes. She has
           never seen a dog before. She gasps. And recoils into the
           couch, the puppy follows.

                                 LEIA
                        What - ?!

           Leia curls as far into the couch as she can go and then
           climbs over the arm and gets behind the couch.

                                 GLEN
                        Leia, it’s ok. It’s a puppy.

                                 MARCY
                        It won’t hurt you.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s ok. It’s ok.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Glen and Marcy exchange looks. Leia peers over the couch at
           the dog as Marcy holds it’s leash.

                                 MARCY
                        Look. (She pets it) See, it won’t
                        hurt you.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s a pet.

                                 MARCY
                        Look, he’s sweet.

           Leia is stalk still behind the couch, Marcy brings the dog
           around, holding it’s collar.

                                 MARCY
                        Look. He’s soft. And harmless.

           Leia is terrified but curious. She lets Marcy bring the dog
           closer. Marcy puts Leia’s hand on the dog. The dog licks
           Leia’s face. Leia lets it. Her eyes fill with water. All at
           once she is hit with everything she’s missed. This dog
           kissing her face is both the best and worst thing she has
           ever felt. She cries.

                                 MARCY
                        See, he loves you.

           The dog licks and licks. Leia sobs an unwilling sob. She
           fights it the whole time. She scoots away from the dog,
           taking her face away, backing out of range.

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t want it.

                                 MARCY
                        Leia-

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t want it.

                                 GLEN
                        Leia, we’re sorr-

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t want it.

           She keeps backing toward the stairs, rights herself and
           tears herself away from the room, looking at the dog the
           whole time she goes back up the stairs. We hear her door
           close hard. Marcy and Glen look at each other. The dog
           bounds about on the other end of the leash, blissfully
           unaware of anything at all. Marcy is clearly devastated.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARCY
                        No. Don’t do that. Don’t make like
                        you are righting some wrong of
                        mine. I will take the dog back,
                        myself. It was my idea.

                                 GLEN
                        It’s nobody’s fault.

                                 MARCY
                        I can think of a world of fault,
                        actually. Actually I can think of
                        plenty of people who’s fault this
                        is.

                                 GLEN
                        There was no way to know.

                                 MARCY
                        Know what! That she doesn’t know
                        anything? That there is no undoing
                        what has been done to her?

                        Never seen a dog before?

                                 GLEN
                        I know.

                                 MARCY
                        Do you? Because I have no idea what
                        that means, for her, for us, for
                        for for the future. She’s never
                        seen a dog before, Glen. Do you
                        know what that means? Because I
                        don’t.

                                 GLEN
                        A lot of people are afraid of dogs.

                                 MARCY
                        She is not afraid of dogs, she has
                        never seen one.

                                 GLEN
                        Well, now she has. Progress. That’s

                        I am so sick of making mistakes. I
                        am especially sick of not making
                        mistakes but having them turn out
                        that way. And more than anything
                        right now, I don’t want to be made
                        to feel like I am wrong, when I am
                        just being realistic.

                        Well I don’t want you to confuse
                        being nihilistic with realism.

                                 MARCY
                        That’s exactly what I’m talking
                        about. Because maybe those two are
                        not that different in this case.
                        Maybe. And maybe the only way we
                        are going to get anywhere is by
                        acknowledging that.

                                 GLEN
                        We have to be patient.

                                 MARCY
                        I also want to be parents.

           INT MARCY’S CAR MOMENTS LATER

           Marcy gets the dog in the car, she gets into the drivers
           seat. The dog mills around in the back and makes puppy
           sounds. Marcy cries alone.

           INT BATHROOM EVENING

           Leia brushes her teeth. We hear Glen and Marcy in the other

                        handle on this? You don’t. We
                        don’t. Lets just admit that.

           Leia spits into the sink.

           INT LIVING ROOM

           Glen stands and Marcy sits on opposite sides of the living
           room.

                                 GLEN
                        You used to have all this faith in
                        her, that she was alive, that she
                        would come back, that she was okay.
                        And she is all of those things.

                                 MARCY
                        I know that.

                                 GLEN
                        But you have so little faith in her
                        now.

                                 MARCY
                        Being alive and living are
                        different things.

                                 GLEN
                        You think we can give advice on
                        living? We went 20 years without
                        it. So maybe we don’t know best.
                        And that’s ok. (A moment) So just
                        wait.I just think it is important
                        that we don’t push her.

                                 MARCY
                        Well, I think it is important that
                        she joins society and that we don’t
                        think of it as a choice, even if
                        that is how it is presented to her.

                                 GLEN
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t care. This isn’t about you.
                        It’s about her. (Beat)I don’t want
                        to be made to feel like wanting
                        things to be better is a some sort
                        of shortcoming on my part. Some
                        flaw. Because it’s not.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GLEN
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 MARCY
                        I didn’t say you said it.

           Marcy gets up and leaves the room. A moment. Glen leaves the
           room.

           INT MASTER BEDROOM NIGHT

           Marcy and Glen lay in bed with a large space between them.
           Marcy thinks.

           INT DARGON HOUSE LIVING ROOM NEXT EVENING

           Hot cocoa and cookies are on the coffee table. Glen, Marcy
           and Leia sit. Sometimes they sip.

                                 LEIA
                        Is this about the dog? I said I was
                        sorry.

                                 GLEN
                        No. Not at all.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s because I care about you.

                                 GLEN
                        We both do.

                                 MARCY
                        And we just want to talk to you
                        about your future.

                                 LEIA
                        My future?

           Leia puts her coco on the table. Sees a pair of reading
           glasses, either Glen or Marcy’s. She picks them up and
           fidgets with them as they talk, slides them into the sleeve
           of her shirt.

                                 MARCY
                        We know you’re smart. Educated. But
                        we don’t know in what areas
                        exactly. And I think the best way
                        to kind of, find out what you know
                        and structure future learning, to
                        start, is a tutor.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        What’s a tutor?

                                 GLEN
                        Like a teacher.

                                 MARCY
                        A teacher who will come to the
                        house and work with you, a couple
                        times a week.

           Glen and Marcy become a mumble. Something changes. We hear
           out of view

                                 BEN
                        Knock Knock (nothing) Knock Knock.

           We hear Leia’s voice separate from herself answer

                                 LEIA V/O
                        Go away.

           The living room seems darker, more underground. Glen and
           Marcy are inanimate. Ben appears behind Leia, we can only
           see him from the waist down.

                                 BEN
                        Leia.

           Leia turns and throws something in his direction.

                                 LEIA
                        Go away!

                                 BEN
                        Ok. Now that’s not fair.

           Leia is determined to shut him out. She is upset and almost
           breathless.

                                 LEIA
                        Where have you been? That’s what’s
                        not fair! Where have you been!

                                 BEN

                        days!

                                 LEIA
                        Why would you do that! Why! I
                        called your name!

                                 BEN

                        I called your name!

                        You know that’s not true.

                        Where were you!? (throws something)

                        I had things to take care of.

                        Care! Why don’t you care that I
                        hate you!

                                 BEN
                        Because, you don’t really hate me.

                                 LEIA
                        YES I DO! (She starts hitting him)

                        (Tries to hold her)

                                 LEIA
                        You were gone! You left me! You’re
                        going to leave me! You keep me in
                        here and you’re just going to leave
                        me here! Alone! You want me to die!
                        Like an animal!

           She hits him hard in the face, he bleeds. His tolerance
           shifts. Ben asserts his real strength. He grabs her, holds
           her tight, her arms clamped by her sides and shakes her

                                 BEN
                        Stop. It. (Shakes her) Look at me.
                        (Shakes her again) Look. At. Me.
                        Look at my face (She does) you did
                        that. Look what you did. (Leia
                        cries) It hurts. I hurt you and you
                        hurt me. Now we are even.

           Leia doesn’t respond. Ben shakes her again.

                                 BEN
                        And now we are even.

           Leia shakes her head in tentative agreement.

                                 BEN
                        But I didn’t mean to hurt you. I
                        didn’t mean to be away from you so
                        long. You did mean to hit me. You
                        aimed. And you got me. On purpose.

           Leia cries.

                                 BEN
                        Sometimes I have to stay away. I
                        would have told you if I’d known.
                        But if I don’t ever stay away
                        people will find out. About you.
                        About us. And then we’ll be done.
                        Do you get it?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 BEN
                        If you are not going to believe me,
                        then what? What do you have then?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Nothing! That’s the point. I don’t
                        have anything.

                                 BEN
                        Don’t do that. Everything I do is
                        for you. If you don’t have
                        anything, I’m a failure.

           Leia melts into Ben, he hugs her back. Her head rests on his
           chest

                                 LEIA
                        What is going to happen to me Ben?

                        What is going to happen to me,
                        after this?

                                 BEN
                        There is no "after-this".

                                 LEIA
                        But what if they get you?

                                 BEN
                        I’m the protector. They can’t get
                        me.

                                 LEIA
                        But what if they do? And what will
                        happen to me? I wouldn’t even know.
                        You would just never come back.

           Ben takes this in.

                                 LEIA
                        I want you to teach me, so I can go
                        out there with you. The only thing
                        I am is yours.

                                 BEN
                        And you are very good at it.

                        But if you go away what am I?

           They hug in quiet. A long moment.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           They have started slow dancing a little. Swaying in the hug.
           They move around in a circle in place.

                                 LEIA
                        Say it.

                                 BEN
                        We’ll change together.

           Leia lifts herself up and wraps her legs around Ben’s waist,
           she buries her face in his neck, he holds her tight and
           keeps them dancing.

                                 LEIA
                        I’m sorry I hit you.

                                 BEN
                        I’m sorry I made you.

           Leia’s face is full and flushed. Her cheeks are sticky from
           crying but, she is calm now. The sound of a coffee mug
           hitting the coffee table. Leia turns to the sound, Glen and
           Marcy are heard again, the living room no longer looks
           lightless. Leia is back on the couch.

                                 MARCY
                        ...Anyway, I’m blabbing. Think
                        about it. We have 8 whole weeks
                        before your first session.

           Leia looks back where Ben had been. He is gone.

                                 GLEN
                        Leia?

                                 MARCY
                        Great!

                        Are we overwhelming you?

                                 MARCY
                        We can talk about something else.
                        Like, here’s something fun: What
                        would you like to do for your
                        birthday?

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DAY

           Leia is on her bed, reading another article about Ben. It
           has clearly been folded and refolded. She stops reading at
           "...being held without bail at Packerton County Jail until
           trial"

           INT HALLWAY MOMENTS LATER.

           Leia comes out of her room. We can hear Marcy watching TV
           downstairs. Leia looks down the hall into the
           master bedroom, she walks in and picks up the portable
           phone by the bed and puts it by her ear, no dial tone. She
           takes in back into her room.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM

           Leia sits with the phone. She presses talk. The dial tone
           starts. She presses "411" it rings. The automated operator
           asks "City and state please"

                                 LEIA
                        Pennsylvania.

                                 OPERATOR
                        What listing?

                                 LEIA
                              (reading it off the paper)
                              Packerton County Jail.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The operator repeats the number. She writes it down. The
           operator then says "Please wait while we connect you" The
           phone rings. Another automated menu plays "Thank you for
           callimg Packerton County Jail. If you are a Law official
           press one, if you are calling about visitation, press two"

           Leia presses 2. It rings again. Then a Male Voice answers

                                 MALE VOICE
                        Packerton.

                                 LEIA
                        Yes. Hi. I am calling to find out
                        how to see someone there.

           She starts writing in a notebook "Photo ID, between 1pm and
           9pm, no personal belongings, no gifts, one visit a week"

                                 LEIA
                        Ok. How do I get there?

           The muffled voice starts to spout highway directions.

                                 LEIA
                        Is that for a car. I can’t drive a
                        car.

           Leia listens to the muffle and writes "F 42 bus to
           Fromton..."

           INT RESTAURANT NIGHT

           Leia sits at a table with Glen and Marcy as waiters and
           waitresses in matching polo shirts sing the happy birthday
           song and present a cake. Glen and Marcy smile and take a
           picture of her blowing out the candles.

           EXT DR ANDREWS OFFICE DAY

           It’s pretty grey out. And cold. Marcy’s car pulls up and
           Leia gets out. Marcy leans over and says

                                 MARCY
                        Glen will see you out here when
                        you’re done.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok. (She waves)

           Marcy pulls away. Leia walks away from the office
           building, She takes out a piece of paper from her pocket,

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           it’s the instructions scribbled with notes, directions to a
           bus stop. She walks quickly and nervously. The office is
           long gone, She sees a bus pulling up to a bus stop ahead,
           she reads the bus number off her note, it matches. She runs
           to catch it, as she gets on she asks the driver

                                 LEIA
                        Is this the 42 bus to Fromton, via
                        (Reads note) Stren- Strenich road?

                                 DRIVER
                        Yes.

           Leia takes a window seat and looks at her note with
           directions. "Take 42 bus to Fromton. wait for shuttle to..."
           The bus drives. It stops. It drives. Every time it stops
           Leia makes a hash mark at the top of her note. The bus goes
           under a tunnel, darkening the windows. Leia’s reflection is
           clear in the window. After a while, as the bus slows, she
           counts her hash marks, 22, and gets out of the bus.

           EXT BUS STOP DAY

           A handful of people get off the bus and walk in various
           directions. Leia stands as the bus pulls away. She holds her
           note. She is nervous. She is alone.

           EXT BUS STOP DAY LATER

           Leia now sits waiting. A shuttle pulls up dropping people
           off and picking Leia and 2 other folks up. It is a shuttle
           to the jail.

           INT SHUTTLE

           Leia looks out the window eagerly. The jail comes into view.

           EXT JAIL DAY

           Leia and two other people exit the shuttle and walk into the
           jail.

           INT JAIL DAY

           Leia waits in line anxiously as people sign in to visit and
           walk through a metal detector. Leia watches everyone closely
           to do it right.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She gets to the sign in table and shows her ID. when she
           signs the sign in sheet she writes "Leia" And pauses without
           taking her pen off the page adds "nne" and then she prints
           "Dargon" copying it from her ID.

                                 UNIFORMED CHECK-IN WORKER
                        ID.

           She hands the State ID to the check-in worker. They look at
           it and look at Leia. Leia is flagged through to the next
           station which is computer input and the metal dectector.

           She is instructed to place her fingers on a scanning device.
           She does. The machine beeps. She does. It scans. It beeps.

           Leia empties her pockets; the ID, the note, lint. She walks
           through the machine without a problem.

           INT JAIL VISITING AREA

           A door is opened. Leia and some other people are let into an
           area divided by glass. On the other side of the glass is a
           line of empty chairs. A buzzer buzzes. A door on the other
           side of the glass opens. A line of inmates in inmate outfits
           come out. One of them is Ben.

           Leia looks at Ben. Ben looks at Leia. This is the first time
           we really get to see him for ourselves. In the grim light of
           the jail and without the affectionate focus of Leia’s
           memory, he seems slightly different, slightly less. She
           stands when he walks in. He stays standing. Everyone around
           them settles. Ben sits. The room is heavy.

           He speaks, but we can’t hear him hardly at all. She sits. He
           gestures for her to come closer, pick up the phone. She
           shakes her head. He gestures to ask her why she won’t come
           closer.

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know. It’s hard.

           He gestures that he can’t hear her. She doesn’t react. He
           puts his hand against the glass. She scoots her chair a
           little closer. Ben is saying the words "I’m sorry" but we
           see it more than we hear it. She scoots her chair a little
           closer. Ben says again "I’m sorry".

                                 LEIA
                        Me too.

           A moment passes. Ben is still. She moves closer. He puts the
           phone to his ear. She picks up the phone. We can hear him
           now, his breathing, muffled yet mic- ed.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 BEN
                        Leia--

           Leia moves the phone away from her ear for a second, on her
           lap. She steels herself and lifts it again.

                                 BEN
                        Leia. You. You’re here. I miss you.

                                 LEIA
                        You look different.

                                 BEN
                        You look good. Your hair looks nice
                        like that.

           Leia pulls the elastic out of her hair. They look at each
           other.

                                 LEIA
                        Are you ever getting out of here?

                        with, so I didn’t think of it as
                        changing things. I thought of it as

                        it’s impossible to forget.

           EXT DR ANDREWS OFFICE LATER

           Glen waits in a running car out front, watching the door for
           Leia. He looks at his watch.

           CUT TO INT DARGON HOUSE EARLY EVENING

           Marcy is pacing she is dialing the phone, frantic, looking
           out the windows. It rings.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s Marcy Dargon again. Yes, thank

                        you.

           She hangs up the phone and dials another number. It’s an
           automated menu. She presses the zero button again and again
           then speaks into the receiver.

                        want to know if you have had any-
                        yes. No girls in their 20’s at all?
                        She looks young, teenagers, any
                        teenagers? Yes I’ll hold.

           The front door opens and Glen comes in. Marcy cups the phone
           receiver to talk to him.

                                 MARCY
                        Anything? Nothing?

                                 GLEN
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        Did you go by the Library? And that
                        store all the kids hang out in
                        front of-what’s it called, on State
                        Street?

                                 GLEN
                        Richdales, yes I did.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        What about-(The phone) Hello? Okay.
                        Thank you. Can I leave my number
                        again? It- ok. Sure. Thank you.
                        (Hangs up) Dammit.

                                 GLEN
                        I’m sure it’s fine.

                                 MARCY
                        You’re sure what’s fine? That we
                        can’t find out daughter? That she
                        is missing!

                                 GLEN
                        Hold on. She is not missing-

                                 MARCY
                        She’s not? Do you know where she
                        is?

                                 GLEN
                        It’s not like last time. This isn’t
                        the same.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s not? It’s not! Well I fucking
                        hope not!

                                 GLEN
                        Marcy! Stop! Stop it. Breathe.

                                 MARCY
                        She is always there when you pick
                        her up. Always. She could have
                        walked and gotten lost and been
                        picked up or hit by a car or worse.
                        She doesn’t know what she is doing.
                        How could Dr Andrews just let her
                        miss an appointment like that- what
                        exactly did she say again?

                                 GLEN
                        For the third time; Dr Andrews
                        assumed we knew.

                                 MARCY
                        Assumed we knew.

                                 GLEN
                        She called the house, no one was
                        home. She assumed Leia -

           CONTINUED:

                                 MARCY
                        Without a note? I can’t believe she
                        would just let her off the hook
                        without a note or without-

                                 GLEN
                        She is not a child! Our days of
                        writing notes are over! They came
                        and went and we weren’t in them,
                        ok. We don’t get to give
                        permission. Ever. For anything. But
                        we can give other things. We
                        finally get the chance to give her
                        other things. So Let’s do that.
                        Like a roof over her head, time,
                        patience (Beat) Maybe she wanted to
                        be alone. Maybe she went to a movie
                        or met up with someone and they
                        went for coffee.

                                 MARCY
                        Who? Who would she meet?

                                 GLEN
                        I don’t know. Someone. Anyone. She
                        should get out there, we shouldn’t
                        let her just be in her room all the
                        time. She has to live a life, not
                        just wait for...whatever she is
                        waiting for.

                                 MARCY
                        I know that Glen. Sometimes I think
                        I am the only one who knows that.
                        But I don’t think that getting lost
                        or hanging around strangers is very
                        constructive. Or safe. Or ok.

                                 GLEN
                        For you or for her?

                                 MARCY
                        Please go drive by the movie
                        theater, just see what’s playing
                        and check the times, maybe you’ll
                        see her leaving. Ask the box office
                        person if they’ve seen her. Show
                        them a picture (She grabs a framed
                        photo and plunges it at Glen, it is
                        of Leia as a child) Just please, do
                        something. We have to always be
                        doing something.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 GLEN
                        I think right now we should just
                        wait. That is enough. It’s only
                        been a couple of hours.

                                 MARCY
                        Five hours. Please go to the movie
                        theater.

                                 GLEN
                        I am going to go to Vinnie’s and
                        pick up a pizza for dinner. Vinnies
                        is near the movie theater. If I
                        happen to see her when I go, then I
                        do. But I am not going to the movie
                        theater to show this photo to the
                        person at the box office. I know
                        it’s difficult to keep perspective,
                        but this is not before. This is not
                        happening again.

                                 MARCY
                        No, last time we started looking
                        after minutes. Not hours. At thirty
                        minutes we had people combing the
                        streets and we still didn’t find
                        her. Five hours is an eternity if
                        you ask me. Five hours is a
                        lifetime. So go get your fucking
                        pizza if you want, but don’t come
                        back here without her.

           Glen leaves. Marcy paces. She pours a drink. Drinks it.
           Looks out the windows - nothing. She stands there a moment
           and then goes upstairs.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM MOMENTS LATER

           Marcy comes into the room and looks around. She opens a
           drawer, closes it. Opens another, closes it. Opens another,
           leaves it open. She sees Leia’s duffel bag, opens it and
           looks inside, then turns it over and dumps it out clothes,
           the viewfinder and a few books spill onto the floor. She
           looks under the bed, pulling things from under it and
           flinging them across the room. She is getting more and more
           frantic. She lifts the mattress and the sheets and pillows,
           shaking them all before she tosses them down. Sits, gives
           up. Then she tries again, rips all the bedding off the bed,
           scours everything, she sees a part of the mattress that has
           been sliced open, she reaches her hand in and pulls out
           something wrapped in a shirt. Unwraps it to reveal articles
           about her and Ben, collected from various newspapers and

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           magazines. Marcy flips through the pile furiously, there are
           also a few hand drawn pictures of Ben on lined notebook
           paper.

           INT BUS EVENING

           Leia rides home on the bus, counting/crossing off the hash
           marks she left on the way there. She looks at her reflection
           in the window against the darkening sky. The bus starts to
           slow. She counts the hash marks, she has arrived. She looks
           at her reflection again, she holds up the ID and props it in
           the window frame. She exits the bus without it.

           EXT PENNSYLVANIA STREET EVENING

           Leia walks. We see her pass the sign for Dr Andrews office,
           she references her note and keeps walking. Turns down a
           street.

           EXT DARGON CUL DE SAC

           Leia walks, turns onto the Dargon’s street.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM

           Marcy sits on Leia’s bed with the clippings and pictures.

           We hear the front door open and close.

           INT LIVING ROOM

           Leia has just come in. Marcy runs down stairs.

                                 LEIA
                        Hello.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh my God. Where were you? Are you
                        ok? Where were you? (Nothing)
                        Leeanne. Where were you?

                                 LEIA
                        I went for a walk.

                                 MARCY
                        A walk? Yes.

                                 LEIA
                        Yes.

                                 MARCY
                        Where? Where did you walk to?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know. A park.

                                 MARCY
                        What park?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARCY
                        Greyson park?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know. Yes.

                                 MARCY
                        With the fountain?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes. I sat in the fountain for a
                        while.

                                 MARCY
                        In it?

                                 LEIA
                        On it. Whatever you do with a
                        fountain.

                                 MARCY
                        You sat on the fountain?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes.

                                 MARCY
                        There is no fountain at Greyson
                        Park.

                                 LEIA
                        Then why did you say there was?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        I didn’t.

                                 LEIA
                        Then the park with the fountain.

                                 MARCY
                        There is no park with a fountain.

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know what a fountain is.
                        (She does)

           They look at each other

                                 LEIA
                        I’m an adult.

                                 MARCY
                        I was scared.

                                 LEIA
                        I can go where I want. Isn’t that
                        the point of all of this, that I
                        can go places.

                                 MARCY
                        Do not make me feel bad for caring
                        about you. For wanting to protect
                        you. You can trust me and you can
                        tell me where you were.

                                 LEIA
                        I did.

                        I don’t think you did.

           Marcy hold up the clippings.

                                 MARCY
                        What are these?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARCY
                        They’re yours.

           They look at each other. Leia realizes. There is an intake
           of breath. She steps towards them. Marcy steps away. Glen
           comes in with pizza.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Vinnie’s was packed, I got - Leia!
                        You’re back. Great. God, we were
                        worried about you. Are you ok?
                        (Nothing) Is she ok?

                                 MARCY
                        No. Nothing is ok. Look at these.
                        They are pictures. Of him, Glen.
                        They were under her bed.

                                 GLEN
                        Marcy-

                                 MARCY
                        (She sifts, she reads off of one of
                        the sketches) "Everyday I’ve had
                        with you is who I am. You will
                        always be that" (Leia is crying)

           Marcy flips the paper over and reads the back

                                 MARCY
                        "Today is my fake-real birthday. I
                        want to tell you I’m sorry for
                        blowing out the candles. Even
                        though without me telling you, you
                        wouldn’t even know, but I feel so
                        bad about it I have to tell you so
                        that I can apologize. I’m sorry.
                        And I’m sorry for telling you."
                        What kind of insane hold-

                                 GLEN
                        I think that we should calm down.

                                 MARCY
                        "Sometimes at night I imagine I’m
                        still with you and that you are
                        keeping me warm" Keeping you warm
                        how?
                               (Leia cries)

                                 GLEN
                        OK! Ok. Enough.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh, have you had enough Glen? When
                        have you ever not had enough? Where
                        in you is there enough room for any
                        of this? Are you listening to me?
                        Are you even hearing what I am
                        saying? "I imagine I’m still-"

                        talk about this. We will sit down
                        and -

                                    MARCY
                        She won’t say where she was. I
                        think that she was with him.

                                 GLEN
                        He’s locked up.

                                 MARCY
                        I know where he is.

                                 GLEN
                        (To Leia) Did you see him?

                                 MARCY
                        (Into the phone) Yes. Hello. This
                        is Marcy Dargon. Detective Timms
                        please, it’s an emergency.

                                 LEIA
                        What are you doing?

                                 MARCY
                        This is a violation. Right? This is
                        a crime, a whole other crime.
                        Getting her to visit him.

                                 LEIA
                        No. No. He didn’t make me do
                        anything.

                                 GLEN
                        Marce wait-

                                 MARCY
                        (Into the phone) Tell him it’s
                        Marcy Dargon, I found evidence in
                        Leanne’s room that leads me to
                        believe she is still in contact
                        with McKay and I
                                           // Yes

                                 LEIA
                        Stop. Stop getting him in trouble!

           Leia smacks the phone out of Marcy’s hand and grabs the
           pictures and clippings. She starts to tear them up.

           Marcy grabs Leia and tries to stop her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Stop it. Those aren’t yours
                        anymore. Stop it. He is hurting
                        you. Even now. Right now. You don’t
                        see it, but he is.

                                 LEIA
                        No! You are hurting me! You are
                        doing this to me! You!

           Marcy slaps Leia across the face. They look at each other.

                                 MARCY
                        Go upstairs. (Beat) Go.

           Leia goes upstairs. As she walks out of the shot we see
           Glen, standing silent and idle in the back of the room.

                                 MARCY
                        Thank you. For all your help.

                                 GLEN
                        We can’t -

                                 MARCY
                        No. Don’t. You always take her
                        side.

                                 GLEN
                        That’s the side we both should be
                        taking. That’s the only side there
                        is.

                                 MARCY
                        And look where it got us. If it
                        were up to you, McKay would
                        probably be moving in here.

                                 GLEN
                        That is not fair.

                                 MARCY
                        You must not have any idea what
                        this is like for me. I’m done.

                                 GLEN
                        You can’t give up on her.

                                 MARCY
                        With you! I am done with you.
           LEIA’S ROOM

           She sits and listens to the murmurs of Glen and Marcy’s
           argument. We hear the front door slam shut.

           CUT TO EXT DARGON HOUSE DAY, A WHILE LATER

           Leaves are mostly gone from the trees. A frost covers the
           ground. Everything is grey.

           INT DARGON HOUSE DAY

           The shades are drawn, lights are off, the sense of daytime
           creeps in behind the shades, but is distinctly unwelcome.
           Marcy sits curled under a blanket amidst newspapers,
           magazines and books about children. The TV is on. Marcy
           watches the news, polishes some silver and smokes
           cigarettes. She has been smoking a lot, the blue light of
           the TV flickers on her face and he hear the news caster’s
           V/O. We watch Marcy watch.

                                 MARCY
                        No thank you.

           She walks away from the door. He knocks one more time. She
           goes back to the couch and waits. He is gone. She
           fast-forwards...There is a break in the tape, the color of
           light reflected on Marcy’s face changes from bluish to stark
           white, static, she sits. The light on her face changes back
           to blues. She lays down, presses play and watches.

                        ...-en Leanne Dargon went missing
                        nearly 20 years ago when she became
                        separated from a group of
                        neighborhood kids playing in an
                        "inflatable castle"

           A blue and red square pops on the screen with the heading
           "911 call" we hear the recording of a hysterical Marcy as
           the transcription of her call appears in white lettering
           inside the screen over a faded image of a playground

                                 911 OPERATOR:
                        911, What is your emergency?

                                 MARCY V/O:
                        Yes, my daughter is gone. She’s
                        missing. She’s 5. Oh my God oh my
                        God. She was, she was in the castle
                        with the other kids. And- 911

                        Ma’am? Ma’am. I am going to need
                        you to calm down. What is your
                        location?

                                 MARCY V/O:
                        Um. We’re at Welling Park. There is
                        a barbeque. I took off her shoes
                        and put her in the castle. For a
                        minute. I was here the whole time.
                        I was here. I thought-- she can’t
                        go anywhere without her shoes, she
                        doesn’t know how to buckle her
                        shoes.

                                 911 OPERATOR:
                        How long has she been missing?

                                 MARCY V/O:
                        Oh God I don’t know. How can I not
                        know--

                                 911 OPERATOR:
                        Ma’am, how long ago did you
                        discover she was gone?

                                 MARCY V/O:
                        15 minutes. We’ve been looking for
                        15 minutes. (She cries)

                        Ma’am, we are going to help you
                        find your daughter. Can you tell me
                        what she is wearing?

                                 MARCY V/O:
                        She’s wearing a yellow t-shirt and
                        a denim jumper. Yellow socks. She’s
                        not wearing any shoes. I’m holding
                        her shoes.

           Marcy on the couch mouths along with the last part of the
           call. She fast forwards through the rest of the call, the
           closed captioning scrolls and scrolls. The screen returns to
           photo montage, first a photo of "MISSING" posters hanging on
           telephone poles and around a shopping center, then a candle
           light vigil; Marcy wearing a t-shirt that pleads for her
           daughter return. Mug sots of Ben and then pictures of him as
           a child, with red circles encapsulating him in group
           shots...She presses play just as a picture of a 2nd grade
           Ben pops up

           The phone rings. And rings. She looks at the caller ID. She
           hestitates. She picks it up with a forced lightness in her
           voice.

                                 MARCY
                        Hello?///Hello Dr Andrews. Yes. Hi.
                        I was going to call, but you beat
                        me to it.//We are back from
                        vacation. Got back a few days ago.
                        Just getting back into the swing of
                        things. You know how it is///Great,
                        it was great. Sunny. Really
                        beautiful. Just what we
                        needed///...Uh huh. Definitely. I
                        agree.///Well, one of the things I
                        was going to call you about is that
                        She’s come down with a bit of the
                        flu, we think it is. Just a little

                        change///Nothing a little rest
                        won’t fix. Can I give you a call
                        when she is feeling better? Thank
                        you. Okay///Bye.
           LEIAS ROOM MOMENTS LATER

           The room has been largely cleared out. Many things are
           missing. Leia lays on her back on the floor. A slightly
           youthful looking Ben sits on her bed looking down at her. A
           knock on her door. Ben is gone.

                                 MARCY
                        Leanne? (Nothing) Leanne? It’s time
                        for lunch. I made you a sandwich,
                        toasted like you like it. (Nothing)
                        I’m going to slide it under the
                        door now.

           The door has been altered at the bottom, taken up three
           inches in the middle to allow for things to pass under it,
           so slides a tray of food with a sandwich a cookie and orange
           slices. There are also two new key- locks on the door.

                                 LEIA
                        Am I still in trouble?

                                 MARCY
                        You’re not in trouble.

                                 LEIA
                        Then I can come downstairs?
                        (Nothing)

                                 MARCY
                        Do you miss me?

                                 LEIA
                        I’m thirsty.

                                 MARCY
                        Water in half an hour. Check the
                        schedule.

           We hear Marcy walk away, the light shifts under the door
           with her movement. Leia picks up an orange slice and sucks
           the juice out of it. And again. And again. There are no more
           slices. She lays back down on the floor and looks at the
           ceiling.

                                 LEIA
                        Dear Universe, thank you for the
                        food I am going to be eating and
                        the thoughts I am going to be
                        thinking...
           INT DARGON HOUSE LIVING ROOM LATER

           Marcy watches the television and smokes. More stuff about
           Ben. A timer goes off on the coffee table. She pauses the
           video and gets up. Goes to the kitchen.

           INT KITCHEN

           Marcy fills two tupperware containers with water. The phone
           rings, she jumps and drops one. It spills.

                                 MARCY
                        Shit.

           Marcy unplugs the phone. Then kneels out of frame to mop up
           the water.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE DIFFERENT DAY.

           Cold. Grey. All the windows are closed and drawn.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM MORNING

           Leia and Marcy sit on the floor. Marcy looks at Leia, Leia
           looks anywhere else. There is a plate of food between them.

                                 MARCY
                        Well. Are you finished or do you
                        want more?

           Beat.

                                 LEIA
                        Fine.

                                 MARCY
                        Fine you are done or fine you want
                        some more?

                                 LEIA
                        More.

           Marcy feeds Leia a bite of something. She chews. Marcy
           watches and has another bite waiting for Leia after she
           swallows. Leia waits but finally gives in and takes the
           bite, something gets on her face, Leia instinctively moves
           to wipe it with her hand, Marcy stops her and wipes it
           herself.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        I’m done.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DIFFERENT DAY

           Marcy and Leia sit on opposite ends of the bed.

                                 LEIA
                        What do I have to do?

                                 MARCY
                        Just look at me.

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t get it.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s attachment therapy. The bond
                        we created when you were an infant
                        has been erased. Children bond to
                        their mothers during the earliest
                        months of their lives, when they
                        can’t speak and can only look into
                        each other’s eyes and trust that
                        the mother will provide and care
                        for what they want or need without
                        asking.

                                 LEIA
                        Ok.

                                 MARCY
                        So you look in my eyes and you
                        can’t say anything.

                                 LEIA
                        But I’m 22.

                                 MARCY

                                 LEIA
                        I’m not an infant.

                                 MARCY
                        But that’s why this is called
                        "Attachment Therapy" instead of
                        just "attachment". Just
                        "Attachment" happens when you are a
                        baby. "Attachment therapy" happens
                        when you are older but are
                        incapable of attaching to someone.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 LEIA
                        I was attached to someone.

                                 MARCY
                        That is a syndrome. A sickness.
                        That doesn’t count.

                                 LEIA
                        What is a sickness?

                                 MARCY
                        It doesn’t matter, we are going to
                        fix it with this therapy.

           They sit feeling heavy.

                                 MARCY
                        I am not asking you to do this.
                        It’s for your own good. (A moment)
                        So lay down here. With your head in
                        my lap.

           Leia slowly slowly moves to lay down. She is not looking at
           Marcy once she settles.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok. Now look at me.

                                 LEIA
                        For how long?

                                 MARCY
                        We’ll see.

           They look at each other. And look. Leia looks away and Marcy
           coaxes her back. They look. And look.

           The room gets dark, the light is sucked right out of it. We
           hear a young girl’s voice say

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        You blinked.

           Marcy is still, stuck in her glance. Leia turns her head and
           we see younger Ben and a 12 year old Leia sitting
           cross-legged, staring at each other.

                                 BEN
                        Are we counting blinking this time?
                        Because you have blinked 14 times.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 YOUNG LEIA
                        Ok, blinks are free.

                                 BEN
                        Ok.

           12 Y/O Leia starts making a scratching sound on the floor
           with her finger. Scratch scratch scratch scratch.

                                 BEN
                        You can stop scratching on the
                        floor. I’m not going to look away.

                        something in here (He points to his

           Leia’s concentration shifts. She breathes in. She closes her

           EXT DARGON HOUSE EARLY EARLY MORNING

           The sun creeps up onto almost leaf-less trees and a very
           still house.

           INT DARGON HOUSE KITCHEN

           Marcy is baking a cake. She is stirring eggs into a mixing
           bowl. There are two finished cakes on the counter, one is
           frosted, the other is cooling. She pours the batter into a
           cake pan. The oven timer goes off, Marcy stops and goes to
           the oven, she pulls out a cake. Puts it out to cool. Starts
           pouring again. The phone rings. She does not answer it.

           INT LEIAS ROOM MOMENTS LATER

           Leia is laying on her back. She is looking through her
           viewfinder. She changes the slide. Looks. She changes the
           slide. Looks. Changes the slide. We hear the repedative
           clang of the slide being shifted as the camera moves to the
           window. The light outside changes from early morning light
           to late afternoon winter-time light.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM LATE AFTERNOON

           Marcy and Leia stand in the middle of the room, facing the
           same direction. Somewhere in the room is a cake.

                                 LEIA
                        So I have to fall backwards.

                                 MARCY
                        Yes. You cross your arms over your
                        chest and let yourself fall
                        backwards and know that I am going

                                 MARCY
                        That’s because you don’t trust that
                        I am going to catch you. But I
                        will.

           pinned to the wall.

                        The second week. Move closer.

           Leia does. Just a little. He socked feet on the pink carpet.

                                 MARCY
                        Those weeks are not a privilege.
                        They are made to make you- (she
                        stops. She decides) Eventually you
                        will miss me. Now, fall.

           Leia readies herself for a trust fall. She tries to do it,
           rolls back on her heels a little and stops.

                        This doesn’t make sense.

                                 MARCY
                        It makes perfect sense. People have
                        been doing trust falls for
                        generations.

                        But, I don’t understand why we’re
                        practicing something that isn’t
                        going to happen in real life.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s not practice for an actual
                        fall, it is the actual fall. It’s a
                        metaphor. For things that happen in
                        real life.

                                 MARCY
                        I don’t know.

                                 LEIA
                        Do you miss him?

                                 MARCY
                        It’s complicated.

                                 LEIA
                        Did you make a schedule for him
                        too?

                                 MARCY
                        No. I made a choice and at some
                        point I’ll make a decision.

                                 LEIA
                        Why choose to be apart from someone
                        like that? After so long.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        People change. Relationships
                        change.

                                 LEIA
                        If you say so.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s important to make choices.
                        Even hard ones.

                                 LEIA
                        If you say so.

                                 MARCY
                        Turn around and lets get to work.

           Leia turns around. She is nervous about the trust fall the
           way anyone would be.

                                 MARCY
                        I am right here. I am going to
                        catch you.

           Leia starts to roll back again, further than she did before,
           but stops again.

                                 MARCY
                        It is natural for you to hesitate.
                        You have never trusted anyone
                        before.

                                 LEIA
                        I haven’t?

                                 MARCY
                        No. Now fall.

           Marcy motions to Leia that she should turn around. Leia
           does. She has another false start and then stands facing
           away from Marcy.

                                 MARCY
                        Here. Would it help if I went
                        first? I’ll fall backwards and you
                        catch me. Ok?

           They switch directions and face the other way in the room.

                                 MARCY
                        Now, I’m just going to fall
                        backwards and you catch me.
                        (Breathes in and lets it out) One.
                        Two Three.
           Marcy lets herself fall with only a mild hesitation, the
           time it takes to swallow. Leia stands straight. As soon as
           Marcy is too far into the fall to stop herself-

           INT LIVING ROOM DUSK

           Marcy watches television again. Same video. Her arm is in a
           sling. The front door opens but is stopped with a chain
           lock. Marcy gasps. It’s Glen. We see him through the chain.
           He talks through the space permits.

                                 GLEN
                        Hello?

                                 MARCY
                        Glen.

                                 GLEN
                        Marcy, open the door. (Nothing)
                        Marce. (Nothing) I didn’t think you
                        were home. It’s dark in here. How
                        can you see anything? I thought
                        maybe you were out.

                                 MARCY
                        Nope. Here.

                                 GLEN
                        Sorry. I came by for some things.
                        Some clothes.

                                 MARCY
                        I’ll grab them.

                                 GLEN
                        I’ll just be a minute. You should
                        turn a light on.

                                 MARCY
                        That’s ok. I’ll grab them.

                                 GLEN
                        Marcy, open the door. This is my
                        house. I live here.

           She doesn’t open the door. And he doesn’t really live there
           anymore.

                                 GLEN
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t go to
                        the movie theater with Leia’s
                        picture. I’m sorry you don’t think
                        I care, I do.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Marcy has walked upstairs to get his things. Glen,
           oblivious, keeps talking.

                                 GLEN
                        I care a lot. I care in a way I
                        can’t stand. I can’t help but feel
                        that I deserve it, that I’ve failed
                        you, both of you and in order to
                        not want to fucking die, pardon my
                        language, I’ve had to keep those
                        feelings in a separate room, you
                        know? Keep all of that somewhere
                        else. Somewhere I don’t have to
                        look at it every day.

           We see Marcy throwing things from Glen’s drawers in a bag.

                                 GLEN
                        I wasn’t belittling what we are
                        going through, I was just trying
                        not to go through it anymore. I was
                        trying to operate like a regular
                        guy, with a regular life. I’m sorry
                        for doing that.

           We see Glen outside, his back to us, pressing his face
           through a crack in what used to be his front door.

                                 GLEN
                        I am going through this too
                        regardless and I’d rather not do it
                        from this side of the door.
                        (Nothing) How is this the next
                        step? I don’t understand why you
                        won’t let me in. Let me in.
                        (Nothing) NO. I. Can’t. Keep giving
                        things up. I wish every day that
                        things were different. For 19 years
                        that has been the first thing I
                        think when I wake up. For the 7
                        before that it was how lucky I was.
                        I wasn’t being unfeeling, I was
                        trying to be lucky again. But I’m
                        not. I’m never going to feel that
                        way. I’m accepting that now. But I
                        certainly don’t want to feel worse.
                        Ok?

           Marcy has returned with a small bag of stuff. She heard that
           last sentence. Marcy hands him a small bag through the
           crack.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        enough.

                                 GLEN
                        I want to come home.

                                 MARCY
                        I’m thinking.

           Beat. Beat.

                                 MARCY
                        But I’m not going to finish
                        thinking right now.

                                 GLEN
                        Can I at least say hi? Five
                        minutes, I just want to see her.

                                 MARCY
                        It’s not a good time. She’s. With
                        her tutor. I’ll tell her you said
                        Hi.

                                 GLEN
                        Tell her I miss her.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok.

           Marcy tentatively puts her hands on the door and starts to
           close it, unsure if he is still there. Glen recedes from the
           space unsure if she knows he is still there. The door is
           closed now. She puts a nearby door stopper against it,
           keeping it closed. She turns a light on.

           INT GLEN’S CAR

           Glen sits alone in his car with his limp partially filled
           duffel bag beside him. He puts his head against the steering
           wheel. Then in his hands.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM DIFFERENT DAY

           Marcy and Leia sit on the floor with a tray of food like
           before. Leia takes a bite from Marcy’s fork.
           EXT DARGON HOUSE DIFFERENT DAY.

           A car pulls up infront of The house, behind Marcy’s car
           which is still kind of covered in leaves and hasn’t been
           driven in a while. Out of the car comes Dr Andrews. She
           looks at Marcy’s car. She walks up to the front door and
           knocks.

           INT DARGON HOUSE SAME MOMENT

           The knocks echo through the desolate looking house. It looks
           not like a home, but a place. Piles of books on attachment
           therapy and magazines and newspapers. Pictures including
           Glen have been taken down. Knock knock knock. Doorbell.

           Marcy emerges, still wearing a sling around an ace-bandaged
           forearm. She cautiously approaches the front door and looks
           through a peephole. She is undecided on opening the door.

           We hear Dr Andrew’s voice through the door.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Mrs Dargon?

           Marcy opens the door. But they stay on opposite sides of the
           threshold.

                                 MARCY
                        Dr Andrews. Were you knocking long?
                        I was downstairs. So sorry.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Not at all.

                                 MARCY
                        Is everything alright? What can I
                        do for you?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Don’t worry about it. May I come
                        in?

                                 MARCY
                        ...Of course. Please.

           Marcy steps aside and gestures for Andrews to enter,
           becoming very self conscious of the house under the idea of
           new eyes. Dr Andrews slowly takes in the space. Marcy turns
           on a light. Then another.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        So how is Leia?

                                 MARCY
                        She is good.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Good. She hasn’t been to my office
                        in a while now.

                                 MARCY
                        She still has that cold. It’s
                        bronchitis, I guess, now. She’ll be
                        fine but, a lot of bed rest.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Her flu?

                                 MARCY
                        What?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Her flu turned into bronchitis?

                                 MARCY
                        Yes. It did. We thought it was a
                        flu at first, but it was the
                        beginning of bronchitis.
                        Apparently.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM SAME MOMENT

           Leia sits with her ear pressed to the floor listening to the
           voices below.

           INT DARGON HOUSE MOMENTS LATER

           Marcy nervously makes tea in the kitchen. Dr Andrews looks
           around the living room with the appropriate restraint, but a
           keen eye. She scans the photos, many clearly missing.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        How is Mr. Dargon?

                                 MARCY
                        Glen? The same. Same old Glen. He’s
                        good. Can I get you anything else?
                        Cake?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        No, thank you. Just the tea is
                        fine.

           Marcy brings over a cup of tea for Dr Andrews and a slice of
           cake. Andrews takes them both and immediately puts the cake
           on the coffee table.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        What happened to your arm?

                                 MARCY
                        I fell. It’s minor. Not a big deal,
                        really.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Here or in Bermuda?

                                 MARCY
                        Hmm?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Did you fall here or in Bermuda.

                              (A long look) Here. Monday.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Glen came by my office.

                                 MARCY
                        He did. Why?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        He’s worried about you and Leia.

                                 MARCY
                        Can we not call her that? I named
                        her Leanne. (Beat. Polite) That’s
                        her name.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Sure. Glen expressed concern for
                        both you and Leanne.

                                 MARCY
                        Glen. (A breath) Glen ran out of
                        worry a long time ago.
                                                 He and I
                        are taking some time apart. As he
                        probably told you. Because. It’s
                        exhausting. I have to pile enough
                        concern into a situation to account
                        for us both, otherwise there isn’t

                        is a lot that has to be done. And
                        so, we are taking some time a part.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        That must be very hard at a time
                        like this. Is this your first
                        separation?

                                 MARCY
                        I went to stay with my sister,
                        years ago. 12 years ago? When they
                        found that body in Maryland. That
                        was hard. So I went to stay with my
                        sister in Santa Fe for-I don’t know
                        what it was, 6, 7 months. I came
                        back and we never talked about it
                        much.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        And your sister? Are you still
                        close?

                                 MARCY
                        She got married. Has two kids. 11
                        and...8? I think? Made it hard to,
                        travel.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        I imagine that’s not easy. Other
                        people’s children.

                                 MARCY
                        Can I get you anything else? (She
                        stands) A slice of cake?

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        No, thank you.

           Marcy remains standing with nowhere to go. Dr Andrews stays
           seated and does not look away from Marcy. A moment passes.
           Then another. Marcy sits. A moment passes.

                                 MARCY
                        It was a slow pull into not
                        reacting to "mom" anymore, the
                        devolving of "mom" into just
                        another word again. Like table. Or
                        crease. Or fund. (Beat) It took an
                        unfairly long time to let that go.
                        And now, I have it back. Sometimes

                        to her.(Beat) Do you have kids, Dr

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        No.

                                 MARCY
                        I never know how to answer that.
                        (Beat) I didn’t realize until she
                        came back, how far from being a
                        mother I’d been. And I didn’t know
                        that after she was found, I’d still
                        have to look for her.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        I’m sure you are doing just fine.

                                 MARCY
                        You’ve done this a lot? Counsel

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Not specifically.

                                 MARCY
                        Me neither. But I’m sure you are
                        doing just fine.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Well. I don’t want to take up any
                        more of your time.

           They stand.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        If I could just see Leia now, I’ll
                        be on my way.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh. Yes. Right.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Not for long. Just to touch base.
                        I’d love to hear about your
                        vacation. I’m sure that was great
                        for her.

           Marcy goes upstairs. In her abscence Dr Andrews takes a sip
           of her tea. She picks up a looked over magazine, it has a
           picture of Ben and a picture of Leia on the cover made to

           look like it is ripped down the middle, even though it
           wasn’t the same picture. She flips through it. She picks up
           another magazine with the pictures of Leia "then and now" on
           the cover.

           CUT TO UPSTAIRS HALL

           Marcy walks up the stairs and stands infront of Leia’s door.
           She thinks.

           CUT TO INT LEIA’S ROOM

           Leia hears Marcy moving around. She scoots over to the door.
           Listens. Marcy’s feet can be seen through the opening at the
           bottom of the door.

           CUT TO UPSTAIRS HALL

           Marcy just stands. She counts; 58 Mississippi, 59
           Mississippi, 60. She walks away from the door.

           CUT TO INT LEIA’S ROOM

           Leia watches Marcy’s feet dissappear.

           CUT TO DARGON LIVING ROOM SAME MOMENT

           Dr Andrews picks up a video tape and reads the label. She
           turns on the TV, the frozen picture of the basement is
           paused on the screen. Marcy comes back down stairs. Andrews
           turns the TV off.

                                 MARCY
                        Oh. The TV. I’m sure you’ve seen
                        it. Maybe I shouldn’t watch it.
                        But. There’s always a but.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Has Leanne seen it?

                        No. God no. -She’s asleep. I tried
                        to wake her but she’s a little too
                        feverish to come.

                                 DR ANDREWS
                        Thursday, then. Our regular time.

           Andrews drives away. Marcy looks out the window.

           EXT DARGON HOUSE EARLY IN THE DAY

           Marcy has the front door open a bit, a locksmith is just
           leaving. Marcy pays him.

                        Thank you.

           He leaves. A neighbor jogs by and waves. Marcy waves back.
           She closes the door.

           The new lock on the front door faces the wrong way. After
           the door is shut Marcy locks it with a key in her hand and
           then pulls a necklace out from under her sweater, there are
           two keys on it, she adds the third.

           Marcy and Leia sit on her bed. In Marcy’s good hand she is

                        We don’t get to choose all the

           Marcy covers her face and maybe she cries, we can’t tell.

                        I know what it is now. It’s a fish.

           A long moment as Marcy pulls herself together, Leia fidgets.

                                 MARCY
                        Ok. Stand up.

           Leia looks at the schedule. She uses her fingers to trace
           along all the blocks of time, lands on one called "Applied

           EXT DARGON HOUSE NEXT DAY

           Marcy cleans leaves off her car. It’s very cold out. She
           gets in and starts it. It has trouble. She lets it warm up
           as she finishes cleaning it. A neighbor walks by. They wave
           to each other.

           EXT DR ANDREWS OFFICE DAY

           Leia and Marcy sit in the car. They are tied together at the

           comes out in tufts of steam.

                        I used a sunscreen. It’s a lotion.

           They look at each other.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, LEIA’S ROOM EVENING

           Marcy is directing Leia who is blindfolded.

                                 MARCY
                        Left. A little more. Good. Wait.
                        (There is something on the floor)
                        Step up, good. Forward. Ok. Now
                        (Leia puts her foot down, missing
                        the object on the floor) Forward.
                        Come towards my voice. Good. Now
                        right. A little more.

           Leia has reached the bed. She feels for it and sits. Takes
           the blindfold off.

                                 LEIA
                        Thank you for letting me eat
                        downstairs.

                                 MARCY
                        You earned it. So thank you.

           Leia hands Marcy the blindfold. Beat.

                                 LEIA
                        Now what. (She squints at the
                        schedule) - Beads.

                                 MARCY
                        Great.

           There is a bin with compartments somewhere on the floor,
           inside, the beads have been organized by color, Marcy pours
           them back into the plastic barrel they came in and reaches
           in, mixing them up.

                                 MARCY
                        So, meditate on recalling a part of
                        our past, just like last time, but
                        this time organize by shape instead
                        of color. I’ll be back in 40
                        minutes to review what you’ve done
                        and bring you to the bathroom.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        Wait. When I was little, did I have
                        a favorite stuffed animal?

                                 MARCY
                        Yes. A bear named Sandy. Once he
                        fell between your bed and the wall
                        and one of his eyes melted against
                        the night-light. I had to file it
                        down with an emery board. He never
                        looked the same, but you loved him
                        anyway. You could meditate on
                        remembering that.

                                 LEIA
                        What’s an emery board?

                                 MARCY
                        You use it to file your nails, it’s
                        like sandpaper. Paper with sand
                        glued to it. Sand. Like from a
                        beach. It feels like tiny rocks. Do
                        you know sand?

                                 LEIA
                        I know of it.

                                 MARCY
                        I’ll bring you some sand.

                                 LEIA
                        Sandy is a boy’s name?

                                 MARCY
                        I always thought so.

                                 LEIA
                        What was your favorite stuffed
                        animal?

                                 MARCY
                        Well. I guess it was. A blanket
                        actually.

                                 LEIA
                        Your favorite animal was a blanket?

                                 MARCY
                        I had a yellow blanket that I
                        carried around. I named it
                        silky. It had silk trim along the
                        sides. I slept with it until I was
                        god, a teenager I guess. My parents
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 MARCY (cont’d)
                        were so sad when I finally gave it
                        up.

                                 LEIA
                        What were your parents names?

                                 MARCY
                        Richard and Louise.

           Leia takes this in and clinks a few beads into various
           compartments, clink clink clink.

           CUT TO BASEMENT

           Marcy in the basement looking through boxes.

           The phone rings upstairs. The machine gets it. We hear a
           distant Glen leave a message. As we listen...Marcy sees an
           old, red, metal stationary bike in a corner in the basement.
           She goes to it. Pulls stuff off of it, pulls it out of the
           corner, it grinds against the cement floor.She looks at it.

           "Hello? Are you there? Marcy? (An exhale, a defeat) Marce?
           I’ve left so many messages at this point, I’m surprised
           there is any space left. Maybe there’s not. I don’t know how
           you would know. I’m not used to leaving messages on this
           machine, I’m used to listening to them. Would it beep if
           there was no room? Or just, not, beep? (Beat) Dr Andrews
           said you went on a vacation. It breaks my heart to think of
           you on vacation. Is that selfish? Does it matter? I have
           spent so much time trying to figure out which one of us is
           wrong, I’m ready not to care..."

           Also as we listen we see Leia in her room. She sits by a
           window looking at a photo album. Outside it starts to snow.
           She sees it. She opens her window, she puts her hand
           outside. She touches snow for the first time. She leans her
           torso outside as far as it can go, looking up to the sky and
           getting snowed on, as Glen says...

           "...I’m ready to either admit fault or forgive you or
           ...both. I’ve been talking to Paul. I wanted to know what my
           rights are. I have rights. I do. Have rights. But I would
           rather have my family. I’m not giving everything up all over
           again"
           EXT DARGON HOUSE NIGHT

           It snows. The basement light and Leia’s lights are the only
           two on.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM AFTERNOON

           Leia lays in bed. Food slides under her door. She doesn’t
           move. Our view opens and we see Ben sitting at the end of
           the bed. Leia is curled up at the head of it, careful to not
           touch him, even though he isn’t real. Marcy’s feet can be
           seen from the space under the door. It is unclear who she is
           talking to, the apperation of Ben or Marcy on the other side
           of the door...

                                 LEIA
                        Is this how people love? They
                        become a room for you to live in
                        and then they lock? Who will tell
                        me if that is right or not? How
                        many rooms do you get in your life?
                        Am I lucky or unlucky? I’m really
                        asking.

           Marcy’s feet move away from the door, The light spilling
           through the opening shifts as she moves. We see the room
           again and Ben is gone. Leia is alone.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, KITCHEN EVENING

           The table is set for two. We hear Marcy’s voice before we
           see her...

                                 MARCY
                        Almost. Ok. Good.

           Marcy and Leia enter the kitchen. They are tied together,
           and much better at moving this way.

                                 MARCY
                        We are getting so good at this.

           Leia sees the table, the food.

                                 LEIA
                        Does that mean we don’t have to do
                        it any more?

           Marcy looks at Leia.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA
                        Just asking.

           Marcy unties their torsos but not their legs. Then they sit.
           Marcy serves food. For a second nothing happens. Leia looks
           for what to do. Nothing presents itself. She picks up her
           fork and takes a bite.

                                 MARCY
                        Don’t you want to say a "Dear
                        Universe"?

                                 LEIA
                        Me?

                                 MARCY
                        Yeah. I thought you always said
                        them.

                                 LEIA
                        No one can always do anything.

                                 MARCY
                        Well, you can say one now if you’d
                        like.

                                 LEIA
                        No thank you.

                                 MARCY
                        Are you sure?

                                 LEIA
                        Yes.

                                 MARCY
                        Would you mind if I said one?

           Leia just looks at Marcy. Marcy begins...

                                 MARCY
                        Dear Universe. Thank you for this
                        food. And for thoughts. And for
                        family. I wish that. I wish that
                        everything-- I wish we have a nice
                        dinner. Sincerely, Marcy. And
                        Leanne. Can I say your name?

                                 LEIA
                        Which one?

                                 MARCY
                        I mean when I end it. Can you say
                        someone else’s name?

                                 LEIA
                        I don’t know. We never did.

                                 MARCY
                        Well, new rules I guess.

           They eat a little.

                                 LEIA
                        This is good.

                                 MARCY
                        Thank you. (They eat. Silverware
                        sounds on plates. Sips of water) So
                        how was your day?

           Leia looks at Marcy.

                                 MARCY
                          Was it good?

                                 LEIA
                        Compared to what?

                                 MARCY
                        It’s just something people say.
                        "How was your day?" "Good" How are
                        you" "Good". How conversations
                        start.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh. What if it was bad?

                                 MARCY
                        You say "fine"

                                 LEIA
                        What if it was fine?

                                 MARCY
                        Then it wasn’t good.

                                 LEIA
                        Oh.

           They eat.

                        Right. How are you feeling, I guess
                        is the question.

                        I don’t really know what I am

                        You’re right.

                        If I knew what I was supposed to be
                        feeling, I’d tell you if I was
                        feeling it. I don’t want you to
                        feel however I am making you feel.

                        am just trying to do what’s best
                        for you. You--I just wanted, want,
                        to know how you feel. How you are.

                                 LEIA
                        I’m fine.

           A moment.

                                 MARCY
                        I have something for you.

           Leia waits.

                                 MARCY
                        Come with me.

           They get up and go to the living room, tied together.

           Marcy unties their legs and gets up. She goes to the door to
           the basement. Disappears into it. Leia looks around. Walks
           around. Quietly. She looks at things because they are there,
           she sees the door with the reverse lock, the magazines with
           her picture on them. She sees the TV, she investigates it.
           She runs her hands on it and pushes buttons. Nothing.
           Nothing. It clicks on. The picture steadies. It’s a frozen
           still of her basement. She puts her hand on it. How does
           this work, does it do anything else? She presses more
           buttons, buttons buttons, the picture animates, Leia jumps.
           We hear narration as the camera continues to pan from corner
           to corner, there are parts we recognize and parts we don’t:
           children’s toys and books, clippings hung on the wall, the
           viewfinder, a washer and dryer...with the following

                        added on, including a standing
                        shower and working toilet. Dargon
                        was not allowed on the upper level
                        of the house, either for fear of
                        being caught or of her escape. The
                        singular window in the basement,
                        seen here, was sealed and covered,
                        making it impossible to see in or
                        out. Neighbors said they never
                        noticed anything unusual about
                        Benjamin McKay or his basement.

           The lights have seemed to slowly get darker around Leia as
           she watches. The television light illuminating her. On the
           video we see a neighbor, He is being filmed outside a house.

                              He kept to himself mostly, but
                              was perfectly social able.
                              Always said hello if we
                              happened into each other. He
                              built things a lot. He never
                              mentioned family, never had
                              anyone over. He was always
                              alone. Or we thought he was
                              alone. (A dog barks. He looks
                              off camera and then back)

           that disappears too. The TV looks to be off. Leia just

           Marcy drags the red metal stationary bicycle into the room.
           It is cleaned, with a ribbon on it. She places it down,
           wipes a smudge off.

                        It’s a stationary bicycle. It’s a
                        bicycle that you ride in place,
                        like this. (She gets on and pedals)
                        See? It stays up on it’s own, so
                        you don’t need to wear a helmet or
                        go anywhere or anything. You can

                        dials (She gets off the bike) I
                        found it downstairs and fixed it up
                        for you, try it. I oiled the gears.

                        Like that.

           Leia pedals the bike. Marcy watches.

                                 MARCY
                        See and you can change the setting

                        that that squiggle line means peaks
                        and valleys, so it is harder and
                        then easier then harder again, like

                        never had a bike when you were

                        is almost like a bike. It’s low to
                        the ground and has one big wheel.

           Leia pedals the stationary bicycle. Ben sits somewhere in
           the room watching her. She doesn’t look at him.

           INT DARGON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM NIGHT

           Marcy has finished clearing plates from dinner. She goes and
           picks up the rope from the living room floor. She sees dust
           and dirt that was dragged upstairs by the stationary bike.
           She gets a vacuum.

           INT LEIA’S ROOM

           Leia stops pedaling the bike and gets off. She stands in the
           middle of her room. She picks up a bunch of her turtleneck
           shirts from the floor and puts them on her bed. And then
           more. And then she dumps some clothes from the "Leanne" box
           onto the bed too. She looks at the pile. She ties one of her
           turtleneck sleeves to the sleeve of one of the tiny shirts.

           Marcy vacuums.

           Leia writes with a pen on the wall. It starts "Dear Marcy"

           INT DARGON HOUSE LIVING ROOM

           Marcy vacuums. We hear the following voiceover

                                 LEIA V/O
                        Dear Marcy. Thank you for caring
                        about me. For trying and for
                        fighting. The idea that you can
                        fight for something you want, is
                        new to me. I thought, before, that
                        you only fought against things you
                        didn’t. But, now I know there are
                        different ways of doing it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As the voiceover plays, we zoom further and further out on
           Marcy vacuuming, out until we are now watching her through
           the window, and now until we see the entire side of the
           house. Marcy moves in the downstairs window as the only
           other light that’s on comes from Leia’s room.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        It seems like things have only ever
                        happened to me. And also it’s like
                        I am something that has happened to
                        you, I think. Which feels funny
                        since really I haven’t ever made
                        anything happen. So, it’s hard to
                        understand myself. If that is
                        something people do; understand
                        themselves.

           Leia’s window opens and her duffel bag is tossed out. It
           hits the frozen brown grass with a thud. Then a long well
           tied rope made mostly of clothesunfurls from the window. And
           Leia climbs backwards out of it.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        It’s not that I don’t not love you
                        specifically. I maybe don’t love
                        anyone maybe. Or maybe that doesn’t
                        matter at all. I’d say I wish I
                        could be different but I don’t. I
                        don’t know what that would be.

           Leia grabs her bag and walks with it, away from the house.
           And down the street. And down another street. Marcy vacuums.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        I didn’t leave because you are bad.
                        The whole point of taking
                        everything away from me in the
                        first place was that I would get to
                        be someone. I mean I am someone -
                        when I am alone. But when I am with
                        other people, I am what they think
                        I am. I don’t know how to be that.
                        And I think I don’t want to be
                        something to share anymore.

           The lights go out at the dargon house. Leia walks a far off
           street as the sky changes color above her. The sun starting
           to come out.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        I was mad before. I thought you
                        couldn’t choose your family and
                        that you were trying to make me
                                 (MORE)

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 LEIA V/O (cont’d)
                        choose you. But then I saw that Ben
                        chose me. He picked me out and he
                        made me his. And there is no un-
                        choosing that. There is no
                        un-growing-up.

           The sun is now up. Shining. There is a park. Leia sits on a
           bench.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        And maybe I am supposed to choose
                        my own family. No matter what, I am
                        sorry that it is not you.

           Leia sits and watches some young kids playing in the snow.
           Their parents are clustered off somewhere else, talking.
           Leia focuses on one little girl in particular. A little
           blond girl in a red hat and blue puffy coat. She is in her
           own world.

                                 LEIA V/O
                        It is time for me to grow up for
                        good and have something that is
                        mine. And mine only.

           The little girl is close to Leia, Leia leans forward and
           says "Psssst" The little girl turns and looks at Leia. They
           lock eyes.

           CUT TO INT DARGON HOUSE

           Marcy has finished vacuuming. She turns a the lights off.

                                 CUT TO BLACK

                                 LEIA V/O
                        Goodbye.

                                 END OF FILM.
