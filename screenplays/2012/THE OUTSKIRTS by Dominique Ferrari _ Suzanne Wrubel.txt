           FADE IN:

           EXT. RICHARD MILLHOUSE NIXON HIGH - DAY

           A typical suburban high school.  A sign out front reads
           "RICHARD MILLHOUSE NIXON HIGH SCHOOL, HOME OF THE MINUTEMEN." 
           The sign is accompanied by a life-sized MINUTEMAN complete
           with a tricorn hat and breeches.

           The BELL rings and students file outside.  A V.O. breaks in. 
           It's an adolescent girl with an unfortunate LISP.  The voice
           belongs to one MINDY O'DOYLE (17).

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        Tricky Dick high wasn't the worst
                        place to spend four years.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - AFGHANISTAN - DAY

           BURKA CLAD YOUNG GIRLS walk to school.  An old Russian car
           speeds up next to them.  The BOYS inside throw rocks.

                                 AFGHANI BOYS
                            (in Afghani)
                        Whores!!!

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Sure it had its share of riffraff
                        like most schools do.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           A group of JOCKS have DUCT-TAPED a FRESHMAN to the wall. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           CARMEN, an angry goth in a wheelchair, wheels down the hall
           utterly unconcerned with running into or over other students.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        But by and large, it was a paragon
                        of suburban normalcy...

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT -- DAY

           Students hang out by their cars, excited to be out of school. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        A utopia of self-segregated
                        diversity...

           A GROUP OF FILIPINO GIRLS walk towards the tennis courts all
           wearing perfect polo's and white skirts.
                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Faux urban culture...

           The girls pass EMO KIDS on a stoop listening to iPods.  One
           EMO BOY wears a t-shirt with a CASSETTE TAPE on it.  

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And unsupervised youth with access
                        to disposable income.

           Emo Boy breaks away from the group and walks past... 

           The POPULAR KIDS, gathered by a suped up Suburban, a beautiful
           BLONDE GIRL at their center.  

           This is WHITNEY BENNETT -- 17, a 5'7" C cup, blemish free
           and loving life.  By her side is her main crony PRITHI, an
           Indian wannabe fashionista who doesn't quite manage to pull
           off the latest trend seen in US Weekly.  

           Tossing a football back and forth are the popular boys --

           COLIN, Whitney's boyfriend and future disgraced senator,
           DAVE, a heavy-set class clown type, not particularly good
           looking but has likeable down pat, and RICK, a letterman-
           clad hottie, dumb as a box of hair. 

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                            (voice turning dark)
                        And just as in every utopia since
                        the ill-fated celestial paradise of
                        Eden, the apple seeds of discontent
                        had taken root and were already
                        growing.
                            (calmer now)
                        That's me, Mindy O'Doyle.
                            (a beat)
                        In the background.

           Between Whitney and Colin is a BLURRY BLOB.  We focus in and
           begin to see two GIRLS at a bike rack -- 

           NEW ANGLE - BIKE RACK

           MINDY, tiny with mousy brown hair, puts on a bike helmet
           painted like a brain.  She wears tapered jeans and an MIT
           sweatshirt over a turtleneck. 

           WHAM!  A football SMASHES into her head.  Her face contorts
           as the screen FREEZES.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The assault victim.
           Behind Mindy, JODI SCHELLENBERGER looks on in horror.  Jodi
           is about 9 inches taller than Mindy, curvy, with poker
           straight large bangs, and dressed in thrift store geek chic. 

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And the girl with the Jackie Kennedy
                        look on her face?  

           Jodi pipes in on the V.O. --

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Aw, thanks.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        That's Jodi, my best friend.  We've
                        been best friends since 3rd grade.

           GRAPHIC - A 3RD GRADE CLASS PICTURE 

           An 8-YEAR-OLD MINDY in a mini version of her MIT sweatshirt
           sits cross-legged in the front row.  An ARROW points to her.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        There I am in the front.  

                                 JODI  (V.O.)
                        And the girl who looks like a
                        teacher's aide --

           Another ARROW appears pointing to 8-YEAR-OLD JODI -- same
           big bangs standing shoulder to shoulder next to the TEACHER. 

                                 JODI  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        That's me.  We were an odd couple.

           EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

           A LARGE JODI and a TINY MINDY are unbalanced on a see-saw. 
           Jodi's planted on the ground and Mindy awkwardly attempts to
           get off from her perch.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        But like Cagney and Lacey...

           EXT. COMMUNITY POOL - DAY

           A 10-YEAR-OLD JODI pushes a smaller BOY that's picking on
           Mindy into the water.

                                 JODI  (V.O.)
                        Or Xena and Gabrielle...
           INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

           A 15-YEAR-OLD JODI & MINDY stand in an autograph line dressed
           as Xena & Gabrielle respectively.

                                 MINDY 
                        We just worked.  I was the yin to
                        Jodi's --

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. BIKE RACK - DAY

           The FREEZE FRAME of Mindy and Jodi unfreezes.  A quick look
           reveals the perpetrators, Colin, who is high-fiving Rick,
           and Whitney who is smiling maniacally.  

           Jodi picks up a rock, winds up to hurl it back towards them.

                                 JODI
                        FR--

           We FREEZE on her mouth, about to yell a four letter-ish word.

                                 JODI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        -- lack of impulse control.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        I'd like to say that the football to
                        the temple was an isolated incident,
                        but unfortunately it wasn't anything
                        extraordinary.

           LIGHTNING QUICK MONTAGE:

           - A THUGGISH KID hits MINDY with a spit ball in class.  Her
           hair is full of them.

           - A GROUP OF FUTURE FRAT BROTHERS hit a PICCOLO-PLAYING JODI
           with an egg during MARCHING BAND practice.  She immediately
           HURLS her piccolo at them.

           - Several MEAN GIRLS hold MINDY'S BATHROOM STALL DOOR CLOSED. 
           They throw in water-soaked tampons, bottles of soda and squirt
           ketchup and mustard all over.  Mindy starts to scream and we --

                                                       SMASH CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. BIKE RACK - DAY

           Jodi finishes her thought as the rock leaves her hand --

                                 JODI
                        --aking cum dumpster!!
                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        And neither was Jodi's aim.

           The ROCK SOARS through the air, towards the POPULAR KIDS. 
           We FREEZE on WHITNEY BENNETT laughing.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Intended target -- Whitney Bennett. 
                        5 feet and 7 inches of sculpted,
                        flawless sociopath.  People didn't
                        wear anything, go anywhere, or do
                        anything unless she said it was okay --
                        and she almost never did.  Rumor had
                        it she killed her twin sister in the
                        womb for stealing her food.  Bottom
                        line -- she was feared AND loved. 
                        But mostly feared.  Actual target --

           UNFREEZE.  The rock soars over the popular kids and hits the
           windshield of PRINCIPAL LES WHITMORE as he pulls out of his
           assigned spot.  He SLAMS on his brakes. 

                                 JODI  (V.O.)
                        Les Whitmore -- School Principal,
                        member of eHarmony and table for one
                        at Hooters.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        And that's how it all started.  The
                        football that launched a thousand
                        ships.  Sort of. 

           NEW ANGLE - SCHOOL ROOFTOP

           VIRGINIA PENDERGAST sits smoking a clove as she silently
           observes.  She's 17, pretty and petite, dressed in black --
           an existentialist Audrey Hepburn. 

           She lets her still lit clove drop, then stands and leaves.

           Below her EAGER STUDENTS run a CANCER AWARENESS TABLE. 
           Virginia's LIT CLOVE lands in their DONATION JAR. 

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Les Whitmore pops Rolaids and chews angrily as he walks a
           pissed Jodi and a scared Mindy down the hall.  

                                 JODI
                        Whitney Bennett and her mandroid
                        Colin Dunne attack us and we're the
                        ones that get detention?!  This is a
                        miscarriage of justice, Mr. Whitmore.
                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Spare me the hyperbole, Ms. 
                        Schellenberger.  Frankly, I'm shocked
                        by this behavior.  Especially from
                        you, Mindy.  Someone with a clean
                        record and a future. 

           Jodi looks vaguely offended. 

                                 MINDY
                        Please, Mr. Whitmore, we --

           He holds up his hand to stop her.  

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Because I'm such a nice guy, and
                        because I don't want to deal with
                        the paperwork, I'm not putting this
                        on your permanent record.  But I
                        strongly suggest if you still plan
                        on attending MIT next year and...
                            (looks Jodi over)
                        Doing whatever it is you'll be doing
                        when you graduate, you make sure
                        this is the last I hear from you. 

           Mindy nods vigorously.  Jodi pouts.  He opens a class door... 

           INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY

           Mindy and Jodi enter a room full of the usual suspects.  The
           TEACHER at the front works on "Sudoku for Beginners." 

           Mindy nervously takes a seat next to a BLACK GIRL in a leather
           jacket.  This is SUGAR JONES -- quite large and even more
           intimidating.  Mindy shoots a nervous smile Sugar's way. 
           Sugar glares back.  Mindy gulps. 

           EXT. BIKE RACK - DAY

           The girls unlock their bikes, Mindy still shell-shocked.

                                 JODI
                        X-Files marathon tonight?

                                 MINDY
                        I have homework. 

           Jodi's gaze catches on the school steps.  

                                 JODI
                        Unbelievable.

           Mindy follows her gaze -- Whitney exits with Whitmore in tow
           and Colin following behind.  Whitney works over Whitmore.  
           He laughs, enthralled.  Whitney sees them and smiles, evilly.

                                 JODI  (CONT'D)
                        What the eff?  We get detention and
                        Whitney does a hair flip and gets
                        off scott free?  She's like the...
                        the President of Suckistan! 

                                 MINDY
                        Actually, it's Prime Minister. 

                                 JODI
                        Um, Suckistan isn't a real place.

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah, but it's a play on Pakistan,
                        which has a Prime Minister, so....

                                 JODI
                        Whatever.  Somebody needs to stuff
                        them in a locker for a change.   

                                 MINDY
                        If it makes you feel better, in at
                        least one of the infinite multiverses,
                        someone has. 
                            (off Jodi, still pissed)
                        Look, I know right now high school
                        seems like the center of this

                        Do not say, "It gets better."  Next
                        year, you'll be in nerdvana at MIT,
                        and I'll still be here dropping plates
                        at TGIFridays.   

           Mindy is not unsympathetic, but they're at a standstill.

                                 MINDY
                        I better go.  If I'm not home by 5,
                        my parents'll activate the GPS. 

           Jodi nods as Mindy jumps on her bike.  With a conciliatory
           smile at Jodi she rides off.

                                 JODI

           INT. KITCHEN - JODI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jodi pulls a meatloaf out of the oven.  The kitchen is cramped
           and dated, yet homey.  Jodi's dad, HERB, enters wearing a
           POSTAL UNIFORM as Jodi starts to prepare two plates of dinner. 

                                 HERB
                        Hey kiddo, smells delicious. 

           Jodi hands him a plate and takes her own as they sit.  They
           clink forks before digging in. 

                                 HERB (CONT'D)
                        How was school?

                                 JODI
                        Legalized torture paid for by the
                        American taxpayer.

           Jodi violently stabs a huge bite and shoves it into her mouth.

                                 HERB
                        Did you make that appointment with
                        the college counselor yet?

           Jodi purposefully ignores him as she devours her food.

                                 HERB (CONT'D)
                        Jodi, you're graduating this year. 
                        Don't you think it's time to start
                        figuring out where you're headed.

                                 JODI
                        Into lots of therapy, most likely.

                                 HERB
                        Very funny.  But you can't fend off
                        your future with one liners.  You
                        have to find something you want to
                        do.  Look at your brother.  All those
                        "stupid pictures" he used to draw
                        for fun?  Look where he is now.

                                 JODI
                        An underpaid assistant tattoo artist
                        in Jersey City?

                                 HERB
                        Exactly.  Well, not exactly.  He's
                        following his dreams, is my point.

                                 JODI
                        Following your dreams is overrated.

                        Turn on the TV for five seconds --
                        those people you see pimping out
                        their own kids to live out their
                        fantasies, or sleeping with some
                        tool for an extra minute of screen
                        time -- you know what those people
                        are doing?  Following their dreams.  

           Jodi gets up and clears her plate -- finished in record time.

                        And anyway, like you're one to talk.

                                 HERB
                        What's that supposed to mean?

                                 JODI
                        Sooo, single, 40-something, postal
                        carrier in suburban New Jersey with
                        a Pez collection was what you put
                        under your yearbook photo?

                                 HERB
                        Those Pez are gonna be valuable one
                        day.  And single and widowed are
                        different.

                                 JODI
                        I know.  But it's been 5 years now. 
                        You're not getting any younger. 

                                 HERB
                        Hey, age is just a number.

                                 JODI
                        That closely correlates with death.

           Point taken.

                                 HERB
                        So, you want me to date? 

                                 JODI
                        I just want you to follow your dreams,
                        Herb.

           With a sardonic smile, she heads upstairs.  Herb calls out --

                                 HERB
                        I'll find a date if you find a
                        direction!
                                 JODI
                        One of those things is a lot easier
                        than the other!
                            (to herself)
                        And it's not finding a direction.

                            (to himself)
                        And it's not finding a date.

           INT. JODI'S ROOM -- NIGHT

           An OIL PAINTING OF TINA FEY hangs above Jodi's headboard,
           while another wall is decorated with a poster and magazine
           collage of ADAM SCOTT.  Jodi grabs her GUITAR and sits in
           front of her computer.  Jodi brings up her YOUTUBE PAGE --

           There are DOZENS OF VIDEOS of her singing with the guitar. 
           Jodi turns on a WEBCAM that sits on top of the computer. 

                                 JODI
                        Hey, so here's a new song I wrote.

           INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mindy sits in class.  MR. SAMUELS -- 30-something, cute and
           dorky -- finishes up as the BELL RINGS. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Bernoulli's theorum will be on the
                        test next week.

           The students GROAN and start to exit. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS (CONT'D)
                        C'mon folks.  Help me help you. 
                            (to Mindy)
                        Mindy, stick around for a sec. 

           Mindy packs up as everyone leaves.  She comes to the front.

                                 MINDY
                        Did something happen to my
                        spectrophotometer?  Are my numbers
                        off?  I knew I should have used my
                        first set --

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Slow down, Sonic.  What I wanted to
                        tell you is I talked to my old
                        roommate who's on the alum board at
                        MIT, and she agreed to set up a
                        special interview for you.
                                 MINDY
                        Are you serious?!

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        As a radiation leak.  

           Mindy looks about to internally combust.   

                                 MR. SAMUELS (CONT'D)
                        You okay?

                                 MINDY
                        I just don't want to let you down. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Mindy, you're smart, capable, and an
                        amazing scientist.  You're not going
                        to let me down.  Just be confident. 

                                 MINDY
                        Confidence isn't really my strong
                        suit.  I'm more of a hide awkwardly
                        in the shadows type. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        You'd be surprised what happens when
                        you just put yourself out there. 
                            (off her skepticism)
                        The math's clear.  If you put yourself
                        out there, you've got a 50% chance
                        of things working out.  If you don't,
                        then it's 0%.  Pretty simple.

           Mindy nods, contemplating. 

                                 MINDY
                        Thanks, Mr. Samuels.  Really.

           Mindy heads for the hall, smiling.  Mr. Samuels calls out -- 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        The world is yours for the taking!

           Mindy enters the hallway and gets STAMPEDED by a JOCK MOB. 

                                 JOCK
                        Move, loser.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                            (to himself)
                        Eventually.
           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           The MARCHING BAND disperses after a practice.  Jodi, in
           uniform, walks to the bleachers with her piccolo.  Mindy is
           waiting.  There's still a slight tension between them.  

                                 JODI
                        Hey, what are you doing here?

                                 MINDY
                        I've been thinking.  Maybe there is
                        something we can do about Whitney
                        and her cronies.

                                 JODI
                        Really?  Because I've been thinking
                        too.  And here's what I figure -- if
                        we can get Whitney's locker combo --

                                 MINDY
                        That's not what I mean.  I thought
                        maybe we could try talking to her. 
                            (off Jodi's incredulity)
                        Whitney's a person too, right?  I
                        think if we just talk to her like
                        mature adults, maybe we can figure
                        out how to coexist in peace. 

                                 JODI
                        Are you crazy?  Of all the
                        douchenozzles in this school, Whitney
                        is the worst.   

                                 MINDY
                        She hasn't been that horrible. 

           Off Jodi's look --

           SERIES OF SHORT SHOTS:

           - Quick flashes of Mindy getting tripped throughout the years
           by WHITNEY'S CRONIES as Whitney looks on in satisfaction --
           in class, on the bus, in the cafeteria. 

           - Quick flashes of Jodi walking throughout the years with
           signs stuck to her back -- "LARD ASS," "WHITE TRASH,"
           "HOMOSEXUAL" -- as people laugh behind her back. 

           - 6th Grade Jodi and Mindy carefully carry a MODEL VOLCANO. 
           Whitney and her Cronies tip the volcano into Mindy and Jodi.  

           - Jodi opens her locker.  Issues of HUSTLER spill out. 

           - Mindy gets on her bike and starts to ride.  The front tire
           comes off, and Mindy crashes to the ground.  
           BACK TO SCENE 

           Mindy winces in acknowledgement.

                        Okay fine.  But people change.  
                            (off Jodi's skepticism)
                        It's either try or suffer through
                        another year of abject humiliation. 
                        What do we have to lose?

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 

           A typical high school cafeteria.  Whitney and Prithi sit at
           their reserved table.  Prithi wears a ridiculous FASCINATOR.

                                 PRITHI
                        So I said to her, you're a whore,
                        and you are not pulling off that
                        color, and if you don't stay away
                        from Rick I will call the police and
                        say that you molested my cat.  And
                        you have to register for that. 

           Colin, Dave and Rick join before Whitney can respond.  

                                 PRITHI (CONT'D)
                            (batting eyelashes)
                        Hey Rick. 

           Rick ignores her.  Colin looks at Prithi's fascinator. 

                                 COLIN
                        What is that on your head?

                                 PRITHI
                        It's called a fastener.  Kate
                        Middleton wore this to her cousin's
                        wedding last week. 

                                 DAVE
                        Was she trying to get hit by
                        lightning?

                                 PRITHI
                        Oh my god.  You are sooooo funny,
                        Dave.  It's such an absolute shock
                        that you can't find a girlfriend.

           MACKENZIE, a neurotic and high strung mean girl in training,

                                 WHITNEY
                        Took you long enough.
           Mackenzie starts pulling out the orders. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                            (to Whitney)
                        One steak, rare. 
                            (to the boys)
                        Three meatball subs. 
                            (to Prithi)
                        A kombucha and a hard boiled egg. 

                                 PRITHI
                            (off Dave's look)
                        Gwen Pal swears by it.

           As Whitney starts in on her steak --

                                 WHITNEY
                        You know what I love about you,
                        Prithi?  You don't even have to know
                        that it's actually called a fascinator
                        to look stupid in it. 

           NEW ANGLE - LUNCH LINE

           The LUNCH LADY spoons a heap of DISGUSTING CHILI onto a
           hamburger bun.  Virginia Pendergast looks up from reading
           NAUSEA by Jean Paul Sartre, to take the plate.  She looks at
           the food with disgust then takes her tray and passes --

           Mindy and Jodi, who stand by the entrance mustering up their
           courage as they look at Whitney's table.  With a deep breath,
           Mindy starts towards Whitney's table.  Jodi follows. 

                                 JODI
                        I'm going to die a virgin and you
                        don't even care. 

           They approach Mackenzie who is standing guard. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        You guys selling band candy or
                        something?

                                 MINDY
                        Actually we were wondering if we
                        could talk to Whitney for a second. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Do you have an appointment?  

                                 JODI
                        This is stupid.  Let's just go.

           Before she can turn around, Whitney approaches. 
                                 WHITNEY
                        It's okay, Mackenzie.  I want to
                        hear what the turtleneck and the
                        lesbian have to say.  

           She gestures for them to sit.  Mindy and Jodi warily sit
           down across from Whitney.  Whitney's crew looks on in
           surprise.  Mindy summons her resolve. 

                                 MINDY
                        We know there's been some bad blood
                        between us throughout the years, but
                        we're seniors now, and there's no
                        reason we can't put all that behind
                        us and finish out the school year
                        being civil to each other.  

           Whitney scrutinizes them.  Mindy and Jodi shift uncomfortably.

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        We thought maybe if we came and spoke
                        to you like adults, we could come to
                        some sort of mutually beneficial
                        agreement. 

           A long beat.  Jodi looks like she's about to throw up.  

                                 WHITNEY
                        Wow.  No one's ever had the courage
                        to come talk to me face to face.   

           Mindy gives Jodi a dorky thumbs up.  A beat.  Whitney nods. 

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        Okay.

                                 JODI
                        Wait, what?

                                 WHITNEY
                        It didn't occur to me until this
                        exact moment that I kind of respect
                        you.  You never changed who you were
                        to blend in.  That's more than can
                        be said for most of these automatons. 

                                 MINDY
                        Well I'm glad we could come to this
                        understanding. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Me too.  Actually Colin's having a
                        party Saturday.  Why don't you come?   

           Colin starts to protest.  Whitney elbows him. 
                                 JODI
                        I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone
                        right now. 

                                 PRITHI
                        I know.  It's like if Edward and
                        Jacob decided to become friends. 

           INT. COLIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A suburban mansion with absurdly loud MUSIC.  People are
           everywhere.  Mindy and Jodi stand at the entrance.  Mindy
           has done her hair.  Her typical soccer mom garb has been
           replaced by "soccer mom goes to The Olive Garden."

                                 JODI
                        You realize this is it, right?  This
                        is the moment we both become school
                        shooters.

           Mindy is looking nervous as well but tries to remain upbeat.

                                 MINDY
                        Beer?

           Jodi nods, and they weave their way through the packed crowd 
           to the KEG.  Mindy grabs a cup and starts pumping -- a lot. 
           She pours a cup for herself and one for Jodi.  There's
           synchronized sips and then matching FOAM MUSTACHES.  

           Mindy looks at her cup in disgust. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        I think mine's gone bad or something. 

           Jodi looks at it, and then takes a test sip.

                                 JODI
                        That's what beer tastes like.

                                 MINDY
                        Oh.

           Just then, DAVE arrives at the keg.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey MIT and, uh --
                            (looking over Jodi)
                        Wellesley. 

           Jodi rolls her eyes.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        How's it goin'?
                                 JODI
                        Well, we haven't been date-raped
                        yet, sooo --

                                 DAVE
                            (to Mindy)
                        Is she always this pleasant?

                                 MINDY
                        No.  This is her trying to be nice.

                                 JODI
                        I'm hoping to get time off from this
                        conversation for good behavior. 

                                 DAVE
                        You're funny, Wellesley. 

                                 JODI
                        Thanks, Penn State.

           Dave laughs. 

                                 DAVE
                        I'm Dave by the way.

                                 MINDY
                        We were lab partners for three years.

                                 DAVE
                        Oh, totally.  Right.  Mandy.

                                 MINDY
                        Mindy.

                                 DAVE
                        Mindy.  Mindy.  Yep, Mindy.  
                            (to Jodi)
                        And is there any reason it would be
                        awkward for me not to know your name?

                                 JODI
                        Not unless you're an avid follower
                        of the piccolo section in the school
                        marching band.  

                                 DAVE
                        I'm more of a tuba section guy myself. 

                                 JODI
                        Well then I'm Jodi. 

           They shake.  For a second it looks like Jodi might even be
           enjoying herself. 
                                 WHITNEY
                        There you guys are!  Now that you've
                        hit your obnoxious creep quota for
                        the night, I'll show you around.

           With a snide look at Dave, she ushers them off.  Dave rolls
           his eyes and heads back into the thick of it. 

           EXT. COLIN'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Whitney leads Mindy and Jodi, who look around in awe. 

                                 MINDY
                        The mean attractiveness of this party
                        is statistically significant. 

           A STREAKER runs through and jumps in the pool.

                                 JODI
                        Oh my god.  Is that really just how
                        I saw my first human penis?

           Whitney leads them to Colin, Rick, Prithi and Mackenzie. 
           Rick hits on Mackenzie as Prithi glares. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Mackenzie, drinks. 

           Mackenzie leaves to obey orders.  Rick stands to follow. 

                                 PRITHI
                        Do not sleep with the help, Rick. 

           Rick ignores her.  Prithi looks back to the group trying to
           maintain her dignity. 

                                 PRITHI (CONT'D)
                        I like a guy I can't order around. 

           Nearby, two FRAT BOYS at a pong table look at Mindy and Jodi. 

                                 FRAT BOY
                        Dorks.  Balls.  Now. 

           Mindy and Jodi, taken aback, look to Whitney.

                                 WHITNEY
                        Go.  Mingle.  Let people get to know
                        you. 

           LATER:

           Mindy and Jodi at the pong table with a GIANT STACKED PYRAMID
           OF BEER.  They look in trepidation at the pyramid.  Mindy
           tentatively throws the ball... and totally misses.  
           The Frat Boy takes the ball and sinks it in the top cup.

                                 FRAT BOY
                        Boom!  Drink!

           Mindy and Jodi share the cup, sputtering.  Jodi serves.  As
           they play, the game SPEEDS UP until we are in FAST MOTION --

           FAST MOTION MONTAGE:

           Mindy and Jodi get increasingly into the game as they get
           increasingly drunk.  They beat a series of opponents, Mindy
           calculating the perfect arc for the ball, as people start
           CHEERING them on.  They're HIGH-FIVING random people, DOING
           SHOTS, and generally having a great time. 

           They get pulled onto the DANCE FLOOR.  For a second they are
           nervous and then they totally go for it -- the Sprinkler,
           the Robot, the Worm, the Running Man -- they are pulling out
           all the stops as people CHEER them on.  Total glory. 

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Mindy and Jodi, happy and drunk, hang out on the patio.  

                                 MINDY
                        I'm so happy I could throw up.

                                 JODI
                        What?

           BLLLAAGH.  Mindy throws up all over the ground.  Jodi just
           raises an eyebrow.  Suddenly, WHITNEY gets on the DJ mic.  

                                 WHITNEY
                        Excuse me, everyone.  

           Everyone, quiets and looks at her.  A LARGE PROJECTOR SCREEN
           has been erected behind her.

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        As you may have noticed, we've got
                        some new additions tonight.  Mindy
                        and Jodi.  Now, most of us walk past
                        these girls each and every day in
                        the hallway and have never bothered
                        to get to know them.  So I put
                        together a little video about our
                        very own Jodi, so we could all get
                        to know her a little better. 

           Whitney steps aside as the projector screen turns on --

           ON VIDEO: 
           INT. JODI'S ROOM - DAY

           Jodi types at her computer, the video recorded off her WEBCAM. 

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Mindy glances at Jodi -- what's going on?  

           WEBCAM VIDEO OF JODI'S BEDROOM:

           Jodi continues to type. 

                                 HERB (O.S.)
                        Hey hon.  Got your tampons. 

           Jodi turns and looks towards the door. 

                                 JODI
                        Dad!  I need maximum flow!

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Everyone at the party bursts out laughing.  Whitney shoots
           Jodi a perfect smile as growing horror dawns on Jodi's face. 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Oh my God. 

           WEBCAM VIDEO OF JODI'S BEDROOM:

           Jodi plays "Part of This World" on the piccolo as she sits
           in a circle with her STUFFED ANIMALS.  The song ends. 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Not bad, right guys?

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Jodi awkwardly flits around her room wielding a pair of
           NUNCHUCKS against an imaginary foe. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Jodi sits across from Herb, who looks nervous.

                                 HERB
                        It's like -- when two people have
                        feelings for each other... Okay, you
                        know how there are birds, and there
                        are bees?
                            (off her confusion)
                        How familiar are you with male
                        anatomy?
                                 JODI
                        Oh my God, dad.  I'm 17! 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           Jodi, dressed in a ONESIE, plays her guitar and SINGS --

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Oooooh, eczema, I'm gonna vanquish
                        yaaaa...   

           BACK TO SCENE 

           The party is in HYSTERICS.  Only Dave looks at Jodi with
           sympathy.  Mindy is too stunned to do anything.  Jodi bolts
           for the exit as the LAUGHTER follows her.  A beat and then
           Mindy follows. 

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Mindy runs out.  Jodi is BIKING AWAY as fast as she can. 

                                 MINDY
                        Jodi, wait!

           Jodi doesn't stop.  Mindy watches her recede into darkness.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           The hall buzzes with student activity.  A path begins to
           clear as students step aside for --

           WHITNEY, PRITHI and MACKENZIE, striding in SLO-MO.  STUDENTS
           look at Whitney in awe and fear as she passes.

           Whitney, Prithi and Mackenzie stop at Whitney's locker. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        That prank you pulled was epic. 
                        Everyone is talking about it.  Our
                        grandchildren will still be talking
                        about it.  

           Whitney takes a BOOK from her locker and hands it to Mackenzie --

           THE 48 LAWS OF POWER

                                 WHITNEY
                        If you're going to be in power next
                        year, this is your new bible.  The
                        48 Laws of Power.  Make sure you
                        heed Law number one.

           Mackenzie carefully opens the book to the first chapter -- 
           "NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER"

                                 PRITHI
                        Mark Burnett was a nanny before he
                        read that book. 

           Off Whitney slamming her locker shut --

           NEW ANGLE:

           Mindy wanders through the hall self-consciously.  People
           LAUGH and WHISPER as she passes.  She pulls out her cell,
           checks for calls.  Nothing.  She SPEED DIALS.  A beat. 

                                 MINDY
                        Hey Jodi.  It's me.  Again.  Just
                        call me, okay.  I'm at school, and
                        it's really not so --
                            (trailing off)
                        Bad.

           Before her is JODI's LOCKER -- it's decorated with items
           referencing the video -- TAMPONS, NUNCHUCKS, JODI'S YEARBOOK
           PICTURE photoshopped onto a FOREVER LAZY AD, etc.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Whitney and her crew hang in the back of Colin's Suburban
           drinking beers.  Dave silently nurses his beer. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Did you guys see Jodi's locker? 
                        Someone did something with a piccolo
                        and a Paddington Bear that is
                        really... not right. 

                                 DAVE
                        That was seriously twisted, Whitney. 
                        Even for you.  I mean how mental do
                        you have to be to put in that much
                        effort into messing with a couple of
                        nerds just trying to make peace?

                                 WHITNEY
                        What do you mean?  All I had to do
                        was get Jodi to respond to a spyware
                        email, figure out her IP address,
                        and learn how to hack into a webcam. 
                        After that, it was just going through
                        the 84 hours of footage to edit
                        together the best bits.  

                                 DAVE
                        Here's an idea.  Why don't you just
                        leave them alone?
                                 WHITNEY
                        Because, Dave, if I left them alone,
                        it would make me look weak.  And I
                        will not allow that creepy giant and
                        her frizzy-haired lapdog to roam the
                        halls of this school thinking that,
                        for one second, they are my equal. 

           Mackenzie holds up the 48 Laws of Power. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Law 15 -- crush your enemy totally. 

                                 DAVE
                        You know, I'm so glad I'm not a girl,
                        and it's not just because of your
                        plumbing and status in society. 
                        It's because girls are demonic. 
                        You're like medieval to each other.  

                                 PRITHI
                        Oh, shut up.  Guys are just as bad.

                                 DAVE
                        No.  Freaking.  Way.  When a dude
                        has a problem with another dude, you
                        know what he does?

           Dave PUNCHES Colin in the chest.  Hard.  Colin wheezes.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        He punches him.  And then, after we
                        fight.  We drink.

           Dave hands his Tall Boy to Colin.

                                 DAVE  (CONT'D)
                        Drink up, buddy.
                            (to Whitney)
                        And then we apologize.
                            (to Colin)
                        Sorry I punched you.  We cool?

           Colin nods through his pain.  Dave turns back to Whitney.

                                 DAVE  (CONT'D)
                        And then we make up.  And that's how
                        it works.  No passive aggressive,
                        evil arch nemesis bullshit.

                                 WHITNEY
                        Perhaps that's why, by all measures, 
                        your gender is increasingly falling
                        behind in education, employment, and
                        financial status.   
                                 DAVE
                        Whatever.  You're a jerk.

           INT. JODI'S ROOM - DAY

           Jodi lies in her pajamas despondently watching "Party Down." 
           Mindy enters.  Jodi looks at her then turns back to the TV. 
           Mindy looks over to see a giant strip of DUCT TAPE has been
           placed over Jodi's webcam.  Mindy sits by Jodi's bed. 

                                 MINDY
                        You know, one day we're going to
                        look back on this and --

                                 JODI
                        Just stop, Mindy.  I told you this
                        was going to happen.  I should have
                        never listened to you.  

           Mindy doesn't know what to say.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        And I knew I shouldn't have clicked
                        on that attachment.

           QUICK CUT:

           Jodi opens and EMAIL:

           CASTING CALL FOR NEW TINA FEY SERIES!!!  PICCOLO PLAYERS
           WANTED!!!

           Jodi clicks on the attachment excitedly. 

           BACK TO SCENE 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        How am I supposed to go back to school
                        after this?

           Mindy hates seeing Jodi like this.  Something has to be done. 

                                 MINDY
                        I'll tell you how.  'Cause this isn't
                        over.  We're going to win this one.

                                 JODI
                        I'm not sure if you understand the
                        definition of winning.  This...
                            (gesturing to herself)
                        Not winning. 

                                 MINDY
                        No, I'm serious.  You were right. 
                        We've gotta stand up for ourselves.  
                                 JODI
                        And how are we going to do that?

                                 MINDY
                        We're gonna beat those fascists at
                        their own game.  We're gonna be
                        popular.  And not lame Top 40 popular. 
                        Awesome popular.  All of us.  All
                        the people they've ever treated like
                        second class citizens and then copied
                        their Calculus homework. 

                                 JODI
                        Popular people don't take Calculus.

                                 MINDY
                        Exactly.  Because they're stupid
                        dolts who'll go to below average
                        universities, get mediocre grades
                        and still end up being our bosses
                        unless we do something about it now.  

                                 JODI
                        Just like that?  We're going to
                        overthrow generations of ingrained
                        high school social strata. 

                                 MINDY
                        Sure.  Is there anything we've ever
                        put our minds to that we haven't
                        accomplished?
                            (cutting her off)
                        Besides getting Firefly back on the
                        air.

                                 JODI
                        Then, no, I guess not. 

                                 MINDY
                        Exactly.  So let's do this thing.  

           Jodi nods.  She's in.  The two grasp each others' pinkies,
           doing an elaborate pinkie agreement shake. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And so it was, that the revolution
                        was born.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And Tina Fey, if you're listening,
                        I'd still play piccolo for you. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mindy and Jodi march down the after-school hall with resolve. 
                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        The facts were simple -- there were
                        more of us than there were of them. 
                        So all we had to do was convince the
                        outsiders, misfits and weirdos of
                        the school to band together. 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Basically, we were going to unionize
                        the outcasts.

           QUICK SHOTS: Mindy and Jodi talk to various factions -- from
           the ORCHESTRA NERDS to MATH GEEKS to GOTHS and STONERS. 
           They put up SIGNS advertising a meeting with the slogan "POWER
           TO THE PEONS!!!"

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Unfortunately, it was a lot harder
                        than we expected. 

           Mindy and Jodi sit alone in an empty room. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        We were getting desperate.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mindy and Jodi stop by a classroom with a poster board --

           TWI-HARDS!  TUESDAYS AFTERSCHOOL, ROOM 301

           Mindy and Jodi peak in.  A GIRL SOBS HYSTERICALLY as other
           girls and one boy nod in total understanding.

                                 TWI-HARD
                            (between sobs)
                        He just... loves her... so much.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Buuut not that desperate.

           Mindy and Jodi glance at each other, then keep going. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mindy and Jodi, deflated, stop in front of a doorway labeled
           GIRL SCOUTS.  They look at each other skeptically but enter. 

           INT. CLASSROM - DAY

           The room is empty, all except for CLAIRE STEWART.  Innocently
           adorable, she sits in her GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM building an
           elaborate TOOTHPICK SCULPTURE of a unicorn.  She looks up
           and sees them, then stands abruptly, excited.
                                 CLAIRE
                        Holy cannoli!  Hi, come in. 

                                 JODI
                        Where is everyone?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Oh, this is it.  Just me.  I'm Claire. 

           Claire stares with wide-eyed enthusiasm, especially at Jodi. 

                                 JODI
                        Hey, Claire.  So we're going around
                        to everyone because we're trying to
                        gather people together to make a
                        change.  Basically, we're -- 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm in!  Whatever you guys need. 

           Jodi glances at Mindy.  That was strangely easy. 

                                 CLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Yay!

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Jodi and Mindy wander the deserted halls after school. 

                                 JODI
                        So we've pretty much talked to every
                        misfit toy in this school, and the
                        only thing we have to show for it is
                        Marcia Brady. 

                                 MINDY
                        Revolutions have to start some -- 

           They stop short as they see SUGAR JONES walking straight for
           them looking like she's about to rip their heads off.  

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                            (whispering, scared)
                        It's Sugar Jones.  Why is she coming
                        towards us?

           They look around frantically but they are alone in the hall. 

                                 JODI
                        Whatever it is, no eyewitnesses. 

           They quiet as Sugar stops in front of them.  They gulp.
                                 SUGAR
                        I hear you're trying to obliterate
                        the asshole-normative power hierarchy
                        of this pathetic excuse for a school. 

                                 MINDY
                        Uh, obliterate's kind of a strong
                        word, but yeah.

                                 SUGAR
                        I'm in.

           Jodi looks hesitant, but one look from Sugar convinces her.

                                 JODI
                        Okay. 

           Sugar nods, then turns and walks away.  Mindy and Jodi look
           at each other.  What the hell just happened. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mindy, Jodi, and Claire sit waiting.  Claire smiles eagerly
           at Jodi and Mindy.  Sugar enters and takes in the three girls.

                                 SUGAR
                        Are you kidding me?  Charles Manson
                        had more followers. 

                                 MINDY
                        I know right now we're a small group,
                        but we're all here for a reason,
                        right?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Right.  Wait, why are we here?

                                 JODI
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 SUGAR
                        If this is all we've got to show, I
                        say we just burn this mother down
                        and be done with it.

                                 JODI
                        Nice.  Arson sounds like a fabulous
                        plan.

                                 CLAIRE
                        If we need to get more people, we
                        could go door-to-door like I do with
                        cookies.  It's an excellent way to
                        meet people in a place they feel
                        comfortable --
                                 SUGAR
                        Screw Girl Scout cookies.  An obvious
                        conspiracy to subjugate girls and
                        force them into traditional gender
                        roles by selling overpriced,
                        unremarkable, and nutritionally
                        deficient baked goods.

           Okkkaaaay.  They stare at each other in awkward silence.

                                 JODI
                        We suck at this.  Look at us.  This
                        isn't a revolution, it's a girl band. 
                        We need someone who can work the
                        system.  Karl Rove, good witch style. 

                                 MINDY
                        Wait...

           Jodi and Mindy exchange a look.  Eureka. 

                        MINDY (CONT'D)
                                                       JODI
                Virginia.
                                             Virginia.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Virginia, the girl from the roof, stands at a podium, except
           instead of her usual existentialist garb, she is dressed out
           of a J Crew catalogue and emanates an upbeat can-do attitude.  

                                 VIRGINIA
                        As president of the History --

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                 VIRGINIA  (CONT'D)
                        Young Democrats --

                                                                 CUT TO:

                                 VIRGINIA  (CONT'D)
                        Model United Nations club --

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        Virginia Pendergast had locked up
                        "Most Likely to Succeed" in elementary
                        school.  Every club, every activity. 
                        She even played a sport. 

           EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

           Virginia tees off perfectly.
                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        Our junior year, Virginia launched
                        the culmination of all her hard work --
                        a campaign for student council
                        president.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Virginia is dressed impeccably.  She hands out FLYERS, PINS,
           AND #2 PENCILS WITH HER PICTURE and the words "YES I CAN."

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Virginia CAMPAIGNS in the lunch room, going table to table.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        But despite a well-oiled political
                        machine, and the endorsement of
                        several key teachers --

           INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY

           Virginia sits alone, balloons and confetti everywhere.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        She lost.  To Kyle McDevitt -- a
                        sophomore basketball star whose
                        campaign speech consisted of a Journey
                        song and free Chipotle gift cards. 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           KYLE enthusiastically belts out "Don't Stop Believing" as
           CHEERLEADERS dance backup behind him and throw GIFT CARDS to
           the CROWD OF STUDENTS eating it up.  Virginia looks on aghast.

                                 MINDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        After her crushing defeat, she went
                        where many a depressed and disgruntled
                        American has gone before...

           INT. CHARLES DEGAULLE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           The scene is chaotic -- people are smoking everywhere and
           the loud speaker is blasting FRENCH.  Virginia stands in the
           middle of it all, eyes closed, soaking it in.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        France.

           LIGHTNING QUICK SHOTS:

           - Virginia at a CAFE chain smoking and reading beat poetry.
           - Virginia at a FRENCH MOVIE starring a weird talking cow. 
           She laughs and cries at the same time.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Needless to say--

           EXT. RICHARD MILLHOUSE NIXON HIGH - DAY

           Virginia smokes a clove.  She wears a shirt that reads
           "L'enfer c'est les autres."  Another SMOKER observes her. 

                                 SMOKER
                        What's your shirt say?

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Hell is other people.

           She flicks her clove and walks away.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        -- she didn't come back from summer
                        break the same.

           EXT. PENDERGAST ESTATE - DAY

           Jodi, Mindy, Claire and Sugar stand before a giant gate. 
           They look up at the intimidating Gothic estate.  

                                 JODI
                        Who's their architect?  Tim Burton?  

           Mindy finds the "V. PENDERGAST" buzzer and pushes it.  

                                 MINDY
                        Um, hi Virginia.  It's Mindy, Jodi,
                        Sugar and Claire from school.  We're
                        trying to figure out how to upend
                        the social hierarchy of the school --

                                 SUGAR
                        Or destroy it. 

                                 MINDY
                        And we could use your help.

           A VOICE comes on the intercom --

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.)
                        I'm not interested in your futile
                        attempts to make sense of the world's
                        chaos.

           CLICK.  The line goes dead.  Jodi presses the button.
                                 JODI
                        We're actually thinking more along
                        the lines of revenge.

           A beat.  The gate starts to open.

           EXT. VIRGINIA'S ROOM - PENDERGAST ESTATE - DAY

           Not a color to be found.  Poetry is scribbled on the walls. 
           Virginia sits blandly regarding Mindy and Jodi's motley crew.  

                                 VIRGINIA
                        So how, exactly, are you going to
                        pull off this little experiment?

                                 MINDY
                        That's where you come in.  We tried
                        to talk to the different groups at
                        school, but no one wanted to take up
                        the cause.  

                                 VIRGINIA
                            (laughs)
                        Of course not.  You know how all
                        Asian people look the same but then,
                        underneath it all there's 3000 years
                        of genocide and the rape of Nanking? 
                        Well, that's outcasts.  You think
                        we're all the same but really we're
                        like snowflakes.  Snowflakes that
                        hate each other.  Look, let me break
                        it down for you.  You've got your
                        basic over-achievers...

           SERIES OF SHORT SHOTS:

           A TYPE-A NERD frantically raises his hand in class.

                                 VIRGINIA (V.O.)
                        Your under-achievers...

           In the back, a GRUNGY BOY carves the desk with a switchblade. 

                                 VIRGINIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Then you've got the kids lost in the
                        past... 

           TWO BOYS DRESSED AS AN ELF and WARLOCK fight in the woods.

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Kids lost in the future...

           TREKKIES dressed up in uniform line up at a convention. 
                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Kids still obsessed with Lost...

           A GIRL pauses on a scene in "Lost" and grabs her notebook. 

                                 LOST FAN
                        I've seen that number before.

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.)
                        Kids who are lost. 

           STONERS watch The Simpsons as they pass around a bong. 

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Then there are the Emo's --

           The Emo's from before sit on the same stoop.

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The kids who hate Emo... 

           A car of GOTHS passes.  Goth Girl sneers at the Emo's. 

                                 GOTH GIRL
                        Freaks.

                        Kids with foreign parents --

           Several ASIAN GIRLS walk down the school hall past a group
           of GIRLS IN HEAD SCARVES.  They roll their eyes at each other. 

                                 VIRGINIA  (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Parents --

           A JUNO-ESQUE GIRL waddles through the hallway.

           BACK TO SCENE:

                                 VIRGINIA
                        And we haven't even touched the whole
                        nerd/geek/dork debate yet.  There're
                        more strains of loser out there than
                        the herpes virus.  Uniting them under
                        one banner -- that's no easy task. 

                                 JODI
                        So we're screwed.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        I said it wasn't easy.  I didn't say
                        it was impossible.  

           Off Virginia, the wheels already turning --
           INT. WAR ROOM - VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Virginia leads the girls into a subterranean chamber with a
           giant WAR TABLE and remnants from Virginia's campaign.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        What is this place?

                                 VIRGINIA
                        It used to be my campaign
                        headquarters.  Prior to that, it was
                        used by my father to house his
                        miniature horse collection.  And
                        prior to that, it was used by my
                        schizophrenic grandfather to
                        interrogate imaginary communists. 
                        He won an imaginary medal for it.

           She points to a BOWLING TROPHY on a shelf. 

                                 SUGAR
                        Man, rich white people are messed
                        up. 

           Claire nods. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        When I was running for office, I did
                        a little research on the voters.  

           We PAN OUT to reveal she is standing before a wall to wall
           bookshelf of INTEL FILES that would make the Patriot Act
           blush.  They approach in awe. 

                                 VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                        This represents the entire student
                        body.  Each file contains your
                        standard class list, activities,
                        hobbies, GPA, psychological
                        evaluation, past and current lovers,
                        and most importantly, weaknesses. 

                                 JODI
                        No goddamn way.

           Jodi immediately finds her file and pulls it.  She opens it --

           INSERT JODI'S DOSSIER --

           Jodi's CLASS PICTURE with a list of activities, classes,
           etc.  GPA reads 3.7.  PAST AND FUTURE LOVERS is blank.

                        Jesus, am I that transparent? 

           The other girls read from their files --

                        Latent Napoleonic tendencies?

                        Overtly aggressive, lack of impulse
                        control, militant with anarchist

                        What does yours say, Claire?

           Claire shuts the file, uncomfortable.

                                 CLAIRE
                        It just says Girl Scout. 

           Virginia looks at her knowingly. 

                                 MINDY
                        Virginia, where's your file?

                                 VIRGINIA
                        I have no weaknesses. 

           Virginia retrieves FIVE FILES.  

                                 VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                        These four files represent the
                        kingpins of the school's underclass. 
                        Convince these five to join your
                        side, you've got a shot at this thing. 
                        The key is finding out what makes
                        someone tick.  And then exploiting
                        it mercilessly.  

                                 SUGAR
                        I like her.  Even if she is named
                        after a slave state. 

           Virginia opens a file.  She takes out the DOSSIER...

                                 VIRGINIA
                        First up...
           She stabs a DOSSIER violently into a cork board.

                        Howard Chang.  Leader of the Young
                        Entrepreneurs.  Points of weakness --
                        the word "billion," black mock neck
                        turtlenecks, and tall women. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           The five girls sit across from HOWARD -- Asian, officious,
           always on his iPad, dressed exactly like Steve Jobs.  Behind
           him TECH NERDS work on APPLE PRODUCTS in front of GIANT
           PICTURES of STEVE JOBS and MARK ZUCKERBERG. 

                                 HOWARD
                        I get what you guys are going for, I
                        think it's very innovative, but it's
                        just not right for us.  We're working
                        on an app right now that's gonna
                        blow up -- Asia Vous.  Facebook for
                        Asians.  And besides I've gotta look
                        to the future, not worry about high
                        school.  I still have to get into
                        Harvard, then drop out of Harvard,
                        before I can start my first company. 

           Mindy leans forward, doing her best sell. 

                                 MINDY
                        Here's to the crazy ones, the misfits,
                        the rebels, the troublemakers.  You
                        can quote them, disagree with them,
                        glorify or vilify them, but the only
                        thing you can't do is ignore them
                        because they change things.

           Jodi stands up.  Howard looks up at her, towering over him.

                                 JODI
                        You know who said that?  Steve Jobs. 
                        And that's why he made a billion
                        dollars.

           Howard looks at them.  Sold.

                        Fiction club.  Points of weakness --
                        hard sci-fi, the sound of his own
                        voice, very aggressive women. 
           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CLASSROOM - DAY

           The girls, have just made their pitch to MARTIN -- thin,
           bespectacled, arrogant -- as SCI-FI NERDS hang behind him. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Just because you're a science geek
                        doesn't mean we're your comrades in
                        arms.  Science is about what is. 
                        Any idiot can do that.  Science
                        fiction is about what could be. 

                                 JODI
                        We love science fiction too!  We're
                        huge Doctor Who fans.

                                 MINDY
                        I mean the Matt Smith years...
                        completely turned the series around. 

           Martin looks at them with withering derision.

                                 MARTIN
                        I'll tell you what.  Give me the
                        title of one Neal Stephenson novel,
                        just one, and I'll join your little --

           Sugar butts in --

                                 SUGAR
                        You think skinny anemic fanboys have
                        a monopoly on the one fictional genre
                        where women and people of color get
                        to exist outside of backwards societal
                        norms and traditional confinements? 
                        Not to mention a genre largely
                        premised on the idea that future
                        dystopia is the inevitable outcome
                        of the current system of patriarchal
                        excess?
                            (before he can protest)
                        Idiot.  Oh, and Cryptonomicon, Snow
                        Crash, Anathem.  Want me to go on?

           Martin looks at her, impressed.  Maybe a little turned on.

           The girls stand before Carmen, who's playing a first person
           shooter.  The room is drenched in the sound of GUNFIRE and
           EXPLOSIONS as GAMERS frantically tap their controllers. 

                                 MINDY
                        We just think, if we can bring

                        BAM!

                        Head shot!  Suck it, bitches!
                            (turns to them)
                        I'm all for war.  But you guys are
                        worse than noobs, and we don't follow
                        noobs into battle.

                        Care to shoot for it?

           Claire nods to the game.  Carmen looks at her, incredulous.

           LATER:

           Carmen and Claire engage in a head-to-head FPS battle.  Claire
           gets the winning shot.  Carmen's screen goes RED.  Disbelief.

                        Now the real work begins.  

           EXT. MINDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jodi, Claire, Sugar and Virginia exit Mindy's house as they
           all exchange happy goodbyes.  Virginia hops on a Vespa and
           Sugar heads to her car.  Jodi walks to her bike.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Need a ride?

                        I'm really glad I'm helping you guys
                        with this whole thing.  I've always
                        really admired you, you know.

                                 JODI
                        Really?  Why?

                                 CLAIRE
                        You're just so unapologetic about
                        who you are. 

                                 JODI
                        That's been a recurring problem. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        No, it's awesome.  
                            (beat; nervous)
                        So when did you know?

                                 JODI
                        That I rubbed people the wrong way?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Haven't heard that one before.  But
                        yeah.  

           Jodi looks at her oddly but then shrugs.

                                 JODI
                        It was pretty obvious since I was a
                        kid.  But I really hit my stride in
                        middle school.

                        I'm that one there.

           Claire pulls over.  She hesitates a moment, then speaks --

                                 CLAIRE
                        I... rub people the wrong way too. 
                        I mean I haven't actually yet.  But
                        I want to.  Someday.  First I have
                        to figure out how to tell them.

                                 JODI
                        Tell them that you're rude and
                        obnoxious?

                                 CLAIRE
                            (confused)
                        No.  That I'm gay. 

                                 JODI
                        Wait, what?

                                 CLAIRE
                        It's so great talking to someone
                        who's already out.  You're like my
                        hero.  When you walked through the
                        school with that sign announcing you
                        were gay, I couldn't believe how
                        brave you were.  

                                 JODI
                        Someone put that sign on my back as
                        a prank. 
                            (off Claire's confusion)
                        Why does everyone think I'm gay?

           Off Claire's look --
           SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS:

           - Jodi dressed up as XENA WARRIOR PRINCESS. 

           - Jodi plays the guitar and bellows out the Indigo Girls's
           "CLOSER TO FINE" in one of her YouTube videos.

           - Jodi opens her locker to reveal a picture of RACHEL MADDOW. 

           BACK TO SCENE 

                                 CLAIRE
                        And you do wear a lot of vests.

                                 JODI
                        Huh. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm sorry, I just always thought --

                                 JODI
                        No, I'm sorry.  
                            (awkward beat)
                        So when did you know? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I think it finally clicked when I
                        realized that I didn't love Veronica
                        Mars.  I loved Veronica Mars.

           Jodi puts his hand up in the air like a Reverend.

                                 JODI
                        Preach.

           The two exchange a smile. 

           INT. JODI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jodi enters smiling.  Herb sits at an outdated computer.

                                 JODI
                        Things are happening, Herb.  Things
                        are happening. 

                                 HERB
                        Yes.  They.  Are.

           Herb hands her a BROCHURE for a NEW YORK PERFORMING ARTS
           SCHOOL.  Before Jodi can protest --  

                                 HERB (CONT'D)
                        A deal's a deal. 

           He points to his new DATING PROFILE.
                                 HERB (CONT'D)
                        I have a date with Carol, and you
                        have a date with destiny.

           Off Jodi considering the brochure --

           INT. WAR ROOM - VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           Carmen, Howard, Martin, and Louis sit at the war table. 
           They're still skeptical.  The five girls sit nervously on
           the other side, except for Virginia who coolly observes. 
           Mindy clears her throat and starts woodenly reading cue cards. 

                                 MINDY
                        Raise your hand if you've ever eaten
                        lunch in a bathroom stall... 
                            (no hands)
                        Completed someone else's homework...

           Still nothing.  Mindy continues, increasingly uncomfortable. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Made fun of because of your weight,
                        ethnicity, sexual orientation, or
                        knowledge of the periodic table of
                        elements. 

           The Kingpins are unimpressed.  The girls shift, anxious.   

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well it's time we did something about
                        it!  

                                 HOWARD
                        It's time to get to the point.  It's
                        been 42 seconds and I still don't
                        know your product, your plan or your
                        profit point.  If you want to
                        endlessly pontificate, start a blog. 

                                 SUGAR

                        Oh no, here comes angry black girl.  

           Sugar looks at her in disbelief. 

                                 SUGAR
                        I'm not angry because I'm black. 
                        I'm angry because I'm paying
                        attention.

                                 SUGAR (CONT'D)
                        Are you honestly going to sit there
                        and tell me you're happy with the
                        way things are?  

                                 MINDY
                        All we're saying is if we don't stick
                        together, we don't have a chance of
                        standing up to the evil Empire. 

                                 MARTIN
                        So what you're proposing is like the
                        rebel alliance.

                                 JODI
                        Exactly!  Star Wars.  Classic sci-
                        fi.

                                 LOUIS
                        I'm sorry to interrupt, but I think
                        Star Wars technically constitutes
                        fantasy.

                                 MARTIN
                        Are you serious?

                                 LOUIS
                        It's an archetypal hero's quest. 
                        That's fantasy. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Um, yeah.  Set in a technologically
                        advanced society with spaceships. 

                                 LOUIS
                        And swordfighting.

                                 MARTIN
                        Lightsabers are not swords. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What about the Force?  That's magic. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Which was scientifically explained
                        by midichlorians. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Are you actually citing the prequels
                        to me right now?

                                 HOWARD
                        I don't get it.  Why do we have two
                        sci-fi nerds here?
                                 LOUIS
                        He's sci-fi.  I'm fantasy.  It's
                        totally different. 

                                 CARMEN
                        But neither of you get laid, right?

           Virginia finally steps in. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        This is exactly the problem.  
                            (off their looks)
                        What is a popular person anyway? 
                        What makes them different from us?

                        MARTIN
                                                       LOUIS
                Looks.
                                             Social skills.

                                 HOWARD
                        They have sex.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        That's just what they want you to
                        think because they need you to believe
                        it's hard to be popular.  The only
                        difference between them and us, is
                        they're united.  While we're tearing
                        each other apart over who would win
                        between Batman and Green Lantern --

                        LOUIS
                                                       MARTIN
                Batman.
                                             Green Lantern. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        -- they're sitting pretty and ruling
                        our school. 

                                 CARMEN
                        So what are you asking for?  Blind
                        loyalty?  That we just pretend we're
                        all friends?

                                 MINDY
                        No, not blind loyalty.  Real loyalty. 
                        We all have something in common. 
                        We've been treated like second class
                        citizens in a school we help make
                        great.  We're the movers and shakers. 
                        We're the club presidents and
                        innovators.  And we're the ones with
                        our hands on the beating pulse of
                        otherness that makes America the
                        best effin' country in the G-D world! 
                        So let's stop bending over and taking
                        it and stand up together! 
           She has their attention.  Jodi steps up, feeling the momentum.

                                 JODI
                        The plan's simple.  Popularity is
                        9/10th's posture.  So you see each
                        other in the halls -- you say hello. 
                        You see someone getting roughed up --
                        you back 'em up.  From now on, the
                        lines that divide us are gone.  We
                        are one united front of misfits!

           The Kingpins exchange glances.  They're in. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Students stream through the halls between class. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        And so it began.  Our independence
                        day.  At first the changes were small. 
                        A smile here.

           Howard and Sugar pass each other and exchange a nod. 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        A random act of non-douche-baggy-
                        ness there.

           CARMEN races her wheelchair down the hall.  About to sideswipe
           a group of NERDS, she slows down, goes around them.  

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Louis, wearing a LOTR tee, searches for a seat.  He spots
           Martin, wearing a Star Trek tee.  The two lock eyes and squint
           at each other.  A beat then Martin offers up a seat.  

           As they start to eat, they each pull out a tab of LACTAID. 
           They nod solemnly at each other.  Lactards, unite.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Some of us learned the ancient art
                        of not getting our asses kicked.

           INT. FANTASY CLUB CLASSROOM -- DAY

           LOUIS, in a white gi and a PURPLE BELT, demonstrates a self-
           defense move on Howard to rows of dorks on exercise mats. 

                                 LOUIS
                        You want to grab, twist and push. 
                        Pair off and give it a try.  

           Everyone starts practicing.  Sugar and Martin, who are
           adjacent, glance at each other, then hesitantly pair off. 
                                 MARTIN
                        So, I'll try not to --

           Sugar grabs him and body slams him onto the mat.  Martin
           sputters.  He looks up at Sugar impressed as she glares. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Some of us combined forces to design
                        innovative solutions to age-old
                        problems.  

           INT. VIDEO GAME CLUB - DAY

           Carmen and her GAMERS lecture people on battlefield tactics
           as she points to a blueprint of the school with a stick.

                        If you get in trouble, head for these

                            (thwacking map)
                        Do not get isolated in these chokes
                        points where you will get pinned. 
                        But if you do, that's the time to
                        activate Howard's alert system.

           She glances at Howard who nods.  People scribble down notes.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        And slowly, things began to actually
                        change. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           A TINY FRESHMAN closes his locker as THREE JOCKS corner him. 
           He grabs his iPhone and presses a GIANT RED BUTTON. 

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Several MISFITS, feeling their phones vibrate, take them
           out.  A RED ALARM flashes "ALERT" with a GPS hallway location.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           At the end of the hallway, a SHADOWY FIGURE appears and begins
           RUNNING (like, weirdly full speed) towards the jocks, a CLOAK
           billowing behind him.  The shadowy figure arrives --

           It's Louis.  The jocks laugh.  Louis KARATE CHOPS one in the
           neck then makes a ninja "come hither" hand motion.  The Jocks,
           furious, go after him, who leads them round a corner to --

           An virtual MISFIT ARMY, led by Carmen.  The Jocks stop short. 
           INT. SCHOOL STAIRWELL - DAY

           A FUTURE STRUGGLING MODEL approaches a GEEK with her homework. 
           He puts his hand out.  She reluctantly produces a debit card.  

           The geek swipes her card on an iPhone.  A RECEIPT prints
           from a mobile printer he wears like a fanny pack.  He offers
           it to the model, who gives him the FINGER and walks.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

           Rick scores a touchdown against the opposition, but only
           Whitney and her crew are in the stands.   

                                 PRITHI
                        Where IS everyone?

           INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

           A DEBATE NERD stands at a podium arguing.  As he finishes,
           the audience goes wild.  Every seat is filled.  The SCHOOL
           MARCHING BAND, crammed in the aisle, plays a celebratory
           tune.  The other school's team looks on in awe. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        And once the outcasts became a united
                        front, the rest of the school fell
                        like dominoes.  Political power?

           INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Principal Whitmore stands in front of the student body.

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Sooo let's give a hand to your new
                        student government.

           The student government stands -- Carmen, a MINIATURE BLACK
           GIRL with thick glasses, and a sad looking EMO KID.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Check.  Gym class reform?

           INT. GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Two team captains -- a GOTH GIRL and TINY ASIAN BOY have
           picked teams leaving only the MEAN JOCKS and POPULAR KIDS.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Check.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Dork was the new popular.
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Whitney, Prithi and Mackenzie are forced to squeeze through
           the crowded hallways that used to part like the Red Sea.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           The cafeteria is now a utopia.  Tables co-mingle, share notes,
           laugh and more.  The five girls sit at a central lunch table. 
           Surveying their work, they exchange smiles.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        We had just pulled off the bloodless
                        coup of the century and it was --

           NEW ANGLE:

           Whitney and her crew sit in the corner of the lunch room.

                                 PRITHI
                        Far-reaking bullshit.  I feel like
                        that Rosa Parks lady when they made
                        her sit on the back of the bus.

                                 RICK
                        Dude.  Spoiler alert. 

                                 COLIN
                        Yeah, something weird is going on.

                                 WHITNEY
                        What tipped you off?  The empty
                        football games?  Our special Olympics
                        student government?  Or the fact
                        that you're all failing science now?

                                 PRITHI
                        Chill, Whitney.  It's probably just
                        a phase or something.  Like, I heard
                        Mercury is supposedly going retrograde --

                                 WHITNEY
                        What is law number 5?

           Mackenzie scrambles for her copy of 48 Laws of Power.

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        Much depends on your reputation. 
                        Guard it with your life.  Get it
                        now?  We ARE our reputation.  So
                        right now, I'd say it's pretty clear
                        that we are --

           Whitney is hit in the head with a piece of TOAST, flicked by
           a KID from an adjacent table.  
           The Kid looks at Whitney, terrified.  Rick picks up the toast,
           and takes a bite.

                                 RICK
                        Mmmm.  Toast. 

           Dave laughs, amused.  Whitney just glares, scary calm.

                                 WHITNEY
                        The thing about power is, if you
                        don't have it, someone else does. 
                        So you say "phase," I say
                        insurrection.  And if Stalin taught
                        us anything, the only response to
                        insurrection is to crush it.  Quickly.  

           They regard her, a bit scared. 

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        One day I will be in a place where
                        power isn't determined by acned
                        suburban subliterates, but in the
                        meantime, I have to cater to these
                        morons, who apparently think they
                        can just pretend they're popular. 
                        But here's the thing -- at the end
                        of the day, we're better looking, we
                        dress better, and we have more money. 
                        Except you Dave.  And those are the
                        things that give you power in high
                        school.  So we're throwing a party. 
                        And let's see how long these losers
                        want to go to debate tournaments
                        when they have the carrot of real
                        popularity dangled in front of them. 
                        And now for the stick.  Mackenzie --

           Whitney nods to the boy who hit her with toast by accident.  

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        Patsy Cline. 

           Mackenzie walks towards Toast Boy.  She crosses behind him,
           slipping something unseen into his backpack.  Off Mackenzie's
           cue, Whitney crosses to the SECURITY GUARD talking to him in
           mock concern as she points in Toast Boy's direction.   

           The Security Guard crosses to Toast Boy, grabs his backpack
           and pulls the WEIRDEST PORNO MAGAZINE EVER out of it.  Off
           Toast Boy sputtering in shock as everyone stares at him -- 

           EXT. JODI'S HOUSE - DAY

           Jodi stands before the mailbox with a large MANILA ENVELOPE
           in her hand.  She looks at the envelope addressed to -- 
           NEW YORK CITY PERFORMING ARTS SCHOOL, ADMISSIONS OFFICE. 

           Jodi takes a deep breath, and drops the envelope in.  

           INT. MINDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy alternates holding two MIT SWEATSHIRTS up to herself
           in front of the mirror.  They're practically identical, but
           you'd think she were picking an outfit for the Oscars. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Mindy sits across from the FEMALE INTERVIEWER (late 30s), a
           leather jacket type with a slight air of rebellion.  She
           looks bored out of her mind.

                                 MINDY
                        And in tenth grade I received second
                        place at the state science fair for
                        my project "Isotropic Versus
                        Anisotropic Materials: The Effect -- 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Let me just stop you there.  It's
                        obvious you're a very talented
                        scientist, good grades, good test
                        scores.  But what makes you special? 
                        What makes you tick?

           Mindy doesn't say anything, stumped. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (CONT'D)
                        Like when I was at MIT, I was a member
                        of the Hacks.  Learned more from
                        pulling off those pranks than any
                        class I took. 

                                 MINDY
                        Well, as I mentioned, I am president
                        of our high school's science club. 
                        I'm also a National Merit Scholar...

           The Interviewer sits back disappointed. 

           INT. RECORD STORE - DAY

           Jodi sifts through a record bin stopping on a Bowie album. 

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        And I thought I was the only person
                        under 60 who came to this place. 

           Jodi looks up to see Dave holding a record.  He points to
           the Bowie album.
                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        That one's awesome.  You should
                        totally get it. 

           She looks at him skeptically then glances at his record.   

                                 JODI
                        What's that?  Smash Mouth? 

           He shows her the album -- it's an old Carol King album.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        You like Carol King?

                                 DAVE
                        Um... yeah.  I used to listen to her
                        in the car with my mom all the time. 
                            (singing)
                        You make me feel like a nat-ur-al
                        woman...
                            (beat)
                        Who can't relate to that?

           She smiles despite herself.  Then she shakes her head. 

                                 JODI
                        Look, I don't know what you're trying
                        to do, but you can stop with the
                        whole nice guy routine.  Let's not
                        forget that last time I saw you, you
                        and your friends orchestrated the
                        most humiliating moment of my life.

           She movies away from him to another bin.  He follows. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hold up.  First of all, I did not
                        know that was going to happen.  And
                        second of all...
                            (searching)
                        ...it wasn't that humiliating.
                            (off her look)
                        Okay, I'm surprised you didn't
                        transfer schools.  But on the positive
                        side, that eczema song?  Ridiculously
                        catchy.  Any chance you can write
                        one about rickets for my grandpa?

           She is again charmed despite herself.  She looks him over. 

                                 JODI
                        I don't get it.
                                 DAVE
                        Rickets?  I think it's usually caused
                        by a vitamin D deficiency --

                                 JODI
                        No, I mean... you seem like you, you
                        know, have at least a modicum of a
                        soul, and aren't a completely heinous
                        human being --

                                 DAVE
                        Aw shucks, thanks.

                                 JODI
                        How can you hang out with Whitney? 

                                 DAVE
                        Trust me, I know how awful Whitler
                        can be.  But Colin and I have been
                        friends since second grade.  What am
                        I supposed to do?  Not everyone has
                        the guts to stage a full scale
                        rebellion against Cruella de Vil. 

           Jodi can't help smile at the compliment.  He regards her.   

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        And for what it's worth, I'm glad
                        you didn't transfer schools.  

           They exchange smiles.  A cute moment. 

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Soooo, I'll see you round.  Soon. 
                        Like.  At school.  Because that's
                        where we both go.  

           He heads off, then turns and points to the record bin.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Bowie totally made weird awesome.

           He exits.  Jodi smiles as she watches him.

                                 MINDY  (V.O.)
                        Ah, young love.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Really?

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Samuels sits grading papers.  Mindy enters, excited.  
                                 MINDY
                        Hey, Mr. Samuels!  I had my interview
                        yesterday.  I think it went really
                        well.  Did you... hear anything?

           Mr. Samuels smiles a little weakly and shakes his head. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Amy just said you seemed very...
                        competent. 

           Mindy nods relieved.  Les Whitmore pops in. 

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Hey, sweater vest, do I need to get
                        a chaperone in here for you two?

           Mr. Samuels shakes his head in distaste but doesn't respond.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Can I help you, Mr. Whitmore?

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Yeah, I need those reports on my
                        desk by noon.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        I put them in your inbox yesterday. 

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        I said on my desk, not in my inbox. 
                        I hope your students follow directions
                        better than you do. 

           Just then Louis, wielding a plastic broad sword, and Martin,
           wielding a double lightsaber, duel past the doorway as people
           follow and cheer them on.  Mr. Whitmore does a double take. 

                                 LES WHITMORE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus.  It's like Pandora's Box opened
                        up and it was full of losers. 
                            (back to Samuels)
                        Those reports, on my desk.  Today. 

           As Whitmore heads off, Mr. Samuels glances at Mindy, a bit
           embarrassed.  Mindy looks at him with sympathy.  He shrugs. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Every scientist needs an arch nemesis. 
                            (off her grin)
                        He's right though.  The school has
                        been different lately.  You have
                        anything to do with that?
                                 MINDY
                        I can neither prove nor disprove
                        this hypothesis.

           He smiles as she tries, but fails, to conceal her pride. 

           INT. THE GIRLS' BEDROOMS - NIGHT

           FIVE-WAY SPLIT SCREEN SKYPE CONVERSATION:

           The five girls are on a five-way video call.  Behind Mindy
           is her Einstein poster.  Behind Jodi, Tina Fey.  Behind
           Claire, the Girl Scout motto.  Behind Sugar, a Gloria Steinem
           / Phyllis Shlafly poster.  Behind Virginia, The Scream. 

                                 MINDY
                        Did you see how many people came out
                        for mathletes?  

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Even the goths are starting to look
                        kind of happy. 

                                 JODI
                        We should do something to celebrate
                        how awesome we are.

                                 CLAIRE
                        How about a party?  I make a mean
                        bundt cake and iced tea. 

                                 SUGAR
                        Slow down, Betty Crocker.  You don't
                        want to get us all arrested. 

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, a party.  But on our terms. 
                        Not some lame kegger.  Something
                        people will talk about for years to
                        come.  

           The girls nod in excitement.  Mindy's wheels are turning --

                                 MINDY
                        Three words.  Science.  Lab. 
                        Equipment. 

           EXT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Two FLUORESCENT LIQUIDS are poured from BEAKERS into the top
           of a FLUX CAPACITOR ICE LUGE.  The liquids merge and combine
           at the base of the Y, then pour into MINDY's open mouth. 

                                 PARTYGOERS
                        Mindy!  Mindy!  Mindy!
           The party is in full-swing.  Martin raises the beakers.

                                 MARTIN
                        1.21 gigawatts of power!  Next up!

           NEW ANGLE:

           A STUDENT wearing a motorcycle helmet gallops on a MINIATURE
           HORSE with a HOMEMADE SHIELD and LANCE...

           SMASH!  He's knocked from his horse by his JOUSTING OPPONENT
           as people cheer, going crazy.  Louis equips the next opponent. 

           NEW ANGLE:

           Howard and other students play BEER PONG, but using ELABORATE
           RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINES.  Howard calibrates his machine, then
           sets the ball in.  After going through the series of
           mechanisms, the ball lands in the other side's CUP.

           INT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The inside of the house is equally packed.   

           INT. MAKEOUT ROOM - VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A FEMALE NERD and a MALE NERD nervously sit on opposite ends
           of a couch.  They sneak furtive glances at each other. 

                                 MALE NERD
                        You wanna?

                                 FEMALE
                            (beat; coquettish)
                        Okay.

           They reach for VIDEO GAME CONTROLLERS.  A WORLD OF WARCRAFT
           style game is on the TV SCREEN in front of them.  The Nerds
           make their AVATARS kiss.  A PARTYGOER walks in and sees the
           screen.  He backs out. 

                                 PARTYGOER
                        My bad, sorry. 

           EXT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Mindy, Jodi, Claire, Sugar and Virginia observe the party. 
           Nearby, Carmen leads a rousing game of LASER TAG. 

                                 JODI
                        This is the greatest party in the
                        history of the world. 

           They all nod. 
           EXT. BACKYARD - COLIN'S MANSION - NIGHT

           Whitney and her crew hang out.  The party is completely dead. 
           Whitney fumes.  Prithi hits on a bored Rick. 

                                 PRITHI
                        With your looks and athletic ability,
                        and my fashion sense and personality,
                        it's just a complete waste for us
                        not to date.  We're total shoo-ins
                        for celebrity couple status.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Whitney and Colin are already the
                        school's celebrity couple. 

                                 PRITHI
                        There's room for more than one.  Me
                        and Rick would be the Posh and Becks
                        to Whitlin's Brangelina.   

           Dave lies on a beach chair tossing a ball up and down. 

                                 DAVE
                        So would you and Rick have a celebrity
                        couple nickname?

                                 PRITHI
                        Duh.  Prithi and Rick.  Pri --

           She stops short realizing what she's about to say.  

                                 DAVE
                        Prick. 

           Prithi glares as Rick and Colin guffaw.  Whitney's had enough.

                                 WHITNEY
                        Where the hell is everyone?

           Colin tries to rub Whitney's back.  She hits his hands away. 
           Prithi gets a text.  A bit sheepish --

                                 PRITHI
                        I think everyone's at the lame party.

           Whitney is about to blow a gasket.  Dave laughs to himself.

                                 DAVE
                        That's awesome.

           Whitney grabs the ball mid-air as he tosses it.

                                 WHITNEY
                        WHAT.  IS.  YOUR.  PROBLEM?
           Dave stands.  Colin prays to Dave with his eyes to say
           nothing.  Nope, not this time.

                                 DAVE
                        YOU.  SUCK.  I think I'm gonna check
                        out that "lame" party.  Plus, I heard
                        the hosts aren't, you know --
                            (to Whitney)
                        TOTAL SOCIOPATHS.

           He leaves.  Nobody knows what to say.  

                                 RICK
                        I'm gonna go to that other party. 
                        Sounds like there are girls there. 

                                 PRITHI
                        Um, hello. 

                                 RICK
                        I've already made out with you and
                        Mackenzie.  And Whitney scares me.

                                 PRITHI
                        Someone should probably check it out
                        to, like, do some double agent
                        shenans.  I mean, right?

           Prithi stands and runs after Rick.  Colin tries to follow
           but is stopped cold by Whitney's laser beam eyes.  

           EXT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Virginia inhales from a gas mask.  The mask is connected to
           a small gas tank.  Mindy, Jodi, and other party-goers watch.

                                 MINDY
                        This is my own personal homemade
                        blend.  A dash of nitrous oxide, a
                        dash of sodium thiopental, a dash of
                        genius.  Effects: decreased
                        inhibitions, increased veracity, and
                        occasional cachinnation -- that's
                        laughter for you non-Latin speakers.

           Virginia removes the mask, deadpan as always. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        You're right.  I do feel the vague
                        urge to laugh. 

                                 MINDY
                        It's still a work in progress.  
           The mask is passed to a NERDY TYPE-A GIRL.  She puts it to
           her face then quickly removes it. 

                                 NERD GIRL
                        Will this help me study?

                                 MINDY
                        Maybe.

           She puts the mask to her face then removes it again.

                                 NERD GIRL
                        Is this FDA approved?

                                 MINDY
                        This isn't a street drug.  It's
                        science.

                                 JODI
                        So is meth. 

           Just then Dave approaches.  

                                 DAVE
                        Meth.  I knew I picked the right
                        party.

           Jodi is surprised but happy to see him. 

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        So I may have just told Whitney off. 

                                 JODI
                        Oh my god.  Tell me everything.

           She pulls him away.  Mindy turns with the gas mask. 

                                 MINDY
                        Jodi.  Your --

           Mindy sees Jodi and Dave walking off. 

           INT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Claire and Sugar hang on the couch.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        So Mr. Whitmore gave you 2 months
                        detention for protesting the summer
                        reading list?  I always heard it was
                        because you threw a flash bomb into
                        glee club. 

                                 SUGAR
                        Nah, that was just a rumor I started. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        We should organize a protest!

                                 SUGAR
                        What do you know about protesting,
                        Pollyanna? 

                                 CLAIRE
                        I know you think the Girl Scouts are
                        silly, but the whole point is to
                        empower girls so we can change the
                        world.  You know, Gloria Steinem,
                        Hillary Clinton and Sandra Day
                        O'Connor were all Girl Scouts.  

           Sugar regards her. 

                                 SUGAR
                        Maybe you're not as Brady Bunch as
                        you seem. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        And maybe you're not as scary.

           They exchange a smile.  

                                 SUGAR
                        I'm gonna get a drink.  Want anything?

           Claire shakes her head.  Sugar crosses to Virginia's BLACK
           BUTLER who stands holding a tray of smoking beverages in
           TEST TUBES.  Behind him there is a STATUE OF A BLACK BUTLER.  

           NEW ANGLE: 

           Rick enters, followed by Prithi.  He scouts the room and
           spots Claire sitting sweetly alone.  Easy prey.  He crosses
           and sits next to her turning on the charm.  Prithi follows.

                                 RICK
                        Hey.

                                 CLAIRE
                        Hi! 

           Prithi scowls.  Rick is thrown by Claire's obliviousness.

                                 RICK
                        So are we gonna make out now?

           Claire sputters, blushing furiously. 

                                 RICK (CONT'D)
                        I mean you're hot, I'm hot, and it's
                        a party.  What's the problem?
           Claire doesn't know what to say, totally uncomfortable.  He
           looks at her expectantly.  Finally --

                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm gay. 

                                 PRITHI
                        You are?

                                 CLAIRE
                        Well, I mean sort of... I guess it
                        depends on... I mean...  Yes.  I am. 

           Silence.  Prithi looks her over a long moment.

                                 PRITHI
                        That's so cool.  Gay is totally the
                        new straight.  And bi is so five
                        minutes ago.  Oh my god, you know
                        what we should do?!  Threesome!

           Claire looks horrified.  Sugar comes up.

                                 SUGAR
                        I think the lady said she wasn't
                        interested.  Come on, Claire. 

           Claire, relieved, leaves with Sugar.

                                 RICK
                        So wait, is that a no?

           INT. SALON - VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jodi and Dave enter the empty room.  They're both a bit tipsy. 

                                 JODI
                        You have to admit we totally beat
                        you.  Our party is way better. 

                                 DAVE
                        Agreed.  Though I always thought I'd
                        be better at jousting. 

           Jodi smiles.  A beat. 

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Write any new songs lately?

                                 JODI
                        I just wrote one in my head called
                        "Our Party is Better Than Your Party."

           Dave smirks.  Jodi becomes suddenly more shy. 
                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Actually, I am working on one now. 
                        It doesn't have a title yet, but...

           She looks at the GRAND PIANO in the corner.  She sits and
           plays, singing along a few lines.  She looks up, nervous. 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        That's all I have so far. 

                                 DAVE
                        It's great.  

           He comes and sits next to her on the piano bench. 

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        What if, for the chorus, you did
                        something like this --

           He plays a few chords and sings.  She looks at him, impressed.

                                 JODI
                        You play?

                                 DAVE
                        Just a little. 

           They look at each other, gazes locking. 

                                 JODI
                        That was really good...

                                 DAVE
                        Thanks...

           They move in for the kiss.  Mindy enters, interrupting them. 
           Mindy stops short as they abort --  

                                 MINDY
                        Oh.  Hey guys.  I was just going to
                        tell you they're reenacting the Battle
                        of Trafalgar in the pool.

           Dave and Jodi glance at each other, Jodi torn.

                                 DAVE
                        Cool.

           The moment over, they stand and follow Mindy out.  Awkward.

           INT. COLIN'S SUBURBAN - NIGHT

           Whitney and Colin slow as they approach Virginia's house. 
           They can tell it's epic even from afar.  Whitney seethes.
                                 COLIN
                        Why don't we just go in?

                                 WHITNEY
                        Is Rick's dumb rubbing off on you?

                                 COLIN
                        Whatever.  You're the one that started
                        this whole war.

           She squints evilly.

                                 WHITNEY
                        And I'll be on the one to finish it.  

                                 COLIN
                        Dude.  You're kind of creepy
                        sometimes.

           Whitney still just stares at the party.

                                 WHITNEY
                        Thank you.

           INT. VIRGINIA'S BUNKER - DAY

           The nerd leaders are assembled around the war table, Godfather
           style.  Mindy presides over the meeting. 

                                 MINDY
                        I think I speak for everyone when I
                        say that our party will go down in
                        history as one of the best -- nay --
                        THE best party of all time.

           Everyone claps.  

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Now, does anyone have anything they'd
                        like to bring to the council's
                        attention?  Upcoming events to
                        promote?  Seminar ideas?

           Claire raises her hand. 

                                 CLAIRE
                        Sugar and I did some research, and
                        it turns out 92.3 percent of the the
                        school library's collection are books
                        written by dead white males, so we
                        want to circulate a petition to -- 

                                 MARTIN
                        What about sabotaging the lacrosse
                        team?  Those guys have it coming.  
                                 LOUIS
                            (nods in shared trauma)
                        I'm still waiting for my arm hair to
                        grow back on my left arm. 

                                 MARTIN
                        A few drops of saline into the team's
                        water coolers and we could give them
                        all explosive diarrhea.

           The Kingpins nod eagerly in agreement.  Claire and Sugar
           look a bit deflated by the brush-off.  

                                 MINDY
                        Isn't that sinking to their level? 

                                 HOWARD
                        Every second we rest is a second our
                        competition catches up to us.  Do
                        you think Steve Jobs became the
                        greatest visionary of all time by
                        being satisfied with creating the
                        iMac?  No, he changed it up and went
                        on to create the iPod, then the
                        iPhone, then the iPod Touch, then --

                                 MINDY
                        Okay, I got it. 

           She's still uncertain.  She exchanges a look with Jodi.

                                 CARMEN
                        Come on, Mindy.  Unleash the Kraken. 

                                 MINDY
                        I guess a little explosive diarrhea
                        never hurt anyone.   

           The Kingpins cheer.  Jodi looks surprised, maybe a bit
           disappointed.  Virginia just observes the situation. 

           LATER:

           The meeting just adjourned, Mindy and Jodi come together. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Wanna play Settlers of Catan?

                                 JODI
                        I can't.  My dad's new "lady friend"
                        is coming over with her son so we
                        can all meet each other. 

                                 MINDY
                        Ah, cute.  A new mom and brother. 
                                 JODI
                        Shut up. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Sorry guys, you gotta clear out. 
                        You know how my parents feel about
                        organized labor.

           EXT. MINDY'S HOUSE - DAY

           Mindy arrives home on her bike and stops at the mailbox to
           retrieve the mail.  As she goes through it, she stops short --

           It's a letter from MIT ADMISSIONS.  Mindy stares at it, a
           bundle of nerves.  She opens it. 

           INT. JODI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Herb is a bundle of nerves as he checks himself in the mirror. 
           Jodi's putting the finishing touches on the perfect pot roast.  

                                 HERB
                        Part left or part right?

                                 JODI
                        Herb, it's been awhile since you've
                        dated so I feel the need to tell you
                        that at your age, women aren't super
                        concerned with the side you part
                        your hair on as much as they're
                        impressed you still have hair to
                        part.

           The door RINGS.  Herb's eyes go big.  Jodi walks to the door.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Relax.  Awkward doesn't suit you.

           She opens the door and steps into... Awkwardville.  Standing
           before her is CAROL, a plainly pretty middle-aged woman. 
           And besides her?  DAVE.  Holy holy.

           INT. MINDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy paces on the cell phone. 

                                 MINDY
                        Jodi, it's me.  Call me. 

           INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jodi's CELL PHONE VIBRATES on the counter with a new message.
           INT. JODI'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The four sit around the table.  Herb and Carol are totally
           smitten.  They hold hands and can't stop smiling at each
           other.  Jodi and Dave are silent and horrified.  

                                 HERB
                        So, I say to the kid, "Your package
                        is too heavy.  You'll have to add
                        more postage."  And the kid says,
                        "So, if I add more postage, it'll
                        get lighter?"

           He and Carol bust up, practically nose to nose.  Jodi kind
           of throws up in her mouth.  Dave fake laughs with them.

                                 DAVE
                            (to himself)
                        Kill me.  

                                 HERB
                        How about some Pictionary!?

           INT. MINDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy looks at the letter from MIT -- WAITLISTED. 

           INT. JODI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The group plays Pictionary.  Herb is drawing something that
           looks like a complete blob of nothing.

                                 CAROL
                        The Sound of Music!?

           He points -- got it!  She jumps up and they hug and jump.

           Jodi and Dave sit on the couch with a high pile of pillows
           placed between them as a barricade. 

                                 HERB
                        Okay, kids!  Your turn.

           Jodi rolls her eyes, takes the marker and walks to the board.

                                 CAROL
                        Don't forget to grab your clue.

                                 JODI
                        Goin' rogue, Carol.  

           Dave sighs and sits up.  She begins drawing a dark hole. 

                                 DAVE
                        Bottomless pit of despair. 
           She puts her finger on her nose to indicate that he got it
           right, drops the marker into the tray, and walks off.

                                 JODI
                        I'll start cleaning up.

           She walks towards the kitchen.  Dave goes after her.  

                                 DAVE
                        I'll help.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jodi roughly loads the dishwasher.  Dave approaches.

                                 DAVE
                            (loudly whispering)
                        What are we supposed to do?  

           Jodi thrusts a wet plate at him.

                                 JODI
                        Start drying.

           LAUGHTER erupts from the living room.  

                                 DAVE
                        What if they get married?

                                 JODI
                        Then we almost committed step-cest.

           A new level of horrorification registers on his face.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Hey, you're the one who went in for
                        the kiss.

                                 DAVE
                        No.  Way.  Your eyes were practically
                        undressing me!

                                 JODI
                        Undressing you?!  Are you serious?  
                            (mocking him)
                        Oh, let me just show you a few chords.

           Herb and Carol stumble in.  Aaand, they're holding hands.

                                 HERB
                        We're gonna go grab some ice cream
                        in town.  Wanna come?

                                 JODI
                        Oh, no.  You two lovers have fun.
           Herb and Carol canoodle their way out the front door.  As
           they do, Carol, yells back.

                                 CAROL
                        Be good kids.  Don't do anything we
                        wouldn't do!

           They both look at each other.  A beat.  Then they immediately
           start cleaning dishes.

           INT. MINDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy sits in bed morosely.  She looks down at her cell phone
           expectantly.  Nothing. 

           EXT./INT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT / LES WHITMORE'S CAR - DAY

           Les Whitmore spots Mr. Samuels walking to the school carrying
           a large MODEL of a MOLECULE.  Whitmore shouts at him --

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Nice balls, Samuels!

           Mr. Samuels just shakes his head.  Chuckling, Whitmore pulls
           into his parking spot.  He gets out and walks towards school. 
           Whitney sidles up, doing her best dutiful schoolgirl.

                                 WHITNEY
                        I don't want to get anyone in trouble,
                        Mr.  Whitmore, but I've come across
                        some, well, disturbing information
                        regarding one of our school clubs.

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        And what club would that be?

                                 WHITNEY
                        The Science Club.

           Whitmore stops in his tracks.  He glances at Mr. Samuels.

                                 LES WHITMORE
                            (to himself, pleased)
                        No shit.

           INT. LES WHITMORE'S OFFICE - DAY

           Mindy sits in pissed off defiance in front of Whitmore who
           pops Rolaids, fuming.  Mr. Samuels sits next to her.

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        You know, as an Eagles fan, I know
                        the sting of disappointment all too
                        well.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LES WHITMORE (CONT'D)
                        But this... this is a new level. 
                        Stealing chemicals and lab equipment
                        from the school?

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Mr. Whitmore, this must be a mistake.  

           Whitmore throws down a pile of BLOWN-UP PICTURES of the party. 
           Mr. Samuels looks through -- the luge made out of lab
           equipment, kids doing test tube shots, Mindy in a meth lab.  

                                 MINDY
                        Okay, that one's clearly photoshopped.

           Mr. Samuels looks at her in disappointment. 

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Well guess what, sweetie?  You're
                        out of Science Club.  Forever.  

           Mindy shakes her head and scoffs.  One more disappointment. 

                                 LES WHITMORE (CONT'D)
                        Hear that sound?  That's the sound
                        of your future deflating like a
                        goddamned life raft on the Titanic.

                                 MINDY
                        The Titanic's lifeboats weren't
                        inflatable.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        I'm sure we can work something out
                        here.  Mindy has always --

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Save it, Samuels.  You clearly don't
                        know how to control your students. 
                        You're suspended as head of Science
                        Club for the rest of the year.  

           Mr. Samuels's face drops as Mindy shoots up in her chair.

                                 MINDY
                        No, Mr. Whitmore.  Please.  Mr.
                        Samuels had nothing to do with it --

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        We're done here. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE WHITMORE'S OFFICE - DAY

           An upset Mr. Samuels and a chagrined Mindy exit.
                                 MINDY
                        Mr. Samuels...

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Not right now, Mindy.

           He turns and walks away from her. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mindy glumly loads books into her locker.  Jodi approaches.

                                 JODI
                        I've been looking for you all day. 
                        Oh my god, last night was like the
                        seventh circle of awkwardness.

                                 MINDY
                        I called you. 

                                 JODI
                        I'm sorry.  It was insane -- 

                                 MINDY
                        I got wait-listed at MIT. 

           A beat as Jodi figures out what to say.

                                 JODI
                        But... that's not possible.  There
                        must be a mistake.  I want names.

                                 MINDY
                        It doesn't matter.  

           As Jodi is about to reply, Dave approaches. 

                                 DAVE
                        Heyyy.  Soooo... how about last night? 
                            (to Mindy)
                        Did you hear?  Her dad, my mom -- 
                        dating. 

                                 MINDY
                        Wow.  Crazy.

                                 DAVE
                            (to Jodi)
                        And, sidenote, I think I know the
                        perfect song for your audition.

                                 MINDY
                        Audition?
                                 DAVE
                        Jodi's got an audition at the New
                        York School for the Performing Arts!

           Jodi grimaces as Mindy's goes from miffed to hurt.  

                                 JODI
                        Thanks, Dave.  I'll take it from
                        here. 
                            (to Mindy)
                        I was going to tell you.  It's no
                        big deal.  It's just an audition.

                                 MINDY
                        Of course it's a big deal.  I'm sure
                        you'll get in.  And good thing you'll
                        have Dave to help you with your
                        audition.

                                 JODI
                        Mindy, don't be mad --

           The BELL RINGS.  An awkward beat between them. 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        I'm that way. 

           Mindy nods in the other direction.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        We'll talk later, okay? 

           Mindy just nods.  She watches Jodi and Dave walk off.  As
           she heads in the other direction, she sees Whitney chatting
           at her locker with Prithi and Mackenzie.  Whitmore passes
           them and they have a quick exchange before he continues on.

           Mindy stops to watch, her gaze narrowing onto Whitney. 
           Whitney and Mackenzie see Mindy watching them. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Oh my god, she looks like she's about
                        to cry now that you got her kicked
                        out of science club.  You totally
                        broke her. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Law 42.  Strike the shepherd and the
                        sheep will scatter.  

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Straight back to you. 
                                 PRITHI
                        You guys are being super Gargamel
                        right now. 

           INT. WAR ROOM - VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - DAY

           CLOSE on Mindy as she paces giving a Patton-esque speech.  

                                 MINDY
                        The time has come and the truth cannot
                        be ignored.  The world is not fair. 
                        The world is not just.  There are
                        people who, despite our best efforts,
                        rise up to thwart ideas of fair play
                        and decency.  Who manipulate the
                        system.  Who thrive on cruelty and
                        injustice.  And those people must be
                        stopped.  We all know who I'm talking
                        about.  Whitney Bennett.  She has
                        been a scourge on this school for
                        too long, and so long as she retains
                        one ounce of influence and control,
                        there can be no true peace.  And so
                        she must be crushed.  Let us never
                        breathe another day under her reign. 

           The KINGPINS cheer in battle lust.  The girls look hesitant.   

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Jodi walks, passing two DORKS who are harassing a CUTE
           FRESHMAN.  Nearby, Howard bosses around his new intern.  On
           a nearby wall, a basketball poster has been vandalized.  

           A NERD HOARD rounds the corner led by Carmen and Louis. 
           Louis fake lunges with a karate move at a JOCK, who flinches. 
           Jodi shakes her head as she enters...

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - DAY

           Mindy combines smoking chemicals.  Jodi watches. 

                                 JODI
                        Soooooo... that speech yesterday. 
                        That was kind of intense.  

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah, well, if Whitney thinks we're
                        going to back down just because she
                        has Whitmore wrapped around her
                        finger, she has another thing coming.
                                 JODI
                        I guess I just thought things were
                        going really well before.  Why create
                        conflict when we don't have to? 
                            (beat)
                        Look, come over tonight.  We can
                        play Risk.  Get a chance to talk.   

           Mindy considers, uncertain.  She finally relents. 

                                 MINDY
                        You know I can't resist the game of
                        global domination.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mindy exits school at the end of the day.  As she heads to
           her bike, she sees Whitney with her crew...

           Mackenzie has organized a celebration for Whitney with various
           PRINCETON themed paraphernalia.  BALLOONS decorate the area
           saying CONGRATULATIONS and PRINCETON.  Mackenzie presents
           Whitney with an orange and black PRINCETON CAKE. 

           Mindy just stares at them.  Whitney turns and sees her. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Hey, Mindy.  Where's your MIT
                        sweatshirt?

           Mindy glares back at her.  It's on. 

           INT. VIRGINIA'S BASEMENT - DAY

           Mindy stands in front of Virginia and her wall of files.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Are you sure you want this?  

           Mindy hesitates a moment, then...

                                 MINDY
                        I want it. 

           Virginia gives a resigned smile and hands a file to Mindy. 
           It reads "WHITNEY BENNETT."  Mindy takes it greedily and
           opens it.  As she reads it, her eyes open wide in disbelief.

           INT. JODI'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jodi sits waiting by a set-up Risk board.  Herb passes by.

                                 HERB
                        Mindy's not coming?
                                 JODI
                        I don't know.  I guess not. 

           INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mr. Samuels deals with a rowdy class.  Suddenly, a CRACKLE
           sounds and the AV PA system lights up.  A video plays. 

           ON VIDEO: Black screen.  A NARRATOR speaks, the voice
           disguised ala Anonymous -- "anonymous" with a lisp, that is.

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        Brothers and sisters.  It is time to
                        open your eyes. 

           INT. ENGLISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Claire and Sugar glance at each other in confusion.

           ON VIDEO: WHITNEY'S SCHOOL PICTURE.  High school perfection.  

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        Whitney Bennett.  For four years,
                        she has ruled this school.  Money,
                        clothes, looks, family -- if you did
                        not meet her standards, you were
                        made to suffer.

           Pictures of Whitney with her friends flicker on the screen. 

           INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Whitney watches icily.  Prithi preens at a picture of herself.  

           ON VIDEO: The pictures have stopped on an image of Whitney
           riding in Colin's SUV.  The picture fades to black and white
           and a giant image of the word "LIES" is stamped on screens.

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        Well brothers and sisters, Whitney
                        Bennett is not who you thought. 

           INT. SPANISH CLASSROOM - DAY

           Jodi looks on in confusion.

           ON VIDEO: The image flickers to a PICTURE taken on a long-
           angle zoom -- Whitney entering a RUN DOWN TRAILER HOME.  

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        This is the real Whitney Bennett. 
           INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Everyone turns to Whitney in surprise.  Prithi tries to
           contain her schadenfreudic glee.  Whitney is stonily silent. 

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        The mother who works in fashion? 

           ON VIDEO: A PICTURE of an OVERWEIGHT WHITE TRASH woman hanging
           up laundry on the clothelines outside the trailer.

                        Only if this constitutes working in
                        the fashion industry. 

           The LIES STAMP comes down on the image.

                        Her father, the banker...  

           The image changes to a MIDDLE AGED MAN, beer belly and TRUCKER
           HAT, sitting in a LAWN CHAIR out front drinking beer. 

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                        Collecting unemployment for two years.

                        Her older brother attending Wharton?  

           The image changes to a 20-SOMETHING LOSER in a WIFE-BEATER.

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR (CONT'D)
                        Currently out on probation for
                        possession of methamphetamine. 

           The LIES STAMP comes down on the image. 

           INT. FRENCH CLASS - DAY

           Virginia watches the presentation, unreadable. 

           ON VIDEO: Whitney's picture is now polarized.  Her eyes GLARE. 

                                 ANONYMOUS NARRATOR
                        The truth is revealed.  The only
                        reason Whitney was always so intent
                        on exposing all of your weaknesses
                        was so you would never discover hers --
                        Whitney Bennett is white trash. 

           A huge WHITE TRASH stamp comes down on Whitney's face.
           INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

           You could hear a pin drop.  Everyone looks at Whitney. 
           Without a word, Whitney stands up and walks out of the room.  

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Jodi pulls Mindy into an empty classroom.

                                 JODI
                        Dude, what was that?

                                 MINDY
                        That was our victory over Whitney. 

                                 JODI
                        You do realize you just did the same
                        thing to her that she did to me? 

                                 MINDY
                        Yes.  Exactly.  It's called revenge. 
                        This is what you wanted.  I don't
                        get what your problem is.  We set
                        out to change things, and we did.  
                        Now the people calling the shots are
                        the ones who deserve to call them. 
                        It's not the people with the best
                        hair.  Or the most money.  It's the
                        smartest.  The most creative.  We
                        did it.  We won.

                                 JODI
                        Then how come it doesn't feel like
                        we won?  How come it feels like we're
                        becoming the things we used to hate? 

                                 MINDY
                        Look, my whole life, I played by the
                        rules.  Did my homework.  Colored in
                        the little bubbles with my number 2
                        pencil.  And what did it get me? 
                        Teased.  Tortured.  Ignored.  Wait-
                        listed.  You know what turning the
                        cheek gets you?  Two black eyes.  

                                 JODI
                        The old Mindy --

                                 MINDY
                        The old Mindy was a stupid pushover
                        who thought she was going to go to
                        MIT, perfect the hydrogen fuel cell,
                        and get an element named after her. 
                                 JODI
                        There's nothing dumb about dreaming.

                                 MINDY
                        Well, I'm awake now.

           They both look at each other.  Impasse.

                                 JODI
                        If this is what it is, I'm out.  

           Jodi walks away.  Mindy watches her go, her face hardening --

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           The hallways are crammed with students.  Suddenly, a path
           clears as students make way for...

           Mindy and the Kingpins.  They stride (and wheel) their way
           down the hall.  There's a new sheriff in town.  

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           Jodi, Sugar, Virginia, and Claire sit at a new lunch table. 
           Mindy and the Kingpins have staked their claim on the table
           that used to be theirs together.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        So we had succeeded in creating a
                        New World Order at Richard Millhouse
                        Nixon High School.  

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And it blew.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        That's a little extreme. 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        What?  It's true.  Turns out the
                        only thing worse than pretty people
                        with too much power is ugly people
                        with too much power.   

           Prithi walks towards her lunch table dressed in her usual
           trendy, gawdy chic.  From one table over we hear:

                                 RANDOM DORK
                        Dude, look.  She's wearing 7 Jeans.

                                 RANDOM DORK 2
                        They look more like 12's to me.

           They laugh and pound fists.  Elsewhere, UPPERCLASSMEN GEEKS
           throw food at FRESHMAN.  JOCKS sit alone.  
           Back at the girls' table, everyone eats in silence.  The
           depression is palpable.

                                 JODI
                        This sucks. 

                                 SUGAR
                        I told you we should have just burned
                        this mother down.

           Virginia sits reading Human All Too Human by Nietzsche.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Here, here.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        Has anyone seen Whitney?

                                 SUGAR
                        She's been absent all week.

           They all contemplate this in silence.  Jodi's eyes rest on
           the table where Whitney would normally sit.

           EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Mindy walks down the hall as people step out of her way. 
           But she doesn't look happy.  She stops at her locker. 
           Mackenzie approaches.  Mindy looks at her in surprise. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I'm going to cut right to the chase. 
                        I intend to rule this school next
                        year, but the only way you become
                        the best is by working for the best. 
                        I thought that was Whitney.  But
                        apparently I was wrong.  I can't say
                        I think much of your fashion choices,
                        but I think you've got a lot to teach
                        me, and I'd like to offer my services
                        as your intern for the rest of the
                        school year.  

           A beat, then Mindy shakes her head in disgust and walks away. 

           EXT. WHITNEY'S TRAILER PARK - DAY

           Jodi rides her bike up to a trailer.  She stops, not sure
           how to proceed.  She turns, looking around the yard and sees --

           Whitney sits alone in a broken, gutted car.  Jodi approaches. 
           Whitney glances at her, then turns away. 
                                 JODI
                        Look, I want to apologize.  I didn't
                        know Mindy was going to do that.

                                 WHITNEY
                        Whatever.  Fine.

           Jodi tries to join her in the car but the passenger door is
           rusted shut.  Jodi climbs into the open back seat.  She looks
           around, noting their odd configuration

                                 JODI
                            (in Miss Daisy voice)
                        Mr. Coburn, won't you take me to the
                        Garden Club for a mint julep? 

           Whitney just shoots her a withering look.  Jodi smiles weakly.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        I never meant for things to go down
                        like that. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Oh, come on.  Don't tell me you aren't
                        loving this.  

                                 JODI
                        Fair enough.  But look on the bright
                        side.  It's all out in the open now. 
                        Nobody likes having to carry around
                        secrets.  Right?  So in a way, now
                        you're free.

                                 WHITNEY
                        And cue violins.

                                 JODI
                        Look, let's not forget that you did
                        pretty much the same thing to me. 
                        And did I go into hiding?

                                 WHITNEY
                        Yeah, but look at your wardrobe. 
                        Your bar for humiliation was already
                        so high.

           Jodi just shakes her head and moves to get out.

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        No, wait.
                            (Jodi pauses)
                        I'm so --

           She chokes on her own words. 
                                 JODI
                        Were you just trying to apologize?

                                 WHITNEY
                        It just gets stuck in my throat, you
                        know?  But you're right, okay?  I
                        know you're right.  

           A beat.  This is odd.  Then -- 

                                 JODI
                        I'll see you tomorrow then?

           Whitney nods, appreciative.  With a last nod, Jodi gets out
           and heads off.  

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Mindy sits at the head of the table with the Kingpins. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Prom is almost here and we still
                        don't have a theme, so I'd like you
                        to rally your various factions to
                        support my proposal --

                                 CARMEN
                        Is the theme Carrie?  I vote for
                        Carrie.  

                                 HOWARD
                        Support my bid for prom king, I'll
                        vote for whatever theme you want.

                                 LOUIS
                        Wait.  I'm running for prom king.

                                 CARMEN
                        I thought we were letting Colin win
                        so we could prank him.

           Mindy watches them as they squabble.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        As I sat there listening, I realized
                        how ridiculous it all was -- bickering
                        over who was going to be prom king
                        of a school that three months ago
                        they couldn't wait to leave.  We had
                        pretended we cared about coming
                        together, but in the end, it had all
                        been a lie, and everyone only cared
                        about themselves.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MINDY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Which was fitting, since when you
                        think about it, most of high school
                        is a lie.  Everyone faking it, trying
                        to act cooler or older or smarter or
                        just more sure of themselves than
                        they really are.  And I couldn't
                        help but think, wouldn't it be nice
                        for once if people just told the
                        truth?

           Mindy sits in a tinted out black on black Mercedes SUV.

                                 MINDY
                        And that's the plan.

           Mackenzie sits next to her in the driver's seat.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        So you're going to drug prom?

                                 MINDY
                        It's not a drug.  It's just a very
                        mild form of a truth serum in gaseous
                        form.  Think of it like a smart
                        person's version of spiking the punch. 

                                 MACKENZIE
                        I'm totally fine with you drugging
                        prom. 

           Gee, great.  Mackenzie glances at Mindy. 

                                 MACKENZIE (CONT'D)
                        So what changed your mind about
                        working with me?

           Mindy considers for a moment. 

                                 MINDY
                        At least you're honest about what
                        you want.  I'll see you on Saturday.

           Mindy gets out of the car...

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           And joins the hoards of students heading into school. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Jodi is at her locker.  Whitney approaches.  Jodi cowers
           instinctively.  She catches herself and straightens up.
                                 JODI
                        Sorry, habit.

                                 WHITNEY
                        So are you going to prom tomorrow?

           Jodi just keeps staring.  Whitney snaps in her face. 

                                 WHITNEY (CONT'D)
                        Come on.  Speed up the cycle of your
                        bewilderment.  Prom.  Are you going?

                                 JODI
                        Hell no.

                                 WHITNEY
                        You don't need a date to go to the
                        prom.  Did not having dates stop
                        Madeline Albright?

                                 JODI
                        The date.  The dress.  The revelry. 
                        I don't even know where to begin
                        with my hatred.  And don't say one
                        day I might regret it.  That's just
                        one of those things people say to
                        get you to do crap you don't want to
                        do.  "It'll build character." "If it
                        doesn't kill you."  "Just use your
                        hand."  No thank you.
                            (suddenly a bit sad)
                        Mindy and I always had a plan to do
                        a Star Wars marathon on prom night. 
                        Even the prequels. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        I get it.  It's just --

           She stops herself.

                                 JODI
                        What?

                                 WHITNEY
                        I had a chat with Mackenzie. 
                        Duplicitous little bitch is apparently
                        Mindy's intern now.  She wouldn't
                        tell me anything, but it sounds like
                        Mindy is planning some sort of crazy
                        prank at prom.  I guess she's not
                        done getting her revenge. 

           The BELL rings and Whitney heads off.  Jodi closes her locker,
           letting this sink in.
           INT. JODI'S HOUSE - DAY 

           Jodi sits disinterestedly watching Star Wars: Episode 3 -
           Revenge of the Sith on TV with Herb.  

                                 JODI
                        God, this movie is like evidence of
                        early onset Alzheimers.

           ON TV:

           The final battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin begins. 

                                 ANAKIN
                        If you're not with me, then you're
                        my enemy. 

                                 OBI-WAN
                        Only a Sith deals in absolutes.  I
                        will do what I must.

                                 ANAKIN
                        You will try. 

           They pull out their light sabers and go at it. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Mindy gets off her bike and looks around warily.  A 20-
           something, SKEEZY-LOOKING NERD gets out of a nearby car and
           looks her over.  He begins talking -- with a LISP. 

                                 SKEEZY NERD
                        Did you bring the payment?

           Mindy brandishes two TICKETS. 

                                 MINDY
                        Two Dragon Con tickets.  Now where's
                        the sodium thiopental?

           He opens the trunk to reveal two large CHEMICAL CANNISTERS. 
           He sets them on the ground.  Mindy hands him the tickets. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Pleasure doing business with you.

                                 SKEEZY NERD
                        You too. 

           He looks her over appreciatively.  

                                 SKEEZY NERD (CONT'D)
                        Nice lisp. 
                                 MINDY
                            (a bit flirty back)
                        Thanks. 

           INT. JODI'S HOUSE - DAY

           Jodi continues to watch the Star Wars scene but with a little
           more interest now.

           ON TV:

           Anakin and Obi-Wan fight on a hovercraft above molten lava. 

                                 ANAKIN
                        I should have known the Jedi were
                        plotting to take over. 

                                 OBI-WAN
                        Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil!

                                 ANAKIN
                        In my point of view, the Jedi are
                        evil!

                                 OBI-WAN
                        Well then you are lost!

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY

           Mindy waits with the canisters.  Mackenzie pulls up in a
           black Mercedes SUV and gets out.  They load in the canisters.

                                 MINDY
                        God, we are so Breaking Bad right
                        now. 

           INT. JODI'S HOUSE - DAY

           Jodi is now totally engrossed in the Star Wars battle. 

           ON TV:

           Obi-Wan stands above Anakin.

                                 OBI-WAN
                        It's over Anakin!  I have the high
                        ground. 

                                 ANAKIN
                        You underestimate my power. 

                                 OBI-WAN
                        Don't try it. 
           Anakin jumps and flips towards Obi-Wan.  Obi-Wan CHOPS OFF
           HIS LEGS.  Anakin screams in agony as he writhes on the floor.

           Jodi stares at the screen. 

                                 JODI
                        Shit.  I gotta go to prom. 

           Herb looks at her confused.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           The school is being set up for prom.  A SECURITY GUARD stands
           near the back entrance.  Mackenzie and Mindy sneak in behind
           him, rolling the cart of chemicals inside. 

           INT. JODI'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jodi frantically looks through her closet. 

                                 JODI
                            (shouting downstairs)
                        Dad!  Is there anything in mom's old
                        clothes I could wear?

           INT. JODI'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jodi stands in front of the mirror in a HIDEOUS PANT SUIT. 
           Think the worst of Hillary Clinton's 1990s wardrobe.  Jodi
           looks appalled, but there's no other option.  Herb peaks in.

                                 HERB
                        What a vision!  I just got off the
                        phone with Carol.  Dave doesn't have
                        a date either so she's going to bring
                        him over here so you guys can carpool!

                                 JODI
                        Daaaddd. 

                                 HERB
                        It's fine.  You're just carpooling. 
                        It won't be awkward at all. 

           INT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Jodi and Dave enter.  A GAWDY PHOTO SET stands between them
           and the gymnasium.  A PROM CHAPERONE approaches.

                                 PROM CHAPERONE
                        Alright, you two just hop on up there.
                            (off their protests)
                        Don't be silly!  Tonight only happens
                        once.
           He shoves them towards the seedy PHOTOGRAPHER who grabs their
           hands, thrusts them onto the platform, and steps back to
           take pictures.  They stand as far away as two people could.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Squeeze in a little bit.

           They barely move. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
                        Ok.  I need you both in the frame
                        and I need it now.  You -- guy --
                        grab her waist.  And you -- girl --
                        you smile like you like it when he
                        grabs your waist.

           They oh so awkwardly oblige.  He snaps.

           FREEZE FRAME: Worst.  Prom.  Photo.  Ever. 

           They step off the platform looking like POW's.  They take
           one look at each other and then head in opposite directions. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT

           A stretch limo arrives.  A dapper looking Rick emerges.  He
           turns and offers his hand to a MODEL BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

           Behind them, another HAND emerges waiting for Rick's
           assistance.  He doesn't notice.  The hand waits.  

                                 WHITNEY (O.S.)
                        It's not going to happen, Prithi.  

           An annoyed but still smiling Prithi emerges gracelessly. 
           She takes Rick's other arm.  He rolls his eyes but relents.

           Whitney and Colin exit behind them.  As they exit, Whitney
           pulls out her phone.  She has a new TEXT MESSAGE.

           ON PHONE:

           From Jodi -- "I'm coming to prom.  We have to stop Mindy."

           INT. PROM GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Jodi stands alone scanning the crowd for any sign of Mindy
           or something out of place.  Her phone buzzes.  A TEXT MESSAGE --

           From Whitney -- "Meet me in the hallway in 15."

           NEW ANGLE:

           Sugar and Claire mill around. 
                                 CLAIRE
                        What is this theme, anyway?

                                 SUGAR
                        The patriarchy.

           A Flo Rida song comes on.  Martin approaches Sugar.

                                 MARTIN
                        Ah.  Flo-rida.  May I ask for this
                        dance with the woman who taught me
                        his name wasn't Florida?

           Sugar looks uncertainly at Claire who nods to the dance floor. 

                                 SUGAR
                        Fine.  Whatever. 

           They depart.  Claire smiles after them. 

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           Mindy stands next to a CONTRAPTION consisting of three
           canisters feeding into each other through hoses.  One large
           hose emerges from the largest canister, which Mindy is FEEDING
           INTO THE OPEN CEILING above her.

           INT. AIR DUCT - NIGHT

           The hose inches down the duct, being fed from the other end.

           INT. PROM GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Mackenzie stands beneath and air vent.  She sees the end of
           the hose inch out.  Mackenzie puts her finger to her ear.

                                 MACKENZIE
                        Okay, stop.  We're good.

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           Mindy gets the message from Mackenzie.  She goes to the
           canisters.  A beat of hesitation, then she turns the nozzle. 

           INT. PROM GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The ripples of the gas start seeping into the room.

           NEW ANGLE:

           CLOSE ON: Whitney stands against the wall behind the
           bleachers.  She gets a text and looks at her phone.  

                                 WHITNEY
                        I gotta run. 
           Colin stands up from below the screen.  He gives her an
           incredulous look as she adjusts her dress and walks away.

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           Mindy stands before the gas contraption looking at her work. 
           She glances over the wall with framed PICTURES of the SCIENCE
           CLUB.  She looks at a picture of her in her MIT sweatshirt,
           smiling wide next to Mr. Samuels. 

           INT. PROM GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The effects of the truth gas are starting to kick in.  Two
           STUDENTS dance.  The girl is decent.  The guy, not so much.

                                 FEMALE STUDENT
                        You suck at dancing. 

           He pouts.  Then he gives the girl a petulant, childish shove. 

           NEW ANGLE:

           A JOCK comes up to Mr. Samuels, who chaperones, bored. 

                                 JOCK
                        Dude, Mr. Samuels, I totally cheated
                        on the science midterm.

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        Yeah, I know.  I just didn't want
                        you in my class another year. 

           NEW ANGLE: 

           Colin, Prithi, Rick and his date sit at a table.

                                 COLIN
                        Sometimes I start to think that
                        Whitney doesn't actually like me
                        that much, but then I realize that
                        would be impossible. 

                                 RICK'S DATE
                            (to Colin)
                        You're incredibly boring. 

                                 PRITHI
                        Is there any way to deny that all
                        human suffering originates from human
                        desire?  And thus, the only way to
                        end suffering, is to end desire? 
                        But the illogical and futile nature
                        of desire will inevitably win out
                        over our rational natures.  So we're
                        doomed to suffer.  
                                 RICK 
                        This punch is good. 

           NEW ANGLE:

           Jodi ladles punch.  She looks up to see Dave across from
           her.  They make eye contact, then can't seem to look away.

                                 DAVE
                        I find myself incredibly attracted
                        to you despite that pantsuit. 

                                 JODI
                        You're really sweet.  I wore matching
                        bra and panties just in case. 

           Off them staring at each other in lust --

           INT. JANITOR'S CLOSET - NIGHT

           Jodi and Dave furiously go at it. 

                                 JODI
                        Our babies would be so tall. 

                                 DAVE
                        You're a little flabbier than I
                        imagined. 

                                 JODI
                        You're exactly as flabby as I
                        imagined. 

           LATER:

           Jodi and Dave lay post-coital in their tuxedo and pant suit.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Thank God I'm not going to leave
                        high school a virgin.

                                 DAVE
                        Me too. 
                            (turns to her)
                        I really like you, you know. 

           She smiles, about to say something, but her phone goes off. 
           She looks at it. 

                                 JODI
                        Damn it, I gotta go. 
                            (kisses him)
                        I'll find you later. 
                                 DAVE
                        You promise?

           Jodi smiles. 

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Whitney waits in the hallway.  Jodi comes hurrying around
           the corner, trying to tidy herself up. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Where have you been?!

                                 JODI
                        I'm sorry.  I just lost my virginity
                        in the janitor's closet to my step
                        brother. 

           Whitney suppresses her gag reflex. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        We have to find Mindy.

                                 JODI
                        And before her plan goes into effect. 
                        God knows what she could do!  You
                        know, she's a really good chemist. 

           NEW ANGLE:

           From the other end of the hallway, Mindy stands watching
           Jodi and Whitney colluding.  Her face drops. 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           Whitney leads Jodi towards the science lab.  

                                 WHITNEY
                        Alright, think.  You used to be her
                        best friend.  If she were hiding
                        anywhere, where would it be?

           Jodi thinks.  She glances to the science lab door.  Epiphany.

                                 JODI
                        The science lab. 

           Jodi steps forward.  Whitney follows as Jodi opens the door.

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           They step into the room to find Mindy's contraption. 

                                 JODI
                        Oh my God.  What is this?
                                 WHITNEY
                        Do you think she's trying to poison
                        the school?

                                 JODI
                        I wouldn't put it past her at this
                        point.  
                            (examining contraption)
                        What does this thing do?

                                 MINDY (O.S.)
                        It exposes the truth. 

           They turn to see Mindy.  She shakes her head. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Nice.  Some best friend you are. 

                                 JODI
                        I'm sorry, is the person pumping
                        chemicals into the prom questioning
                        my integrity in this scenario?

                                 MINDY
                        Relax, it's just a prank.  I thought
                        it was about time we cut through all
                        the bullshit so we got to see who
                        people really were.  The truth is
                        out there.

                                 WHITNEY 
                        I told you you couldn't trust her
                        anymore.  

           Mindy looks at Whitney in disbelief, then turns to Jodi.  

                                 MINDY
                        I can't believe you.  This whole
                        year was supposed to be about me and
                        you standing up to Whitney and the
                        rest of the jerks.  And now you're
                        all of a sudden BFF with her?  I
                        feel like I'm in bizarro land.

                                 JODI
                        Yeah, no kidding.  Because honestly,
                        between you and Whitney right now,
                        Whitney is the one acting less like
                        an evil dictator. 

           Mindy scoffs, hurt.  She lashes back --
                                 MINDY
                        You're just pissed off that I was
                        the one who finally stood up to
                        Whitney and did what you've always
                        been too scared to do. 

           Jodi shakes just her head.  She looks at the contraption's
           on/off nozzle.  Mindy sees what she intends.  She steps
           between Jodi and the nozzle. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        If you're not with me, then you're
                        my enemy. 

                                 JODI
                        Only a Sith deals in absolutes.  I
                        will do what I must.

                                 MINDY
                        You will try. 

           Jodi lunges for the nozzle.  Mindy intercepts her.  Thus
           begins an epically inept nerd fight.  Mindy and Jodi slap,
           kick and pull at each other as Mindy keeps Jodi away.

                                 JODI
                        Whitney!  Turn off the gas!

           Whitney suddenly reverts to her old nonchalant disdain. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        No thanks. 

           With a smirk of victory, she strolls out of the room. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           As Whitney walks out, Mackenzie rounds the corner.  Whitney
           nods to her, and Mackenzie takes her place at Whitney's side.

           INT. SCIENCE ROOM - NIGHT

           Mindy and Jodi continue their struggle.  As Jodi tries to
           wrestle Mindy free, they SLAM into Mindy's contraption.  

           The CHEMICAL CANNISTERS come loose and topple to the floor,
           the CHEMICALS spilling out towards the doorway. 

           Mindy and Jodi push away from each other.  They glare, sizing
           each other up.  Mindy picks up a LASER POINTER.  She POINTS
           THE BEAM AT JODI'S EYES.

           Jodi shields her face, then hurls a FOAM MOLECULE at Mindy. 
           Mindy catches it and sets it down carefully.
           Mindy and Jodi face off again.  Then with a PRIMAL SCREAM,
           they run towards each other to engage in battle --

           INT. PROM GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The students have gathered around the front stage.  Whitmore
           stands at the mic.  The effects of the gas continue to show.  

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Ok, the votes are in for Prom King
                        and Queen, and your Prom King is... 
                            (opening card)
                        Louis Hammerschmidt.  Wow.  Really? 
                        You guys suck at this.  

           Louis springs onto stage.  Whitmore places the crown on his
           head.  Louis almost has an orgasm.  He steps up to the mic.

                                 LOUIS
                        My fellow classmates, I intend to
                        rule you all with an iron, but noble,
                        fist.  And to whoever my Queen is, I
                        trust you will bear me many sons --

           Whitmore cuts him off and moves him out of the way.

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        Settle down, Attila.  Okay, the Prom
                        Queen is... Claire Stewart.  
                            (somewhat sexual)
                        Now that's a Queen I could get behind.

           Ew.  Claire is surprised but flattered.  She walks onto the
           stage.  Whitmore crowns her and hugs her.  For way too long.

                                 LES WHITMORE (CONT'D)
                        Anything you want to say?

           She steps up to the mic and speaks to Mr. Whitmore.

                                 CLAIRE
                        I'm sorry about your hair loss.  And
                        I felt kind of funny about that hug --

           Whitmore steps in and cuts her off. 

                                 LES WHITMORE
                        And now let's let Beauty and the
                        Beast regale us with a dance.

           The MUSIC begins playing.  Louis and Claire dance in a
           painfully first-cousin platonic way.  Other students join. 
           Claire notices two JOCKS have started dancing together
           seductively.  She raises an eyebrow.  
           NEW ANGLE:

           Sugar and Martin dance together.  Sugar regards Martin.

                                 SUGAR
                        I find everything about you repulsive,
                        yet I'm strangely drawn to you.

                                 MARTIN
                        That's the nicest thing a girl has
                        ever said to me.  

           NEW ANGLE:

           Carmen sits in her wheelchair next to a disgruntled Howard.

                                 CARMEN
                        I've always wanted to pull a fire
                        alarm in a crowded room.

                                 HOWARD
                        You should do it.  Carpe diem.

           A beat then Carmen STANDS FROM HER WHEELCHAIR, WALKS TO THE
           SWITCH, AND PULLS THE FIRE ALARM.  The ALARM sounds.  She
           walks back to her chair and gets in.  Howard stares at her. 

                                 CARMEN
                        What?  You never asked.

           As the ALARM BLARES, there is a collective groan from the
           crowd, but everyone slowly begins to evacuate.

           INT. SCIENCE LAB - NIGHT

           The FIRE ALARM sounds as Mindy and Jodi wrestle on the floor
           in ridiculous fashion.  Jodi pushes Mindy's face into the
           ground as they finally register the alarm. 

                                 MINDY
                        Wait. 

           Jodi releases some of the pressure. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        I'm a fire captain.  I have to bring
                        out the first aid backpack. 

           Jodi considers then gets off her. 

                                 JODI
                        This isn't over. 

           Mindy stands and retrieves a first aid backpack as they
           continue to glare at each other.  
           Mindy slings the backpack over her shoulder and heads for
           the exit.  Jodi follows... 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           They speed walk towards the exit, still eying each other.

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Mindy and Jodi get outside.  The students are assembled out
           front.  Jodi looks to the ground and sees the CHEMICALS that
           have spilled from the lab and formed a TRAIL outside.  

                                 JODI
                        Dude, is this --

           Mindy swings the backpack at her, hitting her in the stomach. 
           And just like that it's back on, everything else forgotten. 

           NEW ANGLE:

           The students mill around bored.  Rick glances over and sees
           Mindy and Jodi fighting.  He chuckles to himself.  

                                 RICK
                        Nerd fight!

           Everyone rushes over to see the fight surrounding Mindy and
           Jodi, who roll on the ground, pulling each other's hair.

           Dave elbows his way to the front.  He watches not sure what
           to do as Mindy presses her forearm against Jodi's face. 

                                 DAVE
                        Do you need help?

                                 JODI
                        No!  I got this. 

           Dave watches helplessly as the two continue to go at it.  

           NEW ANGLE:

           Virginia pulls up on her Vespa in her prom dress.  She
           dismounts and walks to the crowd finding Claire and Sugar.  

                                 SUGAR
                        Where've you been?

                                 VIRGINIA
                            (lighting a clove)
                        In Europe proms don't start 'til 11. 

           Mindy and Jodi, exhausted from wrestling, break apart, then
           stand dusting themselves off.  Mindy pushes Jodi.  
           Then Jodi pushes Mindy.  Mindy pushes back. 

                                 MINDY
                        Say you're sorry.

                                 JODI
                        You say you're sorry. 

                                 MINDY
                        I'm not the one who's a traitor. 

                                 JODI
                        I'm not the one who's a psychopath. 

                                 MINDY
                        Yeah, well at least I'm not a liar! 
                        You didn't even tell me you were
                        applying to school in New York!

                                 JODI
                        Well I'm sorry, Mindy, but I don't
                        have to tell you every single thing.

                                 MINDY
                        Yes you do!  You're supposed to be
                        my best friend. 

                                 JODI
                        What did you want me to do?  Just
                        tag along with you forever?!  Why
                        couldn't you just be happy for me?

                                 MINDY
                        Because you lied to me!  And because
                        you were too busy trying to make out
                        with your new brother to even notice
                        when I needed you.  You knew how
                        much MIT meant to me. 

                                 JODI
                        He's not my brother!  And I'm sorry
                        that for once in my life I had a boy
                        who I thought was totally awesome
                        actually like me back --

                                 DAVE
                        You think I'm totally awesome?

           She turns to him, suddenly a bit shy. 

                                 JODI
                        Yeah.

                                 DAVE
                        Cool.
           She turns right back to Mindy, yelling again -- 

                                 JODI
                        And I'm really sorry that for once
                        in your life things didn't go
                        perfectly, but suck it up and deal
                        with it like the rest of us.  And by
                        the way, I looked it up, and Pakistan
                        has a Prime Minister and a President!

           Mindy considers this a moment in disbelief, then resumes --

                                 MINDY
                        Screw you, Jodi.  All those times
                        Whitney picked on you because you
                        couldn't keep your mouth shut, I was
                        right there alongside you.  I did
                        all of this for you.  And then you
                        just walked away from me. 

           Jodi regards her, not sure what to say. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Are you guys going to make out now?

           Jodi reels on her. 

                                 JODI
                        You know what, Whitney.  Shut up.  I
                        tried to defend you.  Even after all
                        the horrible crap you put me through,
                        I still tried because I was stupid
                        enough to feel bad for you.  

           Whitney scoffs. 

                                 WHITNEY
                        Do you really think that for one
                        second I actually cared what these
                        people thought of me?  High school
                        is over.  I'm getting the hell out
                        of here, away from these morons, and
                        never looking back.  I just wanted
                        you two to know before we all left,
                        that I'd won.  That I will always
                        win.  And that whenever I want, I
                        can take away that which you hold
                        most dear and crush it.

           Jodi and everyone just stare at her.  That was intense.  

                                 CLAIRE
                        That bitch crazy.

           Sugar just nods in agreement. 
                                 WHITNEY
                        And it barely took any push at all
                        to turn you two into Cain and Abel. 
                        Frankly, I think I did you a favor. 
                        Otherwise this little horror show
                        likely would have dragged on for
                        another few years before you two
                        just cut your losses and moved on.  

           Jodi and Mindy regard each other deflated.  A beat. 

                                 JODI
                        Maybe she's right.  

           Mindy scoffs, hurt and angry. 

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        It was stupid to think that we'd
                        stay friends after high school. 
                        We're both going to go off and do
                        our own thing, make new friends,
                        start new lives, and in ten years
                        we'll see each other at the reunion
                        and we'll smile and say hi.  Maybe
                        that's how it's supposed to be. 

                                 MINDY
                        If that's really how you see it,
                        then I guess we should just cut our
                        losses now. 

                                 JODI
                        It is how I see it. 

           Mindy just nods in hurt resignation.  They stand looking at
           each other -- this is the end.  Whitney looks on victorious.  

           Jodi turns to go.  Dave follows.  Everyone starts to disperse. 
           Claire, Sugar and Virginia look on sadly from the side. 

                                 VIRGINIA
                        And so it goes. 

           Virginia flicks her cigarette towards the school... 

           Beat. 

           BOOM!!!  THE SCHOOL EXPLODES. 

           Everyone SCREAMS and ducks.  After the initial scare, they
           stand to see the school in FLAMES.  Off their shock --
           EXT. RICHARD MILLHOUSE NIXON HIGH - DAY

           The school is now just a smoking field of rubble.  The only
           thing standing is the MINUTEMAN STATUE.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Once everything... exploded... nothing
                        was really the same.

           INT. JODI'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Jodi lays in her bed and stares out a window, depressed.

           INT. CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Claire sits amongst stuffed animals and stares out a window.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        As much as we'd hated parts of high
                        school, it was our home, too.

           INT. VIRGINIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

           Virginia sits in her windowsill, smoking a clove.  She goes
           to toss the butt into her mother's garden below, but then
           thinks better of it and stubs it out in an ashtray.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And without it, nobody knew what to
                        do with themselves.

           INT. ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON: Mindy staring dejectedly out a window. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        So mostly, we just stared out of
                        windows a lot, depressed.

           We PULL BACK to see Mindy's in JAIL.  She glances over to
           see her CELL MATE peeing on the ground.  Mindy grimaces. 

           INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The police release Mindy to her PARENTS.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        The police let me go, calling it a
                        fluke accident.  

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        As for the school, it turns out their
                        decision to invest in terrorism
                        insurance proved to be a fortuitous
                        one.  
           EXT. RICHARD MILLHOUSE NIXON HIGH - DAY

           Bulldozers clear the rubble as Mr. Whitmore stands with a
           BLUEPRINT of the new school design. 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And Mr. Whitmore was so excited about
                        being able to build the Les Whitmore
                        Amphitheater that he even let Mindy
                        finish out the year. 

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           Mindy stands on her bike taking in the remains of the school. 
           She sees Mr. Samuels walking to his car with a box of charred
           lab equipment.  He sees her and approaches.  A moment between
           them.  Mindy is sheepish and ashamed. 

                                 MINDY
                        I burned down the school. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                            (shrugs, deadpan)
                        It happens.

                                 MINDY
                        I disappointed you.  I disappointed
                        everyone. 

                                 MR. SAMUELS
                        I'm not saying it's okay what you
                        did, but I understand.  It's hard
                        feeling like you're giving your best
                        and people don't see you.  I know
                        people could look at me and think
                        here's a guy who went to MIT, and
                        he's wasting his life with a bunch
                        of kids who could care less about
                        science.  But here's the thing -- I
                        love my job.  And I love getting to
                        work with a student like you, who
                        has all the potential in the world. 
                        There are always going to be jerks. 
                        That doesn't change after high school. 
                        And you can spend your life trying
                        to beat them or prove them wrong or
                        get even with them, but it's just
                        wasted energy.  The important thing
                        is figuring out what's important to
                        you and fighting for that.  The rest
                        doesn't matter. 

           Mindy takes this in.  She nods, appreciative. 
                                 MINDY
                        Thanks, Mr. Samuels. 

           INT. JODI'S ROOM - DAY

           Dave watches as Jodi frenetically changes the strings on her
           guitar.  Finally, he puts his hand on hers, stopping her. 

                                 DAVE
                        Oh my god.  Are you diffusing a bomb
                        or stringing a guitar?  Relax.  You're
                        going to do great.

                                 JODI
                        You have to say that.

                                 DAVE
                        Actually, I don't.  I was born without
                        a filter gene.  Asshole, symplex 1.

                                 JODI
                        It just feels, I don't know.  I feel
                        nervous and empty at the same time. 
                        Is that possible?

           Jodi looks down.  Dave understands.

                                 DAVE
                        Of course.  She's your best friend.

                                 JODI
                        Was.

                                 DAVE
                        You should talk to her.

                                 JODI
                        I can't.  Not after what I said. 
                        It'll never be the same.

                                 DAVE
                        Did you think it always would be?

                                 JODI
                        Well, no...
                            (a beat, relenting)
                        Yes.  

                                 DAVE
                        I've said it before, and I'll say it
                        again -- 

           Jodi waits for a bit of Dave wisdom.
                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Girls are freaking craaaaaazy.

           Jodi throws a pillow at him.  They play fight.

           INT. MIT ADMISSIONS COUNCIL MEETING - DAY

           Several MIT TYPES including Mindy's INTERVIEWER sit at a
           table with piles of applications that they are going through. 

                                 MIT ADMISSIONS GUY 1
                        How about this guy?  He wrote a paper
                        on the sea snail that was published
                        in Scientific American.

                                 MIT ADMISSIONS GUY 2
                        We already let the sea cucumber guy
                        in.  Can't go too heavy on the aquatic
                        invertebrates.  

           The Interviewer opens up a manilla envelope addressed to her
           and pulls out its contents -- 

           NEWSPAPER ARTICLES with headlines like GEEKS UNITE and
           EXPLOSION AT RMNHS DETERMINED TO BE "PRANK GONE WRONG."  A
           letter is attached and signed by Mr. Samuels.  She smiles. 

           EXT. MINDY'S HOUSE - DAY

           Mindy walks to the mailbox and pulls out the contents.  She
           almost doesn't notice the LARGE MIT ENVELOPE.  

           Then she stops.  Double takes.  Drops the rest of the mail. 
           Rips open the envelope.  She's in!  She does a super
           uncoordinated VICTORY DANCE in her driveway.  

           INT. MINDY'S HOUSE - DAY

           Mindy goes for her phone.  Then she remembers.  There is no
           one to tell.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - NYC AUDITION HALL - DAY

           Jodi sits, a bundle of nerves.  An OPERA GIRL practices
           perfect operatic runs.  Jodi looks like she wants to vomit.  

           Mindy comes barreling towards her like a bat out of hell. 
           Jodi looks up.  Mindy arrives, panting heavily as if trying
           hold off an asthma attack.

                                 MINDY
                        I had to.  Catch you.  Before.  I
                        couldn't let.  The thing.  You go.
                                 JODI
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MINDY
                        I couldn't let you go in there without
                        you knowing how proud I am of you.

                                 JODI
                        But --

                                 MINDY
                        But nothing.  You're my best friend. 
                        I got into MIT today.  And it meant
                        nothing because you weren't there to
                        celebrate with me.  I don't know how
                        everything got so messed up --
                            (cutting her off)
                        Ok, I do know.  I went a little Dr. 
                        Strangelove.  But I've been thinking
                        about what you said about us being
                        high school friends.  And it's stupid. 
                        You're not my high school friend. 
                        You're my best friend.  You will
                        always be my Xena.  You'll always
                        know about the face plant that gave
                        me this dental bridge.

           She removes a bridge, fake tooth and all, and continues.

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        You'll always know I prefer odd
                        numbers to even.  I don't know where
                        life will take us.  Hopefully to a
                        lot of great places and PhD programs. 
                        But it doesn't matter.  Because I
                        want you in my life for all of it. 
                        I'm sorry.  And I'm back.

           Jodi smiles. 

                                 JODI
                        I'm so glad you're here.  You don't
                        even know.  I'm totally freaking. 

           Mindy springs into best friend action to reassure her.

                                 MINDY
                        You remember at science fair finals, 
                        I was so nervous I thought I was
                        going to puke on my bacteria cultures?

           Jodi smiles in recollection but looks reluctant. 

                                 MINDY (CONT'D)
                        Come on.  You made me do it. 
           They exchange a look, then turn to stand side by side.  They
           break into the NERDIEST HAKA ever.  Opera Girl looks at them
           like they're crazy.  They end the Haka and exchange grins. 

           The door opens and an INTERVIEWER pops out. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Jodi Schellenberger.

           Jodi looks at Mindy, still a bit nervous, but pumped now.

                                 MINDY
                        Destroy it.

           With a smile, Jodi heads in.

           LATER:

           Mindy waits nervously.  Finally the door opens.  Jodi exits. 
           Mindy looks at her, expectant.  Jodi gives the THUMBS UP. 
           They jump up and down and yell together in celebration.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           Graduation.  STUDENTS get their diplomas as their families
           watch on, the remnants of RMNHS in the background.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        So high school was finally over... 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And maybe it was just the Stockholm
                        Syndrome talking, but for the first
                        time, I kind of felt like I was going
                        to miss the place. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        The thing was, we had tried so hard
                        to tear down the entire system that
                        we lost sight of what our high school
                        really was.  

           EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

           Baseball practice.  A boy gets a hit.  High fives all around.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        People.  Just people.

                        People learning.  
           EXT. GLAAD MEETING - DAY

           Claire sits in her first GLAAD meeting, a bit nervous, but
           smiling from ear to ear.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Learning who they are.  

           INT. HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Sugar watches a movie in class about the Women's Suffrage.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Who they want to be.  

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Dave passes several upperclassmen cornering a scared FRESHMAN. 
           He tells them to knock it off.  They oblige.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        Who they don't want to be.  

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Because no matter who you are --

           MONTAGE OF MAIN CHARACTERS:

                                 JODI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The geek, the prom king, the blow-
                        hard, the president of the history
                        club, or someone who never wanted a
                        title before their name -- high school
                        is the same.  It's the best of times.

           EXT. VIRGINIA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           GEEKS cheer each other on during the Battle of Trafalgar.

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        It's the worst of times. 

           EXT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           DRAMA GEEKS rush to the list of who's been cast in the next
           play.  One girl's faces falls in disappointment.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        It's amazing.  

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           A GIRL scores the game winning shot.  Her team rushes her. 
                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        It's heart-breaking.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           A BOY tears up as he removes a picture of his now ex-
           girlfriend from her locker and rips it up.

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        Full of wonderful people.  

           BACK TO GRADUATION:

           Dave exchanges a smile with Jodi from down the row. 

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        And awful people.  

           Whitney, Colin, Rick and Prithi watch the ceremony in
           disinterest.  Prithi reads US Weekly. 

                                 JODI (V.O.)
                        And it's once in a lifetime.  

                                 MINDY (V.O.)
                        And we made it through. 

           In the crowd, Mindy, Jodi, Sugar, Claire, and Virginia all
           make eye contact with each other.  A moment.

           EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY

           The girls hang out around the now partially melted bike rack.

                                 SUGAR
                        Whitmore's face when the marching
                        band played Light My Fire?  Priceless.  

           They all laugh.  Jodi takes a bow.  MARTIN approaches and
           stops awkwardly by Sugar. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Um, hello, Sugar.  I was, wondering
                        if you would perhaps do me the great --

                                 SUGAR
                        I'll see you this week, Martin.

           He nods in relief then departs.  Off the girls' bemusement --

                                 SUGAR (CONT'D)
                        Hey, the heart wants whatever twisted
                        bizzaro thing the heart wants.
                                 (MORE)
                                 SUGAR (CONT'D)
                            (to Claire)
                        And don't look so smug.  Because you
                        know what our next mission is? 
                        Getting you your first date!

           Claire blushes and shakes her head.

                                 JODI
                        She's right!  We can't send you off
                        to Smith having never gone on a date
                        with a girl.  That's like sending a
                        soldier to war with a book of poetry.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Not a bad idea for Smith, actually.

           CLAIRE'S FAMILY, a perfect 1950's replica pulls up in the
           station wagon.  It's really starting to sink in -- it's over.

                                 MINDY
                        See you this week.

                                 CLAIRE
                            (smiles)
                        Deal.

           She hops into the station wagon, and they depart.  As she
           does, a blacked out Crown Victoria pulls up.

                                 VIRGINIA
                        That's my driver.

                                 SUGAR
                        Ok, it's time to spill it.  What are
                        you doing in the fall?

                                 VIRGINIA
                        Eh.  A little of this.  A little of
                        that.  I'm just going to see where
                        the wind takes me.

           She waves and heads into her probably armored vehicle.  

                                 SUGAR
                        That girl's going into the CIA, right?

                                 JODI
                        No doubt.

           An stylishly upscale AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILY pulls up. 

                                 SUGAR'S MOM
                        You ready, Dolores?
           Mindy and Jodi regard her in surprise.  

                                 SUGAR
                        Don't even. 

           Sugar exchanges fist bumps with the girls, then heads off. 
           Jodi and Mindy stand alone at the bike rack.  A beat, then
           Jodi pulls out an ENVELOPE and hands it to Mindy.

                                 JODI
                        Open it.

           Mindy does.  It's a TRAIN TICKET FROM BOSTON TO NEW YORK.  

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        The first of many.  

           Mindy smiles and they embrace in a good, long hug.  They
           unlock their bikes, then hop on and start riding.

                                 JODI (CONT'D)
                        Next year is going to be epic.

                                 MINDY
                        Next year?  We still have the summer.

                                 JODI
                        Battlestar marathon at my place?

           Mindy smiles and nods.  They ride off into the Sunset. 

                                 VIRGINIA (V.O.)
                        Fin.

                                                               FADE OUT:
