           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

           TITLE: 2001. Upstate New York. The Tri-Cities. 

           Two high school seniors walk down a quiet street. The taller 
           one is KYLE: gangly, quiet, a bit high-strung. He’s also gay, 
           but only out to his two best friends. 

           One of those best friends is MARTY, a nice Jewish boy in an 
           OVERSIZED LINEN JACKET. He holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE. 

                                 KYLE
                        You’re really doing this, huh? 

                                 MARTY
                        No turning back now. 

           They walk in silence for a beat. 

                                 KYLE
                        Can I see your hand again?

                                 MARTY
                             (quickly)
                        Not a chance. 

           The guys continue walking. They don’t break stride even as 
           they hear a voice from behind:  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Thanks for waiting up, dick weeds. 

           This is the third friend, FAREED, aka “FRANK.” He jogs up 
           looking ‘90s suburban fresh to death: gelled hair, puka shell 
           necklace, all Abercrombie everything. But with his baby face 
           and squat frame, he’s not quite pulling it off. 

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry, forgot my sheepskins in the 
                        car. I mean, what if Vanessa’s 
                        allergic to latex?  

                                 KYLE
                        Frank, buying more condoms doesn’t 
                        increase your odds of getting laid. 
                        They’re not lotto tickets.

                                 FRANK
                        You gotta pay to play.
                                 MARTY
                        But you’re paying to not play. 

                                 FRANK
                        I didn’t make the rules, Marty. 

           We hear the FAINT DIN OF A PARTY in progress as the guys turn 
           onto the driveway of an upper-middle class home. Marty stops 
           and faces the guys. 

                                 MARTY
                        Alright. How do I look? 

                                 FRANK
                        Like you just sold your hundredth 
                        Miata?

                                 MARTY
                        Thanks.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, you look fine. 
                             (then)
                        Maybe lose the jacket? 
                             (off Marty’s look)
                        Jacket’s great. 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - LATER 

           Your standard graduation rager: Beer pong, quarters and 
           bongs, oh my! Our dudes are in the back of the living room, 
           observing more than participating.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m gonna miss this. Running shit. 

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah, it’s gonna be hard moving on 
                        from this lofty social perch, what 
                        with all the girls coming over 
                        begging to blow you.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay Marty, no one’s saying I spent 
                        the last four years constantly 
                        wetting it -- 

                                 KYLE
                        Or ever wetting it.  

                                 FRANK
                        -- But locking up the first hole 
                        that comes your way is just crazy. 
                                 MARTY
                        Believe it or not, Frank, I see 
                        Hannah as more than just a “hole.”  

           Frank considers this. 

                                 FRANK
                        She does have great tits.

                                 MARTY
                        Not talking about her tits, Frank.

           Just then, a cute blonde girl comes up behind Marty and wraps 
           her arms around him. 

                                 GIRL
                        Hey, hottie, wanna cheat on your 
                        girlfriend?

           Marty turns around to see his lady, HANNAH. She’s adorable. 
           You’d wanna spoon and bone her (if you were still in high 
           school, sicko.)    

                                 MARTY
                        Very funny, babe.

           She flashes a big smile. You can see why Marty’s on board. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (to Frank and Kyle)
                        Hey, guys. Oh, Frank --  

           She motions her head across the room, where VANESSA DANIELS 
           (hottest girl in school, knows it) ascends a stair case. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I’d say you have four minutes 
                        before she’s swarmed by every 
                        sausage in here.

                                 FRANK
                        Hannah, you’re the best. Kyle, 
                        let’s go.
                             (then, as he exits)
                        Marty, sorry I said “hole.” 

           They leave. Hannah curiously eyes Marty in his blazer. She 
           notices something on his hand.

                                 HANNAH
                        What’s that? 
                                 MARTY
                             (quickly pocketing hand)
                        Nothing. Hey, it’s kind of loud in 
                        here, wanna go for a stroll? 

                                 HANNAH
                        A stroll?
                             (faux Victorian accent)
                        It is a great distance to the 
                        shire? Shall I pack a basket of 
                        crumpets? 

           Marty gives Hannah a little tap on the butt as they exit.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - MOMENTS LATER  

           Frank and Kyle make their way to the stairs. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve been letting Vanessa cheat off 
                        me in chemistry all semester, so 
                        I’m golden. In the biz, that’s what 
                        we call “laying pipe to lay pipe.”

                                 KYLE
                        You cheat off me in chemistry.

                                 FRANK
                        And that’s why you’re my assistant 
                        pipe-layer, dude. 

           Just then, something catches Kyle’s eye. 

                                 KYLE
                        Ahhh, son of a fuck. 

           We ANGLE ON the other side of the room, where a bro in Jncos 
           and a hockey jersey holds court with his bro pals. This is 
           BILLY WILCHECK. Billy, plain and simple, is a dick. The type 
           of guy who enjoys making life hell for a closeted classmate. 

           In the middle of the group is a skinny black exchange 
           student, N’DIQUE.

                                 BROS
                        N’DIQUE! N’DIQUE!

                                 BILLY
                        Show us one more time how they do 
                        it in Nigeria, N-Bomb!

           N’Dique does a weird tribal “humping” dance as the group 
           laughs. Kyle and Frank watch, horrified.
                                 FRANK
                        Not sure nicknaming the black kid 
                        “N-Bomb” is a great call.

                                 KYLE
                        God, he’s the worst.

                                 FRANK
                        Jeez, it’s not his fault he’s 
                        black.
                             (off Kyle’s look)
                        Kidding. Look, I know you’re not 
                        trying to get hate-crimed tonight. 
                        I can stick around, catch up with 
                        Vanessa later. 

                                 KYLE
                        I’m just gonna go outside and 
                        chill. I’ll be fine. Go do your 
                        thing.

                                 FRANK
                        Cool. You sure you’re okay?

           Frank takes a MAGAZINE COLOGNE INSERT out of his pocket and 
           rubs it on his neck.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you?

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - BACKYARD - LATER 

           Marty and Hannah walk around the side of the house. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (as Alanis Morissette)
                        ‘Cuz he’s got one hand in his 
                        pocket, and the other on...no? 

           Marty takes a deep breath and stops. He turns to Hannah.

                                 MARTY
                        Okay, Hannah, look. Frank thinks 
                        this is retarded, but -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        Marty H. Miller. 

                                 MARTY
                        Sorry. Frank thinks this is “not 
                        smart,” but anyway, here goes. You 
                        know I love you, right?
                                 HANNAH
                        Of course, babe. I love you too.

                                 MARTY
                        And I know we’re gonna be pretty 
                        far apart soon. And that’s not 
                        gonna be easy. But I want you to 
                        know I’m serious about making us 
                        work. 

           Marty drops to a knee. He takes his hand out of his pocket 
           and shows it to Hannah.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Hannah Jensen, will you marry me? 

           Finally, we see a close-up of his hand. On his ring finger, 
           where a wedding band would be, is a TATTOO that says “H.J.”

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t afford a ring, but I 
                        hope this shows you I’m in this 
                        forever. 

           Hannah stares, speechless. It is a pregnant silence. Finally: 

                                 HANNAH
                        You...got an “HJ” tattoo?

                                 MARTY
                        Your initials. Hannah Jensen.

                                 HANNAH
                        Right. But it says “HJ.” On your 
                        hand.

                                 MARTY
                        Right. Your name.

                                 HANNAH
                        Right...HJ.

                                 MARTY
                        Okay, I don’t know why everyone 
                        focuses on that interpretation.  

           Another awkward beat.

                                 HANNAH
                        Marty, are you fucking retarded? 
           INT. HOUSE PARTY - HALLWAY - LATER

           Frank’s upstairs, looking for Vanessa. He opens a door, only 
           to find a FAT KID dancing alone to Ginuwine’s “Pony.” They 
           make eye contact, but the guy just keeps dancing. It’s weird.  

           He quickly moves to the next door and opens it. Inside, some 
           DUDES are “antiquing” (throwing flour on) a PASSED-OUT GUY. 
           Frank’s still standing there when, way down the hall, he sees 
           TWO BIG JOCKS lead a wasted Vanessa into a bedroom.

                                 FRANK
                        Vanessa! Wait! 

           Too late. The door slams shut.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           So close yet so far. As Frank contemplates his move, he 
           notices the BAG OF FLOUR being used for the antiquing. 
           Hmmm... 

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - BACK PATIO - LATER

           Kyle hangs out in a gazebo, observing the drunken masses from 
           a distance. Suddenly, his solitude is interrupted by a voice:   

                                 BILLY (O.S.)
                             (re: party)
                        Hard to believe this is over, huh?

           Kyle turns and sees his nemesis, Billy the Dick, approaching. 
           Fantastic. Billy sidles up next to him.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        You hear me, partner? 

                                 KYLE
                        I did. I’m just waiting for the 
                        part where you go, “And by partner, 
                        I meant faggot,” and tell me to 
                        take my AIDS medication. Anyway, 
                        Billy, good talk. 

           Kyle starts to walk away.

                                 BILLY
                        I’m sorry, Kyle.

           Kyle turns around.
                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        I know I’ve been a prick to you 
                        over the years, so maybe this 
                        doesn’t mean much. But graduating 
                        put some stuff in perspective.
                             (then)
                        Point is, I was wrong, and I’m 
                        sorry.

           Kyle eyes Billy for a beat.

                                 KYLE
                        Wow, Billy. I don’t really know 
                        what to say. 

                                 BILLY
                        You don’t have to say anything. No 
                        hard feelings?

           Billy extends a hand. Kyle hesitates, then accepts.   

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe slightly less hard feelings.

                                 BILLY
                        Good enough. Now let’s take some 
                        beers to pound town. 

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - BEDROOM - LATER

           Vanessa’s lying on the bed. One of the jocks kneels over her, 
           holding a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA. His buddy is also on the bed. 
           Her parents would not be happy.

                                 VANESSA
                             (slurring)
                        No more shots.

           There’s a knock at the door. The guys look at each other. 
           More knocking. One heads to answer it.  

                                 JOCK #1
                        Okay, okay, hold on.

           He opens it a crack, only to be THROTTLED BACKWARDS as Frank 
           barges in and flings a GIANT BAG OF WHITE POWDER at Jock #2 
           on the bed.

                                 JOCK #2
                        What the --
                                 FRANK
                        Someone narc’d me out, man. I’m not 
                        going back to juvie on this shit! 

           Jock #2 throws the powder back at him. 

                                 JOCK #2
                        Dude, get this out of here! 

                                 FRANK
                        Just stash it under the bed!

           Frank grips the baggie tightly and throws it back. There’s an 
           EXPLOSION OF POWDER. It’s everywhere. Including on the jocks. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Fuuuuck, you guys got any priors?  

                                 JOCK #1
                        SHIT. Let’s get out of here, man. 

           They break for the window, drop into some hedges, and take 
           off across the yard. Frank goes to Vanessa and sits down.  

                                 FRANK
                        It’s okay. You’re safe now.

                                 VANESSA
                        Frannnnnk! Hiiiii!

           She puts her head in his lap and...VOMITS. And she’s out. 

                                 FRANK
                        Damn, these are my favorite cargo 
                        shorts.

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - POOL - LATER

           Kyle and Billy have moved their bonding session to the chairs 
           by the pool. They’re both a little drunk at this point.  

                                 KYLE
                        Remember freshman year? You shoved 
                        me into the gym naked and locked 
                        the door. Coach Dixon thought I was 
                        trying to flash him. 

                                 BILLY
                             (impersonating)
                        “Cooper, take your sad little junk 
                        pile down to the principal’s 
                        office.”
                                 KYLE
                        Man, I am not gonna miss this 
                        place. 

           They laugh. Is it possible they’re having a moment? 

                                 BILLY
                        Hey, lemme ask you something. Are 
                        you actually gay?   

                                 KYLE
                        Huh?

                                 BILLY
                        I mean, I know I made a lot of 
                        jokes about it, and I’m sorry for 
                        that. But now that we’re burying 
                        the hatchet, I feel like it’d be 
                        nice to know the real you.   

           Kyle stares at Billy. 

                                 KYLE
                        Are you on ecstasy?    

                                 BILLY
                        No man, I’m just asking. But if you 
                        don’t wanna talk about it, that’s 
                        cool.

           Kyle considers this. Ah, last night of school. What the hell.   

                                 KYLE
                        Yes, Billy, I’m gay.

           Billy takes a beat. 

                                 BILLY
                        Wow, Kyle. I really appreciate you 
                        telling me...that you’re a fucking 
                        fag! 

           Billy leaps into the air and starts hooting and hollering.

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit, I did it! I got Kyle to 
                        admit he likes dick! Mikey you 
                        heard, right?! Pay me!

           MIKEY, his meathead friend, comes over and hands him some 
           CRUMPLED BILLS. 

                                 KYLE
                        You’re a fucking asshole, dude.
                                 BILLY
                             (to passers-by)
                        Attention seniors, breaking news 
                        about your classmate Kyle Cooper. 
                        He has just confirmed that he is, 
                        in fact, a total homo.

           Annnd SNAP. Kyle lunges at the much larger Billy. They both 
           tumble to the ground...   

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - BEDROOM - LATER

           Vanessa’s passed out, her back to Frank. He’s taken off his 
           vomit-covered cargo shorts and is holding a GLASS OF WATER 
           and some ADVIL. He nudges her.  

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, you should take this. 

           Vanessa rolls over. Her head is level with Frank’s crotch. 
           She opens her eyes.  

                                 VANESSA
                        Where am -- why are your pants -- 
                        oh my god oh my god. 

           She smacks the pills out of Frank’s hand and breaks for the 
           hallway. 

                                 VANESSA (O.S) (CONT’D)
                        Help! The nerd date-raped me!

           Frank, still sans pants, rushes after her.

                                 FRANK
                        Whoa whoa whoa! I just saved you!

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Marty storms through the kitchen, pissed off at his thwarted 
           proposal. Hannah follows two steps behind. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Come on Marty, it’s just we’re so 
                        young, and we’re gonna be so far 
                        apart, and -- 

           Out of nowhere, Vanessa barrels through the frame, shrieking. 
           Seconds later, a pant-less Frank whizzes by.  

                                 FRANK
                        I swear I didn’t rape you!
           They pass through the living room and exit into the kitchen. 

                                 MARTY
                        Dear god.  

           Marty takes off after Frank. Just then, TWO POLICE OFFICERS 
           enter through the front door, holding up flashlights... 

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER  

           Frank dashes out onto the patio. 

                                 FRANK
                        Vanessa! Wait!

           Suddenly, he stops. Marty gets there a beat later and stops, 
           too. Down by the pool, they see Kyle getting his ass kicked 
           by Billy.

                                 FRANK/MARTY
                        Oh, shit. 

           They book it for the pool. 

           EXT. HOUSE PARTY - POOL - CONTINUOUS 

           Frank and Marty charge at Billy, “Braveheart”-style. They’re 
           within striking distance.   

                                 MARTY
                        I’m going for his legs!

                                 FRANK
                        Cool, I’ll go for his legs!
                             (to Billy)
                        Get off him!

           They both dive at Billy’s feet. Billy side-steps them just as 
           they collide and tumble into the pool. A second later, he 
           heaves Kyle in as well. 

           Our guys surface to see Hannah and Vanessa staring at them as 
           Billy and the rest of the party laugh hysterically. 

                                 BILLY
                        Hey, the Village People are having 
                        a wet t-shirt contest!
                             (to the tune of “YMCA”)
                        Kyle! Is! So! Gay!

           A bunch of nearby drunk kids join in singing. They don’t 
           notice that the POLICE OFFICERS have arrived. 
           Kyle looks up and makes eye contact with one of cops. 

                                 COP #1
                        Kyle?

                                 KYLE
                             (horrified)
                        Dad?

                                 PARTY DUDE (O.S.)
                        Shit, cops! Run!

           As the crowd starts to disperse, a RANDOM GIRL moves in with 
           a camera and SNAPS a shot of Frank, Marty and Kyle. Behind 
           them, Billy laughs. Hannah looks humiliated. Vanessa is 
           disgusted. Over this PICTURE, the TITLE CARD: 

           FUCK / MARRY / KILL

           (In the picture, ”Fuck” is above Vanessa. “Marry” above 
           Hannah. And “Kill” above Billy.)

           CREDITS: Have you seen that Google Chrome ad where the dude 
           tries to win his ex back? (If not, go watch it now. It’s 
           pretty cute.) This sequence, which traces the journey of our 
           guys from graduation to present day on one anonymous computer 
           screen, will look like that. Very quick cuts. Set to LCD

           -- We start on the POOL PHOTO. A cursor clicks a 2001-era AOL

           BlondieSurfGrl responds: “18/f/NYC”. FrankChode: “Kewl. Send

           -- Another EMAIL from Susan: “Kyle, understand this is new to

           EXT. SOHO LOFT -- DAY

           A live/work building on a cobblestone Manhattan street.

           TITLE: Present Day. November. 

           INT. SOHO LOFT -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

           KYLE (looks boss, acts boss) stands at the head of a 
           boardroom. With gravitas:

                                 KYLE
                        So really, it’s more than an 
                        iPhone. It’s (INTERLOCKS FINGERS) a 
                        WePhone. Thank you.
                             (then)
                        So? What do you think?

           We PULL OUT to reveal that the only people he’s speaking to 
           are FRANK (better dressed, less baby fat) and MARTY (kinda 
           looks the same). They’re in their home office, aka THE 
           INTERNET ROOM. It’s super sleek -- GLASS WALLS, COOL CHAIRS, 
           LOTS OF SCREENS. Marty snacks on trail mix. Frank’s on his 
           laptop.

                                 MARTY
                        So the iPhone’s a metaphor for 
                        hope. Bravo.  

                                 KYLE
                        Frank?

           Frank doesn’t look up from his laptop. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Frank.

           Still nothing.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Siri, screenshare on laptop three. 
                                 SIRI
                        Yes, Kyle.

           On a wall-mounted MONITOR next to Kyle, we see what Frank is 
           so engrossed in: the FACEBOOK PROFILE of a HOT CHICK. 

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus, Frank, stop creeping on 
                        party sluts for two seconds and 
                        help me out. This is important. 

                                 FRANK
                        A bunch of rich gay guys are giving 
                        you a trophy for being a rich gay 
                        guy. You’ll be fine.
                             (then)
                        Also, Karen isn’t a party slut. 
                        She’s a publicist.

           Marty looks at Karen’s picture on the screen.

                                 MARTY
                        Is she at a dog park? I can see her 
                        tits.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, she’s a slutty publicist. 

                                 MARTY
                             (reading)
                        I see her interests include 
                        “blacking out,” “my bitches from 
                        Kappa,” and “E!” Does she mean the 
                        TV channel or the drug? 

                                 KYLE
                        Guys, can we focus here?

                                 MARTY
                             (ignoring him)
                        Bitches is also spelled with a “z.”

                                 FRANK
                        She’s not a goddamn English 
                        professor, Marty.

                                 KYLE
                        GUYS. 

           Marty and Frank finally stop.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Come on! You think other CEOs waste 
                        their time like this?!
                                 FRANK
                             (muttering)
                        I bet Mark Zuckerberg does. 

                                 KYLE
                        Great. Let’s all give him a hand 
                        for reducing real human interaction 
                        to staring at pictures of people 
                        you want to bang.  

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not just people we want to 
                        bang. It’s also people we have 
                        banged. 
                             (then, to Marty)
                        Or have banged and are now just 
                        sadly obsessed with. 

                                 MARTY
                        I told you, I blocked Hannah.  

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, after we caught you looking 
                        at photos from her Fiji vacation 
                        album and crying. 

                                 MARTY
                        A dolphin was giving birth, Kyle. 
                        To a baby dolphin. 
                             (off his look)
                        So what, you never have the urge to 
                        look up an ex?

                                 KYLE
                        No. We broke up for a reason. Fuck 
                        ‘em. 

                                 MARTY
                        What about people from college? 

                                 KYLE
                        Why, so I can see so-and-so had a 
                        baby? Fuck your baby. And fuck 
                        pictures of your baby even more.  

                                 MARTY
                        So you’re saying there’s no one 
                        from your past you care to keep up 
                        with.

                                 KYLE
                        That’s what I’m saying. It’s the 
                        past. What’s the point?
                                 FRANK
                        What about Billy Wilcheck? 

           Oh. HIM. Kyle is clearly thrown by the name. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You spent half your life thinking 
                        about murdering that guy. You’re 
                        telling me you never wonder what 
                        he’s up to now? 

                                 KYLE
                        No, I don’t. What Billy’s up to now 
                        doesn’t matter because he doesn’t 
                        matter. 

                                 FRANK
                        Well, why don’t we take a looksie? 
                        Siri, Billy Wilcheck’s Facebook 
                        page. 

                                 SIRI
                        You got it, Frank.

           On the main monitor, Billy’s profile appears. He’s standing 
           in front of some TVs in a store, smiling. He looks...normal.

           Frank scrolls down the page as Kyle turns back to the guys. 

                                 KYLE
                        Great, he’s alive. Now can we -- 

                                 MARTY/FRANK
                             (looking at screen)
                        Whoa.

           Kyle looks back at the screen. There, in Billy’s news feed, 
           is a picture. The picture. THE POOL PARTY PICTURE! No one’s 
           seen it in years.

           Above the picture is some text: “Billy Wilcheck and 322 
           Others are attending The Tri-Cities Thanksgiving Eve Bar 
           Crawl.” 

           Frank clicks the link, which leads to a FACEBOOK EVENT PAGE 
           featuring a photo of Billy holding an oversized check.

                                 KYLE
                             (reading)
                        “This Wednesday at the Windjammer:

                        in honoring our Humanitarian of the 
                        Year, Billy Wilcheck.”
           Kyle stares at it, stunned. Then:

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        He’s getting a fucking award? 

           Frank clicks the ATTENDING list and scans the names.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, that guy who used to huff 
                        keyboard cleaner in homeroom’s 
                        going! I love that guy.
                             (then)
                        So is Hannah Jensen. 

                                 MARTY
                             (a touch too eager)
                        Really?

           Frank moves the cursor over Hannah’s name. 

                                 FRANK
                        Want me to click it?

           He clicks on HANNAH’S PROFILE, but hits BACK before it loads.

                                 MARTY
                        Dude, come on! 

           Frank does this a few times before Kyle goes over and grabs 
           the laptop from him. He clicks to Billy’s profile and hits 
           ABOUT. All it says is: “Owner, The Man Cave.”

                                 KYLE
                        The Man Cave? 

           Kyle opens the company’s website. It appears to have been 
           designed by Michael Bay.

                                 FRANK
                             (reading from monitor)
                        “The world’s first luxury 
                        electronics store catering 
                        exclusively to gentlemen.” Sounds 
                        dope.

                                 KYLE
                        It sounds like one of Turtle’s 
                        shitty ideas on “Entourage.” 
                                 FRANK
                             (reading on)

                        is basically Matthew McConaughey.

                        Siri, close the fucking page. 

           Billy’s profile disappears. There’s a beat of silence. 

                                 MARTY
                        Whatever, dude. Facebook’s dumb.

                        about some idiot from high school?

           He storms out, SLAMMING THE DOOR. Silence. Then: 

                                 FRANK
                        Seriously, check out that 
                        foundation. They’re doing some 
                        really great things. 

           INT. INTELLIGENT COFFEE - THAT EVENING 

           Marty and his girlfriend, ZOE (pretty, put together) are in 
           line at one of those old-timey coffee places where everyone 
           looks like they were just out panning for gold. 

           Marty stares at his iPhone while Zoe talks.

                                 ZOE
                        Okay, so we’re leaving Wednesday 
                        morning and I still have to pick up 
                        my dry cleaning, buy your mom 
                        flowers, and get chestnuts for my 
                        smoked apple soup. And make it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZOE (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Maybe we get this to go?

           From Marty’s POV, we see his phone: clearly, the pool pic 
           jogged his memory, because he’s looking at the Facebook 
           invite list of the Windjammer’s Thanksgiving Eve Bar Crawl, 
           where Hannah Jensen’s avatar is displayed.

           They’re at the head of the line now. Marty continues to stare 
           at his phone, lost in thought, as the HIPSTER MIXOLOGIST eyes 
           him impatiently.

                                 ZOE (CONT’D)
                        Marty?

           He quickly hits “REQUEST FRIEND” and puts his phone away.  

                                 MARTY
                             (to mixologist)
                        Sorry. Uh, two small coffees.

                        You need to select a flavor 
                        profile. Bean and roast.  

           The guy points to a menu behind him, which features an 
           extensive list of caffeinated beverage options. Marty sighs.  

                                 MARTY
                        Fine, two (READING) Peruvian Guano 
                        Golds. To go. 

                                 MIXOLOGIST
                        We don’t do coffee to go. We find 
                        it’s best enjoyed in our aromatic 
                        tasting room.

                                 MARTY
                        Of course it is. 

           The mixologist turns over an ANTIQUE HOURGLASS and exits. 
           Marty and Zoe step aside and sit at a nearby empty table. 

                                 ZOE
                        You okay, babe? You seem out of it.

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just, it 
                        sounds like you have a lot on your 
                        plate. You totally don’t have to 
                        come home with me this weekend.

                                 ZOE 
                        I know I don’t have to. I want to.
                                 MARTY
                        I know you do. But really, what’s 
                        the rush? My folks will be around 
                        forever. I mean, we have no family 
                        history of heart disease or high 
                        blood pressure. Plus they drive 
                        Volvos.  

           Zoe lets this hang for a second. Then:

                                 ZOE 
                        Marty, are you uninviting me to 
                        Thanksgiving?  

                                 MARTY
                        Of course not. I’m just saying, 
                        maybe you shouldn’t come because as 
                        you pointed out, you have a lot on 
                        your plate.

                                 ZOE
                        The only things on my plate are 
                        things I had to do for a trip you 
                        asked me to come on. 

                                 MARTY
                        And I’m not telling you not to 
                        come. But maybe...

           The silence says it all.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Zoe, I’m really sorry. It’s just --

                                 ZOE
                        It’s just what? This might become 
                        an actual relationship?
                             (getting up)
                        Have fun at home. I hope you find 
                        whatever it is you’re looking for.
                             (under her breath)
                        Asshole.

           She exits. As Marty sits there, the mixologist comes over 
           holding an ORNATE PEWTER SERVING TRAY with a plate, a cup, a 
           French Press, liquid sugar, raw sugar, and three different 
           types of milk. He turns over another ANTIQUE HOUR GLASS. 

           Marty glares at him. Off his look, we...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - NIGHT

           Close on a DUNKIN DONUTS COFFEE CUP, which Marty sips as he 
           walks home. His phone buzzes. He checks it. 

           It’s a Facebook notification: “HANNAH JENSEN HAS ACCEPTED 
           YOUR FRIEND REQUEST.” Oh, shit. He starts walking a little 
           faster. And faster. And...he’s running home. 

           INT. LOFT - THE INTERNET ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Frank’s at the table. His pants are around his ankles, and 
           there’s a BOTTLE OF LOTION next to him. He’s wearing 
           HEADPHONES. We can’t hear what he’s listening to, but we know 
           what he’s doing.

           MARTY rushes in and stops dead in his tracks.

                                 MARTY
                        Jesus, Frank! 

           Frank keeps pluggin’ away. Marty picks up an EMPTY POLAND 
           SPRING BOTTLE and whips it at his head. Direct shot. 

                                 FRANK
                        Shit!

           Frank tries to stand and pull his pants up in one go, but he 
           gets tangled in the headphone wires and FALLS. The wire pops 
           out of the headphone jack, prompting Paula Cole’s “I Don’t 
           Wanna Wait” (aka the “Dawson’s Creek” song) to BLARE LOUDLY 
           from the speakers. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Siri, music off!  

           Silence. Frank finally composes himself and gets up.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

                                 MARTY
                        How many times do we have to go 
                        over this?! No jerking off in the 
                        Internet...

           His voice trails off when he sees the monitor. There are 
           VARIOUS FACEBOOK PHOTOS of...Frank’s former flame VANESSA 
           DANIELS?? Guess the pool party photo got to him, too. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Vanessa Daniels? You’re jerking off 
                        to that chick from high school?  
                                 FRANK
                        She’s not still in high school, 
                        Marty. 
                             (then)
                        Why are you home, anyway? I thought 
                        you were with Zoe.

                                 MARTY
                        I was. 
                             (then)
                        Siri, go to Hannah Jensen’s 
                        Facebook profile.

           Frank looks at him.

                                 FRANK
                        Whoaaa, buddy, you do not want to 
                        go down that rabbit hole and end
                        up --

                                 MARTY
                        Shut up and let me live, Frank!  

           INT. LOFT - KYLE’S ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Kyle’s in bed when he wakes up to SHOUTS AND NOISES. He 
           checks the clock: 3:26 AM. More shouts. He storms out of bed.

           INT. LOFT - THE INTERNET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle enters to find Frank and Marty amidst a sea of beer cans 
           and pizza boxes. The screens are filled with VARIOUS PHOTOS 
           of Hannah and Vanessa. They went down the rabbit hole, 
           alright. 

                                 MARTY
                        Go back to the pic where Hannah’s 
                        holding the baby pug. 

           Frank types, laser focused. 

                                 FRANK
                        One sec, lemme finish sending 
                        Vanessa this message. 

                                 KYLE
                        What the fuck is going on?

           They turn and see Kyle. He notices the bottle of lotion near 
           Frank. 
                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, Frank! There is literally 
                        one rule in the Internet Room.

           He points to a laminated placard on the wall. It reads: RULES 
           OF THE INTERNET ROOM: 1) NO JERKING OFF 

                                 FRANK
                        Actually, this isn’t the Internet 
                        Room anymore, it’s the War Room. 
                        And in the War Room, there are no 
                        rules.

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t care what room it is. Keep 
                        it down. 

           He turns to leave. 

                                 MARTY
                        Get your ass back here. No one 
                        leaves the War Room until I say so. 

                                 FRANK
                             (sotto, to Marty)
                        I thought we said there were no 
                        rules in the War Room?

                                 MARTY
                        Shut up, Frank. 
                             (to Kyle)
                        Sit. 

           Kyle checks to see if Marty is serious. He is. Reluctantly, 
           he takes a seat.

           Marty hits a key. A PHOTO of Billy, grinning like an asshole, 
           appears on the main screen.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        What does this mean to you, Kyle?

           Kyle quickly glances at the picture, then turns to Marty.

                                 KYLE
                        Are you kidding me? This is why I’m 
                        sitting? 

                                 MARTY
                        You barely looked at it.

           Kyle sighs, then looks at it again.
                                 KYLE
                        What do you want me to say? He’s an 
                        asshole I went to school with. 

                                 MARTY
                        That’s it? 

                                 KYLE
                        Yes, Marty, that’s it. He means 
                        nothing.    

                                 MARTY
                        Why don’t you call your dad and 
                        tell him that?

           Kyle doesn’t say anything.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I thought. Billy 
                        Wilcheck is not nothing. 

           Marty hits a key, bringing up a PHOTO of Vanessa.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        But you’re not alone. I mean, look 
                        at Frank. Dude is surrounded by the 
                        hottest chicks in the city --

                                 FRANK
                        That’s true.

                                 MARTY
                        And yet I come in here and find him 
                        jackin’ his sausage McMuffin to 
                        this. It’s pathetic.  

                                 FRANK
                        That’s also true.

                                 KYLE
                        Not that I should talk.

           Marty hits another key. A picture of Hannah appears. 

                                 MARTY
                        Point is, Kyle, you’re not the only 
                        one who never dealt with their 
                        past. None of us did. Which is why, 
                        despite everything we’ve 
                        accomplished, we all still kind of 
                        feel -- 

           Marty hits a key. The pool photo comes up. 
                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Like this. 

           He lets the image sink in for a second. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        But that changes now. Frank, take 
                        it from here.

           Frank hits a key on his laptop. On the main screen, pictures 
           of VANESSA, HANNAH, and BILLY appear against a white 
           background. Under Vannesa’s is a picture of two stick figures 
           boning. Under Hannah’s is a ring. Billy’s has a red “X” 
           through it.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Thanksgiving is two days away. 
                        Usually, we (re: Frank) go see our 
                        families while you stay here and 
                        mope. But I propose a new plan: On 
                        Wednesday, we all go back home, 
                        together, for the first time since 
                        we left. Our mission is simple: 
                        Frank’s gonna fuck Vanessa so he 
                        can finally stop feeling like he 
                        has to fuck everything else.  

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve got no choice, man. I’ve gotta 
                        do it.

                                 MARTY
                        Me? No more wondering what could’ve 
                        been with Hannah. I find out once 
                        and for all if she’s The One.
                             (then)
                        And you? You’re gonna kill Bill. 
                        Billy. Kill Billy. 

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, we talked about this, Kyle 
                        can’t kill him.

                                 MARTY
                        Right, you’re not actually gonna 
                        kill him. But you’re gonna mess his 
                        world up real bad. Just like he did 
                        to you. 

                                 FRANK
                        You see what we did? Fuck. Marry. 
                        Kill. Boom. 

           Frank and Marty look at Kyle.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        So? Whaddaya think? 

           Kyle takes this in. Then:

                                 KYLE
                        What do I think? I think you guys 
                        should get off Facebook, because 
                        honestly, that’s the dumbest 
                        fucking plan I’ve ever heard. 
                        That’s what I think. Now, I have a 
                        big night tomorrow, so I’m going 
                        back to bed. I suggest you idiots 
                        do the same. 

           Kyle gets up and walks out. 

                                 FRANK
                             (calling after)
                        Rule number two in the War Room: 
                        Don’t be such a douche!

           INT. LINCOLN CENTER -- THAT EVENING 

           Manhattan’s finest have packed the atrium of Lincoln Center 
           for Kyle’s big night. Black tie, champagne, passed plates of 
           canapes. At a podium, dapper as always, is ANDERSON COOPER. 
           Behind him, on a screen: “THE BUSINESS GETS BETTER PROJECT”.

                                 ANDERSON COOPER
                        Thanks again to everyone for coming 
                        out tonight. I’m sorry the 
                        champagne comes in such tiny flutes 
                        -- blame Mayor Bloomberg.  
                        (LAUGHTER). Anyway, it’s now my 
                        great pleasure to introduce our man 
                        of the hour: Mr. Kyle Cooper!

           The crowd applauds as Kyle takes the podium. Marty and Frank 
           look on proudly from the front of the room. 

                                 KYLE
                        Thanks, Anderson. It’s nice to see 
                        you in a tux, not running around 
                        some war zone in a tight black t-
                        shirt. (LAUGHTER). You know, when 
                        my partners and I came up with the 
                        idea for Siri, we thought of it as 
                        a way to not get real jobs after 
                        college. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KYLE (CONT'D)
                        Never in my wildest dreams did I 
                        think that one day, I’d be standing 
                        here, in a position to do something 
                        that truly makes a difference. 
                        Which is why launching “Business 
                        Gets Better,” which will provide 
                        seed capital for LGBT 
                        entrepreneurs, is the proudest 
                        moment of my career. (APPLAUSE). 
                        See, I grew up only three hundred 
                        miles north of here, but in high 
                        school, it couldn’t have felt 
                        further. My home town wasn’t a 
                        place where it was “cool” to be 
                        gay. Or even “okay,” really. 
                        Honestly, there were times I was 
                        bullied so badly I wanted to kill 
                        the kids who tormented me. Or at 
                        least maim them beyond repair. 
                        (LAUGHTER) No, seriously, there was 
                        one guy that, uh...

           Kyle looks out onto the crowd. Suddenly, like a PTSD episode, 
           BILLY WILCHECK’S GRINNING MUG flashes before him.  

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        That, uh...

           Kyle tries to regain his focus, but now his mind is running 
           through the pool incident: Billy chanting “Kyle! Is! So! 
           Gay!”...Billy tossing him in the pool...the look of 
           embarrassment on his dad’s face when he showed up. (This 
           sequence will feel like a hallucination.) 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        One guy that was just, uh... 

           Kyle’s voice trails off. We ANGLE ON Frank and Marty.

                                 MARTY
                        Is he having a stroke? 

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe he’ll turn it around?  

           Back on Kyle, who is now silent. After a long beat: 

                                 KYLE
                        You know what? Fuck that guy. That 
                        guy doesn’t deserve to be an 
                        anecdote in some bullshit 
                        inspirational speech. He deserves 
                        to get cancer in his dick and 
                        fucking die. 
                                 FRANK
                        Or not.

           Kyle finally snaps out of it. We WHIP PAN around to see the 
           audience, silent and mortified.

                                 KYLE
                        Anyway. It gets better.

           Anderson Cooper quickly rushes over and grabs the mic. 

                                 ANDERSON
                        Kyle Cooper, everyone. 

           There’s nervous applause as Kyle exits the stage. 

           Kyle finds Marty and Frank in the front row. Before they can 
           even say anything:

                                 KYLE
                        Let’s go. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - THE NEXT MORNING

           Frank drives (Navigator, Hybrid edition!). Kyle rides 
           shotgun, fiddling on his iPad. Marty reads the NEW YORK POST 
           in the back. Some dope-ass rock song plays as we see the 
           familiar sights of leaving New York: the FDR freeway, George 
           Washington Bridge, etc. They’re doin’ it. 

                                 MARTY
                             (reading)
                        “SIRI-ous Meltdown”? C’mon, Page 
                        Six, you’re better than that.

                                 FRANK
                        How’d they miss “Arma-GAY-ddon”?

                                 MARTY
                        That’s not bad.

                                 KYLE
                             (reading from iPad)
                        Listen to some of Billy’s bullshit 
                        status updates: “Great week at 
                        work. Can’t wait to give back at 
                        the shelter this weekend. Blessed.” 
                        Or this one: “Brats on the grill. 
                        White zin on ice. Wife in the hot 
                        tub. #Lovinglife.”   
                                 MARTY
                        You know, that actually doesn’t 
                        make him sound so bad.

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah, well now listen to this: 
                             (reading)
                        “You around? Wife’s out of town and 
                        I’m in the mood for Thai. Thai 
                        pussy.”

                                 FRANK
                        Seems a little overshare-y for 
                        Facebook.

                                 KYLE 
                        That’s not from Billy’s Facebook. 
                        It’s from his email.

                                 MARTY
                        How’d you get into his email 
                        account?!

                                 KYLE
                        You’d be amazed how easy it is to 
                        bypass Hotmail’s security questions 
                        when you know the name of someone’s 
                        second-grade teacher, the name of 
                        their pet, and the year they 
                        graduated high school.

                                 FRANK
                        Class of ‘01, go T.C. Panthers!

                                 MARTY
                        Damn, so what now?    

                                 KYLE
                        What now is I show up at the 
                        Windjammer tonight, wait for Billy 
                        to get his little award, and then 
                        get on stage and do a little public 
                        cleaning out of his inbox. Let’s 
                        see what his wife has to say about 
                        his late-night crab rangoon.  

           Marty and Frank look at Kyle, impressed and a little scared. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                             (to Marty)
                        Want me to see what Hannah’s been 
                        up to? 
                                 MARTY
                        All good, Wikileaks. I figure I’ll 
                        just “run into” her, get some 
                        quality time in, and take it from 
                        there.

                                 FRANK
                        Heh, “quality time.” You’re cute.

                                 MARTY
                        What, you want me to just knock on 
                        Hannah’s door and have sex with 
                        her?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s my plan with Vanessa. 

                                 KYLE
                        Not satisfied with just one rape 
                        accusation, huh?    

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not like that.
                             (proudly)
                        I laid my dream trap and she walked 
                        riiiight into it.

                                 MARTY
                        That’s not sending any less rapey.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, look. You contact a girl you 
                        haven’t seen in a while, you’re 
                        gonna come off creepy, right? The 
                        trick is to own it with a dream. So 
                        I write something like, “Hey, I 
                        know this is weird, but you were in 
                        my dream last night.” Girls just 
                        love being in other people’s 
                        dreams, so nine times out of ten, 
                        they write back, “That is weird. 
                        What was I doing?” Boom. You’re in. 

                                 MARTY
                        What do you say after that?

                                 FRANK
                        Anything you want! That’s the 
                        beauty of it. You don’t have 
                        control over your subconscious.
                             (then)
                        I told her we were milking cows. 
                        Oddly sexual. We’ve been texting 
                        ever since.   
           Kyle thinks about this for a second. 

                                 KYLE
                        Man are straight people dumb.

           Frank’s phone buzzes. He picks it up from the middle console. 

                                 FRANK
                        I take offense to that. Courtship 
                        between a man and a woman is a 
                        finely-tuned game of cat and mouse, 
                        almost scientific in its --
                             (re: phone)
                        Holy shit it’s a titty pic. 

                                 KYLE
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        Vanessa just sent me a picture of 
                        her titties. Holy shit.  

                                 MARTY
                        Lemme see!

           Frank turns to show Marty in the back seat. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Not mad at that. 

                                 KYLE
                        Dude!

           Kyle grabs the wheel and swerves to narrowly avoid hitting 
           something. He snatches the phone from Frank and pockets it. 

           After a beat, Frank’s phone buzzes again. Kyle just shakes 
           his head no.  

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, come on!

           INT/EXT. FRANK’S CAR -- LATER

           We pass a graffiti-covered sign: “WELCOME TO THE TRI-CITIES.” 
           Shots of run-down strip malls and sad chain restaurants. 

           EXT. THE WINDJAMMER - PARKING LOT - LATER 

           And our boys have arrived! Frank stands next to his car, 
           trying to strike a “cool bro” look as Marty takes his 
           picture.
                                 MARTY
                        Frank, there is literally no cool 
                        way to pose with your car.

                                 FRANK
                        Faaack. How am I supposed to 
                        compete with those titties?

           They start walking towards the entrance of the bar. 

                                 MARTY
                        Just so we’re clear, you’re not 
                        bringing her back to my house. My 
                        mom is still scarred from when she 
                        caught you beating off on her bed.

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, it’s my fault she left an Ann 
                        Taylor catalog on the night stand. 
                             (then)
                        I still can’t look at one of those 
                        things without popping wood.

                                 MARTY
                        Just take her back to your place. 

                                 FRANK
                        You kidding? My mom can’t know I’m 
                        in town. She’d keep me on lockdown 
                        all weekend. Far as she knows, I’m 
                        in Haiti doing charity work. 

                                 KYLE
                        You are every Indian parent’s 
                        dream. 

                                 FRANK
                             (pointed, to Kyle)
                        Cool, let’s just stay with your 
                        folks.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m sorry, is your dad an asshole 
                        who fundamentally rejected your 
                        sexual identity? 

                                 FRANK
                        No, he’s a gynecologist who slapped 
                        me because I “only” got a 1560 on 
                        my SATs. 

                                 KYLE
                        He slap you like this? 
           Kyle lightly slaps Frank across the face. 

                                 FRANK
                        Hey!

           Marty steps in. They’re at the entrance now.  

                                 MARTY
                        Alright guys, take it easy. We can 
                        stay at my house. Frank, no 
                        fucking. Kyle, no fighting.       

           Frank and Kyle eye each other for a moment.

                                 FRANK/KYLE
                        Fine/fine. 

           Marty opens the door. As they enter: 

                                 KYLE
                        I still can’t believe your dad is a 
                        gynecologist. 

                                 FRANK
                        What can I say? Touching vag is the 
                        Chattopadhyay way.  

           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - CONTINUOUS

           Our boys survey the scene. It’s like any small-town sports 
           bar: flatscreens, pool tables, people drinking pitchers of 
           beer. There’s a makeshift stage, behind which a banner reads: 
           CONGRATS TO HUMANITARIAN OF THE YEAR BILLY WILCHECK!

                                 KYLE
                        Let’s do this. 

           We now see a MONTAGE of our guys catching up with RANDOM 
           PEOPLE they went to school with. You know how it goes: lots 
           of nodding, fake smiles, forced enthusiasm. And in Frank’s 
           case, mostly texting while people talk to him.  

           -- A bro in corporate casual talks to Marty.

                                 CORPORATE BRO
                        I clocked 100,000 frequent flier 
                        miles in the last fiscal quarter 
                        alone. So...yeah.  

           -- A fat guy in a Christmas sweater talks to Kyle.  
                                 FAT GUY
                        So I tell her, “Look, Rhonda: I saw 
                        you eating my Greek yogurt. Just 
                        admit it.” (SHAKES HIS HEAD) It’s 
                        like she thinks the office fridge 
                        is a goddamn free-for-all.

           -- A guy who sells cellphones at the mall talks to Frank.

                                 GUY
                        I got a sick idea for a startup, 
                        bro. It's like Google, but for 
                        finding chicks.

           We ANGLE ON: FRANK’S PHONE. It’s a text from Vanessa: “Nice 
           car. You compensating for something?” 

           -- A tipsy soccer mom talks to Marty. 

                                 MOM
                        Basically, I’m either doin’ Zumba 
                        or fuckin’ partying. Look at this.
                             (re: a shitty tattoo)
                        Henna. 

           -- ROSS, a LIGHT-SKINNED BLACK GUY (an important detail for 
           later) and high-school burnout, talks to Frank, who continues 
           to not look up from his phone. 

                                 ROSS
                        You wanna go spark a J, get crispy? 
                        Or get into that Meow Meow.
                             (looks around)
                        Bath salts. 

           ANGLE ON: Frank’s phone again. (We see the previous text in 
           the thread.) He texts back: “It’s a hybrid. Unlike my dick, 
           which is straight diesel ;)” 

           -- Corporate bro, again talking to Marty.

                                 CORPORATE BRO
                        You want another brew? I’ll put it 
                        on my card. Just gonna get more 
                        miles.

           -- Ross, again to Frank.

                                 ROSS
                        You guys sold that company for like  
                        a billion dollars, right? Pretty 
                        cool.
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Mind if I borrow a hundred? I’ll 
                        hit you back.

           Back on Frank’s phone, a new text from Vanessa in the 
           exchange: “Show it 2 me. If I like, I’ll cum meet u.”

                                 FRANK
                             (to himself, as he exits)
                        What the fuck.

                                 ROSS
                        No worries. How about fifty?

           -- Finally, Marty and Kyle sit in a CORNER BOOTH with 
           N’DIQUE, the Nigerian exchange student from the graduation 
           party.

                                 N’DIQUE
                        I am now entrepreneur in e-mail 
                        marketing. Very web 2.0.

                                 MARTY
                        So you’re the Nigerian prince I’ve 
                        been getting all those emails from.

                                 N’DIQUE
                        You are first person to make this 
                        joke. Not. 

           He gets up and leaves. 

                                 MARTY
                        Shit, was I just racist?

                                 KYLE
                        Sounded like it.

           Just then, Kyle notices something across the room. He calmly 
           slides under the table until only his head pokes above it. 

                                 MARTY
                        What’re you doing?

           Kyle motions towards the stage with his head. Marty turns and 
           sees him: BILLY WILCHECK. Older and fatter, sure, but still 
           that same dick-ish face. He’s flanked by a SQUAT WOMAN with 
           spiky blond hair.

                                 KYLE
                        Stealth mode, Marty. Just staying 
                        off Billy’s radar ‘til the moment 
                        to strike presents itself. Then, 
                        death from above.  
                                 MARTY
                        So...you’re gonna hide under a 
                        table all night?

                                 KYLE
                        Not just under a table. In the 
                        shadows.

                                 MARTY
                        What does that even mean?  

                                 KYLE
                        Look, Marty, this isn’t Seal Team 
                        Six. I’m kind of figuring it out as 
                        I go. 

           Suddenly, Marty slides under the table, too. 

                                 MARTY
                        Shit, I think I just saw Hannah.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re not in stealth mode. Go talk 
                        to her.

                                 MARTY
                        Right.

           He pops back up and looks around, but doesn’t see her.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Damn, I lost her. What if Hannah 
                        saw me earlier and is avoiding me? 
                        What if she’s in stealth mode?!

           Suddenly, a girl comes up behind Marty and covers his eyes 
           with her hands. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE
                        Hey, hottie, wanna cheat on your 
                        girlfriend?   

           Marty turns to see...HANNAH JENSEN! She looks super cute: 
           Flannel shirt jeans, Converse sneakers, knit sweater. Like 
           she was just out picking apples or something. 

                                 MARTY
                        Oh my god, Hannah! 

           She comes around the booth and gives Marty a big hug. As she 
           goes to sit, she notices Kyle’s head poking out.

                                 KYLE
                        Hannah, hey!
           Kyle sits up.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        I was just...looking for my phone. 
                        (re: phone) Found it!  And now I 
                        can go to...somewhere else.
                             (then)
                        You look stunning, by the way. 

           Kyle gives Marty an “I don’t know” shrug as he slinks off. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (genuinely surprised)
                        Marty Miller. Wow. What are you 
                        doing here? 

                                 MARTY
                        Oh, you know, just home for the 
                        holidays. Figured I’d pop by the 
                        ol’ Windjammer, catch up with all 
                        the people who used to hate me. 

                                 HANNAH
                        To be fair, a lot of these people 
                        still hate you. 

           They both smile. 

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        God, it’s been ages! You know, 
                        every time a friend uses Siri, I’m 
                        like, “Hey, I took that guy’s 
                        virginity!”

                                 MARTY
                        I think it’s time to find something 
                        new to brag about.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, maybe now I can brag about 
                        you stalking me on Facebook.

                                 MARTY
                        I prefer to think of it as re-
                        connecting. 
                             (then)
                        Okay, fine, I was stalking. Why’d 
                        you get rid of the bangs, by the 
                        way? They were really working for 
                        you in those pics from Jillian’s 
                        wedding.  

           Hannah smiles as she takes Marty’s hand and looks at it. No 
           tattoo.
                                 HANNAH
                        Looks like you got rid of 
                        something, too.

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah. Turns out having an ex’s name 
                        inked on your ring finger is what 
                        they call a “red flag.” 

           Hannah laughs. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Man, it’s so crazy running into you 
                        like this. How’s the fam?

                                 HANNAH
                        Good, good. We’re all like ninety 
                        percent butter right now. You know 
                        how mom gets this time of year. 

                                 MARTY
                        I wish I loved anything as much as 
                        I love Viv’s pecan pie.

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, if you’re not doing anything 
                        tomorrow, you should come get some. 
                        I’m sure she’d love to see you. 

           Marty smiles. He’s in! 

                                 MARTY
                        I’d love to. 

           Just then, DOM, a skinny bearded hipster who looks like he 
           just finished chopping some very fashionable wood, comes 
           over. He hands a drink to Hannah.

                                 HANNAH
                        Thanks, babe. Oh, Marty, meet my 
                        boyfriend Dom. 

                                 DOM
                        Hey, Marty. 

           And...he’s not in. 

           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - MEN’S ROOM - LATER 

           Frank’s in a stall, attempting God’s work: trying to take a 
           compelling portrait of his genitals. The lighting, though, is 
           terrible. 
                                 FRANK
                        Goddammit! I cannot work in here! 

           There’s a knock on the stall door. 

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Frank?

           Frank opens the door.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up? I just got your text.

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, you’ve seen a bunch of dicks, 
                        right? Is it accurate to say I’ve 
                        got a “huge cock?”

                                 KYLE
                        You said you were having an 
                        emergency.

                                 FRANK
                             (showing Kyle his phone)
                        This is an emergency.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus, Frank! Is that a dead 
                        caterpillar?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s my shaft, isn’t it? It’s not 
                        long enough and it’s fucking up the 
                        whole perspective. 

           Kyle just shuts the door and walks away.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Shit. We’re gonna need a bigger 
                        dick.

                                 GUY’S VOICE (O.S.)
                             (from the next stall)
                        You guys haven’t changed at all. 

           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - TABLE AREA - LATER

           Marty, Dom, and Hannah sit in the booth. Not exactly the 
           reunion Marty was hoping for. 
                                 DOM
                        ...So been up here about eleven 
                        months now. Haven’t thought about 
                        Brooklyn since. 

                                 MARTY
                        And you don’t miss the city at all?  

                                 DOM
                             (earnest)
                        What’s to miss? I grow my own food, 
                        on land I own, next to neighbors I 
                        call friends. I mean, know what we 
                        had at breakfast today? Syrup from 
                        a young maple tapped in our own 
                        back yard. It’s good living. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (to Dom)
                        Marty hated it here growing up. 

           Marty senses he’s on the wrong side here.

                                 MARTY
                        Well, I used to hate a lot of 
                        things. But, the older I get, the 
                        more I realize how important it is 
                        to embrace the past. It’s what made 
                        us who we are.

                                 DOM
                        That sort of thinking actually 
                        seems regressive to me. It’s hard 
                        to grow as a person unless you move 
                        forward. Wasn’t it Dylan who said, 
                        “Don’t look back?”

                                 MARTY
                        I don’t know, Dom. I don’t frame my 
                        worldview around what some guy on 
                        “90210” said.

           A beat.

                                 DOM
                        I meant Bob Dylan. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (quickly)
                        Okay! How about more drinks?
           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - HALLWAY - LATER

           Frank scans the room for his Moby Dick. It’s tricky, though. 
           He’s brown. And the bar is a sea of white dudes... 

           Finally, near the door, he spots a BIG DARK GUY. Just as dark 
           as he is. Frank goes over and taps the guy on his shoulder.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey, man, I’m Frank. 

                                 DUDE
                        Jordan. 

                                 FRANK 
                        Jordan, great. Lemme ask you a 
                        question. You work out? 

                                 JORDAN
                        Nope, just naturally big I guess. 

                                 FRANK
                        Naturally big, huh? That’s perfect. 
                        So listen, Jordan. There’s no easy 
                        way to ask this, so I’ll just come 
                        right out with it: I’ll give you 
                        five hundred bucks for a picture of 
                        your dick. 

                                 JORDAN
                        What? 

                                 FRANK
                        It’s nothing weird. It’s just, I 
                        told this girl my dick is huge, and 
                        now she’s asking for proof. And not 
                        that it’s not big, but I don’t know 
                        if she’ll be impressed, exactly. 
                        Anyway, you look like a well-
                        endowed dude, all due respect, and 
                        (PUTTING HIS ARM NEXT TO JORDAN’S) 
                        it appears we have a match, so...

           Jordan just stares at Frank. 

                                 JORDAN
                        How ‘bout I send your girl a pic of 
                        me breaking off your tiny-ass dick?

                                 FRANK
                        Not into it. I get that.

           Frank slinks off. As he beelines across the bar, he bumps 
           into Ross, the pothead from before. Frank’s drink spills.
                                 ROSS
                        Shit, Frank, sorry about that. 

           Frank bends down to clean his shoe. He sees Ross’ huge feet. 

                                 FRANK
                        What size shoe you got there? 

                                 ROSS
                        Size thirteen. Why?  

           Hmm...Ross is also roughly Frank’s color. Frank looks around. 
           There’s one of those BAR PHOTO BOOTHS off to the side... 

                                 FRANK
                        Still want that hundred bucks, 
                        Ross?

           Kyle is back in his secluded booth. Watching. Waiting. An OLD 
           BEARDED GUY takes the stage. 

                                 BEARDED GUY
                        Good evening everyone, I’m Tri-
                        Cities superintendant Joe Callahan, 
                        and welcome to our 14th Annual 
                        Alumni Humanitarian night. 
                        (APPLAUSE) Now, I’m sure you guys 
                        would all rather get drunk than 
                        listen to me talk, so I’ll get 
                        right to it (LAUGHTER). This year’s 
                        honoree has worked tirelessly to 
                        enrich the lives of the less 
                        fortunate. He also got me a great 
                        deal my 55-inch Vizio. So lets give 
                        a big round of applause to your 
                        2012 Alumni Humanitarian of the 
                        year, Mr. Billy Wilcheck!

           Billy takes the stage just as Frank comes over. 

                                 FRANK
                        Just sent Vanessa a pic of some 
                        dude’s huge-ass dong. It’s on. 

           Kyle quickly shushes him. ON STAGE, Billy starts his speech.
                                 BILLY
                        Thanks, Joe. You know, when I 
                        started the Man Cave, I thought, “I 
                        just opened the first luxury 
                        electronics store devoted 
                        exclusively to men. What more could 
                        I want?” But then I realized I 
                        could help a bunch of poor African 
                        kids. And that’s why --

           Back on Frank and Kyle. 

                                 FRANK
                             (whispering)
                        So when are you getting up there? 

                                 KYLE
                        As soon as he’s done. 

           Frank takes his iPhone out and starts recording Billy. Off 
           Kyle’s look:

                                 FRANK
                        What am I, not gonna YouTube this?

           Marty is still with Hannah and Dom. He’s maybe overstayed his 
           welcome with Dom.  He sees Billy on stage. 

                                 MARTY
                             (getting up)
                        Hey, I’m gonna go check on Kyle and 
                        Frank real quick. If the waitress 
                        comes over, get me a vodka cran. 
                        (LOOKS AT DOM) Or a whiskey.

                                 DOM
                        You know, Hannah, we should 
                        probably get going.

                                 MARTY
                        Really?

                                 DOM
                        Yeah, it’s getting kind of late. 
                        Plus we got a big day tomorrow. 

                                 MARTY
                             (to Hannah)
                        Oh, okay. Well, what time we doing 
                        pie?  
                                 HANNAH
                        I’ll ask mom. Maybe around -- 

                                 DOM
                        Actually, Hannah, I was talking to 
                        your mom earlier, and it sounds 
                        like tomorrow’s gonna be kind of  
                        intimate. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (confused)
                        Really? 

                                 DOM
                        Yeah, more of a family thing.
                             (to Marty)
                        It was great meeting you.

           Dom gets up and starts putting his jacket on.  

                                 MARTY
                             (to Hannah)
                        You sure you don’t want to stick 
                        around? I’m sure the guys would 
                        love to see you. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Aww, the goof troop. I could stay 
                        for one more drink.  

                                 DOM
                        I don’t know, babe, the fun run 
                        starts pretty early.

                        Of course, the fun run... 
                        (SCRAMBLING) Guess I’ll see you 
                        guys out there.  

                                 HANNAH
                        You run? Since when? 

                                 MARTY
                        I was born to run.
                             (to Dom)
                        That’s Bruce Springsteen. Look him 
                        up.

           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - CORNER BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle and Frank watch as Billy wraps up his speech. 
                                 BILLY
                        Again, thanks to everyone. For 
                        those of you I won’t see at 
                        tomorrow night’s Donor Dinner, 
                        Happy Thanksgiving. And God bless 
                        America. And our troops.

           Applause. Kyle slams his drink.  

                                 KYLE
                        Go time. 

           Kyle heads towards the stage just as Superintendent Joe 
           greets Billy and takes back the mic. 

                                 JOE
                        What a guy. Hard to believe just a 
                        few years ago, he looked like this.  

           On the FLATSCREEN TV behind Joe, and the numerous ones  
           around the bar, Billy’s HIGH-SCHOOL YEARBOOK photo appears. 
           The audience laughs. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t laugh too hard -- ya’ll are 
                        next.(MORE LAUGHTER). Before we 
                        wrap it up, we thought it’d be fun 
                        to have a little slide show of all 
                        your old yearbook photos, alongside 
                        new ones taken tonight in the photo 
                        booth. Happy Thanksgiving!  

           The SLIDESHOW starts as Billy and Joe exit the stage. Kyle 
           passes right by Billy, who does a double-take.   

                                 BILLY
                        Kyle Cooper? What the fuck?   

           Kyle bounds onto the stage and takes the mic. 

                                 KYLE
                        Excuse me, everyone. I’m Kyle 
                        Cooper, class of ‘01, and I have a 
                        few thoughts of my own about our 
                        beloved Billy Wilcheck. Something 
                        of a counterpoint... 

           He glares at Billy and smiles. Checkmate.  

           Suddenly, there are LOUD GASPS and FITS OF LAUGHTER as people 
           point at the monitors. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        What? 
           He turns around. There, on the screen behind him, is someone 
           who looks suspiciously like Frank, TAKING A PICTURE OF SOME 
           GUY’S DICK. 

           Everyone is now staring and laughing at Frank.  

                                 FRANK
                        Whoa whoa whoa, that is not what it 
                        looks like!

           The next photo cycles through. It explicitly shows Frank’s 
           face near the guy’s crotch. 

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Hey Siri, why is Frank such a fag?!

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        You take that with Dickstagram?

           Frank bolts to the stage, where Kyle is trying to restore 
           order.

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, if I could just have 
                        everyone’s attention for just one --  

                                 FRANK
                        Dude, turn that shit off!

                                 KYLE
                             (covering the mic)
                        With what?! Jesus Christ Frank, 
                        what the fucking fuck?  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey baby dick!

           Frank turns to see JORDAN, the bouncer, standing there. 

                                 JORDAN
                        You and your friend got five 
                        seconds to get the fuck out my bar.

           INT. THE WINDJAMMER - TABLE AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Marty, Hannah, and Dom watch the madness unfold.

                                 DOM
                        Cool friends.

                                 MARTY
                        I should probably go. 
                                 HANNAH
                             (laughing)
                        I think that’s a good idea. 

           They ad-lib goodbyes. Marty races over to Frank and Kyle, who 
           are now being escorted to the front door by Jordan.

                                 MARTY
                             (meekly, as he exits)
                        Go T.C. Panthers. 

           EXT. THE WINDJAMMER - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Frank, Marty and Kyle walk to their car, defeated.

                                 KYLE
                        How is it possible I wasn’t the 
                        gayest guy in there? 

                                 MARTY
                        Because Frank’s a fucking idiot, 
                        that’s how. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, I’m the idiot? How’d you not 
                        know Hannah has a boyfriend? 

                                 MARTY
                        He wasn’t in any of her Facebook 
                        pics.

                                 FRANK
                        Ahh, she put you on limited 
                        profile. Veteran play. 

           The guys are at their car when Kyle hears a voice: 

                                 BILLY (O.S.)
                        Hey, Kyle. Nice try in there. 

           They guys turn around to see Billy standing there. Jordan the 
           bouncer is a few steps behind.  

           Suddenly, Billy snatches the car keys out of Frank’s hands. 

                                 FRANK
                        Hey!

           Before Frank can react, Jordan steps in. Billy flings the 
           keys as far as he can into the darkness. 
                                 BILLY
                        You might be hot shit down in dick 
                        suck city, but remember: this is my 
                        town.

           As Billy and Jordan laugh, the squat, spiky-haired blonde 
           Billy was with before comes stumbling over, drunk. This is 
           his wife, TRICIA (foul-mouthed, pugnacious.)

                                 TRICIA
                             (slurring, to Billy)
                        C’mon, let’s go. I wanna hit Arby’s 
                        before the drive-thru closes.

           She notices Kyle and eyes him up and down.

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Ooh, look at Ken Doll, all cut up, 
                        shredded. 
                             (to Billy)
                        Wouldn’t kill you to do a sit-up.

                                 BILLY
                             (under his breath)
                        Why don’t you do a fucking sit-up? 

                                 TRICIA
                        What’d you say? 

                                 BILLY
                        Nothing, babe. C’mon, let’s go.

           Billy, Tricia, and Jordan start to walk away.

                                 TRICIA
                        Did you invite Ken Doll to the 
                        donor dinner?  
                             (turning around, to Kyle)
                        Starts at six. Wear something 
                        slutty. 

           As they exit: 

                                 FRANK
                        Hey Billy! 

           Billy turns around. Is Frank starting shit? 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You see Vanessa Daniels lately? 

           Billy ignores him and keeps walking. The guys stare at Frank.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What? She never texted me back. 

           EXT. MARTY’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           A middle-class home. Piles of leaves in the yard. Frank’s 
           dumb-ass Navigator is parked out front.

           INT. MARTY’S KITCHEN - SAME

           Frank and Kyle are eating breakfast in Marty’s kitchen. It’s 
           a little tense from last night. 

                                 FRANK
                        Pretty good eggs, huh?

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe you should stick your dick in 
                        ‘em and send a picture to Marty’s 
                        mom.

           Marty’s mom, GLORIA (a dishy, “US Weekly”-loving housewife) 
           comes over with pancakes. 

                                 KYLE
                        Nothing, Mrs. Miller. Thanks again 
                        for having us.

                        Oh stop it, it’s nothing. Though I 
                        must say, we were very excited to 
                        meet this Zoe that Marty’s been 
                        telling us about. 
                             (then)
                        So gimme the goss, are they donezo?

                                 FRANK
                        Hard to say, Gloria. Marty can be 
                        fickle in matters of the heart.    

                                 GLORIA
                        You’re so right, Frankie. Always 
                        the wise one.

           Frank smiles at Kyle as Gloria crosses off to get more food.
                                 FRANK
                        You gonna stay mad all day? In case 
                        you forgot, it’s Thanksgiving, so 
                        you kind of have to be nice to 
                        Indians. 

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry if I’m a little peeved I have 
                        to un-fuck your fuck-up.

                                 FRANK
                        I agree, that was my bad. But I’m 
                        willing to put that behind us and 
                        help you figure out this Billy 
                        situation. So let’s think: what 
                        does he love that you can take 
                        away?
                             (then, “a-ha”-like)
                        Does he have a jet ski?  

                                 KYLE
                        You know what I know, Frank. He’s 
                        got a wife and a store. 

                                 FRANK
                        Saw the wife. Not an asset.
                             (then)
                        I mean, Billy’s no show pony 
                        himself, but damn, why’s he still 
                        married to that? 

                                 GLORIA (O.S.)
                        Why do you think, Frankie?

           Gloria crosses back with a plate of bacon. She rubs her 
           fingers together to indicate “money.”

                        Debbie Manus’ husband works down at 
                        the bank. Apparently, Billy came in

           Marty enters wearing his old, now ill-fitting Tri-Cities High 
           gym uniform (long tube socks, matching shorts and t-shirt).

                        Me and the gals from book club made 
                        t-shirts and everything. They say 
                        (PROUDLY) “Shop ‘Till They Drop.”

           Marty comes over to get some food. The guys look at him. 

                                 KYLE
                        Cool Umbros, bra. 

                                 MARTY
                        It’s all I had. I wasn’t expecting 
                        to run a goddamn marathon today.

           Frank’s phone buzzes. He checks it. 

                                 FRANK
                        You look like you’re not expecting 
                        to get laid, either. But I am!

           He shows his phone to Marty and Kyle. We ANGLE ON a series of 
           texts from Vanessa: 

           - Sorry babe, fell asleep last night. Luv that big dick. I’m 
           at 342 Magnolia Drive. Bring lube. And condoms. Magnums ;) 

           - Oh yeah, and cranberry sauce, pie crust, and canned yams. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        She said my dick’s big. 

                                 KYLE
                        Not your dick, but, semantics. 

                                 FRANK
                        Where am I gotta get cranberry 
                        sauce, pie crust, yams, lube, and 
                        condoms?

                                 FRANK
                             (uneasy)
                        Thanks, Mrs. M. 

           EXT. PARK - 5K FUN RUN - LATER

           A brisk Autumn day. Runners in fleece are lined up under a 
           banner that reads “Tri-Cities 2012 Turkey Trot.” 

           Marty sees Hannah and Dom and jogs over. Hannah hears his 
           panting and turns around. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Marty, you actually came.

                                 MARTY
                             (sucking wind)
                        Well, if I hid out every time Frank 
                        humiliated me, I’d never leave the 
                        house.

                                 DOM
                             (friendly)
                        Glad you made it.  
                             (re: Marty’s panting)
                        Hope you saved a little gas for the 
                        actual race.

                                 MARTY
                        Don’t worry about me, Bon Iver.

                                 DOM
                        I think it’s “Bone-E-Vare.”

           Hannah starts stretching. Marty eyes Dom’s getup: bandana, 
           thermal underwear, and those weird running shoes with rubber 
           toes. Like most hipsters, he doesn’t look very athletic...

                                 MARTY
                        Hey, Bone, whaddyou you say we make 
                        this interesting? 

                                 DOM
                        A bet? This is a fun-run, man. 

                                 MARTY
                        Let’s make it a little more fun. I 
                        win, I come by Hannah’s later for 
                        some pie. 
           Dom eyes Marty.

                                 DOM
                        Okay. So if I win, you come by 
                        Hannah’s...never? 

                                 MARTY
                        See you at the finish line.

           They shake hands as Hannah rejoins them. 

                                 DOM
                        Hey babe, where’d I place in the 
                        Boston Marathon?

                                 HANNAH
                        Stop bragging, it’s a charity run.  

                                 DOM
                             (whispers, to Marty)
                        Under three hours. 
                             (regular voice)
                        I’ll see you at the finish line.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                             (through a megaphone)
                        Okay, racers! On your marks, get 
                        set, gobble gobble go!

           A cap gun sounds. Dom and Hannah sprint off the line. They’re 
           fast.

                                 MARTY
                        Goddammit. 

           EXT. A&P GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT -- LATER THAT DAY 

           Establishing shots of a suburban grocery store.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - CONTINUOUS 

           Kyle opens his door to get out. Frank hands him a list.

                                 FRANK
                        Make sure you get everything on 
                        here. And be quick. I gotta trim my 
                        pubes when we get back.

           Kyle gives Frank a “You’ve got to be kidding me” look.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. What if my mom’s inside? 
                        Can’t risk it.
                             (off Kyle’s look)
                        You have cash, by the way? Left my 
                        wallet at home.

           INT. A&P GROCERY STORE -- LATER 

           Kyle pokes his head down an aisle.

                                 KYLE
                        All clear.

           Frank pushes a cart around the corner. 

                                 FRANK
                        So what now? 

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t know, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        You wanna know what I would do if I 
                        were you?

                                 KYLE
                        Not really.

                                 FRANK
                        I’d fuck his wife. 

           Kyle stops to look at Frank. 

                                 KYLE
                        Sometimes, the shit that comes out 
                        of your mouth really makes me 
                        question my friendship with you. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m serious. Pretend you’re a small-
                        minded homophobe. You know what 
                        would really piss you off? A known 
                        homosexual running his dick up in 
                        your wife. Best part is, you heard 
                        Marty’s mom -- he can’t afford a 
                        divorce. He’d just have to live 
                        with it.   

                                 KYLE
                        I’m not fucking his wife, Frank.
                                 FRANK
                        Why, ‘cause you’re gay? She looks 
                        like Guy Fieri, and you’d probably 
                        fuck him. After a few drinks. 

                                 KYLE
                        It doesn’t work like that. I mean, 
                        would you bang a dude if it meant 
                        you got to have sex with Vanessa?

           Frank gives this some thought. 

                                 FRANK
                        Matthew McConaughey? 

                                 KYLE
                        A regular dude. 

                                 FRANK
                        Well, I wouldn’t put my dick in a 
                        butt. But I’m secure enough in my 
                        sexuality that I’d maybe poke 
                        around down there. Hands only.

           A clerk walks by. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, where’s the cranberry 
                        sauce?

                                 CLERK
                        Aisle seven. 

                                 FRANK
                        Wow, Marty’s mom knows her shit.

                                 KYLE
                        Look, fucking his wife is not an 
                        option. I’m not one of your party 
                        sluts who just bangs people willy-
                        nilly.  

           Frank stops in his tracks. A light bulb goes off...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. A&P GROCERY STORE - LATER

           Frank holds a bag of groceries and talks into his phone as 
           Kyle walks next to him. They head towards Frank’s car. 
                                 FRANK
                        Mm-hmm. We’ll pick you up at the 
                        train station at four. 
                             (then)
                        No, I don’t have coke, but we can 
                        round you up a couple Red Bulls or 
                        something. Okay, buh-bye.

           He hangs up.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re sure about this girl. 

                                 FRANK
                        Chloe’s great, total pro. 

                                 KYLE
                        You mean a prostitute. 

                                 FRANK
                        She’s a “VIP club hostess.” Like 
                        one of those girls Tiger Woods was 
                        banging. 

                                 KYLE
                        You mean a prostitute. 

                                 FRANK
                        She just likes to party, okay? And 
                        judging by his emails, so does 
                        Billy.  

                                 KYLE
                        That’s true...

                                 FRANK
                        Trust me, Operation Black Friday is 
                        airtight: We go to that stupid 
                        donor dinner, set up a camera in 
                        the bathroom, and let Chloe do her 
                        thing. Then tomorrow, in the middle 
                        of his most important day of the 
                        year, you pop in video of Billy 
                        banging some bimbo on all two-
                        hundred HD TVs at the Man Cave. 
                        Either his wife leaves him and he 
                        goes broke, or you ruin his sale 
                        and he goes broke. No matter what, 
                        you win.

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t know, this just sounds sort 
                        of beneath us. Well, beneath me. 
                                 FRANK
                        Cool. Guess you’re just gonna have 
                        to fuck his wife then. 

           Kyle thinks about this for a beat. 

                                 KYLE
                        Operation Black Friday it is.  

           They’re at Frank’s car. Frank hands Kyle the grocery bag and 
           goes to open his door. Kyle peeks inside.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Magnums, huh? 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s what she asked for. 

                                 KYLE 
                        Yes, but that’s because you texted 
                        her a picture of a penis that is 
                        substantially larger than your own. 

                                 FRANK
                        So, she’ll be underwhelmed. I’m 
                        okay with that.  

                                 KYLE
                        Right. But you’re still gonna wanna 
                        have sex with her. And I don’t 
                        think those will work. 

           Frank considers this. He takes a condom out of the box and 
           opens it. It unfurls, like a floppy, giant tube sock. 

                                 FRANK
                        Holy shit. I could fit a chicken 
                        cutlet in this thing.

           Frank holds the condom near his penis and looks down, sadly.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Awww, man. She specifically asked 
                        for Magnums! She said the gold 
                        wrapper “gets her pussy wet.”

                        Maybe you could tie a tourniquet 
                        around the base. Or secure it with 
                        a rubber band. Or put it on your 
                        foot and fuck her that way.

           Oh, SHIT. That’s a voice Frank knows. He turns to see his 
           mom, LENA (short, stern-looking) STARING RIGHT AT HIM! He 
           quickly flings the condom aside.

                        What are you doing here? I thought 
                        you were doing charity project in 
                        Haiti.

                                 FRANK
                        I was. I...fixed Haiti. So I 
                        decided to come home early and, uh, 
                        surprise you. Surprise! 

           She picks up the grocery bag near Frank’s feet and starts 
           rifling through it. Frank tries to stop her.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mom, please --

           He’s too late. Out come the pie crust and whipped cream...

                                 LENA
                        Aww, Franky, you were planning on 
                        baking pie for your mother?

           ...then the tube of lube and the open box of condoms.

                        Get in the car. 

                                 FRANK
                        Mom, please, I just need --

                                 LENA
                        The car. Now. 

           He’s not gonna win this one. Frank gives Kyle the car keys.

                                 KYLE
                        What about Chloe?
           Frank just gives him a “I’m sorry, man” shrug. As he and his 
           mom walk away, Lena slaps him across the back of the head. 

                                 LENA
                        Chloe? That is who the 
                        prophylactics are for? 

           EXT. PARK - LATER

           Marty’s at the 1K marker of the race, and not in good shape. 
           A FAT DAD in a plush TURKEY SUIT breezes by. 

                                 MARTY
                        Son of a. 

           He tries to kick it up a notch, but only makes it a few yards 
           before keeling over. 

           On the other side of the street, in the shoulder, TWO TEENAGE 
           BOYS cruise by on SEGWAYS. Hmm. Marty crosses the street and 
           flags one of them down. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Hey! (re: Segway) How much you 
                        pay for that thing?

                                 TEENAGER #1 
                        It’s not for sale.

                                 MARTY
                        Oh, I get it. You got those as part 
                        of your virginity pledges.

                                 TEENAGER #2
                             (looking at friend)
                        You can buy mine. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PARK - WOODS - LATER

           Marty cruises down a well-worn path in the woods on his new 
           whip. 

           Up ahead, through some trees, he sees Hannah and Dom coming 
           down the final stretch. He guns it. As he reaches the 
           clearing, going a little too fast, he hits a rock and 
           CRASHES. He scrambles to his feet and merges back into the 
           race. With a final burst, he passes Dom.  

                                 DOM
                        What the?!  
           Dom quickly catches Marty. They’re neck-and-neck. With 30m to 
           go, Dom kicks into overdrive and blows by him. 

           Shiiiit. Marty looks back and sees Hannah a few paces behind. 
           Time for an audible. He clutches his knee and dramatically 
           falls to the ground.

                                 MARTY
                        Ahhh!

                                 HANNAH
                             (catching up)
                        Oh my God, Marty! Are you okay?

           Dom comes over.  

                                 DOM
                        What happened?

                                 MARTY
                        It’s my A...CL. Must have tweaked 
                        it warming up. Probably why I was 
                        so slow.  

                                 DOM
                        I’m a certified first-responder, 
                        lemme take a look. 

           He kneels down next to Marty. As soon as he touches Marty’s 
           knee, Marty shrieks. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh my god, Marty, are you okay? Do 
                        you need us to call anyone?

                                 MARTY
                        It’s fine. My folks are out of 
                        town, but I can get a cab. 

           Hannah looks at Marty, all pathetic-like. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Your parents aren’t home?

                                 MARTY
                        It’s fine, really. There’s a 
                        RoboCop marathon on TNT, and they 
                        left some fish sticks in the 
                        freezer, so... 

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re not spending Thanksgiving 
                        watching cable by yourself. 
                                 DOM 
                        Hannah, I really think -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        Dom, please. Let’s help him up.  

           Hannah and an exasperated Dom help Marty up.

                                 MARTY
                        Thanks, guys.
                             (then)
                        So should we swing by my house and 
                        grab those fish sticks?  

           INT. FRANK’S PARENTS KITCHEN - LATER

           It’s Frank’s worst-case scenario: he’s a hostage in his own 
           home. He holds a big bowl in the kitchen as his mom and a 
           bunch of aunts zip around. Every time one passes him, they 
           add something to the bowl (sugar, flour, etc.)

           An aunt comes over and pinches Frank’s cheek.  

                                 AUNT #1
                        Frank, how skinny you’ve become. 
                        They don’t feed you in the city?  

           His mom cracks an egg into the bowl and starts whisking. 

                                 LENA
                             (to Aunt)
                        You better wash your hands. God 
                        knows where his face has been. 

                                 FRANK
                        Mom, please.

                                 LENA 
                        Please what? You don’t call, you 
                        don’t come home. What do you do 
                        with yourself?

                                 FRANK
                        I have a job, you know.

                                 LENA
                        Intercourse with white girls from 
                        the discotheque is not a job.

           She stops whisking and crosses off. 
                                 AUNT #2
                        We have girl for you, Frankie. Your 
                        Auntie Bindu’s family friend is 
                        very nice, very sharp.

                        She has 3.8 G.P.A. from Wharton!

                                 AUNT #2
                        I sent you link with her biodata. 
                        She sings and has mastered the 
                        bassoon, Frankie. Plus she scored 
                        third place on “Jeopardy” last 
                        year! 

                                 FRANK
                        There are only three places on 
                        Jeopardy. 

           His mom is back with a bag of chocolate chips.

                                 LENA
                        She will be here soon. You will 
                        meet her and you will like her and 
                        that is that. Now go get milk from 
                        the garage and get in the shower. 

                                 FRANK
                        I showered this morning, mom.
                             (off her look)
                        Fine. 

           Frank sticks his hand into the batter. She slaps it away.

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - TRAIN STATION - LATER

           Kyle sits in Frank’s car awaiting Chloe’s arrival. A 
           Christmas song plays on the radio. Switch. Another Christmas 
           song comes on. Switch. Then, a local commercial: 

                                 BILLY’S VOICE

                        Black Friday, our doors open--

           Kyle’s PHONE RINGS, cutting off the radio. It’s Frank. 
           INTERCUT between Kyle and Frank, who is in his garage getting 
           milk for his mom. 

                                 KYLE
                        Hello?
                                 FRANK
                        Okay, my phone’s about to die so 
                        here’s the plan. Park in front of 
                        the Levys’ house and honk three 
                        times. I’ll be out five to forty-
                        five minutes later, depending on --

                                 KYLE
                        Whoa, dude, I can’t pick you up. 
                        I’m at the station getting Chloe.

           We hear the CHOO-CHOO of a train arriving.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Fraaaaaaaaanky!

                                 FRANK
                             (covering receiver)
                        I’m coming!
                             (back to Kyle)
                        Dude, I’m fucking dying here. Plus 
                        it’s my car. Come get me!  

                                 KYLE
                        No time. Gotta set the camera up 
                        before dinner starts. 

           Kyle scans the platform...

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        By the way, what’s Chloe look like? 
                        I don’t have her number. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not telling unless you promise 
                        to come get me.

           And he sees her. Strutting across the platform, hotter than 
           anyone on an Amtrack, ever, is CHLOE (blonde, Australian, 
           slutty-looking.) 

                                 KYLE
                        Nevermind! 

           We hear FRANK YELLING into the phone as Kyle hangs up.

           INT. FRANK’S PARENTS’ GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank hangs up the phone.

                                 FRANK
                        Fucker.
           As he closes the fridge, he hears a car pull into the 
           driveway. Doors slam. Footsteps. The doorbell rings.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Frank! Thu kya ghay? Jul-thee karo!

           Just then, his phone vibrates. It’s a text from Vanessa: 
           “WHERE THAT DICK AT??” A second later, it vibrates again: “I 
           WANT IT IN MY MOUTH.”

                                 FRANK
                        Fuuuuck.

           Frank stares at his mom’s car. He opens the door, but there 
           are no keys. He starts typing “HOW TO HOTWIRE A HYUNDAI 
           ELANTRA” into his phone, but it DIES. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Fucking fuck!

           He gets out of the car and looks around. There, peeking out 
           from a box of junk, are his OLD ROLLERBLADES. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (epiphany)
                        Fuck yeah.

           Lena and assorted guests are on the front porch. Lena talks 
           to AN INDIAN GIRL whose back is to us. 

                                 LENA
                        I tell you, he’s a sweet boy. Very 
                        ready for something serious. 

           Suddenly, Frank bursts out of the garage on his blades, 
           skating away as fast as he can.

                                 LENA (CONT’D)
                        Fareed! What are you doing?!

                                 FRANK
                        Sorry, mom! Be back before dinner! 

           And he’s gone. 

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - LATER

           Kyle and Chloe drive through the empty streets of the Tri-
           Cities. It’s a little awkward. 
                                 KYLE
                        So, uh, thanks again for coming on 
                        such short notice.

                                 CHLOE
                        No problem. I hate the holidays, 
                        anyway. Clubs are always dead. 
                             (then)
                        Where’s Frank, by the way? Are you 
                        his driver or something? 

                                 KYLE
                        Frank got held up with some family 
                        stuff. We’re gonna meet him later.

           Kyle drives in silence for a beat, unsure how to proceed.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Speaking of Frank, did he tell you 
                        why he wanted you to come up here? 

                                 CHLOE
                        He just said he needed a favor at a 
                        party. Frank always has the best 
                        parties.  

                                 KYLE
                        He didn’t say what the favor was? 

                                 CHLOE
                        No. But he took me to Miami one 
                        time, so I pretty much owe him. 

                                 KYLE
                        Right. 

           Chloe looks out the window at all the DILAPIDATED BUILDINGS 
           and VACANT LOTS.

                                 CHLOE
                        We going to a warehouse rave or 
                        something? 

                                 KYLE
                        Sort of. He really didn’t give you 
                        any details?

                                 CHLOE 
                        Nope.
                             (then)
                        I mean I assume I’m supposed to 
                        bang some guy, but other than that, 
                        not a lot of info.
           Kyle turns to Chloe. Seriously? 

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Can we stop at a Bev Barn? I need 
                        vodka like I need a dick in my 
                        mouth. 

           INT. HANNAH’S PARENTS HOUSE - LATER

           Marty’s laid up on Hannah’s couch, an ice pack by his side. 
           Hannah enters, holding WATER and ADVIL. He quickly places the 
           ice pack back on his leg. She hands him the pills.

                                 HANNAH
                        If these don’t work we’re putting 
                        you down. 

           Hannah smiles and sits down next to him. She picks up a 
           magazine. Side by side, they look kind of...couple-y.

                                 MARTY
                        So this is exactly how I imagined 
                        we’d be spending Thanksgiving when 
                        I proposed. Except with a couple  
                        kids instead of a stylish 
                        lumberjack. 

           She laughs.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        He really steel-cuts his own oats? 

                                 HANNAH
                        He does, but come on. Our break-up 
                        was the best thing that ever 
                        happened to you.

                                 MARTY
                        It was? I must’ve forget to thank 
                        you when I was sobbing in my dorm, 
                        listening to Destiny’s Child tell 
                        me I’m a survivor. 

                                 HANNAH
                        C’mon, Marty, if we’d stayed 
                        together, you would have spent 
                        every weekend visiting me -- 

                                 MARTY
                        And it would have been great.  
                                 HANNAH
                        And it would have been holding you 
                        back. Instead, you did your own 
                        thing. And now look at you.
                             (then)
                        Well, you look pathetic right now. 
                        But on two good legs, I’m sure you 
                        do fine with the ladies. 

                                 MARTY
                        I do. It’s just, meeting people you 
                        really connect with? That’s hard. 

                                 HANNAH
                        It is, isn’t it.

           Hannah’s parents, GARY and VIV (they love Marty, Marty loves 
           them), enter. Viv has a bottle of wine and two glasses. 

                                 VIV
                        The last time you guys were on this 
                        couch, I could only offer cider. 

           Viv fills up the glasses and hands them to Hannah and Marty. 

                                 MARTY
                        I like this time more.

           Marty raises his glass to toast.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        To not drinking cider.

                                 HANNAH
                             (looking at Marty)
                        To old friends.

           As everyone clinks, Dom enters. He’s thrown by the joviality.

                                 DOM
                             (to Hannah)
                        We should probably get going. 

                                 MARTY
                        Where you guys headed?

                                 HANNAH
                             (getting up)
                        To get the turkey. Should be back 
                        in an hour. 

                                 MARTY
                        An hour? Isn’t the A&P like five 
                        minutes away?
                                 DOM
                        We’re purchasing a humanely-killed 
                        bird from a local farm. Just trying 
                        to be a little more conscientious 
                        about our food choices.  

           Marty watches Hannah and Dom head for the door. He had some 
           momentum going before... 

                                 MARTY
                        Wait, I’ll come, too. I’m totes 
                        locavore these days. 

           He gets up and “limps” to his jacket.

                                 HANNAH
                        You sure you’re okay?

                                 DOM
                        Yeah, shouldn’t you rest your leg? 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m fine. A little stretch will 
                        probably help, anyway.
                             (to Dom)
                        You don’t mind sitting in the back, 
                        right?

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER 

           Kyle and Chloe sit in the car parked outside of Billy’s club, 
           which is more Elk’s Lodge than Augusta National. Chloe’s 
           chasing swigs of vodka with Sugar-Free Red Bull. Kyle fiddles 
           with a Flip Cam. 

                                 CHLOE
                             (re: Sugar-Free Red Bull)
                        I switched to sugar-free a few 
                        months ago. It’s just, like, 
                        cleaner, more natural, you know?  

                                 KYLE
                        I bet. Anyway, so let’s run through 
                        the plan one more time: While I 
                        (re: camera) set this up, you track 
                        down Billy and wait for my signal. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Right. 

                                 KYLE
                        Then you get him in the bathroom 
                        and...
                                 CHLOE
                        And...?

                                 KYLE
                        You know... 

                                 CHLOE
                        I don’t know.

                                 KYLE
                        You know, take Billy and, uh...

                                 CHLOE
                        Relax, Kyle, I’m kidding. You act 
                        like this is the first time I’ve 
                        fucked on camera. 

           Kyle half-laughs to see if she’s joking. She’s not.

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Just remember to keep his wife 
                        away. I don’t need some crazy bitch 
                        coming at me with a hammer. Not 
                        again. 

                                 KYLE
                        Got it. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Seriously, his wife catches me, I’m 
                        coming at you with a hammer.  

           Kyle looks to see if she’s joking. Again, she’s not.

                                 KYLE
                        No wife, no hammers, no problem. 
                             (then)
                        Out of curiosity, how are you gonna 
                        get Billy into the bathroom?

           Chloe reaches into the back seat and grabs a slinky black 
           dress out of her suitcase. She strips off her top. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Dunno. Probably just gonna grab his 
                        dick.

           Kyle checks her out. Not that he’s a boob guy, but man. 

                                 KYLE
                        That should do it. 
           EXT. ECO-VALLEY TURKEY COMMUNE - LATER 

           Marty, Dom, and Hannah are at the Eco-Valley Turkey Commune, 
           a rustic local farm. Marty “limps” along as their guide, KAI 
           (30s, NPR glasses, dirty overalls), gives them a tour. 

                                 KAI
                        Our birds all live happy lives. 
                        It’s very sustainable here.

           The turkeys mill about in a big chicken-wire pen, making high-
           pitched, slightly frightening gobble noises.

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        Our most important job is making 
                        sure they’re never scared when they 
                        die. We want them calm at the end 
                        of their journey. It’s their 
                        purpose.

           Kai tenderly puts her hand out to a bird, which pecks at it. 

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        Who wants to accept the sacred gift 
                        of life?

                                 MARTY
                        Wait, what? 

                                 KAI
                        Who will be performing the cut?

                                 MARTY
                        You want one of us to kill it?

           Dom senses Marty’s discomfort. 

                                 DOM
                        I was lucky enough to experience 
                        this miracle last year. It would be 
                        greedy to do it again.

                                 MARTY
                        By all means, be greedy.

                                 HANNAH
                        Honestly, Marty, it’s good to be 
                        connected with what you eat. 

                                 DOM
                        You know what, Kai, I’ll do it. 
                        Marty’s obviously more comfortable 
                        in a Whole Foods.
           A turkey comes over and starts pecking at Marty’s shoe. Marty 
           looks at Hannah. Off his look, we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TURKEY FARM - KILLING PEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Marty’s in the pen with Kai as Dom and Hannah look on from 
           outside the fence. There is blood everywhere. 

                                 KAI
                        So which one are you grateful for?

           Marty spots a sleeping turkey. 

                                 MARTY
                        That guy’s lookin’ pretty good.

                                 DOM
                        What about that one?

           Dom points at the biggest, snarling-est, meanest-looking 
           motherfucker in the pen. 

                                 KAI
                        A lovely choice. Come. 

           Kai leads Marty over to the bird. She straddles it and gently 
           strokes its face before slipping a sleeve over its torso. 

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        The muscles, as they move, as they 
                        die, are very strong. The energy, 
                        the force of life leaving, it’s 
                        almost startling.
                             (is she starting to weep?)
                        I’m sorry, it’s just...they know. 
                        They know it’s their purpose. See 
                        how calm she is? Here, pet her.

           Marty hesitantly touches the bird, who immediately starts 
           squawking. 

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        Please, softly. We must maintain 
                        serenity in her final moments.

           Kai takes the bird in her own hands, calming it down. She 
           then pulls a huge KNIFE from her boot and hands it to Marty.

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                             (to Marty, but looking at 
                              the turkey)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        Shhh...look into her eyes. Tell her 
                        to be still.

           Marty grips the knife and looks at the bird. It looks pissed.

                                 MARTY
                        Please, bird...be still.

                                 KAI
                             (business-like)
                        One firm cut across the gullet 
                        should do it. 

           Marty looks the bird in the eye. Can he really do this? He 
           takes a deep breath and clenches the knife when suddenly, the 
           bird RIPS OFF ITS SLEEVE LIKE SUPERMAN AND EXPLODES FORWARD, 
           knocking him over. It begins to FURIOUSLY PECK AT MARTY! 

                                 KAI (CONT’D)
                        Please! No violence!

           Marty springs to his feet and retreats, shrieking. He tries 
           to maintain his “hobble,” but the bird chases after him.

                                 MARTY
                             (dropping the knife)
                        Look! Look! I’m your friend!

           The bird is not interested in being friends.  

           Out of options, Marty starts sprinting and LEAPS OVER THE 
           FENCE. His foot clips the top, causing him to tumble as he 
           lands on the other side, heaving but safe.

           But this is one angry bird. In a feat of strength not often 
           associated with turkeys, she LEAPS OVER THE FENCE! In a 
           whirlwind of feathers and squawks, she’s back on Marty before 
           he can even get up.

           It’s Man vs. Wild as he struggles to put the bird in a 
           headlock. 

                                 KAI
                        Please! Don’t hurt her!

           Dom rushes over and yanks the bird off Marty, causing them to 
           both hit the deck. Dom gets up, holding the bird, and heads 
           back towards the pen.

                                 DOM
                        I got you, I got you.

           As Marty rolls off his back, he notices something on the 
           ground where Dom fell: A RING. 
           He picks it up and takes a closer look -- it’s an engagement 
           ring. He glances at Dom, then pockets it just as Kai comes 
           over. 

                                 KAI
                        Okay, asshole, get the fuck off my 
                        farm!

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - HALLWAY - LATER 

           Kyle, wearing a back pack, pokes his head around the corner 
           of a long hallway. All clear. He sneaks into the MENS ROOM.

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle surveys the scene: In one corner is a toilet. In another 
           is a sink/mirror combo. A third wall has two urinals (one is 
           lower, for kids.) Finally, there’s a potted plant. Kyle looks 
           around, then removes the camera from his backpack and 
           conceals it at the base of the plant. He steps back.  

                                 KYLE
                        Hmmm. 

           While still looking at the camera, Kyle moves around the room 
           and MIMES HAVING SEX IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS (against a wall, 
           bent over the sink, on the floor). He then goes back to the 
           camera and checks the playback to make sure all angles are 
           covered. Satisfied, he puts the Flip Cam back in the pot and 
           texts Chloe: “CAMERA IS IN THE PLANT.” 

           INT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - LATER

           Thanksgiving dinner. Except instead of turkey, two BOSTON 
           MARKET ROTISSERIE CHICKENS sit in their sad plastic cases. 

           Oh, and Dom has also realized he doesn’t have the ring. 

                                 MARTY
                        You know who else spared a turkey’s 
                        life this year? President Obama. 

           Dom tries to inconspicuously scan the floor for the ring. 

                                 HANNAH
                             (to Dom)
                        Everything okay? You seem fidgety. 

                                 DOM
                        Yes, babe, everything’s great.
                                 MARTY
                        Especially the pumpkin soup. Is 
                        that creme fraiche I taste, Mrs. J? 

                                 VIV
                        I’ll never tell. Everyone just make 
                        sure to save room for dessert.   

           Viv winks at Dom. She’s clearly expecting him to propose. Dom 
           gets up. 

                                 DOM
                        You know what, guys, I think I 
                        dropped my wallet at the farm. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Really? Want me to come help you 
                        look?

                                 DOM 
                        No, you stay here. But I should get 
                        it before the place closes. Love 
                        you. 

           He gives her a peck, glares at Marty, and leaves. 

                                 MARTY
                             (enjoying the soup)
                        C’mon, Viv, no more lies. This is 
                        creme fraiche, isn’t it?   

           INT/EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER 

           Kyle shivers as he peers inside a window that looks into the 
           crowded dining room. Near the bar, he sees Chloe nursing a 
           cocktail as Billy orders a drink. She smiles at Billy. 

           Across the room, Tricia holds court with SEVERAL WIVES.

           Back at the bar, Chloe has sidled up to Billy. As she leans 
           in to whisper something into his ear, her hand subtly -- but 
           perceptibly -- grazes Billy’s crotch. His face lights up as 
           she walks away. 

                                 KYLE
                        Well-played, you hot little psycho.  

           He looks back to Tricia, who’s now filling up at the dessert 
           station; then back at Billy, who furtively looks around 
           before following Chloe.
           Kyle’s phone vibrates. It’s a text from Chloe: “IT’S ON. KEEP 
           WIFE AWAY!!!” Just then, the top of a YOUNG BOY’S HEAD pokes 
           into the frame. Kyle quickly ducks down.

           EXT. STREET - EVENING

           Frank struggles to rollerblade up a (very) slight hill. He 
           finally pulls up in front of a cute, nondescript home.

           He checks the address on a slip of paper. Jackpot. He pulls 
           off his skates, races to the door and rings the bell.

                                 FRANK
                             (practicing, to himself)
                        “Hey, girl”...nah. How about, 
                        “’Sup, V. Ready for this D?” Ugh. 
                        (like a sorority girl) 
                        “ohmygodVanessahiiiyeee!”

           Frank’s voice trails off as the door opens. Standing there is 
           a...

                                 DUDE
                        You must be Frank!

           The dude vigorously shakes Frank’s hand. 

                                 DUDE (CONT’D)
                        I’m Todd.
                             (then)
                        Oh, sorry. This little guy is 
                        Tristan. Say hi, buddy!

           We PAN DOWN to a five-year-old boy, who doesn’t say anything.

                                 TODD
                        He’s just tired. Anyway, come on 
                        in!

           Yeah, Frank’s confused. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - LATER

           Kyle stands outside the same window, watching Tricia talk to 
           an OVERWEIGHT WOMAN eating shrimp.

           He looks down at his phone, which is on the Facebook profile 
           picture of an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN.

           He holds the phone up so that the picture is next to shrimp 
           lady. It’s clearly the SAME WOMAN. 
                                 KYLE
                        Who do you think you’re kidding, 
                        Carolyn Gwatney?

           Tricia starts looking around. She excuses herself and walks 
           away, eyes scanning the room for her missing husband... 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           He bolts for the entrance. 

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kyle bursts around a corner just in time to see Tricia down 
           the hall, checking rooms for Billy. She’s getting close to 
           the men’s room. He races to intercept her. 

                                 KYLE
                        Tricia. Hey. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Ken Doll? What are you doing here?

                                 KYLE
                        Oh, just catchin’ up with the gang 
                        at the club. Lotta memories here. 
                        What about you? 

                                 TRICIA
                        Ah, here with Billy, he’s got some 
                        stupid dinner. I’m actually trying 
                        to find his ass and go home. 
                             (then, shaking her head)
                        Biggest day of the year at the 
                        store tomorrow and that fucktard’s 
                        been drinking like an Indian. 

           She walks past him and heads for a door next to the men’s 
           room. Kyle steps in front of her.  

                                 KYLE
                        You know what? I think Billy’s 
                        outside. Yup, saw him by his car.  

                                 TRICIA 
                        We took a cab here. 

           She walks away again. Panicked and out of options, he grabs 
           her and spins her around. They’re close.

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?
                                 KYLE
                        I, uh, have a confession to make, 
                        Tricia. I didn’t come here to catch 
                        up with old friends. 

                                 TRICIA 
                        Then why’d you come here? 

                                 KYLE
                        I came here to see...you
                             (then)
                        I felt something in the parking lot 
                        last night. I know you did, too.

           She eyes him curiously, then moves in closer. Kyle tries to 
           hide his discomfort. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Billy said you putt from the rough. 

                                 KYLE
                        You strike me as a woman who likes 
                        a challenge.  

           Tricia smiles lasciviously. She takes his hand and drags him 
           towards the MEN’S ROOM. 

                                 TRICIA
                             (re: bathroom)
                        Two minutes in there and I’ll flip 
                        you like a fucking spatula. 

           Kyle moves them towards the WOMEN’S ROOM, right next door. 

                                 KYLE
                        In here.
                             (then)
                        Seems cleaner. 

           He pulls her inside. 

           INT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER 

           Marty, Hannah, Viv, and Gary are still at the dinner table, 
           drinking wine and having a grand old time. Dom’s still gone.  

                                 HANNAH
                        So he’s on one knee waiting for an 
                        answer, and I’m like, “It says HJ. 
                        On your hand.”  

                                 VIV 
                        Your initials. That’s sweet. 
                                 GARY
                        No, Viv. Hand job.

                                 VIV
                        Oh.
                             (then)
                        Good thing we didn’t name you Beth. 

           As everyone laughs, Hannah takes Marty’s hand to look at 
           where the tattoo used to be. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Admit it, you were a little sad the 
                        day you got it removed.

           Marty looks at her. 

                                 MARTY
                        Well... 

           He rubs his finger, removing skin-toned make-up. He raises 
           his hand. IT’S HIS OLD TATTOO! Everyone gasps.

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh my God. No. 

                                 MARTY
                        I heard laser removal really hurts. 

           Hannah grabs Marty’s hand again to inspect it. No one hears 
           Dom enter. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Sad that this might be the most 
                        romantic thing anyone’s ever done 
                        for me. 

                                 VIV
                        Hannah, how did you never tell us 
                        Marty proposed?!

                                 DOM 
                        He what?!

           Everyone turns to see Dom. Hannah quickly drops Marty’s hand. 

                                 HANNNAH
                        Dom. Hi. Did you find your wallet?

                                 DOM
                        He proposed to you? And you never 
                        told me? 
                                 HANNAH
                        Honey, we were kids. I didn’t tell 
                        you -- I didn’t even tell my 
                        parents -- because it was so long 
                        ago that it doesn’t matter. 

           This stings Marty a little. 

                                 DOM
                        Right, it doesn’t matter but it was 
                        the most romantic thing anyone’s 
                        ever done for you.

                                 HANNAH
                        Dom, I was just --

                                 DOM
                        Stop. Just stop. You know, maybe if 
                        you weren’t so busy flirting with 
                        Fatal Attraction here, you’d have 
                        noticed I spent the entire weekend 
                        trying to get a second alone with 
                        you, so that I could propose, like 
                        an adult, with an actual ring.
                             (then, to Marty)
                        Which now happens to be missing. 

           A beat. 

                                 HANNAH
                        You were going to propose?

                                 VIV
                        My grandmother’s ring is missing? 

                                 DOM
                             (pointedly, to Marty)
                        I don’t think it’s missing. 

                                 MARTY
                        Whoa, dude, what are you trying to 
                        say? 

                                 DOM
                        Lemme see your pockets. 

           Everyone stares at Marty. After a beat, he theatrically 
           empties his pant pockets. Nothing.  

                                 MARTY
                        Maybe it was Colonel Mustard in the 
                        conservatory. 
                                 DOM
                        Whatever, I’m over this. 

           He turns and leaves. Hannah gets up.

                                 HANNAH
                        Dom, wait.

           She chases after him. Viv and Gary follow, leaving Marty at 
           the table, alone. Somehow, he thought this would feel better. 

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - MEN’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Billy and Chloe are going at it in the bathroom. She’s up on 
           the sink, her legs wrapped around him. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Yeah, just like that... 

           She makes a “sexy face” in the direction of the camera. He 
           clocks it, but doesn’t say anything. 

                                 CHLOE (CONT’D)
                        Yes. Yes. Yes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - WOMEN’S BATHROOM - SAME TIME

           A MATCHING SHOT of Tricia pawing at Kyle as he desperately 
           tries to fend her off.

                                 KYLE
                        No, no, no. 

           He quickly sneaks a peak at his phone -- nothing from Chloe. 
           Tricia goes to undo his belt buckle. Kyle blocks her hand. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe it’d be good to get to know 
                        each other first, talk a little.

                                 TRICIA
                        Let’s talk about where you’re gonna 
                        put it. 

           Again she goes for his pants. Again, he deflects. 

                                 KYLE
                        Wait. I need to tell you something. 
                        I, uh...I have crabs.  
                                 TRICIA
                             (not missing a beat)
                        Don’t worry. Me, too. 

           Good god. This time, she actually grabs hold of the buckle. 
           Kyle smacks her hand away. Hard. 

           Tricia stops, surprised. She stares at him for a beat. 
           Suddenly, she slaps him across the face. Almost immediately, 
           Kyle slaps her in the face. 

                                 TRICIA (CONT’D)
                        Goddamn, Kenny.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m sorry, I just -- 

                                 TRICIA
                        I think I just squirted. 

           She goes back at him. 

           INT. VANESSA’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Todd and Tristan lead a very confused Frank through a 
           hallway. The walls are covered with family photos.

                                 FRANK
                        Am I, uh, interrupting something? 

                                 TODD
                        Not at all. Vanessa’s just upstairs 
                        getting ready.

           They’re in the kitchen now. Todd motions to a table.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        Can I get you something? We have a 
                        ton of leftovers. Or -- 

                                 FRANK 
                        Alcohol would be great.  

           Todd heads to the fridge, leaving Frank with Tristan. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (sotto)
                        Hey, buddy. So, Todd seems like a 
                        very nice man. Is he married to the 
                        pretty lady in the photos?  

           Tristan doesn’t say anything. Todd’s back with beers.
                                 TODD
                        Anyway, man, cheers. I’ve heard a 
                        lot about you from Vanessa.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s funny, because I have heard 
                        almost nothing about you.

                                 VANESSA (O.S.)
                        Frannnnnnnnk!   

           Finally: high school megababe Vanessa Daniels enters. And 
           she’s still a megababe. Seriously, it’s like the laws of 
           physics and time conveniently decided to give her a pass on 
           the last decade. 

                                 FRANK
                        Vanessa. Hi.

           She gives Frank a hug. Boobs press against his chest. Mmmm.

                                 VANESSA
                        It’s been ages. You look great.

           Tristan yawns. Todd picks him up. 

                                 TODD
                        I’m gonna go put little guy down.

           Todd leaves with Tristan. 

                                 VANESSA
                        I’m so glad you met Todd. He’s the 
                        best, isn’t he? 

                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        You are, honey!

           Frank politely smiles. As soon as Todd is gone, his face 
           changes. The following is conducted as a WHISPER-YELL. 

                                 FRANK
                        What the fucking fuck?! You’re 
                        married?! With a kid?!

                                 VANESSA 
                        Relax, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        No, you relax!  I thought this was 
                        gonna be some kind of Facebook fuck 
                        sesh! I saw “Unfaithful,” okay? I 
                        am not trying to get jealous 
                        husband murdered! 
                                 VANESSA
                        It’s not what you think.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not what I think? Should I not 
                        think the man sitting here three 
                        seconds ago is your husband? And 
                        that he’s not upstairs right now 
                        tucking in your kid? Jesus Christ, 
                        if you’re gonna cheat, let’s at 
                        least meet at some shitty motel 
                        like goddamn normal people! 

           Just then, a pair of MAN HANDS come down on Frank’s 
           shoulders. He turns and sees Todd.

                                 TODD
                        Tristan’s asleep.
                             (then, smiling)
                        We’re gonna get so nasty tonight.

           Vanessa takes Frank’s hand. Off his look.

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Billy and Chloe are done doin’ it. He open the door for her.

                                 BILLY
                        Now remember...our little secret.  

                                 CHLOE 
                        Yeah, yeah.

           She exits. Billy immediately locks the door and goes to where 
           Chloe was looking during their love-making. He finds the 
           camera in the plant. 

                                 BILLY
                        That sneaky son of a bitch. 

           He rewinds through the footage (we don’t see it.) He deletes 
           a clip, then puts the camera back, angling it just so...

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB WOMEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Tricia and Kyle are as they were. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Do it again. Harder this time.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m not hitting you.  
                                 TRICIA
                        Come on. Saddle up. Buck this 
                        Bronco.

                                 KYLE
                        I...don’t know what you’re saying.

           Kyle’s phone buzzes. He whips it out. It’s a text from Chloe: 
           “DEAL’S DONE. GET CAMERA.” 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                             (back to Tricia)
                        You know what, Tricia, I gotta go. 

                                 TRICIA
                        What? You’re not even giving this a 
                        chance. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah...pretty sure I’m gay.

           He heads for the door. 

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle slips out of the bathroom and turns towards the men’s 
           room to grab the camera, but A DAD WITH A MUSTACHE and his 
           THREE KIDS are waiting in line. The dad glares at him.

                                 KYLE
                             (re: Women’s Room)
                        Sorry, really had to pee.

           The camera will have to wait.  

           INT. HANNAH’S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Marty sits at the table, picking at a piece of pie. Hannah 
           enters, teary-eyed. He gets up.  

                                 MARTY
                        Hannah. Everything okay?

                                 HANNAH
                        Not really. Dom’s taking a train 
                        back to his parents’ in the city.

                                 MARTY
                        I’m sorry.

                                 HANNAH
                        Don’t be, it’s not your fault. 
                                 MARTY
                             (re: pie)
                        When I don’t want to feel things, I 
                        usually eat pie. 

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m not really hungry.

                                 MARTY
                        Okay, better idea: throw on Uncle 
                        Buck. If John Candy waving that 
                        hatchet can’t cheer you -- 

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t believe I blew that. You 
                        know, I actually wanted to get 
                        proposed to this time. 

           This thought hangs there. 

                                 MARTY
                        I should probably go. 

                                 HANNAH
                        Yeah, I think I need to be alone 
                        for a bit. 

           She gives Marty a hug.  

                                 HANNAH (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we’re friends again, at 
                        least. 

                                 MARTY
                        Me, too, Hannah.  

           He exits. Once he’s out of the dining room, Marty takes the 
           ring out of his shirt pocket and feels the weight of it, like 
           an asshole Frodo. Fuck.   

           INT. VANESSA’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Frank sits across the table from Vanessa and Todd. 

                                 FRANK
                             (to Todd)
                        So let me get this straight: You’ve 
                        known about this the whole time.  

                                 TODD
                        Known about it? It was my idea.
                                 FRANK
                             (to Vanessa)
                        What about those texts?!  

                                 TODD
                        I sent most of those. Man to man, 
                        you’re working with a great dick.

                                 FRANK
                        Guys, I’m flattered. Really. But 
                        maybe give Craigslist a whirl. 

           He gets up to leave. 

                                 VANESSA
                        What’s the matter, Frank? Don’t you 
                        want this? 

           She unbuttons the top of her blouse. Fuuuuuuuck. 

           As Frank looks at her more-than-ample bosom, a question Kyle 
           asked him earlier in the day replays in his head: “Would you 
           bang a dude if it meant you got to have sex with Vanessa?”

           He sits back down. 

                                 FRANK
                        Let’s talk hypotheticals.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VANESSA’S KITCHEN - LATER 

           Everyone’s huddled around the table as if they’re brokering a 
           Middle Eastern peace accord. 

                                 FRANK
                        How about this: I’m in the bedroom, 
                        having sex with Vanessa. (POINTING 
                        TO TODD) You’re in the living room, 
                        hangin’ out. I finish and leave. 
                        Then you come in and do whatever 
                        you want.  

                                 TODD
                        I need to participate or it’s 
                        infidelity.

                                 FRANK
                        Got it. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Okay, how about, you get to listen 
                        to Vanessa and I have sex, from in 
                        the bathroom. That’s participation!  

           Vanessa shakes her head no. Frank sighs. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What if...you kneel by the side of 
                        the bed and hold her hand while we 
                        have sex? 

                                 TODD
                        No.

                                 FRANK
                        What if Vanessa jerks me off, but 
                        your hand is on top of hers, so 
                        it’s almost like you’re jerking me 
                        off? That’s pretty good! 

                                 TODD
                        Nope.

                                 VANESSA
                        What if you blow Todd and I 
                        masturbate?

                                 TODD
                             (into it)
                        That works. 

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, that’s not happening. 

           Vanessa unbuttons her blouse even further. 

                                 VANESSA
                        C’mon, Frank. What would you do for 
                        this?

           Ughhh. He stares at her. Then back at Todd...

           INT. VANESSA’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER 

           CLOSE ON Frank and Vanessa, making out in bed, side by side.

                                 VANESSA
                        Mmmmm.   

                                 FRANK
                        Uhhhh.
                                 TODD (O.S.)
                        Yeahhh.

           We PULL OUT TO REVEAL: Todd on the other side of Frank, 
           getting, uh, you know. Manually stimulated. Under the covers. 

                                 VANESSA
                        You’re doing great, baby. 

                                 TODD
                        Totally.

           They both lean in and whisper into Frank’s opposite ears:

                          VANESSA
                                                          TODD
           I’m so wet.
                                              I’m so hard.

           Frank looks like his puppy just died.

                                 VANESSA
                             (in one ear)
                        How do you want to fuck me? 

                                 TODD
                             (in the other ear)
                        Where do you want me to come?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s it, I’m out!

           Frank springs out of bed and starts putting on his clothes 
           with a quickness.  

                                 VANESSA
                        What’s wrong?! 

                                 FRANK
                        Your husband is about to jizz on my 
                        back, is what’s wrong! 

                                 TODD
                        Dude, I coulda finished in a 
                        Kleenex.

           He’s never been dressed faster.

                                 FRANK
                        Happy holidays, guys. I’ll see you -  
                        well, I really hope I don’t see 
                        either of you ever again. No 
                        offense.

           He makes a beeline out of the bedroom and into the hallway, 
           where he almost bowls over Tristan, holding a blanket.
                                 TRISTAN
                        I was having a nightmare.

                                 FRANK
                        Me too, buddy. 

           INT. COUNTRY CLUB - HALLWAY - LATER

           Kyle walks towards the men’s room. He looks around. The coast 
           is clear. 

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kyle opens the door and enters. Inside, he’s shocked to find 
           Billy and the MUSTACHE DAD from earlier. Dad’s holding the 
           camera. They both glare at Kyle.   

                                 BILLY
                        I always knew you were a sicko, but 
                        I had no idea how sick. 

                                 MUSTACHE DAD
                        You got an explanation for this?

           Mustache Dad gives the camera to Kyle and hits a button. 
           Instead of Billy having sex with Chloe, it’s footage of 
           LITTLE BOY AFTER LITTLE BOY PEEING!! Billy had re-positioned 
           the camera to face the LITTLE BOYS URINAL. 

                                 MUSTACHE DAD (CONT’D)
                             (re: screen)
                        That’s my son. He’s eight. 

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, I don’t know what’s going on, 
                        but this is not my camera.

           Mustache Dad hits REWIND. We now see footage of Kyle looking 
           into the camera, placing it in the plant, and miming sex 
           moves. Dad takes a POLICE BADGE out of his jacket. Uh-oh.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Marty sits in the back seat of cab, gazing out the window. Up 
           ahead, he sees someone on rollerblades, moping along. As they 
           drive past him, Marty realizes it’s Frank. 

                                 MARTY
                             (to driver)
                        Stop the car. 
           INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Marty and Frank sit in grim silence. Then:

                                 MARTY
                        I’m starting to think coming back 
                        here maybe wasn’t the best call.  

           A long beat as Frank absently stares out the window. 

                                 FRANK
                        I jerked a guy off tonight. On 
                        Thanksgiving. 

           Marty and the cab driver both stare at Frank. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Well, not all the way off.  
                             (then)
                        But yeah.

           INT. TRI-CITIES JAIL - LATER

           Kyle stands next to a payphone in a bleak-looking holding 
           cell. A COP walks by.

                                 KYLE
                        Can I please have my cellphone 
                        back?

                                 COP
                        When you leave. (re: payphone) 
                        Until then. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yes, I see the payphone, but it 
                        doesn’t exactly do me much good 
                        when all the numbers of people I’d 
                        call are on my cellphone. 

                                 COP
                        Well, I suggest calling a number 
                        you do remember. 

           The cop exits. Marty stares at the phone for a long beat. 
           Finally, he picks up the receiver and dials...  

           EXT. MARTY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marty and Frank sit on Marty’s porch. Frank drinks from a 
           bottle of Wild Turkey. Marty’s on his phone, then hangs up.
                                 MARTY
                        Rang, no answer. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sure he’s fine. 

                                 MARTY
                        Yeah.
                             (then)
                        So can I at least ask how -- 

                                 FRANK
                        Nope. Not emotionally prepared to 
                        get into that just yet. 

           Frank takes a swig of whiskey. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You know, this is all the 
                        Internet’s fault. 

                                 MARTY
                        What is? 

                                 FRANK
                        This. Us. Here. I mean, the way we 
                        live now, it’s just not natural. 
                        Think about it -- ten years ago, 
                        you didn’t know what every single 
                        person you’d ever met was up to. 
                        But somehow, we managed. 

                                 MARTY
                        You sound like Kyle. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is that so bad? I mean, fuck. If it 
                        wasn’t for Facebook, I wouldn’t 
                        have just...well, you know. And 
                        you, you’d probably still be dating 
                        a pretty great girl.

                                 MARTY
                        Zoe was great. But she wasn’t...

                                 FRANK
                        She wasn’t what? Far as I can tell, 
                        Zoe’s biggest problem was that she 
                        didn’t live up to the idea you had 
                        of a girl you don’t even really 
                        know anymore.

                                 GLORIA (O.S.)
                        He’s right, Marty.
                                 MARTY
                        Jesus, mom, do you listen to 
                        everything we say?

                                 GLORIA (O.S.)
                        Sorry, boys.

                                 FRANK
                        Anyway, that’s why I’m unplugging 
                        for good. No more Facebook, no more 
                        Twitter, no more YouPorn, no more 
                        PornHub, no more xTube, no more 
                        YouJizz, no more Spankwire -- 

                                 MARTY
                        I got it, Frank. 

           Marty’s phone buzzes.

                                 FRANK
                        Is that Kyle? Or my mom? I’m scared 
                        to turn my phone back on. Somehow, 
                        I feel like she knows what I did 
                        tonight. 

                                 MARTY
                        It’s Hannah. She just asked, “hey u 
                        around?” 

           Marty shows Frank his phone. 

                                 FRANK
                        Damn, she wants to see you real 
                        bad.

                                 MARTY
                        How do you know? 

                                 FRANK
                        No comma after “hey.” “U” instead 
                        of spelling “y-o-u.” Also “u 
                        around” is basically code for “I’m 
                        lonely and vulnerable.”
                             (then)
                        You’re in. 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m in. 

           He gets up to leave. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Now or never, I guess. Be back in a 
                        bit.  
           As he exits, Frank calls out to him:

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll answer one question about my 
                        night. That’s it.  

           Marty turns around.

                                 MARTY
                        What were you thinking when you 
                        started...(MIMES JERKING OFF)?

           Frank takes another pull from the bottle.

                                 FRANK
                        I closed my eyes and tried really 
                        hard to pretend it was my dick. 

                                 MARTY
                        And? 

                                 FRANK
                        Didn’t work. 

           INT. TRI-CITIES JAIL -- LATER 

           Kyle’s still in the holding cell, staring at the rather 
           unpleasant metal toilet. The kind of toilet that makes you 
           question your life choices. He’s about to give it a go when 
           the cop comes over and unlocks the door.

                                 COP
                        I guess you got something to be 
                        thankful for this year.  

                                 KYLE
                        What’s that?

                                 COP
                        Having a retired cop for a dad. 

           The cop exits as JACK COOPER (late 50s, conservative, looks 
           like a retired small-town cop) enters the cell. 

                                 JACK
                        Let’s go, Kyle.

           Off Kyle’s look, we...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JACK’S CAR - LATER

           Kyle and his father sit in tense silence as Jack drives. 

                                 KYLE
                        So, uh, thanks for  --

                                 JACK
                        It’s fine.

           A beat.

                                 KYLE
                        How’s mom?

                                 JACK
                        Good. She’s good. 

           More silence. Kyle flips on the radio. It’s “Party Rock 
           Anthem” or some other terrible LMFAO song that couldn’t be 
           less appropriate for the moment. Jack turns the radio off.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Should we just go get real drunk?

                                 KYLE
                             (quickly)
                        Absolutely.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

           Marty illegally parks his car and rushes to the platform. 

           INT/EXT. TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Marty scans the “Arrivals/Departures” monitor and finds the 
           listing for Grand Central. Track 3. He peers through the 
           window: it’s far. And it’s leaving in two minutes...

                                 MARTY
                        Son of a. 

           He takes off running.

           EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 

           Marty races down some stairs. At the end of the track, he 
           sees Dom about to get on the train. 
                                 MARTY
                             (running over)
                        Dom! Wait!  

           Dom turns around. 

                                 DOM
                        You’re kidding me. 

                                 MARTY
                        You can’t get on that train.  

           Dom scoffs and starts to board. Marty grabs his jacket. Dom 
           turns around and slugs him in the face. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Owww! Fuck! I deserved that. 

                                 DOM 
                        You’re lucky I don’t kick your 
                        fucking ass. 

                                 MARTY
                        You’re right. I lied to Hannah, 
                        ruined Thanksgiving, and screwed up 
                        your proposal. 

           Marty reaches into his pocket and takes out Dom’s ring.

                                 DOM
                        I knew it. 

                                 MARTY
                        I’m really sorry, man. She’s still 
                        at her parents’ place. 

           Dom glares at Marty before taking the ring. As he turns to 
           leave, Marty stops him.

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Dom: Take good care of her, 
                        okay? 

           Dom slugs him in the face again. 

                                 DOM
                        Fuck off, dude. For real. 

                                 MARTY
                        Got it.  
           INT. RICK’S LODGE - LATER

           Close on Kyle and his dad sitting at a wooden table, 
           surrounded by empty beer bottles. They’ve loosened up 
           considerably.

                                 JACK
                        Look, I’m not saying I reacted 
                        great. But you know how it is here. 
                        You think it was easy being the 
                        only guy on the force with a gay 
                        son?

                                 KYLE
                        The only guy? What about Officer 
                        Flynn? 

                                 JACK
                        Patty’s kid? The wrestler? No. 

                                 KYLE
                        He goes to my gym. Let’s just say 
                        he doesn’t need a ref to roll 
                        around with sweaty dudes anymore.

           RICK, the grizzled owner, comes over to the table. 

                                 RICK
                        Another round?

                                 KYLE
                        Why not.

           Rick plops down a BOX OF AMMO on the table. We WIDEN to 
           reveal: Kyle and his dad aren’t at a bar -- they’re at an 
           INDOOR GUN RANGE. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        I still can’t believe this place is 
                        open on Thanksgiving.

                                 JACK
                        Rick’s is always open. Didn’t even 
                        close on 9/11.  

                                 RICK
                        Sold twice as many shells that day. 
                        Never forget. 

           Kyle and his dad walk to the firing stalls. Kyle puts on ear 
           muffs and goggles as Jack loads a gun. He hands it to Kyle.
                                 KYLE
                        Anyway, it’s possible I, uh, 
                        overreacted. It’s just, you know 
                        Billy...

           At the mere mention of his name, Kyle angrily unloads a clip. 
           None of the bullets hit the target. Jack shakes his head. 

                                 JACK
                        When you were a kid and you got 
                        mad, you remember what you’d do? 

                                 KYLE
                        No.

                                 JACK
                        You’d close your eyes and hold your 
                        breath. No more ice cream? (HE 
                        MIMICS KYLE HOLDING HIS BREATH). 
                        Tell you to turn the TV off? (SAME 
                        FACE). Your mom and I were always 
                        worried you’d damn near pass out.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, I’m not a kid anymore. 

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, you’re all grown up, hacking 
                        emails and setting up secret 
                        cameras.

           That’s not a bad point.  

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You’re a smart kid, Kyle. But you 
                        gotta learn when to take a deep 
                        breath and let stuff go. 

           Kyle takes a deep breath, aims, and fires. Again, he’s missed 
           completely.   

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You also gotta learn how to shoot 
                        guns when you’re drunk. 

                                 KYLE
                        Yeah I’m not good at this. 

           He takes off his goggles and ear muffs. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess that’s that. Billy  
                        has his big sale and goes on living 
                        like nothing ever happened. 
                                 JACK
                        Hey, on the bright side, at least 
                        you’ll be safe. I tell you, those 
                        Black Friday sales are a bunch of 
                        animals. Last year, I saw someone 
                        nearly get trampled to death over a 
                        goddamn waffle iron.  

           Kyle perks up. Off his look.

           INT. MARTY’S PARENTS HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

           Marty sits at his kitchen table, holding a bag of frozen peas 
           to his face. Frank comes down the stairs. He smiles when he 
           sees Marty.

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t tell what’s sadder: Your 
                        face or that tattoo.

                                 MARTY
                        Still rather take a beating than 
                        give one.
                             (then)
                        Did Kyle make it home? Have a 
                        couple missed calls from him.  

                                 FRANK
                        He didn’t sleep in the guest room.

                        Uh-oh, sounds like someone got 
                        lucky last night... 

           Marty’s mom, Gloria, comes in, wearing her “Shop ‘Till They 
           Drop” t-shirt over long sleeves. 

                                 GLORA
                        Hey, guys. I’ll be back in a couple 
                        hours.

                                 MARTY
                        Mom, for the last time: whatever 
                        you’re buying, I promise you it’s 
                        cheaper on Amazon.   

                                 GLORIA
                        Oh really? They give away free 
                        iPads on your precious Amazon web 
                        page?  

                                 FRANK
                        Whoa, who’s giving away free iPads?
           Gloria shows Frank her iPhone.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                             (reading)

                        What? That can’t be right. Where’d 
                        you see that? 

                                 GLORIA
                        Kyle posted it on his Facebook 
                        page.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Marty)
                        Since when is Kyle on Facebook?

                                 GLORIA
                        He added me yesterday. Already got 
                        a pretty good Words with Friends 
                        game going, too.
                             (then)
                        Anyway, gotta run. Whole town will 
                        probably be there by now.

           Gloria leaves. Marty takes out his phone and dials Kyle. No 
           answer.

                                 MARTY
                        That’s really weird. 

                                 FRANK
                        I know. I friend requested your mom 
                        six months ago and she still hasn’t 
                        accepted. I thought we were tight.

                                 MARTY
                        No, Kyle posting that. He say 
                        anything to you?

                                 FRANK
                        My phone was dead all day. Lemme 
                        check. 

           Frank gets his phone from a nearby charger. 
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Eight voicemails from my mom, good 
                        times...oh, and one from Kyle.

           He hits the speaker phone button. Kyle sounds kind of manic. 
           Sporadic GUNFIRE makes certain words impossible to hear.

                                 KYLE’S VOICEMAL
                        Hey, it's Kyle. So shit with Billy 
                        got crazy and I ended up going to 
                        (INAUDIBLE.) My fucking dad 
                        (INAUDIBLE.) Believe it or not, I’m 
                        holding a shotgun right now. Crazy. 
                        Anyway, talk soon. If I’m not back 
                        in jail, ha ha.  

           Frank and Marty look at each other. 

                                 FRANK
                        No. He wouldn’t. At the Man Cave? 

                                 MARTY
                        Holy shit. Mom!

           Frank and Marty bolt out of the room. 

           EXT. THE MAN CAVE - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Standing in front of the giant crowd, holding an iPad in one 
           hand and a megaphone in the other, is KYLE. He’s pacing back 
           and forth, whipping the crowd into a frenzy like an Occupy 
           Wall Street protestor meets William Wallace. 

                                 KYLE
                             (into megaphone)
                        What do we want!?

                                 CROWD
                        iPads!

                                 KYLE
                        When do we want them?!

                                 CROWD
                        Now! 

                                 KYLE
                        We’re talking free iPads here, so I 
                        wanna know what you’ll do to get 
                        one! 
                             (to a random guy)
                        You! How far are you willing to go?
                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Pretty fucking far! 

           The crowd cheers. 

           INT. MARTY’S PARENTS CAR - LATER

           Marty and Frank sit in the back seat, as Marty’s mom drives.  

                                 MARTY
                        You have got to drive faster! 
                             (to Frank, re: phone)
                        Who are you possibly texting right 
                        now?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m Googling gun laws to see if 
                        we’re technically accomplices. 

                                 MARTY
                        Jesus Christ, Frank --
                             (stops himself, thinking)
                        Wait, what’s it say?

           EXT. THE MAN CAVE - PARKING LOT - LATER

           Kyle continues to preside over the crowd, which has gotten 
           bigger. And angrier. A LADY IN HUNTING GEAR shouts:

                                 CAMO LADY
                        Come on! Where are the iPads!?

                                 KYLE
                        They’re about to come out!  

                                 CROWD
                        IPADS! IPADS! 

           The levee seems like it might break at any minute. Finally, 
           the door to the Man Cave opens, and Billy Wilcheck steps out, 
           waving. The crowd’s chants grow louder. 

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        IPADS! IPADS!

           Billy approaches Kyle. 

                                 BILLY
                             (smiling)
                        The hell are you doing?
                                 KYLE
                        Hope you got a whole lot of iPads 
                        back there, Billy.  
                             (into megaphone)
                        Hey everyone, look who it is! Billy 
                        Wilcheck’s here to tell you about 
                        your free iPads! 

           The crowd roars.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        But before he does, I’d just like 
                        to give him a quick introduction. 
                        As some of you might remember, I 
                        grew up here. And people like Billy 
                        didn’t make it easy. It actually 
                        took me almost ten years to come to 
                        terms with the abuse and -- 

                                 RANDOM SHOPPER 
                        -- Dude, shut the fuck up! Where 
                        are our iPads?

                                 CROWD
                        IPADS! IPADS!

                                 KYLE
                        Okay, not interested in that.  

                                 CROWD
                        IPADS! IPADS! 

           Billy grabs the megaphone from Kyle. 

                                 BILLY
                        Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! If I 
                        could have your attention for just 
                        one moment, I can explain. 

                                 RANDOM SHOPPER #2
                        What’s going on? We’ve been waiting 
                        for hours! 

                                 BILLY
                        See, that’s what I’m trying to tell 
                        you. Unfortunately, uh, there are 
                        no free iPads, but I’d be more than 
                        happy to offer ten percent off all 
                        purchases over --

                        He’s flaking on the deal! 
                                 CAMO LADY 
                        Get him!

           The powder keg explodes. Shoppers rush the door. 

           EXT. THE MAN CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank and Marty jump out of the car. The parking lot is a 
           CRAZY MOB RIOT.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh my God, he shot Billy.

           Frank and Marty take off into the crowd.

           INT. THE MAN CAVE - CONTINUOUS

           Billy’s “shrine to manliness and luxury electronics” is being 
           ripped to shreds by the frenzied mob. 

           Near the entrance, Kyle ducks to avoid a flying XBOX. He 
           scans the store and sees Billy trying to wrestle a LARGE TV 
           BOX away from a determined MOM. Kyle heads that way.   

           INT. THE MAN CAVE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marty and Frank make their way into the store. Some crazy OLD 
           LADY tries to wrestle a MICROWAVE away from a younger woman. 
           The Old Lady PEPPER SPRAYS her.

           Across the way, they see Kyle, holding what to them looks 
           like A WEAPON, calmly walk towards an oblivious Billy. Frank 
           picks up a discarded Blu-Ray player and uses it as a shield. 

                                 FRANK
                             (taking off running)
                        We still have time! 

                                 MARTY
                        I’ll grab his legs!

                                 FRANK
                        Kyle! Nooo! 

           Just as Kyle reaches Billy, Frank and Marty dive at him. 
           Except unlike in high school, they connect. Hard.

           The three of them tumble to the floor. Kyle rolls over. 

                                 KYLE
                        What the fuck was that for?! 
                                 FRANK
                        You were about to shoot Billy!  

                                 KYLE
                        Shoot him with what?! 

           Billy picks up the “weapon” Kyle was holding. It’s not a gun  
           -- it’s a rolled-up print of the POOL PICTURE. On the back, 
           written in Sharpie, is “Go Fuck Yourself.”  

                                 FRANK
                        Ohhh. I see now. 

           Billy looks at the three of them, sprawled out on the floor.

                                 BILLY
                        Wow, Kyle, you finally nailed me.    
                        Good thing my insurance policy pays 
                        double what I’d make all year.

           He smiles triumphantly. We feel Kyle’s rage building. 

                                 BILLY (CONT’D)
                        Guess now I won’t have to file for 
                        bankruptcy, huh? Thanks for the 
                        bail out, bro. 

                                 KYLE
                        Ah, fuck it. 

           Kyle springs up and tackles Billy. As they tussle, he sees 
           one of those cheesy PERSONAL BACK MASSAGERS near him. He 
           grabs it, gets on top of Billy, and raises it over his head. 

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        This is me letting go.

                                 MARTY/FRANK
                        Stop!/Kyle, no! 

           Instead of clubbing a cowering Billy, however, Kyle flings 
           the massager into a GIANT MIRRORED WALL. It shatters. 

                                 KYLE
                        Let’s get out of here. 

                                 MARTY
                             (pointing to mirror)
                        Holy shit. 

           On the other side of the mirrored wall, they see N’DIQUE -- 
           the Nigerian exchange student -- sitting at a table with 
           STACKS OF MONEY. 
           He’s surrounded by a bunch of SHADY-LOOKING PEOPLE working at 
           a giant bank of computers. He immediately puts his hands in 
           the air as if he’s under arrest. 

           Across the store, COPS storm in and try to break up the riot.

           EXT. THE MAN CAVE - PARKING LOT - LATER

           The guys stand in the parking lot as cops restore order at 
           the store. Billy and N’Dique are led away in handcuffs. 

                                 MARTY
                        So lemme get this straight. Dude 
                        was taking money that was supposed 
                        to buy computers for kids in 
                        Nigeria -- and giving it to a guy 
                        to buy computers for an actual 
                        Nigerian email scam? 

                                 FRANK
                        You kind of have to appreciate the 
                        irony.

                                 KYLE
                        Hey Billy! 

           Billy turns to look at him as he’s put into the back of a 
           police car.

                                 KYLE (CONT’D)
                        I fucked your wife.
                             (sotto, to the guys)
                        I didn’t fuck his wife. 

           Behind them, a familiar voice.

                                 LENA (O.S.)
                        Fareed.

           The guys turn to find FRANK’s MOM, several AUNTS, and bunch 
           of OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS, all holding VARIOUS SHOPPING BAGS. 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh my God, mom. I’m really sorry. I 
                        swear I was on my way home. In 
                        fact, I will spend as much time as 
                        you -- 

           She whacks him across the head. 
                                 LENA
                        Shut up, Franky. This is Bindu 
                        Auntie’s daughter, Nadia. The one I 
                        was telling you about. 

           It’s the girl whose back we saw earlier at Frank’s house. 
           Turns out she’s a SUPER HOT INDIAN GIRL.

                                 NADIA
                        Hi.

                                 FRANK
                        You were on Jeopardy?

           As they smile at each other, TODD, Frank’s three-way partner, 
           walks by with his son Tristan. 

                                 TODD
                             (to Nadia)
                        Don’t waste your time. This guy’s a 
                        fucking cock tease. 

           He crosses off. 

                                 FRANK
                        No idea who that was. 

           EXT. THE MAN CAVE -- PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS 

           Kyle and Marty head towards Frank’s car.

                                 MARTY
                        Almost breaking up an engagement, 
                        burning a store to the ground, and 
                        jerking a guy off. I guess that’s 
                        what Thanksgiving’s all about.

           As they walk, TWO HANDS cover Marty’s eyes from behind. 

                                 GIRL’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Guess who?

           Marty turns. It’s Hannah.

                                 MARTY
                        Hannah. Hey. Look, I can --

           And she SOCKS HIM IN THE FACE. 

                                 MARTY (CONT’D)
                        Oww!
                             (clutching face)
                        Glad you got that ring back.
                                 HANNAH
                        You’re an asshole, Marty. But at 
                        least you did the right thing. 

           She extends a hand to Marty. They shake.  

                                 MARTY
                        Friends?

                                 HANNAH
                             (smiling)
                        Maybe one day. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOFT - DAY

           TITLE CARD: ONE YEAR LATER

           It’s Thanksgiving at the loft. Friends and family mill about. 

           In the kitchen, Marty takes a turkey out of a WHOLE FOODS 
           CONTAINER and hands a KNIFE to his (no-longer) ex, ZOE. She 
           just shakes her head. As he wipes his hand, we see that the 
           “HJ” TATTOO is gone. 

           Elsewhere in the kitchen, Frank is about to dip his hand into 
           a bowl of MASHED POTATOES when he receives a playful smack 
           across the head. Except it’s not his mom -- it’s Nadia. 

           At the dining room table, Kyle fiddles with his iPad. Jack 
           comes over and puts his arm around him. We ANGLE ON Kyle’s 
           iPad. He’s updating his Facebook status. It reads: “Home. 
           Happy.”

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END

           OVER CREDITS:

           EXT. MAN CAVE

           Where once stood Billy’s shrine to masculine electronics, 
           there is now the Tri-Cities’ first and only gay nightclub. 

           There’s a NEON SIGN in the roof: one caveman holds a drink, 
           another holds a club. It’s still called “The Man Cave.”

           The marquee reads: “Happy Thanksgiving! -- From Kyle and the 
           gang.”
