           EXT. ATCHINSON PLANTATION - NIGHT

           A pair of BARE BLACK FEET step softly through dewy grass. 
           JUDAH, 25, crosses the lawn of a sleepy MISSOURI PLANTATION.

           He approaches the SLAVE QUARTERS, two low barracks with a 
           dozen simple doors on each side, and pauses in front of one.  

           INT. SLAVE QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           A SOFT KNOCK awakens CELIA. At 22, she is already a proud 
           black woman, and even in darkness, her beauty is captivating. 

                                 JUDAH(O.S.)
                             (hushed)
                        Celia? 

                                 CELIA
                        Judah? That you? 

           Judah slips into the cramped, dark room. Celia sits up, 
           trying to make him out in the shadows. 

                                 CELIA (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JUDAH
                        We always talk ‘bout runnin’ off.

                                 CELIA
                        Uh-hunh?

           She fumbles for a lantern. 

                                 JUDAH
                        What if we go tonight?

           Celia lights the lantern, and its amber glow reveals Judah’s 
           shirt, pants, and calloused hands. COVERED IN BLOOD. 

           INT. BARN - AT THE SAME TIME

           Blood mingles with hay on the dusty floor of the stables. The 
           handle of an AXE sticks out of a 17-year-old boy’s chest.  

           DAVID ATCHINSON, 40s, a coarse but charismatic Missouri 
           aristocrat, stares down at the body of his dead son. 

           His face is contorted with the horror of his son’s brutal 
           death. ATCHINSON’S EYE TWITCHES as he stifles his grief.
           OVERBY, 30s, the head house slave, kneels over the young 
           man’s body. Searches for a pulse. There isn’t one.  

           EXT. ATCHINSON PLANTATION - NIGHT

           DING-DING-DING-DING-DING! A triangle bell RINGS out the alarm 
           from the front porch of the MAIN HOUSE. 

           Judah and Celia race through rows of leafy tobacco, heading 
           for the safety of the dense forest beyond. 

           BANG! Judah glances back to see Atchinson out on the second-
           story balcony of the Main House with a long rifle.  

           Atchinson reloads, steadying his gun on the balcony railing. 
           He sights down the crosshairs, inhales deeply, exhales slowly-

           BANG! Judah keeps running... but suddenly he’s all alone.  

           He stops and turns. Celia’s crumpled form sprawls between the 
           rows. A bullet hole blossoms red in the back of her dress. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Celia? Celia?! Get up!

                                 CELIA
                        Keep. Runnin’. 

           He scoops her up and continues running toward the tree line. 
           Another shot WHIZZES by his head.  

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Judah sprints through the trees, leaping over logs and 
           ducking beneath branches, Celia cradled in his arms. 

           The BAYING of bloodhounds starts up behind him, and for the 
           first time we see fear in his eyes. 

           EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

           Judah reaches the MISSOURI RIVER, BURBLING softly in the 
           night. He can barely see the opposite bank, much less imagine 
           how to get there. 

           Judah looks down at Celia, her head lolling back over his 
           arm. Shakes her gently. No response. 

                                 JUDAH
                        No... Please no... 

           He shakes her again, but she is a rag doll in his arms. His 
           voice trembles as he slowly lays her on the ground. 
                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Celia. Gotta keep goin’. 

           He puts his ear to her mouth, praying to hear her breath. But 
           she’s already dead. He shuts his eyes, fighting back tears as- 

           A DOG BURSTS through the brush, BARKING ferociously. Judah 
           stands between the animal and Celia’s body as it charges.

           The canine LEAPS, fangs gleaming, and sinks its teeth into 
           Judah’s forearm. They both SPLASH into the shallows, and it’s 
           clear from his awkward flailing that-

           JUDAH CAN’T SWIM.

           He panics, GASPING, and stumbles to gain his feet. The dog’s 
           jaws grip his arm like a vise. Judah forces its muzzle under 
           the surface, and it THRASHES violently to come up for air. 

           Judah pins the hound beneath the cold black water. The dog 
           scratches and twists, but Judah brings his weight to bear 
           until the frantic clawing stops. The body goes limp, and 
           Judah releases the dead animal, letting it drift downstream. 

           He scrambles back to Celia, cradling his mangled arm. Judah 
           gazes at her angelic face, now still and cold. He turns away, 
           not sure what to do... then makes a hard choice. 

           Judah lifts the body and takes a few tentative steps into the 
           water. Lowers her slowly into the river. He notices her hand 
           is clenched into a fist, and carefully opens her palm-

           AN 1846 SILVER LIBERTY DOLLAR shimmers in the moonlight. 

           He removes the coin and lets go of Celia’s hand. His heart 
           breaks as he watches the current carry her body downstream. 

           The PRELAPPED SOUND OF BARKING DOGS brings us to- 

           EXT. RIVER - LATER

           Overby holds the leashes of two BLOODHOUNDS, as they strain 
           to chase Judah’s scent into the water. Atchinson stands 
           nearby, looking across the river with a torch in his hand. 

                                 OVERBY
                        Musta gone in, suh.  

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Ever seen a nigger swim, Overby? 

                                 OVERBY
                        No, suh. Maybe he drowned.  
           Overby points to a LOW-HANGING BRANCH that reaches out over 
           the water. Judah’s bloody shirt is tangled up in the leaves. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        No. He’s out there. 

           Atchinson’s gaze follows the branch upward, charting a path 
           back to the trunk, across another branch to a second tree, 
           higher and higher, all the way to the canopy. He holds out 
           his torch, but the light cannot penetrate far enough to see-

           Judah, perched between two of the highest branches, leaning 
           back against the trunk, holding his breath. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        But he can’t run forever.

           BLOOD trickles down Judah’s wounded elbow and falls to the 
           ground like dark droplets of rain. DRIP. DRIP. DRIP.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                TITLE CARD: BLEEDING KANSAS

           EXT. WAGON TRAIL - DAY

           SUPER: KANSAS TERRITORY, MAY 1856

           Wooden wheels CREAK along a dusty road that cuts through the 
           open Kansas plain. 

           DRIVER and SHOTGUN, two crusty BANK EMPLOYEES, sit atop a 
           WELLS FARGO STAGECOACH. 

           WHEEE-OOO-WHEET! An impossibly shrill WHISTLE reverberates 
           across the plain. The two men look around for the source. 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Could be Comanch. 

           Driver CRACKS the reins, hurrying the four horses yoked to 
           the front of the stagecoach. 

           UP THE ROAD

           The GALLOPING HOOVES of a midnight-black MUSTANG.

           ON THE STAGECOACH

           Shotgun COCKS his weapon and swivels his sights back on: 

           A BLACK SHAPE in the distance, racing up from behind them.  
                                 SHOTGUN
                        We got company. 

                                 DRIVER
                        How many? 

                                 SHOTGUN
                             (squinting)
                        Just one. 

           The wild mare closes in on them, unencumbered by a saddle.  
           Or a rider. 

           Shotgun draws a bead on the dark horse as it comes up 
           alongside the stagecoach, but then lowers his weapon. 

                                 SHOTGUN (CONT’D)
                        Damn, look at her go. 

           The mare races past, maneuvering in front of the lead horse. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Wouldja look at that? She wants to 
                        be a carriage horse. 

           Driver laughs, but Shotgun is wary. 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        No wild horse wants to pull. 

           The mare accelerates, and the pull horses pick up the pace. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Whoa, whoa now!

           Driver tries to slow them, but they follow the mare as she 
           leads the coach off the main trail.  

           The wagon JOLTS over a small dirt path. 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Get a hold of ‘em, damn it!

           The dirt path drops down into a slotted RAVINE, and the coach 
           picks up speed as it races down the incline. 

           Shotgun drops his weapon and wrenches the reins from Driver, 
           pulling back hard. But the horses barrel onward. 

           The coach swerves around a sharp curve, and they see-

           A FELLED TREE, lying directly across the path. The mare 
           gracefully LEAPS over the trunk. 
           The stagecoach horses try to follow, but out of sync and 
           weighed down by the coach, they TRIP and TUMBLE. The 
           stagecoach SMASHES into the downed tree. 

           Driver and Shotgun are LAUNCHED forward. The coach teeters 
           onto its side. Driver CRUNCHES into the dirt, out cold. 

           Shotgun GROANS, clutching his ribs.  

                                 SHOTGUN (CONT’D)
                        I heard of stealing an election 
                        before, but shit. Y’all workin’ for 
                        Sherman or Robinson? 

           He starts to push himself up- 

           But a BLACK BOOT steps onto his back, pressing him down. 

                                 OUTLAW (O.S.)
                        You see my face, have to kill you. 

           Shotgun turns white at the sound of the Outlaw’s voice. 

           WE BOOM UP to reveal black chaps, a long black duster, a pair 
           of holsters, a gleaming belt buckle, and a red bandana over 
           the Outlaw’s face. He pulls off the bandana, revealing- 

           JUDAH. Dark locks of hair, tied off with beads and feathers, 
           spill out from under a black hat and fall to his shoulders.

           FIVE YEARS HAVE PASSED since he fled the plantation. Half a 
           decade on the run has hardened Judah’s face and taught him to 
           keep a pistol between himself and anyone else. 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Don’t need to see your face. You 
                        got the voice of a black man. 

           Judah kneels on Shotgun’s spine, uses the bandana as a 
           blindfold, then pulls a key ring from the man’s belt. 

                                 SHOTGUN (CONT’D)
                        Only one road agent of that color.  

           Judah ignores him and opens the door to the stagecoach. It’s 
           piled high with stacks of PAPER BALLOTS. He frowns. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Where’s the safe at? 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        All we got is ballots.
                                 JUDAH
                        Hell am I to do with ballots? 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Vote, I reckon. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Where’s the local transfer? 

           Shotgun hesitates. Judah COCKS his gun.

                                 SHOTGUN
                        In the bank.  

           Judah presses his gun to the man’s temple.

                                 SHOTGUN (CONT’D)
                        We ain’t picked it up yet, I swear!

           Judah pulls an apple from his coat pocket and offers it to 
           BRANDY, the black Mustang. Strokes her neck as she eats. 

           He takes a hard look at the banged up coach, thinking.

           EXT. TOPEKA, KS - DAY

           MEN AND WOMEN crowd around a LARGE PLATFORM in the TOWN 
           SQUARE of Kansas’ unofficial and bitterly divided capital 
           city. The platform doubles as a public stage and a gallows. 

           Today, it serves as a stage, and a large banner reads: 
           “TERRITORIAL GOVERNOR’S DEBATE”. The CANDIDATES stand center 
           stage, while their respective ADVISORS sit on the sides. 

           The Free-Soil candidate, CHARLES ROBINSON, 40s, leans heavily 
           on a WALKING CANE, his legs withered by childhood polio. For 
           Charles Robinson, even standing is an act of defiance. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        The fate of this territory is not 
                        only a matter of the Negro’s 
                        freedom, but our own as well. My 
                        wife, God rest her soul, used to 
                        say that no man is free while 
                        another is in chains. This nation 
                        cannot endure half free, half 
                        slave. The next state to enter the 
                        Union will decide the issue at 
                        last. So let Kansas come in free. 
                        Free to prosper, free to decide her 
                        own fate, and free from the 
                        shackles of Southern slavery!
           Across the stage, the pro-slavery incumbent GOVERNOR SHERMAN, 
           40s, peers out from beneath a derby hat. His fine suit and 
           Southern charm conceal ruthless ambition. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Mr. Robinson is not here to serve 
                        Kansas, but to put another jewel in 
                        the crown of the North. He would 
                        tip the delicate balance of power 
                        in Washington and put an end to our 
                        Dixie way of life. Before you 
                        choose the man to guide Kansas into 
                        statehood, remember this: my 
                        opponent traveled two thousand 
                        miles to be here today, while I 
                        walked just a mile from my home. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Did you walk, or were you carried 
                        by your slaves? 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                             (re: Robinson’s cane)
                        I myself have never needed 
                        assistance walking. 

           The crowd responds with a mix of SNICKERS and BOOS.

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        My negros are here to make this 
                        land prosperous. And I care for 
                        them all with a father’s love. 

           Charles Robinson falters, still shaken by the insult. His 20-
           year-old daughter K.C. ROBINSON, as passionate as she is 
           naive, calls out from her chair at the edge of the stage. 

                                 KC
                        We’ve all heard of the affection 
                        you have for your female slaves, 
                        Mr. Sherman. But I would not call 
                        that kind of love “fatherly”. 

           The crowd titters, but Governor Sherman holds his ground.  

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN 
                        A fine daughter you’ve raised, Mr. 
                        Robinson. I’m sure you’re proud of 
                        her Yankee manners.
                             (then, for the crowd)
                        But I’d ask how you plan to run the 
                        entire territory when you can’t 
                        even run your own household? 
           The debate erupts into pandemonium as both sides start 
           YELLING INSULTS at each other. 

           ACROSS THE SQUARE

           BRANDY and three of the CARRIAGE HORSES pull the banged-up 
           Wells Fargo coach into town. Shotgun and Driver sit rigidly 
           on the driver’s bench. The barrels of a SHOTGUN poke out from 
           a hole in the coach and point straight at their backs. 

           INT. STAGECOACH - CONTINUOUS

           Judah, on the other end of the shotgun, peeks out at the 
           chaotic scene in the town square, then whispers to Driver.

                                 JUDAH
                        Easy, now. 

           EXT. BANK - DAY

           The stagecoach pulls up in front of a small, regional BANK. 
           Driver and Shotgun remain in their seats, and the MANAGER, a 
           bow-tied man with a pocketwatch, comes out to meet them. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Goddammit, you two, runnin’ over an 
                        hour late!

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Sorry, we got held up a bit. 

                                 MANAGER
                        I don’t want no excuses, I want my 
                        transfers in Lawrence tonight.
                             (calling inside the bank)
                        Stuart! Get them deposits out here!

           A scrawny BANK EMPLOYEE hurries outside with two satchels 
           full of deposits. The Manager looks up from his watch and 
           finally notices the busted-up trim on the stagecoach.  

                                 MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Would you look at them scratches? 
                        You have any idea how much it costs 
                        to repair damage like that? A 
                        goddamn gold mine! If you two’ve 
                        been drinkin’, I swear- 

           The door of the coach opens to reveal Judah, with his shotgun 
           leveled at the two bank men. They freeze, awestruck. 

                                 BANK EMPLOYEE
                             (sotto)
                        The Black Bandit...
           Judah steps out, grabs the satchels, steps back in, and shuts 
           the door. He KNOCKS the shotgun on the roof, signalling. 

                                 SHOTGUN
                        Like I said, we got held up. 

           Driver CRACKS the reins, and the coach rumbles off, picking 
           up speed as it heads back toward the town square. The Manager 
           chases after it, waving his arms and CALLING FOR HELP. 

           INT./EXT. STAGECOACH - CONTINUOUS

           Judah opens the bag and rifles through the coins. He bites 
           one and holds it up to the light. 

           In the front seat, Driver and Shotgun look at one another. 
           Shotgun nods. Driver nods. THEY DIVE OFF THE CARRIAGE, and 
           roll to the sides as the horses gallop off with the coach. 

           Judah looks up, startled, as the coach starts to bump along 
           out of control. Driver and Shotgun are gone. Shit. 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           The debate has devolved into a shouting match on-stage, and 
           an outright BRAWL in the audience. The mob circles around a 
           pair of men slugging it out in the dirt. 

           COLIN SCHUMACHER, early 30s, pushes men aside as he wades 
           through the bloodthirsty crowd. He’s a rugged frontier man 
           with a thick mustache, a BADGE on his breast, and the 
           absolute certainty that he’s always right. 

                                 COLIN
                        The fuck out of my way! Move!

           He finally makes it to the center and immediately SUCKER 
           PUNCHES one of the FIGHTERS, flattening him. The man lands 
           hard, then squints up at what hit him. 

                                 FIGHTER 1
                        Gee, Sheriff. Never figured you for 
                        a nigger-lovin’ abolitionist. 

           The other fighter’s crooked teeth show through a smug smile. 

                                 FIGHTER 2
                        Appears we got the law. 

           Colin turns and PUNCHES the second man, knocking him down 
           next to the first. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’m impartial.  
           Suddenly, the crowd backs away from him, frightened.  Then 
           they turn and flee in terror. Colin frowns. That’s odd. He 
           looks back for the source of the commotion and sees- 

           THE STAGECOACH CHARGING RECKLESSLY TOWARDS HIM, with no 
           driver in sight. 

           Judah climbs out the side door, carrying the satchels of 
           money. Hoists himself onto the roof. 

           Colin spots a LITTLE BOY playing MARBLES in the dirt. 
           Oblivious to the oncoming danger. Colin makes a run for him.

           Colin scoops up the boy and DIVES out of the way as the WAGON 
           WHEELS WHOOSH past, scattering the marbles. 

           Colin sets the terrified kid aside. Draws his COLT REVOLVER. 

           Judah crouches atop the stagecoach, tries to make his way to 
           the driver’s seat. The coach heads right for the stage. 

           The horses run under the edge of the platform, but the coach 
           is too tall. Judah leaps into the air as it SLAMS into the 
           wooden beams with a sickening CRUNCH. 

           Judah lands on the platform and rolls to his feet, spilling 
           some of the coins. The bewildered politicians have never been 
           so upstaged in their lives. 

           All is still. They stare at Judah. His gun. The money.

           Judah spots KC. He grabs her, presses the gun to her back. 

                                 JUDAH
                        This way, ma’am.

           Judah clings to KC, backing away as he takes her hostage.  
           Colin approaches the stage with his revolver raised. 

                                 COLIN
                        Unhand the girl! 

           Judah FIRES a shot at Colin’s feet. Stops the lawman cold. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Toss that gun and cut my horse 
                        loose. The black one, up front. 

           Colin stares Judah down. Charles Robinson is beside himself, 
           but unable to do anything to protect his daughter. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Let him go, Sheriff! 
           Colin slowly sets his gun on the ground, then steps under the 
           stage. KC glares at her captor as he backs up to the edge.  

                                 KC
                        My father and I are fighting for 
                        your freedom. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Didn’t ask for no help.

           A WHINNY from below as Brandy is cut loose. Judah looks down 
           as Brandy trots into view. He steps off the back of the stage-

           And drops into the saddle below. Judah points his pistol at 
           Colin. The Sheriff’s eyes blaze with contempt. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll be seein’ ya. 

           Judah smirks. He twirls his gun and holsters it, then digs in 
           his spurs, and Brandy takes off like a rocket. 

           Colin climbs onto the stage, where KC is already being fussed 
           over by her father and his staff. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Ya oughta get to the doc, Miss 
                        Robinson. Contact with a dark fella 
                        can be dangerous. 

           Colin puts a hand on KC’s shoulder, his touch betraying more 
           than a professional interest. KC brushes him off. 

                                 KC
                        I’m fine, thank you. 
                             (to her father)
                        You need to make a statement for 
                        the paper. Something positive.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        You have any idea who that was? 

                                 COLIN
                             (off her wide-eyed look)
                        A known outlaw. Responsible for a 
                        dozen stick-up jobs, and eight men 
                        dead. Word has it he scalps ‘em 
                        like a damn Indian. 
                             (then)
                        But don’t worry, miss. I’ll make 
                        him a hemp necktie.
                                 KC
                        He deserves a fair trial, 
                        regardless of his color.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        This isn’t about black and white, 
                        KC. It’s about right and wrong. Let 
                        the Sheriff do his job, and let’s 
                        get you back home. 

           Governor Sherman watches keenly from across the stage, as 
           Charles Robinson shepherds KC away. 

           The PRELAPPED SOUND OF THUNDERING HOOVES brings us to-

           EXT. PLAINS - VARIOUS

           Brandy GALLOPS across the plains, cutting through tall grass. 
           As Judah makes his escape, we see the untamed beauty of the 
           Kansas countryside. 

           - Judah takes Brandy into a pristine stream and travels along 
           it, so that their tracks disappear at the water’s edge. 

           - Judah rides Brandy out of the streambed at the base of a 
           wooden bridge, then crosses over it. 

           - Horse and rider speed down a well-worn road, where Brandy’s 
           hoof prints blend in among countless others. 

           - Judah slowly walks Brandy over a FIELD OF FLAT ROCKS. She 
           struggles to keep her balance, but clearly knows this path. 

           EXT. CANYON HIDEOUT - DAY

           Judah rides Brandy into his camp, hidden up in the canyon. He 
           takes the deposits to a SMALL CAVE in the corner of the camp. 

           He hears a RUSTLING sound within. Judah draws his gun, 
           peering into the darkness of the cave. 

           He sees his stash of food and supplies: coffee tins, cans of 
           beans, potato sacks, whiskey bottles. He creeps closer and- 

           KA-CAW! A large, black CROW bursts from the darkness. Judah 
           stumbles back in alarm and falls on his ass as the bird 
           shrieks past his head.

           The crow lands in the middle of camp as Judah catches his 
           breath, heart racing. The bird cocks its head right at him.

           Then the crow beats its wings, launching into flight. Judah 
           takes aim and FIRES. The shot echoes through the canyon as 
           the crow disappears over a ridge. KA-CAW!
           EXT. CANYON HIDEOUT - NIGHT

           Judah sits by a campfire, heating up a dinner skillet and 
           swigging from a bottle of whiskey. He drains the bottle, then 
           shakes out the last few drops over his cooking. 

           He reaches back and “plants” the bottle neck-down in the dirt 
           beside dozens of identical empties. His makeshift “BOTTLE 
           GARDEN” is growing. 

           Brandy looks up from her dinner and makes eye contact. 

                                 JUDAH
                        What? Can’t have a drink? 
                             (pauses as if listening)
                        Yeah, I put an arm ‘round her. She 
                        was a goddamn hostage.
                             (listening again)
                        Don’t be like that.

           Judah JANGLES the sack of gold coins beside him. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Oughta put us over five easy. Know 
                        what that means? No more chasin’ 
                        coaches and hidin’ under rocks. 
                        You’ll have room to run free. And 
                        no one comin’ to bother us.  

           He lifts his skillet off the fire. Takes a bite, but chews 
           gingerly, CLUTCHING HIS JAW IN PAIN. 

           He looks back at Brandy, who stares at him, not convinced. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Just you wait. Soon as we get out 
                        west, I can ride right into town 
                        and have a doctor pull it proper. 
                        Long as we got the money. 
                             (he listens)
                        Yes, I swear. And new shoes for 
                        you. Now leave me be.

           Brandy goes back to eating, and Judah looks down at the sorry 
           excuse for dinner in his skillet. 

           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           A SHARP KNIFE slices through a bloody steak, as Governor 
           Sherman eats dinner at his cherry wood desk. A KNOCK. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Enter. 
           The door opens and DAVID ATCHINSON, the plantation owner from 
           the prologue, enters. His icy blue eyes are unchanged, but 
           years of drinking away his grief have carved him into the 
           sinewy spectre now known as “BOURBON DAVE”.

           BEN STRINGFELLOW, 30s, Atchinson’s burly enforcer, steps in 
           after him, brushing dust from his chaps.

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        And?  

           Atchinson heads to the bar and pours himself a bourbon.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        You’re losing in every county. And   
                        most cities except Topeka.

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Even Sheridan? 

                                 ATCHINSON
                             (nods and drinks)
                        These abolitionists are descending 
                        on the territory like a plague. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        But as long as we staff the polls-

                                 ATCHINSON
                        -Not this time. The Jayhawkers got 
                        feds lined up at every ballot box. 

           Governor Sherman pushes aside his plate and steps to the 
           window. He looks down at TWENTY MOUNTED BORDER RUFFIANS: 
           armed Missourians ready to defend slavery by any means. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Surely your men can exert some 
                        influence. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        If you want to start a war, just 
                        say the word. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                             (scowls)
                        I hope you don’t only bring bad 
                        news, Bourbon. If this territory 
                        falls to the North, they’ll be 
                        settin’ your slaves free come 
                        harvest-time. And before long, your 
                        field-hands will be taking Georgia 
                        belles to their debutante balls. 
                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        What if we stick him, Gov? 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Keep your fucking tongue.

           Stringfellow shrugs. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        What my colleague means, Governor, 
                        is if some act of God rendered 
                        Charles Robinson unable to stay in 
                        the race, the Jayhawkers would lack 
                        the  time to field a new candidate. 

           Governor Sherman considers, treading lightly. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        The eyes of Washington are on us, 
                        and if providence struck down the 
                        crutcher, blame would quickly fall 
                        on my undeserving head.
                             (then)
                        However, an interesting event 
                        occurred at today’s debate. A buck 
                        nigger robbed the countinghouse. 
                        And during his escape, he took 
                        Robinson’s daughter hostage. 

           Governor Sherman pauses to give the idea time to penetrate. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        She was unharmed, fortunately, and 
                        I understand is recovering at home. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                             (downs his second drink)
                        I’ll be leaving for Missouri 
                        shortly. Perhaps even tomorrow? 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Safe travels. 

           INT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Folded clothes are set into a large trunk. Charles Robinson 
           tries to pack, but is woefully incapable. KC lends a hand. 

                                 KC
                        Where’s your new coat? 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Let me be, KC. 
                                 KC
                        We must leave first thing for 
                        Lawrence, and I want to make 
                        certain you get enough sleep. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I can do it myself, thank you. 

           His tone is final.

                                 KC
                        I suppose I have my own packing.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        You will not accompany me.
                             (off her dismay)
                        It is safer for you to stay home. 

                                 KC
                        I’ll be safe enough by your side.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I am not willing to risk-

                                 KC
                        -But father, I-

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        -Stop interrupting me! 

           She falls silent, restraining herself. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON (CONT’D)
                        In private or in public. If you 
                        cannot keep your mouth shut when 
                        occasion demands, you’ll stay home.

                                 KC
                        I was defending you! 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        And hurting the cause! I’m grateful 
                        your mother wasn’t alive to see you 
                        hollering like a common hussy.

                                 KC
                        And I’m glad she can’t see what a 
                        cantankerous cripple you’ve become. 

           KC marches out, SLAMMING the door behind her. He sighs and 
           SNAPS his trunk shut. 
           EXT. CANYON - DAY

           The sun bakes a FIELD OF FLAT ROCKS. Colin kneels, searching 
           for signs of Judah’s trail. He squints, running his hands 
           over the stones. But the trail has gone cold. 

           Colin picks up a rock, scrutinizing it carefully, running a 
           finger along its edge. And then... 

           He hurls it with all his might into the canyon. Colin’s horse 
           looks up as the stone CLATTERS down the ridge. 

           Colin wipes sweat from his brow as he walks to the stallion, 
           grabbing his canteen and taking a long drink. He takes a last 
           look around him, ready to give up, when he sees: 

           REFLECTED POINTS OF LIGHT make a kaleidoscopic pattern on one 
           of the shadowed canyon walls. He caps his canteen, intrigued.  

           EXT. CANYON HIDEOUT - DAY

           Colin comes around a rock formation with his gun drawn, and 
           spies the source of the reflections: Judah’s “bottle garden”, 
           glinting in the bright sunlight.

           He hears a soft CHINK, followed by a quiet THUMP. The sound 
           continues rhythmically as Colin quietly proceeds into the 
           seemingly empty camp. CHINK. THUMP. 

           Colin traces the sound to the mouth of a small cave. He steps 
           closer and peers inside to see-

           Judah digging a deep hole. The shovel bites the dirt with a 
           CHINK and dumps it. THUMP. Judah’s GUN BELT lies next to the 
           growing mound of earth.

           Judah stops, bends low, and LIFTS OFF a large wooden board, 
           revealing a hollowed-out hiding space at the bottom of the 
           hole. It’s filled with bars and coins of stolen GOLD. 

           Judah wipes his brow, and turns to push himself out of the 
           hole, but freezes when he sees Colin. Judah’s hand 
           instinctively goes to his hip, but the gun isn’t there. He 
           eyes his pistol, a few feet away. 

                                 COLIN
                        One wrong move and you’re diggin’ 
                        your own grave. 

           EXT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Soap suds froth off of a scrubbing board. KC sits in the 
           FRONT YARD, sleeves rolled up, washing her father’s clothes. 
           She takes out her pent up frustration on his collared shirt. 
                                 COLIN (O.S.)
                        Miss Robinson!

           Colin rides up, sitting high on his horse. Brandy follows 
           behind, with Judah tied up and draped over her saddle.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Thought ya might like to see for 
                        yourself. I apprehended the Black 
                        Bandit. So you can sleep tight now. 

                                 KC
                        And are you planning on keeping him 
                        in my father’s front yard? 

           Her terse response is not the heroic return Colin expected. 

                                 COLIN
                        S’pose not.  

                                 KC
                        Then I suggest you take him 
                        elsewhere.  

           She goes back to punishing her laundry. 

                                 COLIN
                        Care to hear how I tracked him? I 
                        know a nice spot out by the river 
                        bend where we can have us a picnic.  

                                 KC
                        If you have nothing more important 
                        to do than picnic, perhaps you 
                        should volunteer for the campaign.  

           The rejection only fuels his desire to win her over.  

                                 COLIN
                        Another time, then. 

           INT. JAIL - DAY

           The door opens and light pours into the small JAIL that 
           doubles as the Sheriff’s office. Colin trains a gun on 
           Judah’s back as he leads his prisoner inside. 

                                 COLIN
                        Hat, belt, and boots on the table. 

           Judah obliges. His shirt hangs open, and Colin sees the worn 
           1846 SILVER LIBERTY DOLLAR, now hanging as a medallion, on a 
           leather strap around Judah’s neck.  
                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        First dollar ya stole?

           Judah stares back defiantly. Colin decides not to press the 
           issue, and waves Judah into the cell with his pistol. 

           Colin turns a key in the lock and takes a seat at the desk. 
           He pulls out a FORM and takes a pen from the inkwell. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Name? 

           No response. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Name. 

           Judah is silent. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        “Sambo.” 
                             (writes on the form)
                        Date of birth? 

           Still nothing. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Need it for the headstone. 

           Colin stands and approaches the cell slowly. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Ya forget how to talk? 

           Judah holds the bars, standing fast.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause I’ll remind ya. Tell me. 
                        Your goddamn birthday. 

           Judah smiles. Colin WHIPS his gun across Judah’s knuckles. 
           Judah recoils, clenching his jaw to restrain a yelp of pain. 

           Judah retreats to the bed. He lies down and pointedly turns 
           his back on Colin.

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Dumb fuckin’ nigger. 

           The front steps CREAK, and the door opens as Atchinson steps 
           inside. His eyes narrow as they adjust to the low light. 
                                 ATCHINSON
                        Caught yourself a coon, Sheriff. 
                        Nicely done. 

           Judah tenses. It doesn’t matter that they’ve been apart for a 
           decade. He instantly recognizes his former master’s voice. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        What’ll you do with him now? 

                                 COLIN
                        String party tomorrow.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        A runaway in the territories is 
                        still a runaway. That’s another 
                        man’s property.

                                 COLIN
                        Free or slave don’t matter in these 
                        parts. He broke Kansas law, and 
                        he’ll pay for it here. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        I’ll pay for him, here and now. 
                        Prob’ly worth four hundred or so, 
                        once I give him a haircut.  
                             (to Judah)
                        Come show me your teeth, boy. 

           Judah holds his breath, his whole body rigid as Atchinson 
           looks him over from behind. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Three fifty, on account of having 
                        to be broken. Must’ve been spoiled 
                        by some limp-wrist master. 

                                 COLIN
                        This ain’t no auction house, 
                        Bourbon. What can I do ya for?

           Atchinson’s gaze lingers on Judah a moment longer.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Came to pick up my piece. 

           Colin unlocks a cabinet behind his desk, revealing shelves of 
           firearms. He takes down a beautiful IVORY-HANDLED REVOLVER.

                                 COLIN
                        That’s a fancy iron. Suits ya. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLIN (CONT'D)
                        If I hand this over, best be on 
                        your way out of town.  

                                 ATCHINSON
                        I’ll be returning to Missouri. 

           He reaches for his gun, but Colin holds it away. 

                                 COLIN
                        Then I can count on ya to be out of 
                        the territory come election day?  

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Frontier politics don’t suit my 
                        temperament. 

                                 COLIN
                        Ain’t what I hear. I hear ya held 
                        up the polls at gunpoint last time 
                        around. Bought every vote ya could 
                        wrangle and scared off the rest. 
                        Most folks think you’re the reason 
                        Levi Keller ain’t been seen since.   

                                 ATCHINSON
                        But you don’t put much stock in 
                        hearsay. Do you, Sheriff?

           Atchinson reaches out for his pistol belt. Colin holds it for 
           a moment longer, then lets go. Atchinson turns and strides 
           out the door, SLAMMING it shut behind him. 

           Judah finally EXHALES, and a SHUDDER runs down his spine.

           EXT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Clean sheets billow on the clothesline. KC comes outside with 
           a laundry basket and steps down into the yard. She walks up, 
           grabs opposite corners of one sheet, and WHISH- 

           The sheet comes down to reveal THREE BORDER RUFFIANS, on 
           horses at the edge of the yard. Stringfellow in the middle.

                                 KC
                        May I help you gentlemen?

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        Lovely day for a ride, ain’t it? 

           Stringfellow COCKS the gun resting on his lap. 
           INT. BANK - DAY

           The Bank Manager looks through the satchel full of money, 
           while Colin watches from across the desk. 

                                 MANAGER
                        Sure appreciate it, Sheriff. But 
                        this’s ten times what was taken.

                                 COLIN
                        Wasn’t exactly sure how to get the 
                        rest where it’s due. 

           Sensing an opportunity, the Manager zips up the satchel.  

                                 MANAGER
                        Oh, I’ll take care of that. Thank 
                        you kindly for your help, and come 
                        see me if ya ever need a bank loan. 

                                 COLIN
                        I been thinkin’ on a piece of land 
                        out by the river bend. 

                                 MANAGER
                             (knowingly)
                        Got a woman picked out too? 

                                 COLIN
                        I’m thinkin’ on it.   

                                 MANAGER
                        You let me know. 

           He extends his hand to Colin, signaling an end to the 
           conversation. Colin grips it tightly and doesn’t let go.  

                                 COLIN
                        I just did. 

           The Manager nods. Colin smiles and pats him on the back.

           EXT. RIDGE - SUNSET

           KC rides on the back of Stringfellow’s horse, hands bound and 
           mouth gagged. The other two Ruffians follow behind. 

           They come to a stop on the ridge next to Atchinson, who sits 
           astride his horse, gazing out over TOPEKA AT SUNSET. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        The light of the Lord reaches even 
                        the savage corners of the Earth.  
                        But this is no place for a lady. 
           KC tries to protest, but is muffled by the gag. Atchinson 
           leads the way as the men ride out to the east. 

           INT. JAIL - NIGHT

           A WIRE wriggles in the lock on the cell door. Judah’s hands 
           reach through the bars of his cell, trying to work the 
           tumblers with a makeshift lock pick. 

           FOOTSTEPS approach. Judah quickly pulls the wire straight, 
           slipping it into one of his thick locks of hair just as- 

           Colin enters. Stares at Judah.  

                                 COLIN
                        Mind telling me what in Sam Hill ya 
                        doin’ with five thousand dollars? 

           Judah turns away and looks out the window. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        S’pose it don’t matter now. Your 
                        property is the property of Kaw 
                        County. The horse’ll be held thirty 
                        days against claim of ownership, 
                        then auctioned. And since the last 
                        known owner was a negro thief, 
                        she’ll more than likely end up 
                        fattening Filmore Jenkins’ hogs. 

           Colin watches Judah subtly tense up at the thought. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I could put her up in the stable. 
                        But seeing as ya won’t do me the 
                        courtesy of opening your mouth, 
                        might as well save the hay.

                                 JUDAH
                             (quietly)
                        Don’t know. 

                                 COLIN
                        What’s that? 

           Judah turns to face Colin. 

                                 JUDAH
                        My fuckin’ birthday. 

           Colin nods. Makes a note on the form.  

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll see she gets fed.
           Judah returns to the window and stares out past the bars at 
           the looming GALLOWS. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MORNING

           The square bustles with the activity of daily commerce. 

           Charles Robinson hurries across town. He uses his cane for 
           each step, nearly falling as he’s jostled by a merchant. 

           INT. JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

           Charles Robinson marches in and SLAMS A LETTER down on 
           Colin’s desk. Colin looks up at his sweaty, reddened face. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        They took her, Sheriff! Goddamn 
                        bastards come in the night- I was 
                        gone one night- for her own safety 
                        she stayed home and- sonofabitches- 

                                 COLIN
                        -Hold on, now, Mr. Robinson. What’s 
                        the matter?  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Have a look! 

           He points to the simple, handwritten note. 

                                 COLIN
                             (reading)
                        “Went for a long ride. Will return 
                        when you come to your senses.”  
                             (to Robinson)
                        Y’all have an argument? 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        We- well yes, but- She’s been 
                        abducted, I’m certain. 

                                 COLIN
                        That’s a prideful young woman. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        It’s not her handwriting! And 
                        besides, you think she’d leave it 
                        stuck in the door with this? 

           He takes out a large Bowie knife, and STABS the letter into 
           Colin’s desk.
                                 CHARLES ROBINSON (CONT’D)
                        It’s Governor Sherman! He hasn’t 
                        the gall to do it himself, but one 
                        of his lapdogs, no doubt. 

                                 COLIN
                        David Atchinson just left town. 

           Charles Robinson’s eyes go wide in fear. Judah turns away 
           from the window, suddenly intrigued.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I never should have brought her. 

                                 COLIN
                        The governor likes to talk. Let’s 
                        go lend him an ear. 

           INT. GOVERNOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           A match LIGHTS the glowing end of a cigar. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        To what do I owe this great 
                        pleasure, gentlemen? 

           Governor Sherman exhales a plume of smoke across his desk 
           toward Colin. Charles Robinson hangs back behind the Sheriff, 
           trying to keep a lid on his boiling temper.

                                 COLIN
                        Mr. Robinson’s daughter went 
                        missing. Yesterday afternoon. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Oh my. 

                                 COLIN
                        Near the same time, Dave Atchinson 
                        took leave of town. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Mr. Atchinson does not apprise me 
                        of his comings and goings. He is 
                        one of my many supporters.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        A supporter who’s known to sabotage 
                        public elections!

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Calm down, Charles. I’m sure your 
                        girl will return if you keep a 
                        level head. 
                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        What exactly do you intend by that?

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Well, if I were missing a child, I 
                        wouldn’t trifle with any political 
                        ambitions. Lord knows, this is a 
                        barbarous land.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Bastard! 

           He lunges forward, raising his cane to strike Governor 
           Sherman. The governor grabs it in the air and pulls the cane 
           aside. Charles Robinson’s twisted legs give out and he 
           collapses into a shameful heap. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Be careful, Charles. You’re in no 
                        position to make accusations.

           Colin helps Charles Robinson to his feet, but stares down 
           Governor Sherman. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll find the girl. And justice for 
                        them who took her. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Scour the earth, Sheriff. But if 
                        you go beyond the borders of Kaw 
                        County, I’ll come for your badge.  

           Colin unpins his TIN STAR. Tosses it on the governor’s desk. 

                                 COLIN
                        Save ya the trouble. 

           INT. JAIL - DAY

           Charles Robinson follows Colin into the jailhouse. Colin 
           immediately begins rummaging in the cabinet behind his desk. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        How quickly can you depart?

                                 COLIN
                        Soon as I string him up. 

           Judah watches Colin pull out A SIX-FOOT ROPE. 
           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Judah’s hands are bound as Colin pulls him up the steps of 
           the gallows. Charles Robinson trails, hampered by his limp.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I’ll start rounding up a posse.

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t bother. Take too long.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        What about the Marshals’ Office? 

                                 COLIN
                        Even longer.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I can leave in an hour.  

           Colin eyes Charles Robinson’s bum leg as he hobbles up.  

                                 COLIN
                        Hour’s more than we can spare, Mr. 
                        Robinson. I’ll bring her back.

           Colin hauls Judah into place over the trap door, and slips 
           the noose around his neck. Judah is astonishingly calm. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Any last words, boy? 

                                 JUDAH
                        I know the Atchinson place. 

           Colin ignores him and tightens the rope. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        What’s that? 

                                 JUDAH
                        I’s born there. 

                                 COLIN
                        He’s lyin’ to save his skin. 

                                 JUDAH
                        My skin don’t lie. Open my shirt. 

                                 COLIN
                        We’re burnin’ daylight.
           Colin looks to Charles Robinson for approval to pull the 
           lever, but he motions for Colin to open Judah’s shirt. Colin 
           grabs Judah’s collar and RIPS it downward, revealing-  

           A RAISED SCAR, where a “BAR A” symbol is branded   [  ---  ]       
           into the skin over Judah’s heart. Charles Robinson [   A   ] 
           stares at the scar, wide-eyed.                                                 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        That’s Atchinson’s brand. 

           Charles Robinson turns to Colin, who remains wary. 

                                 COLIN
                        He’s pulled bank jobs in Lawrence, 
                        Wichita, Scottsville, Garrison- 

                                 JUDAH
                        -Never been to Garrison. 

                                 COLIN
                        And wanted for murder. I can’t 
                        ignore that. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I can. What’s your name, boy? 

                                 COLIN
                        He’s the fuckin’ Black Bandit. 

                                 JUDAH
                        It’s Judah. 

           Colin gives Judah the evil eye. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I’ll make you a deal, Judah. You 
                        help return my daughter before the 
                        election, and my first act as 
                        governor will be a full pardon. 
                        Understand? 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya lost your damn mind? 

           Charles Robinson spits in his hand and extends it to Judah. 

           Judah hesitates. This is the first time a white man has ever 
           offered to shake his hand. 

                                 JUDAH
                        One more thing.
                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        You’re in no position to negotiate. 

                                 JUDAH
                        I want my horse back. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        You’ll get your horse when I get my 
                        daughter. 

           Judah extends his bound hands and shakes. 

           EXT. JAIL - DAY

           Colin ties off his pack and hoists himself into the saddle. 

           Judah sits atop a BROWN QUARTER HORSE with his hands tied. 
           Charles Robinson watches them from the porch. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        If you’re not back by sundown on 
                        Monday, I’ll concede. 

                                 COLIN
                        We ain’t back sundown Monday, shoot 
                        his horse. 

           Colin points to Brandy, who is tied up nearby. Judah scowls. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I don’t know how I could ever repay 
                        you, Colin. But... here. 

           Charles Robinson hands Colin a coin purse. 

                                 COLIN
                        I’ll take it for expenses. But I 
                        been thinkin’ on somethin’ else.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Say the word.

                                 COLIN
                        I get back, I’ll come askin’ KC’s 
                        hand in marriage. 

           Charles Robinson expected this request eventually, but not 
           today. He falters, emotional, searching for words.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Just bring her back safe. Whatever 
                        it takes. Ya hear me?  
                                 COLIN
                        Alright then. 

           Colin spurs his horse forward, and a rope connected to his 
           saddle pulls Judah’s horse along behind him.  

           EXT. RIDGE - DAY

           Colin squats on the ridge overlooking Topeka and examines the 
           HOOFPRINTS left by Atchinson and his men. 

                                 COLIN
                        Headed for Hastings’ Crossing. 

           Behind Colin, Judah slowly slips down off his horse. 

           Colin hears spurs JANGLE, and spins around. JUDAH’S SADDLE IS 
           EMPTY. Colin draws his gun- 

           Only to see Judah kneeling on the ground, with the horse 
           obediently lifting its hind leg. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Hell’re you doin’?

                                 JUDAH
                        Felt her limpin’. 

           The horse WHINNIES as Judah pulls a LONG THORN from its hoof. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Oughta take care of your animals.  

                                 COLIN
                        Oughta stay where I can see ya.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Judah and Colin ride along silently. Judah closes his eyes, 
           enjoying the warm spring air. KA-CAW! A black crow lands on a 
           nearby oak tree, cocks its head and looks directly at him. 

           Up ahead, a large BAND OF RIDERS crest a nearby hill. As they 
           approach, the riders fan out and block their path. 

           JOHN BROWN, 50s, a wiry abolitionist with hawkish features 
           and a minister’s frock, leads with absolute authority, as 
           though commanded by God himself. 

           He is followed by his son OLIVER, 20s, and a dozen other 
           JAYHAWKERS: armed abolitionist freedom-fighters. John Brown 
           eyes the ropes binding Judah’s hands and addresses Colin.  
                                 JOHN BROWN
                        You a slave catcher by trade? 

                                 COLIN
                        Lawman. Yourself?

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Minister. 

                                 COLIN
                        Strange congregation that carries 
                        rifles. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        And it’s a strange lawman that 
                        doesn’t carry a badge. 

           Colin glances at his chest, remembering it’s gone. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        It is a dark day, when one man 
                        freely walks the road to traffic 
                        his brother’s soul into bondage.
                             (to Colin)
                        Now, we prefer to take him 
                        peacefully.

           John Brown signals to his men, and four of them dismount. 

                                 COLIN
                        He’s a prisoner. Robbed a bank. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                             (to Judah)
                        You a thief, son? 

                                 JUDAH
                        No sir. The man’s a bounty hunter. 

                                 COLIN
                        Gonna trust him, or a white?

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        That’s an easy choice. 

           The Jayhawkers close in on Judah. Colin quick-draws his 
           pistol, taking aim at John Brown’s forehead. 

           John Brown’s men respond in unison, raising their rifles in 
           surprise. Oliver advances on Colin, ready to fire. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Put up your weapon!
                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Stand down, Oliver! 

           Oliver reluctantly backs off. Colin levels his gun directly 
           at John Brown, who stares back at him fearlessly. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        You got a counting problem, son? 

                                 COLIN
                        Way I see it, you’re the only one 
                        who counts. And I can count to one. 

           John Brown considers the situation and looks at Judah. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        It’s a strange slave catcher that’d 
                        die over a negro. 

                                 COLIN
                        ‘Less I’m no catcher.

           John Brown waves for his men to stand down. They holster 
           their weapons and mount their horses. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        What’s your name? 

                                 COLIN
                        Colin Schumacher. You?

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        John Brown. And if you’ve deceived 
                        me, our paths will cross again. 

           As John Brown and his men ride on toward Topeka, Colin 
           circles his horse back next to Judah. 

                                 COLIN
                        Pull a stunt like that again, I’ll 
                        hang ya by the bootstraps.

                                 JUDAH
                        You got no sense of humor. 

           Colin PUNCHES Judah in the face, knocking him off his horse, 
           with his hands still tied to the horn of the saddle. 

           The horse STARTLES, drags Judah along the ground a few feet. 

           Judah SPITS OUT A TOOTH and smiles. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Saved me a trip to the doctor. 
                                 COLIN
                        I don’t find ya amusing. Or see one 
                        good reason not to leave ya 
                        crowbait on the side of the road. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Oughta wait ‘til we get through 
                        Ferguson Pass. 

                                 COLIN
                        Ferguson Pass is Indian land. 

                                 JUDAH
                        But it’s fast. And I know the way. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           A HAWK circles in the sky overhead. KC rides behind 
           Stringfellow, bound and gagged. Atchinson trots beside her.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Lovely birds in Kansas.  

           KC tries to speak, but the gag muffles her words. As 
           Atchinson unties it-

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        I enjoy the song of the meadowlark. 
                        And the plumage of the blue jay. 

                                 KC
                        Nothing you can do will keep a 
                        slaver in the governor’s seat.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Nature has a beauty in its balance. 
                        For every sparrow, a sparrowhawk. 

                                 KC
                        When Kansas enters the union, 
                        she’ll come in as a free state. 

           Atchinson ignores her, silently signalling for the party to 
           halt. He draws his rifle, taking aim at the soaring hawk. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        A hawk is vulnerable because it 
                        believes it has no predators. 

           He FIRES, and the hawk tumbles from the sky. One of the 
           Border Ruffians rides out to retrieve it. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Jayhawkers are no different. 
                                 KC
                        My father will not capitulate. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        I imagine he has already withdrawn 
                        from the race. 

                                 KC
                        He knows I’d give up my life for 
                        the cause.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Fortunately, it’s not your choice. 
                        And there’s nothing in the world 
                        more certain than a father’s love. 

           Atchinson spurs his horse onward, ending the conversation. 

           EXT. FERGUSON PASS - DAY

           Colin and Judah crest a mountain pass that looks down over a 
           valley, blanketed in thick forest. Colin surveys the terrain. 

                                 COLIN
                        You lead. Keep close. 

           EXT. INDIAN TERRITORY - DAY

           Colin follows as Judah blazes a trail through the woods.

                                 COLIN
                        What were all them stickups for? 

           Judah sizes up Colin. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make much sense to rob every 
                        bank in the territory if you’re 
                        gonna hide it all in a cave. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Plentya grass land out west. Gonna 
                        buy me some and breed mustangs.

                                 COLIN
                             (doubtful)
                        Rancher?

                                 JUDAH
                        Worked horses my whole life.

                                 COLIN
                        Runaway slave can’t buy no land. 
                                 JUDAH
                        Can’t no one say no to five 
                        thousand dollars. I’d buy me a 
                        hundred acres out there and live 
                        smack in the middle of it. Never 
                        have to see another damn soul. 

                                 COLIN
                        Even so, land don’t tend itself. Ya 
                        ever put in an honest day’s work 
                        without a whip at your back?  

                                 JUDAH
                        Never had the chance. 

           The two men RIDE INTO A CLEARING, and Colin pulls up short, 
           stopping his horse suddenly.

                                 COLIN
                        Christ.

           A DEAD ARMY OFFICER, slumped at the base of a tree, torso 
           shot through with arrows. Colin steps down from his horse and 
           approaches the body. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Second lieutenant. Cavalry. Hell’s 
                        he doin’ out here alone? 

           Flies buzz around the head. Colin opens the soldier’s coat, 
           and delicately pulls an ENVELOPE from the breast pocket.

           He starts to open it, takes a step forward, and breaks a 
           tripwire. A low CREAKING sound, and then- 

           WHOOSH! A NET TRAP springs from the ground, pulling Colin and 
           the dead soldier together as it cinches tight, suspending 
           them in the air. Colin squirms away from the decaying corpse. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Aw, shit! 

           Judah watches, amused, as the net gets tighter and tighter. 

           Judah dismounts. He pulls Colin’s knife from its sheath on 
           the saddlebag and cuts through his bonds. 

           BANG! A shot digs into the earth inches from Judah’s foot. 
           Colin aims his pistol through the net. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Next won’t miss. 

           Judah scans the quiet forest. 
                                 JUDAH
                        Shouldn’ta fired that shot. 

                                 COLIN
                        Toss me the knife and I’ll let ya 
                        live.

                                 JUDAH
                        Sure you can hit me? 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya don’t have a woman to hide 
                        behind this time. 

           It’s a stand off. Judah prepares to make a run for it. 

                                 JUDAH
                        On three then. One... 

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t have to be this way. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Two... 

           Colin’s finger tightens on the trigger. 

           SNAP! WHOOSH! The net trap drops and slams into the ground, 
           spilling Colin and the dead man in a pile. 

           Colin tries to get his bearings, frantically searching the 
           ground. He spots his pistol, scrambles over, and grabs it. 

           But as he looks up, he sees half a dozen KAW WARRIORS, with 
           their bows drawn and pointed at him. Colin drops his pistol. 

           SAWACOTA, 20s, the lead brave, steps forward.

           [Dialogue in italics is spoken in Kaw with subtitles.]

                                 SAWACOTA
                        It has been too long, brother. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Take the white man and let me go. 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya know their damn language?

                                 SAWACOTA
                        Akopi must speak on this. 

                                 COLIN
                        What’s he say?
                                 JUDAH
                        He says you’re fucked.

           EXT. KAW VILLAGE - DAY

           The Kaw tend to their daily chores. A group of women sit, 
           gossiping, as they grind corn with stone mortars. 

           The warriors march Judah and Colin through the center of the 
           village. The women grow silent for a moment, then whisper 
           excitedly as the children run over to get a closer look.

           The procession halts in front of a large TEEPEE. Sawacota 
           steps inside while the others stand guard. 

                                 COLIN
                        Gonna scalp me, ain’t they?

                                 JUDAH
                        Just don’t look him in the eyes. 

           Colin is so scared, he doesn’t even think to question Judah’s 
           command. He stares at his feet, sure of his imminent death. 

           AKOPI, 50s, emerges from his teepee. The towering CHIEF OF 
           THE KAW approaches the prisoners briskly, his patience 
           shortened by decades of defeats and broken treaties. 

                                 SAWACOTA
                        The white man was caught in the 
                        trap. He points a gun at Ju-Deh. 

           Akopi studies Judah, who looks the chief right in the eyes.

                                 AKOPI
                        Ju-Deh is dead to the tribe. 

                                 JUDAH
                        The white man forced me onto your 
                        land. He has no respect for you. 
                        Look how he keeps his eyes on the 
                        ground as though you were a dog. 
                        Let me go and I will not return.  

                                 AKOPI
                        You may still know our language, 
                        but your words are empty.

           He nods to the warriors, who unsheathe their knives. 

                                 COLIN
                        Wait! I’m the law in this county!
                                 JUDAH
                        If you kill us, the whites of 
                        Topeka will come for you. 

                                 AKOPI
                        It makes no difference. Their 
                        thirst for our blood is endless. 

           As the warriors prepare to make their kill, A SHRILL CRY 
           pierces the air. The Chief turns to see ISHAQUA, THE SHAMAN, 
           wearing a mask and full ceremonial garb, coming toward them.  

                                 ISHAQUA
                        The initiate has returned! 

                                 AKOPI
                        Three winters have passed. He is no 
                        longer an initiate. 

           Ishaqua circles Judah, looking him over closely. 

                                 ISHAQUA
                        He has traveled far. It would 
                        dishonor the Great Spirit to deny 
                        him a chance to speak his vision.

           The village watches Akopi closely. His brow furrows.

           EXT. ATCHINSON PLANTATION - DUSK

           A pair of ELEPHANT SKIN BOOTS step down into dewy grass. 
           Atchinson inhales deeply, savoring and surveying his property 
           as the last rays of sunlight play across the rows of tobacco.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        We’ll tour the grounds tomorrow. 
                        Now please, let’s get you inside.  

           He offers a hand to KC, but she dismounts on her own. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           KC steps into the opulent foyer, taking in the wealth on 
           display. Her eyes settle on a PAINTED PORTRAIT OF ATCHINSON’S 
           SON. The resemblance to his father is striking.

                                 KC
                        How strange. As a young man, you 
                        looked almost... Decent.   

                                 ATCHINSON
                        That’s my son Michael. He shared 
                        his mother’s delicate constitution. 
                             (then)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ATCHINSON (CONT'D)
                        Until one of the slaves murdered 
                        him savagely.   

                                 KC
                        Men will seek freedom by any means.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        They are not men. We may train 
                        them, like dogs. But they will 
                        always be animals. 

           Atchinson points upstairs, dismissing her. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Overby will show you to your room. 

           Overby, now in his 40s, is still happy to serve, comforted by 
           feeling superior to his fellows in the fields. As the head 
           house slave leads KC up the main marble staircase, the 
           PRELAPPED SOUND OF RHYTHMIC DRUMMING brings us to-

           EXT. KAW VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Kaw warriors lead Judah and Colin toward a BLAZING CAMPFIRE. 
           Akopi wears a full ceremonial headdress and stands on one of 
           the many large stones that form a ring around the fire. 

                                 AKOPI
                        When we found you, Ju-Deh, you were 
                        starving and alone. We taught you 
                        the ways of the Kaw. To run silent 
                        in the forest. To kill with a 
                        knife. We took you into the tribe, 
                        and sent you on the vision quest. 
                             (pauses for effect)
                        You did not return. We mourned your 
                        death long ago. Why do you come 
                        back to us now? Tell us what you 
                        have seen.

           The drums stop and the tribe falls silent. 

                                 JUDAH
                        I wandered the forest until I could 
                        barely stand. But no guide came to 
                        me. Finally, I had a dream. I 
                        dreamt I would bring pain and 
                        sadness to the tribe. So I went 
                        away as I came, starving and alone.

           Ishaqua leaps up, shaking a RATTLE. 
                                 ISHAQUA
                        Strong medicine! This dream has 
                        come to pass! Were we not saddened 
                        when he did not return?

                                 AKOPI
                        Yes, and he will bring more pain 
                        upon the tribe. He has no spirit 
                        guide, he is not one of the people. 

           Ishaqua removes the large ceremonial mask, revealing that she 
           is an OLD WOMAN. She peers at Judah’s face, then at Colin. 

                                 ISHAQUA
                        You wandered many years. Searching. 
                        And then you found this man? 

                                 JUDAH
                        No. He found me. 

                                 ISHAQUA
                             (to Akopi)
                        Ju-Deh has a guide. 

                                 AKOPI
                        The white man?

                                 ISHAQUA
                        He brought Ju-Deh back to us. And 
                        he will lead him on his journey. 
                        The Great Spirit has spoken!

                                 AKOPI
                        The Great Spirit promised peace, 
                        and yet we cower in this valley. 

                                 ISHAQUA
                        Peace will come. Or have you lost 
                        your faith in the spirits, Akopi? 

           Akopi scowls. He knows he is trapped. But not entirely.   

                                 AKOPI
                        If the white man is his guide, then 
                        let them be bound!

           The crowd is shocked at the suggestion. Ishaqua stares down 
           Akopi, then silently nods. 

           DRUMS begin again, faster and more intense. 

                                 COLIN
                        What now? 
           Kaw men seize Colin and Judah and force them to stand on 
           large stones on opposite edges of the fire pit. Colin tries 
           to escape, but the warriors restrain him. 

                                 JUDAH
                        They’re lettin’ us go. 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya sure?

           The men holding Colin and Judah pull one arm behind each of 
           their backs, and lean them out over the fire. Judah extends 
           his right hand across the fire toward Colin. 

           Colin stares at Judah’s hand, then copies him. They press 
           their hands together, supporting each other’s weight as they 
           lean out over the flames. It’s a precarious balance. 

           Ishaqua stands on another stone between Colin and Judah. She 
           pulls out a BONE KNIFE, sharpened on both sides. 

           Colin breaks into a sweat. He looks down at the fire rising 
           beneath them and panics, starting to waver. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Look at me. 

           Colin and Judah lock eyes, steadying themselves over the 
           fire. Ishaqua reaches out the Bone Knife, sliding it between 
           their pressed hands. She slowly rotates the blade, digging it 
           into their flesh.

                                 ISHAQUA
                        As the Earth is bound to the sky, 
                        the power of the Great Spirit binds 
                        you to one another.

           Ishaqua pulls back the blade, SLICING both of their palms. 
           They collapse forward the width of the blade, so their hands 
           press into each other again, keeping them up. 

           Colin stares, horrified, at their blood mixing. He recoils in 
           disgust, but Judah grips his hand tightly. The blood slides 
           down their pressed hands, and sizzles into the fire.

           The tribe CRIES OUT, wailing in unison as the drums build to 
           an impossibly loud crescendo. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. TEEPEE - MORNING

           Colin wakes up the next morning on the floor of the tent. He 
           slowly rises, pushing off a pile of hides, and notices that 
           his hand has been wrapped in a cloth bandage. 

           EXT. KAW VILLAGE - MORNING

           Colin pulls back the flap and emerges from the teepee. A 
           short distance away, Judah speaks with Ishaqua. 

           Ishaqua hands the Bone Knife to Judah. Colin’s eyes narrow as 
           JUDAH SLIPS THE KNIFE INTO HIS BOOT. 

           A young KAW WOMAN interrupts Colin, offering him his gun 
           belt, canteen, and saddlebag. He peeks inside, finds it 
           freshly stocked with food. 

                                 COLIN
                        Thank ya, miss. 

           Across the camp, Judah bows to Ishaqua, and she places a hand 
           on his shoulder. They part, and Judah strides over to Colin. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Time to move on. 

                                 COLIN
                        How ‘bout the horses? 

           Judah points to a CANOE on the ground a few feet away. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Ya traded my horses?

                                 JUDAH
                        Chief took ‘em for payment. This is 
                        a gift.  

           Judah lifts one end of the canoe. Colin wants to protest, but 
           there’s nothing to say. He takes the other end of the canoe. 

           EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

           The canoe rests at the edge of the river, halfway on the bank 
           and half in the shallows. Colin throws his pack into the boat 
           and hops in. Judah shoots him a look. 

                                 COLIN
                        Whatcha waitin’ for?  

           Judah looks nervously at the water swirling around his legs, 
           then starts to push the canoe into the river. Colin picks up 
           one of the paddles and maneuvers back toward the stern. 
           Judah gets the boat into the current and hoists himself up, 
           starting to climb in- 

           But Colin pushes the paddle against Judah’s chest, stopping 
           him. Judah’s legs drag in the water as he hangs off the side. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Gimme the knife. 

                                 JUDAH
                        What knife? 

           Judah tries to climb in, but Colin knocks him into the water. 
           Judah splashes wildly, flailing in terror. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Can’t swim!

                                 COLIN
                        Grab the paddle!

           Colin dangles the paddle, and Judah seizes it. He jerks 
           fiercely in the water, trying to stay afloat. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Quit floppin’ about! 

                                 JUDAH
                        Pull me up! 

                                 COLIN
                        Kick your goddamn legs!

           Judah kicks ineffectually, starting to hyperventilate. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Naw, float ‘em out behind ya, and 
                        kick like a scissor.

           Judah finds his rhythm and begins a splashy crawl-kick. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        There ya go. Now breathe. 

           Judah takes deeper breaths. Panic turns to anger. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Fuck you!

                                 COLIN
                        Saw that Injun slip ya a knife.

           Judah looks back toward the receding shore. 
                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Even if ya could swim that far, I 
                        wouldn’t give ya the chance. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Pull me up first. 

                                 COLIN
                        If ya think I’m gonna let ya in 
                        with that blade in your boot, 
                        you’re dumber than ya look. 

           Judah hesitates, then nods. He reaches one hand underwater, 
           pulls the Bone Knife from his boot, and tosses it to Colin. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        The Hell did that woman do to us? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Made us brothers. 

                                 COLIN
                        The day I got a black brother is 
                        the day I eat my hat.

           Colin lifts Judah high enough to grab the side of the boat. 
           Judah heaves himself in as Colin draws his pistol. Judah 
           stares at the gun, catching his breath. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Hope ya row better than ya swim. 

           Colin tosses him a paddle and takes a seat in the back of the 
           boat. Judah reluctantly starts rowing. 

           EXT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           ZIP. ZIP. A METAL FILE sharpens the cutting edge of a large 
           BROADSWORD. John Brown examines the blade, satisfied. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        A provocation this naked demands a 
                        response. And these bushwackers 
                        only understand one language.

           Charles Robinson stands on the front porch near John Brown, 
           staring warily at the sword and the man who wields it. The 
           Jayhawkers wait for their leader at the edge of the property.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I appreciate your zeal, Mr. Brown, 
                        but I will not take office with 
                        blood on my hands.
                                 JOHN BROWN
                        You were a physician. You know an 
                        infection must be cut out if the 
                        body is to survive.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        And you’re a minister. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Matthew sent us out “like sheep 
                        among wolves. To be as cunning as 
                        snakes, and as innocent as doves.” 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I cannot afford to be a snake.

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Then you can be the dove.

           Charles Robinson looks away thoughtfully. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        In the shed behind my home, you’ll 
                        find two crates of Bibles and four 
                        barrels of wine. They were sent by 
                        Hank Beecher, another minister who 
                        shares your convictions. I hope 
                        they help in spreading your gospel.  

           INT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S SHED - DAY

           John Brown and his son enter the shed and find large crates 
           labeled “BIBLES”, and wooden barrels marked “WINE”. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Whadda we need all these Bibles 
                        for, Pa?  

           John Brown lifts the lid of the crate, brushing away straw 
           packing to reveal stacks of SHARPS RIFLES. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Careful now. 

           Oliver uncorks the barrel, and, instead of wine, grains of 
           BLACK POWDER rush out of the tap. 

           EXT. RIVER - DAY

           A HERD OF BUFFALO graze alongside a bend in the river. Judah 
           and Colin stop rowing, quietly taking a moment to admire the 
           majestic beasts. 
                                 COLIN
                        Ya ever have buffalo steak? 

                                 JUDAH
                        ‘Course. Ever kill one? 

                                 COLIN
                        Couple hundred or so. 

           Judah looks at him, surprised. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Army had no use for us after we 
                        whipped Santa Ana back to the Rio 
                        Grande. I didn’t wanna go home 
                        broke, so I figured I'd stay out 
                        west and make a buck off hides.

                                 JUDAH
                        But you make more as sheriff?

                                 COLIN
                        The herds thinned out awful quick. 
                             (thinking, then)
                        Time was, ya met another tracker 
                        and ya might share a meal, piece of 
                        news, even a good trap spot. 
                        Nowadays, he'd just as likely kill 
                        ya for what's in your pack.  

                                 JUDAH
                        You got held up. 

           Colin doesn’t answer, which says it all. Instead, he looks 
           over at the buffalo, as TWO OF THE BULLS SQUARE OFF. They paw 
           the dirt, then charge, SLAMMING THEIR HEADS together. 

                                 COLIN
                        Awful headache over a female. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Is it? 

           Judah gives Colin a knowing look.  

                                 COLIN
                        Couldn’t let a girl go kidnapped. 
                        It’s my duty. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Uh-hunh. 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya wouldn’t understand.  
                                 JUDAH
                        I got a lady. 

                                 COLIN
                        Oh yeah? What’s she like? 

                                 JUDAH
                             (looks into the distance)
                        First time our eyes met, a white 
                        man was whippin’ on her. But she 
                        wouldn’t heed no master. Most 
                        beautiful thing I ever saw. Love at 
                        first sight. We run off together, 
                        and I tended her til she trust me. 
                        In time, she let me ride her.
                             (he pauses)
                        Name’s Brandy. Best damn horse I 
                        ever had. 

           Colin LAUGHS. 

                                 COLIN
                        You’re funny for a nigger. 

           WE FLY OVER, surveying the epic landscape, as they steer the 
           canoe out of a small tributary and join the mighty Missouri.

           EXT. ATCHINSON PLANTATION - DAY

           The front gate of the Atchinson property displays a forboding 
           metal sign with the “BAR A” symbol. The same symbol that is 
           branded onto Judah’s chest. 

           Atchinson leads KC on a walk as Overby shades them with an 
           umbrella. Atchinson gestures toward a field full of slaves- 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Tobacco is a demanding mistress, 
                        requiring utmost attention and 
                        care. The slaves tend to her needs, 
                        and I in turn take care of theirs. 
                        I provide three meals, a roof, and 
                        a much-needed dose of Christianity. 

           KC watches the OVERSEER CRACK HIS WHIP across a woman field 
           slave’s back. Atchinson sees the revulsion on her face.

                                 KC
                        You call that Christian? 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Overby, what does the Bible say? 
                                 OVERBY
                        Colossians, six-five: “Slaves, obey 
                        your earthly masters, not only when 
                        you are watched, but in singleness 
                        of heart, fearing the Lord.” 

                                 KC
                        It’s not the Lord they fear. 

           ACROSS THE FIELD

           Judah peeks out through thick brush at the edge of the field. 
           Colin crouches beside him, watching Atchinson lead KC away.

                                 JUDAH
                        Now what? 

                                 COLIN
                        Ya need a haircut. 

           EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

           Judah’s long dreadlocks fall to the ground as Colin cuts his 
           hair with the Bone Knife. 

                                 JUDAH
                        I wanna gun. 

                                 COLIN
                        Hell no. That’s why ya got the 
                        barn, and I’m goin’ in the house. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Ain’t enough time. If you don’t 
                        hitch the horses, none of us gets 
                        out alive. 

           Colin switches his grip and starts shaving Judah’s scalp. 

                                 COLIN
                        How’d ya get away last time? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Didn’t have no plan.  

                                 COLIN
                        Then why’d ya run? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Had to. 

           Colin waits for a real answer. Judah clenches his jaw. 
                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        I killed Atchinson’s son. 

           Colin stops short, the blade still pressed to Judah’s skin. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        That boy was cruel as the day was 
                        long. Any time he wasn’t beatin’ a 
                        field hand, he was beatin’ a horse.

                                 COLIN
                        So ya killed him?  

                                 JUDAH
                        He took a fall one day, and come 
                        back hollerin’ the filly oughta be 
                        put down. But Atchinson wouldn’t 
                        hear it, an’ the two of them cussed 
                        each other rotten. That night, I’s 
                        brushing the mare, and the boy come 
                        in the stable with an axe. Said I 
                        fixed his saddle to slip, and he’d 
                        have my neck for it. I only done 
                        what come natural. Took the axe off 
                        him and turned it round. 

           Colin considers this.

                                 COLIN
                        And then you ran? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Then I ran. 

           Colin resumes shaving, but as he drags the blade, he 
           accidentally NICKS JUDAH’S SCALP. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Aw! God damn it. 

           Judah grabs his head in pain and turns to face Colin. 

                                 COLIN
                        Fuckin’ jungle up here. Ain’t ya 
                        ever heard of a bath?  

                                 JUDAH
                        Tried that once. Still came out 
                        black. 

           Judah stares down Colin. Colin stares back. Then Colin 
           breaks, cracking a smile. Judah’s face softens into a grin.
                                 COLIN
                        I ain’t givin’ ya my gun.

                                 JUDAH
                        How ‘bout a knife then?

           Colin hands him the blade. 

           EXT. TOBACCO FIELD - DAY

           Judah and Colin hide at the edge of the tobacco field. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Wait for my whistle. And make sure 
                        you take care of them dogs. 

           An Overseer rides past, and Judah slips into one of the 
           tobacco rows. Shirtless, shoeless and bald, he immediately 
           begins picking, bending low to hide his face. 

           ISAIAH, late 40s, works nearby. His optimism has been tested 
           but not broken by a lifetime in the fields. He spots Judah 
           and his eyes go wide in recognition. 

           Isaiah makes his way over to Judah. The two men pick quietly 
           beside each other until Isaiah mutters under his breath. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Gotta be the dumbest nigger in the 
                        world, comin’ back here. But it’s 
                        good to see ya, Judah. 

           EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - SUNSET

           Overseers empty buckets of corn mush into a pig trough. 

           SLAVE CHILDREN rush over, swarming the men, who kick them 
           aside. The emaciated children scoop food into their mouths, 
           jostling for position, the smallest ones forced out. 

           Judah reaches the front of the adult line, and a Black Cook 
           ladles a bowl of soup for him. He takes a seat at one of the 
           wooden tables between the men’s and women’s Slave Quarters. 

           As he sits, THE NEARBY SLAVES STAND UP and scoot further 
           away, leaving him all alone.

           Isaiah approaches with two of his SONS, and all three TAKE A 
           SEAT across from Judah. They nod to him and eat in silence. 

           Another MAN stands and goes to sit with Judah. Then another. 
           And another. Judah smiles at the silent display of support. 

           A WOMAN steps up behind Judah and crosses her arms. 
                                 RUTH
                        Whatcha doin’ here, boy? 

           Judah recognizes the woman’s voice from his past. 

           RUTH, late 40s, is always on edge, every nerve in her lithe 
           frame frayed by a lifetime of fearing the lash. Judah sees A 
           LONG JAGGED SCAR from the corner of her mouth to her ear.  

                                 JUDAH
                        What happen? 

                                 RUTH
                        You run off. 

           An emotion we haven’t seen yet crosses Judah’s face. Regret.

                                 JUDAH
                        I’m sorry, Momma.

                                 RUTH
                        I’s sorry you was born. Now get 
                        gone, ‘fore you get caught.

           She shakes her head and walks away. 

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Colin quietly slips into the barn, pulling the door closed 
           behind him. It’s completely dark.  

           Colin lights an OIL LAMP, and the soft glow illuminates a 
           vast multi-purpose barn. He creeps past the stables, pig 
           pens, and a chicken coop, down to the back of the barn, where 
           a large SHAPE is covered by CANVAS. 

           As quietly as he can manage, he pulls the canvas off to 
           reveal: A FOUR-HORSE CARRIAGE. 

           EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

           The Overseer walks down the row of doors to the Men’s 
           Quarters, making sure that all the slaves are accounted for.

           At each door, he stops and opens it. CREAK. He checks inside, 
           and then locks it from the outside. CLICK.

           Ruth peeks through the crack of her door in the Women’s 
           Quarters, watching him. CREAK. CLICK. CREAK. CLICK. 

           The Overseer CREAKS open the next door and peers in. He 
           pauses, clearly confused, then steps inside. 

           The door slowly shuts behind him. CLICK.
           Then Judah opens the door and emerges into the night, wiping 
           blood from his knife. Isaiah follows with the Overseer’s keys 
           and begins UNLOCKING ALL THE DOORS. 

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Colin surveys the three full-grown BLOODHOUNDS in the dog 
           pen. One of the dogs stirs, looks up at him and GROWLS. Colin 
           draws his knife. Then, over in the corner, he sees- 

           The MOTHER, lying on her side so four adorable PUPPIES can 
           nurse. Colin SIGHS heavily and puts the knife away. 

           EXT. SLAVE QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Judah raises his voice barely loud enough to be heard by the 
           gathered slaves, who huddle close between the two buildings. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Those that’s ready, go with Isaiah. 

           Some shuffle toward Isaiah as Ruth speaks up from the back. 

                                 RUTH
                        Ain’t gonna get too far once they 
                        set the dogs on ya. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Them dogs been taken care of. 

                                 RUTH
                        How’s that? 

                                 JUDAH
                        I ain’t alone. 

           This elicits MURMURS of concern from the crowd. 

                                 RUTH
                        Whatcha come back for? Didn’t cause 
                        enough grief gettin’ Celia killed? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Maybe I come for you, Momma. 

           She scoffs. 

                                 RUTH
                        Sure took your time then, boy.

                                 JUDAH
                        This the best damn chance any of 
                        you got to get free. 
                                 RUTH
                        Anyone runs, be Hell on the rest 
                        tomorrow. 
                             (to Judah)
                        Maybe I oughta scream now. Save my 
                        own neck.  

                                 JUDAH
                        If you do, not gonna be a tomorrow. 

           Isaiah steps forward. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        We wastin’ time. Those that’s 
                        goin’, follow me. 

           Isaiah and his sons disappear into the night with a dozen 
           slaves following after them. The others return to their 
           rooms, except Ruth, who stares after the runaways. 

           Judah turns toward the mansion. A blood-red HARVEST MOON 
           hangs low above the Main House. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Atchinson leads KC into a guest bedroom decorated with lace 
           curtains and an ornate birdcage. KC peers inside with wonder 
           at a pair of BRIGHT YELLOW CANARIES. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Beautiful, aren’t they? Probably 
                        the only canaries in the state.  

                                 KC
                        Can they fly? 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        They’re safer in here.
                             (then)
                        If you need anything, ring the 
                        service bell. 

           Atchinson closes the door behind him. KC listens, then creeps 
           to the door and TESTS the handle. It’s locked. 

           She tries the FRENCH DOOR to the balcony, but finds it too is 
           locked from the outside. 

           KC scavenges the room, searching for a tool. She opens the 
           bedside table and her eyes settle on a large old BIBLE, with 
           a faux-gold CROSS inlaid on the leather cover. 

           She takes the book out of the drawer and digs in her 
           fingernails, PRYING the thin metal cross off the Bible.
           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Colin leads one of the horses out of its stall. It NICKERS in 
           protest, and he quiets it as quickly as he can. 

           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judah creeps along the side of the Main House. He stops, 
           crouched beneath a WINDOW, and peers out across the fields. 
           He can barely make out Isaiah and the fleeing slaves. 

           Judah takes a few steps, as though he might run to join them. 
           But he can’t, knowing the hunted life that lies ahead. He 
           turns back to the house and comes face to face with-

           Atchinson, smiling at him through the Parlor window. Judah 
           stops dead in his tracks, too terrified to react. 

           INT. PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           Atchinson looks at his own reflection in the glass. With the 
           lights on inside, he cannot see out into the night. He smiles 
           wide, checking his teeth, then turns away. 

           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Judah watches Atchinson go, unable to believe his luck. Then-

           DING-DING-DING-DING-DING! The triangle bell on the front 
           porch rings out the alarm, awakening old memories. 

           Judah’s hand reaches for the SILVER DOLLAR MEDALLION hanging 
           around his neck.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

           Ruth RINGS the triangle bell feverishly. Stringfellow bursts 
           through the front door and grabs her hand fiercely. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        The hell you doin’? 

                                 RUTH
                        Don’ hurt me! Please don’ hurt me! 
                        They all run off!

           She points toward the forest. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        Cunt-suckin’ coon fucks... 
                             (shouts inside)
                        RUNAWAYS! RUNAWAYS!

           He jumps down from the porch and rushes toward the barn. 
           INT. BARN - DAY

           Colin tightens the harness that yokes the horses to the 
           carriage, hurries to open the door at the rear of the barn. 

           CREAK. The door at the front of the barn opens. Stringfellow 
           rushes inside. The two men stare at each other in shock. 

           Colin moves first, scrambling up the side of the carriage and 
           CRACKING the buggy whip on the horses’ flanks. 

           Stringfellow sprints through the barn and DIVES, grabbing 
           onto the back of the carriage. He hangs on desperately as his 
           feet drag in the dirt behind him. 

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           SHHHIKK! KC slides the metal cross between the French doors 
           and finally manages to open the latch. She pushes the door 
           open to the second story balcony and peers into the night. 

           A KEY JIGGLES in the door to the hallway. KC quickly closes 
           the balcony door and slips the metal cross into the waistband 
           of her bloomers, pulling her nightgown over it.

           Atchinson enters, holding a shotgun. Overby follows, and 
           Atchinson hands the slave his ivory-handled revolver. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        If she runs, shoot her. 

           Atchinson takes off down the stairs. Overby steps into the 
           bedroom, ogling KC in her revealing nightgown. 

                                 OVERBY
                        Evening, ma’am.  

           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Atchinson steps onto the front porch, where the Overseers and 
           three Ruffians stand waiting for his orders. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        How many gone? 

                                 OVERSEER 2
                        Fourteen. And cut Turner’s throat.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Get the dogs.

           He looks at Ruth, who cowers on the steps.  
                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        You rang the bell?
                             (she nods)
                        Thank you for your service.  

           Atchinson extends his hand, helping her stand. He touches her 
           scarred cheek with a strange tenderness. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me, Ruth. Who was it that 
                        killed Turner? 

                                 RUTH
                        It’s our Judah. He come back.

           ATCHINSON’S EYE TWITCHES as the color drains from his face. 

           EXT. PLANTATION ROAD - NIGHT

           The carriage CAREENS down a dusty road. Stringfellow climbs 
           up the back, heaves his weight onto the roof. WHUMP.  

           Colin sees the hulking Ruffian, fumbles for his pistol. 
           Stringfellow SEIZES his wrist, BASHING the gun from his hand. 

           Colin lets go of the reins and WHIPS Stringfellow’s face, 
           drawing blood. But Stringfellow smiles and SNATCHES the whip. 

           He tosses the whip aside and PUMMELS Colin, knocking the 
           Sheriff to the floorboard. Colin looks over the edge at the 
           ground rushing past below. 

           The Ruffian grabs Colin’s collar, drags him to his feet.

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        You oughta know, stealin’ horses is 
                        a death sentence.

           Colin SLAMS HIS HEAD into Stringfellow’s face. The Ruffian 
           staggers back, clutching a bloody nose.

                                 STRINGFELLOW (CONT’D)
                        Motherfuckin’ peckerwood son of a-

           Colin KICKS Stringfellow squarely in the stomach, knocking 
           the behemoth off the speeding carriage. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judah slips in the back door. Creeps through the kitchen, 
           into the large open entry hall. The front door hangs open. 

           HUSHED VOICES upstairs. Judah tiptoes up the marble staircase 
           toward the second level. 
           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Overby sits in a divan across from KC, holding the revolver. 

                                 KC
                        My father is a wealthy man. If you 
                        help me escape, I guarantee safe 
                        passage north. 

                                 OVERBY
                        I eat meat here every day. Sleep in 
                        a warm bed and wake to a clean 
                        uniform. You know any black man up 
                        north that can say the same? 

                                 KC
                        At least they can say they’re in 
                        charge of their own lives.  

                                 OVERBY
                        I’m in charge of fifty niggers. Any 
                        order I give, they snap to it like 
                        it come from Mr. Atchinson hisself.

           KC sizes him up, then stands. Overby raises the gun at her.  

                                 KC
                        Guess you can do as you please. 

                                 OVERBY
                        Sit down.  

           She slowly slips off the straps of her gown, letting it slide 
           to the floor and exposing her corset and bloomers. 

                                 OVERBY (CONT’D)
                        What kinda woman are you?

                                 KC
                        A free woman. 

                                 OVERBY
                        Put them clothes back on, ma’am.

                                 KC
                        What would happen if Mr. Atchinson 
                        caught you undressing me?  

           Behind KC’s back, she tightens her fingers around the METAL 
           CROSS. The sharp point sticks through her fist like a dagger. 

                                 OVERBY
                        Put them on right now. 
                                 KC
                        What if I scream instead?

           Overby grabs her dress off the floor, shaking it at her.  

                                 OVERBY
                        If you don’t put them on, I will. 

                                 KC
                        Be my guest.  

           Overby tucks the pistol into his belt. He grabs her left hand 
           and pulls the dress over her head- 

           But KC TRIES TO STAB HIM with the cross in her right fist. 

           Overby twists away and CATCHES HER WRIST. He sees the 
           improvised knife and looks at KC, rage welling inside him. 

                                 OVERBY
                        You little harlot. 

           He twists her wrist, and the cross CLATTERS to the ground. KC 
           falls to her knees in pain, and Overby towers over her. 

                                 OVERBY (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead and scream. No one’s 
                        comin’ to help you. 

           Overby suddenly STIFFENS, as A KNIFE PLUNGES INTO HIS BACK. 

           The slave GURGLES his last breath and collapses forward, 
           revealing Judah with the bloody Bone Knife in his hand.   

           KC stares at Judah in shock. With his hair freshly shorn, it 
           takes her a moment to recognize him. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Best get dressed. 

           She snatches her dress up, covering herself. 

                                 KC
                        I was going to- 

           Judah raises a finger to his lips, shushing her. He checks 
           the hallway, then indicates for her to follow. She hesitates. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Wanna find your own way home? 

           KC takes a step to follow him. But pauses in front of the 
           birdcage, looking at the songbirds trapped inside. 
           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Atchinson stands next to his horse in front of the house. One 
           of the Ruffians reports back. 

                                 RUFFIAN
                        Can’t find Stringfellow nowhere. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Rotgut bastard.  

           Atchinson turns to a group of Overseers holding BLOODHOUNDS 
           on leashes. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Catch ‘em if you can, kill ‘em if 
                        you can’t!

           The men ride out. Atchinson starts to climb on his horse as- 

           THE TWO YELLOW CANARIES flit through the air overhead. He 
           turns back toward the Main House and scowls. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Atchinson enters through the front door, shotgun cradled in 
           his arm. He pauses and listens. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Overby?

           No response. He brings the shotgun to his shoulder. 

           INT. SECOND STORY - NIGHT

           Atchinson comes to the top of the stairs, checks the hallway. 
           Empty. He steps lightly across the carpeted floors. 

           GUEST BEDROOM

           Atchinson nudges the door open with his gun to reveal: Overby 
           lying on the floor, bleeding across the carpet. 

           The curtains FLUTTER in the breeze.

           BALCONY

           Atchinson steps out onto the balcony, ready to fire. No sign. 
           The balcony runs the length of the second story, with 
           entrances into each room. Atchinson stops as he hears- 

           RING-A-LING-A-LING! Somewhere inside on the second floor, a 
           SERVICE BELL IS RUNG. Amused, Atchinson steps back inside. 
           STUDY

           Judah stops RINGING the service bell. KC looks at him, 
           bewildered, and whispers fiercely. 

                                 KC
                        Are you mad?

           Judah waves KC outside with Atchinson’s revolver.

           BALCONY

           Judah takes position to fire through the study door. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Them lights on, he can’t see out. 

           HALLWAY

           Atchinson leaves KC’s bedroom, stepping into the hallway and 
           listening. Nothing. He moves through a door. 

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Atchinson steps inside. BIG-GAME TROPHIES. Canopy bed. 

           Atchinson tries to peer through the glass of the French 
           doors. No luck. He aims his shotgun. 

           BALCONY

           KA-BLAM! A shotgun blast SHATTERS the glass doors leading to 
           the master bedroom. KC FLINCHES, but Judah gives her a stern 
           look, keeping her silent. 

           STUDY

           Atchinson comes in and immediately FIRES his shotgun through 
           the glass of the French Doors. No one, inside or outside. 

           He CRACKS open the stock of his shotgun. Reloads. Listens. 

           MASTER BEDROOM

           KC follows Judah inside, and a floorboard GROANS beneath her  
           foot. Judah spins and DIVES, knocking her to the floor. 

           KA-BLAM! Atchinson fires his shotgun through the wall, 
           peppering the bed with shot. FEATHERS FLY INTO THE AIR. 

           KA-BLAM! Judah covers KC as Atchinson fires again. 

           Lying on the floor, Judah looks up at the STUFFED HEAD OF A 
           DEER. Gets an idea. 
           HALLWAY

           Atchinson creeps down the hall, ready to fire.

           A SHADOW moves closer to the open doorway. Then the SHADOW 
           flies out and KA-BLAM! Atchinson blows a hole through-

           The stuffed deer head. It thuds to the floor. Atchinson gapes 
           at his destroyed trophy, then swivels back-

           But it’s too late. POW POW POW POW! Judah fires back from 
           inside, having pinpointed Atchinson’s location.  

           A bullet RIPS through Atchinson’s thigh. He doubles over in 
           pain, hobbles away as fast as he can. 

           MASTER BEDROOM

           Judah hauls KC to her feet. 

           HALLWAY

           Judah leads with the pistol, pulling KC behind him. 

           A TRAIL OF BLOOD leads back toward the study. 

           KC starts to descend the staircase but Judah pauses.  
           Considers pursuing Atchinson. 

                                 KC
                        What are you waiting for?

           Judah turns and follows KC down the stairs. 

           EXT. PLANTATION ROAD - NIGHT

           WHEE-OO-WHEET! Judah’s mighty whistle ECHOES out over the 
           plantation. Colin CRACKS the reins, steering the carriage 
           back toward the Main House.

           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           WHEE-OO-WHEET! Judah whistles again, his fingers at the 
           corner of his mouth. KC waits beside him on the front porch. 

           A board CREAKS behind them and Judah spins, ready to fire. He 
           squints, faintly making out a FIGURE huddled in the shadows.

           Ruth crawls forward, tears streaming down her cheeks. 

           Judah sees the TRIANGLE BELL above her, and he understands. 
           He looks down at her with a mixture of pity and rage. 
                                 RUTH
                        I’s sorry. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Ain’t your fault, Momma.   

           He strides past his mother, back into the house. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The entry hall is silent. Judah crosses to the staircase, 
           looking up. No blood on the stairs. 

           He tentatively takes the first step toward the second floor 
           and a SHOTGUN BARREL slides up against the back of his head. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        That pistol belongs to me. 

           Judah grips the revolver, tensing up all over. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        My father had it commissioned on 
                        one of his trips to Africa. I 
                        intended to bequeath it to Michael. 
                        You remember Michael, don’t you? 

           Judah DROPS the ivory-handled revolver to the marble floor. 
           Atchinson picks it up, presses it to Judah’s head. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        You were never free, Judah. You 
                        can’t get free from your own blood.

           Judah cocks his head. What? 

           Atchinson sees the sincere confusion across his face. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        You mean, you didn’t know? 

           Atchinson processes this, taking joy in Judah’s discovery. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        My Lord in Heaven. 
                             (then)
                        I suppose your mother wouldn’t have 
                        let on. She was more ashamed of you 
                        than I was. 

           Judah listens in shock. 
                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Why do you think you got to work in 
                        the stables? And most always spared 
                        the lash? Young fool that I was, I 
                        imagined some kindness might shine 
                        on the darkness of your nature. 
                        That you might rise above your 
                        heathen ancestors and cultivate 
                        even the slightest bit of 
                        civilization. But that was my 
                        mistake. A half-breed is still a 
                        fucking mutt. And if it bites a 
                        child, it must be put down.

           Judah opens his mouth, but can’t form any words. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        You got anything to say, best do it 
                        now. Before I cut your tongue out. 

           Atchinson slides the gun along the side of Judah’s head, 
           bringing it behind his ear. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess some truths are hard 
                        to hear.

           BAM! Atchinson blows off Judah’s ear, SPRAYING blood across 
           the marble steps. Judah HOWLS, drops to his knees, clutches 
           his head. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        I’m a fair man, and the punishment 
                        for running off is an ear. 

           Judah tries to stand, but Atchinson KNOCKS him back down.

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        But you have a blood debt to pay. 
                        And I intend to collect it slowly. 

           Atchinson hears FOOTSTEPS behind him, and swivels to see: the 
           FACE OF HIS SON coming down upon him. 

           THWACK! Ruth smashes the PAINTED PORTRAIT over Atchinson’s 
           head, trapping his arms. Atchinson struggles to get free. 

           Ruth SMASHES A VASE over his head, knocking him down. 

           Judah pushes himself up, woozy with pain. Ruth yanks him to 
           his feet, drags him out the front door. 
           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

           At the bottom of the steps, Colin helps KC into the carriage. 
           He looks up as Judah and Ruth stagger out of the house. 

           Ruth pushes Judah off and points down at the carriage. 

                                 RUTH
                        Get gone now! 

           Judah grabs his mother’s arm, trying to drag her along. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Come with, Momma. 

                                 RUTH
                        Ain’t nuthin’ for me out there. 

           She pulls her arm free. Judah wavers, on the verge of 
           collapse. He can see in her eyes that she will never leave.  

           Colin goes to support Judah and sees the gaping head wound. 

                                 COLIN
                        Aw, Christ. 

           Judah’s feet weakly comply as he lets himself be led down to 
           the carriage. But he glances back at his mother, who stands 
           on the porch, watching her son go for the last time. 

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Judah slumps onto the floor. KC GASPS at the sight of his 
           bloody head as the carriage lurches down the road. 

           KC RIPS off her sleeve and uses it as a bandage. She kneels 
           next to Judah, cradling his head to protect it from banging 
           against the wooden seats. 

           EXT. CARRIAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Colin slows the carriage as he nears a fork in the road. A 
           group of mounted Ruffians approaches, carrying torches. The 
           flickering flames illuminate a family of RUNAWAY SLAVES. 

           A Slave Woman WAILS in abject sorrow as they march back 
           towards the plantation.

                                 SLAVE WOMAN
                        Oh God!... My baby...

           Colin nods to the Ruffians as he rolls past. They eye the 
           carriage, but cannot see inside.  
           DOWN THE ROAD

           As the slaves disappear behind them, Colin sees an animal up 
           ahead in the road. He slows the horses as they approach and 
           he can make out that it is one of the bloodhounds- 

           CHEWING ON THE CORPSE OF A BLACK 16-YEAR-OLD BOY.  

           Colin’s face falls in horror. He stops the carriage and hops 
           down. The dog turns on him, protecting its kill, and GROWLS. 

                                 COLIN
                        Down boy. Heel!

           The dog stands down and Colin grabs its collar. The dog looks 
           up at him obediently, its muzzle smeared with blood. 

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Judah weakly pushes himself up and looks out the window of 
           the carriage to see why they’ve stopped. He watches as Colin 
           pulls his Bowie knife and SLITS THE DOG’S THROAT. 

           EXT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Colin stares down at the young man’s body, suppressing the 
           tide of guilt rising up inside him. 

           Colin gingerly carries the body to the edge of the road and 
           sets it down at the base of a tree. He searches for words, 
           but nothing he can say will ever make this right.

           Colin swallows hard. Marches back to the carriage, climbs 
           into the driver’s seat, and cracks the whip.

           INT. CARRIAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Judah peers out the window as the carriage passes the dead 
           body, seething at Colin’s betrayal.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ATCHINSON PLANTATION - DAY

           The morning sun falls on the face of Stringfellow, waking him 
           up in a ditch beside the plantation road. He climbs to his 
           feet, disoriented, feeling the dried BLOOD on his face.

           EXT. MAIN HOUSE - DAY

           The plantation grounds are eerily still and quiet. As 
           Stringfellow wobbles his way up the steps of the Main House, 
           WE RACK FOCUS TO-
           RUTH’S DEAD BODY, hanging by the neck from the front gate. It 
           sways gently in the breeze beneath the wrought-iron “BAR A”. 

           INT. MAIN HOUSE - DAY

           Stringfellow staggers into the entryway, and immediately 
           hears the sound of Atchinson in the next room. 

                                 ATCHINSON (O.S.)
                        I don’t know, goddamn it! If I 
                        wanted to answer questions all day 
                        I’d talk to the constable!

                                 DOYLE (O.S.)
                        No need to get heated. 

           Stringfellow looks into the parlor. Atchinson reclines on the 
           sofa, nursing a bottle of bourbon, as a DOCTOR casts his leg.  

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Pardon my temper, I’ve been shot in 
                        the fucking leg! 

           Atchinson is yelling at DOYLE, 50s, a grizzled slave-catcher 
           with a gleam of malice in his one good eye. The other eye is 
           clouded over white, as though filled with the ghosts of the 
           countless men he has sent from this world.   

           His sons WILL and DRURY stand nearby. They’d die for their 
           father, but would kill each other for the right price. 

                                 DOYLE
                        You’ll get your nigger in as many 
                        pieces as you like. But we’re not 
                        gettin’ meddled up with the 
                        Robinson girl. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Didn’t figure a man in your line of 
                        work could afford such scruples. 

                                 DOYLE
                        Wits ain’t scruples, and I ain’t in 
                        the kidnappin’ business. But we’ll 
                        drag your boy outta Hell for two 
                        thousand dollars. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        No slave on Earth is worth that. 

                                 DOYLE
                        Kansas ain’t so friendly with Ol’ 
                        Man Brown and his Jayhawkers on the 
                        warpath. Consider it hazard pay. 
                                 ATCHINSON
                        Two thousand then. Breathing. When 
                        the others see what happens to him, 
                        it’ll be worth it.
                             (spits in his hand)
                        If you don’t find him, don’t come 
                        back to Missouri. 

           Doyle turns his cloudy white eye on Atchinson. 

                                 DOYLE
                        Wouldn’t dream of it. 

           The two men shake. As the slave catcher leads his sons out 
           the door, Stringfellow steps into the room. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Where the fuck‘ve you been?

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        I tried to-

                                 ATCHINSON
                        -You tried shit. Get your things. 
                        We’re leaving.  

           Atchinson pushes himself to his feet unsteadily. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Bourbon, you can’t travel. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        I have business in Topeka.

           EXT. CARRIAGE - DAY

           The carriage wheels grind to a halt on the dusty road. Colin 
           hops down, stretching his legs and fighting off exhaustion. 

           INT. CARRIAGE - DAY

           Colin opens the door to the coach to see KC asleep on Judah’s 
           shoulder. Colin CLEARS his throat, waking them both. 

                                 COLIN
                        We gotta ditch the carriage. 

                                 JUDAH
                        I know a place we can lay low.

           Judah gets out, brushing past Colin. Colin offers his hand to 
           KC, helping her step down. 
           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Judah, Colin, and KC ride through the forest. Judah leads 
           them to a remote cabin with boards nailed over the windows.  

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

           Light slips through the cracks in the ceiling. Dust hangs 
           thick in the air. Judah lies down on a bed, while Colin 
           stands watch by the door. 

           KC marvels at the shelves lined with canned goods and other 
           supplies left for runaway slaves. 

                                 KC
                        My God. Think they have iodine? 

                                 JUDAH
                             (hushed)
                        This bed is warm. 

           Colin and KC exchange a fearful look. Colin puts his fingers 
           over his lips and draws his pistol. They listen. Silence.

           Judah points at a ladder in the corner leading up to the 
           attic above them. Colin cocks his gun, aiming at the ceiling. 

                                 COLIN
                        Come on down now! 

           No response. 

                                 JUDAH
                        One... two... 

                                 ISAIAH (O.S.)
                        Judah?! That you?  

                                 JUDAH
                        Isaiah? 

           Isaiah climbs down the ladder, followed by his family: two 
           sons, a daughter, her husband, and a granddaughter. The 
           LITTLE GIRL looks fearfully at KC and Colin. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Sure know how to scare a nigger. 

           INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The slave family eats a meager meal as KC cleans Judah’s 
           wound. Colin watches the Little Girl at play on the floor, 
           taking aim at two CLAY MARBLES with a shooter. 
           The Little Girl SMACKS the two marbles apart. One careens 
           along the floor boards and comes to a stop at Colin’s foot. 
           She scrambles to retrieve it, but Colin picks it up. 

           Isaiah and his family stop eating and watch carefully. Colin 
           hides the marble between his hands and then makes TWO FISTS, 
           presenting them to the Little Girl.

           She looks at his fists, uncertain, and taps his right hand. 
           He opens it. No marble. She quickly taps his left hand. He 
           grins and opens it. Empty. She looks up at him, amazed.  

                                 COLIN
                        Got somethin’ behind your ear. 

           He reaches toward her to complete the trick, but she RECOILS 
           IN FEAR, afraid he’s about to hit her. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        No, it’s alright. 

           She looks at Isaiah, and he nods reassuringly. She takes a 
           small step forward and Colin “plucks” the marble from behind 
           her ear, handing it over. She smiles and returns to her game. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Heard tales ‘bout this place since 
                        I was knee high like her. Never 
                        believed ‘em true til I seen it 
                        with my own eye. 

                                 KC
                        There are plenty of people who want 
                        to help. Even in Missouri.

           KC finishes wrapping Judah’s wound. He sits up.

                                 JUDAH
                        Even so, I wouldn’t trust no white 
                        folk from here on out.
                             (eyeing Colin)
                        We’re less than dogs to them. 

           The mention of the dogs makes Colin bristle. He squints at 
           Judah. But Judah just stares back, holding his ground.

                                 ISAIAH
                        I’ma follow your lead. Oughta be 
                        better in Canadia. Got whole towns 
                        with nuthin’ but black folk.

           Judah shakes his head, never breaking eye contact with Colin. 
           Isaiah senses something is amiss.
                                 ISAIAH (CONT’D)
                        You comin’ with us, ain’tcha?

                                 JUDAH
                        My horse is waitin’ in Kansas. 

                                 KC
                        Won’t he be jailed if he returns? 

                                 COLIN
                        Your father promised him a pardon 
                        once we get you back safe. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Whatcha gonna do then, Judah? 

                                 COLIN
                        Oh, he got big plans.

                                 JUDAH
                        Not no more. 

                                 COLIN
                        Sure ya do. Go on, tell ‘em about 
                        the hundred-acre ranch, and all 
                        them mustangs frolickin’ about- 

                                 JUDAH
                        -Tell ‘em your own damn plans.
                             (to KC)
                        Sheriff here wouldn’t take a penny 
                        for reward. 

           Colin shoots Judah a look of warning. KC takes notice. 

                                 KC
                        Surely you deserve some payment for 
                        all of this, Sheriff. 

                                 COLIN
                        Please, my given name is Colin.

                                 JUDAH
                        Don’t worry, he’ll get his due.

                                 KC
                        What due?

           Colin hesitates. The tension in the room is palpable. 

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        What does he mean, Colin?
                                 COLIN
                        Well... Comes time in a man’s life 
                        when, uh...  I decided I’d like ya 
                        to be my wife. 

                                 KC
                        Pardon me? 

                                 COLIN
                        Already picked out a nice plot of 
                        land, with a view over the river. 
                        Got a loan from the bank. And I 
                        spoke with your pa-

                                 KC
                        -Father would never give my hand 
                        without consulting me first. 

                                 JUDAH
                        We get you back ‘fore the election, 
                        he might. 

           KC realizes the situation. Her eyes flash with anger. 

                                 KC
                        How dare you?! 

                                 COLIN
                        Your father’s gettin’ on now, and I 
                        can take good care of ya. 

                                 KC
                        I can take care of myself. 

           KC walks to the ladder and climbs up into the attic. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Gonna send the dogs after her? 

                                 COLIN
                        Hobble your fuckin’ lip.

                                 JUDAH
                             (imitating a slave)
                        As you say, suh. 

           EXT. MISSOURI RIVER - DAY

           DARK STORM CLOUDS roll overhead as KC and Colin lead the way 
           on horseback. Judah and the slave family follow them on foot. 

                                 COLIN
                        Lemme take care of this. 
           They approach a dock on the bank of the Missouri river, where 
           a FERRYMAN waits idly beside his ferry boat. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I’d like passage across the river. 

                                 FERRYMAN
                        It’s twenty a horse. Ten a piece 
                        for you and the lady. And a dollar 
                        for every nigger. 

           While Colin digs for the money, the Ferryman eyes the 
           bloodstained bandage around Judah’s head. 

                                 FERRYMAN (CONT’D)
                        Need to see your slave papers too.   

                                 COLIN
                        Papers? Why surely... 

           Colin makes a show of searching through his pockets.  

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Damn, now... Where’d I put those?

                                 FERRYMAN
                        Can’t cross them bootlips without 
                        papers. 

           Judah slides a hand to the Bone Knife hidden at his waist. 

           KC panics, desperate to avoid violence. She gets an idea, and 
           addresses Colin in a spot-on imitation of a SOUTHERN ACCENT. 

                                 KC
                        Oh David, you probably left them on 
                        the bureau this morning. 

           Colin looks up in surprise as she turns to the Ferryman.  

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        Pardon my dim-witted husband, sir. 
                        We’re in a terrible rush to Topeka, 
                        and delayed two days already by one 
                        of our boys runnin’ off. 
                             (points at Judah)
                        We had to hunt him down and take 
                        his ear. Troubled David something 
                        fierce. It’s his lily-livered 
                        northern upbringing I’m sure. You 
                        understand, don’t you? 
                                 FERRYMAN
                        Sorry ma’am. I gotta keep a 
                        register of every slave I cross. 

                                 KC
                             (thinking, then)
                        Well, given our need for haste and 
                        your need for fares, I’m sure my 
                        husband would pay the white price 
                        for our coloreds. That makes our 
                        party two horses and nine whites. 
                        And no bother for your register. 

           The Ferryman considers her offer, looking over the slaves.  

                                 FERRYMAN
                        They’re less like white folk, and 
                        more like horses. Don’t you think? 

                                 KC
                        I think that’s very fair.
                             (to Colin)
                        Don’t you, honeypie? 

           EXT. FERRY - DAY

           A twenty-foot barge floats across the wide Missouri. Ropes 
           connect the ferry to an overhead cable that spans the river. 
           The Ferryman turns a winch, pulling them to the other bank.

                                 FERRYMAN
                        My own wife been troublin’ me about 
                        makin’ a move to Kansas. I told her 
                        soon’s our boys is old enough to 
                        shoot, she can start packin’. 

           THUNDER RUMBLES nearby. One of the horses PAWS at the planks. 
           Judah pats the mare’s neck, trying to calm her. 

                                 FERRYMAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll see. Heard that goddamn gimp 
                        Robinson might actually stand a 
                        fucking chance. Can you imagine? 
                             (off KC’s reaction)
                        Pardon my profanity, miss.

                                 KC
                        No, it’s quite all right.

           THUNDER BOOMS, closer. 

           THE HORSE SPOOKS, feet skittering on the wet planks. The 
           slaves back away from the animal, but Judah stays with her. 
                                 JUDAH
                        Whoa, girl. 

           Judah takes the bit, trying to settle the horse. The back of 
           his shirt lifts, revealing the knife stuck in his waistband. 

           THE FERRYMAN SPIES THE WEAPON. He stops pulling, and draws a 
           pistol from his belt.  

                                 FERRYMAN
                        Now whadda we got here? 

           Judah turns and sees the Ferryman aiming a gun at him. 

                                 JUDAH
                        There a problem, sir? 

                                 FERRYMAN
                        That dagger in your britches. 
                             (to Colin)
                        This darky’s conspiring to kill 
                        you. Probably slit your throat soon 
                        as your feet touch Kansas soil.   

           Judah looks to Colin, who shakes his head.

                                 FERRYMAN (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you, boy? Turn around. 

           The Ferryman steps toward Judah, gun at the ready. 

           Colin SEIZES his arm, pulling it up so the gun points in the 
           air. The Ferryman fights for control- 

           BANG! The gun goes off. The frightened horse REARS UP, 
           bucking wildly and knocking Judah off the side of the boat. 

           Judah SPLASHES into the water, flailing and GASPING for 
           breath as the current carries him away from the ferry. 

           Isaiah rushes to the side of the boat. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Grab a line! 

           KC is petrified, watching Colin and the Ferryman grapple.

           Colin starts to get hold of the pistol, but the Ferryman 
           BITES HIS HAND. Colin grabs the Ferryman’s arm. 

           The Ferryman slowly gains the upper hand, bringing the pistol 
           around. Colin turns his head to stay out of its aim.
           Isaiah’s son finds a rope, hands it to his father. Isaiah 
           tosses it out toward Judah. 

           The rope SPLASHES onto the surface, the end landing a few 
           feet shy. Judah reaches for it in vain.

           The Ferryman pins Colin, pushes the gun into his face... 

           SHINK! Blood erupts from the Ferryman’s neck, as KC plunges 
           the METAL CROSS FROM ATCHINSON’S BIBLE into his throat. 

           The Ferryman drops the gun, clutches his throat. He pulls out 
           the cross. Blood spills from his jugular as the life drains 
           from his body. Colin pushes him off and stands.

           KC staggers back, stunned and appalled by what she has done. 
           Colin puts an arm around her and gently turns her away. 

                                 ISAIAH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Come on, take hold now! 

           Isaiah hurls the rope back out over the water, but it falls 
           far short. Judah struggles to keep his head above water. 

                                 COLIN
                        Float your legs out and kick! 

           Judah lets his feet go out behind him and does his best to 
           crawl-kick, but makes little progress against the current. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Now climb with your hands! 

           Judah’s stroke is awkward and uncertain, but it’s strong 
           enough that he starts to move closer to the rope. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        You gots it, boy!  

           But to their dismay, the rope starts to sink as it soaks up 
           water. Judah struggles with all his might, but when he 
           reaches where the rope was, it has disappeared underwater. 

                                 COLIN
                        Faster! Come on!

           Judah uses his last ounce of strength, but the rope continues 
           to sink, receding from his grasp. Exhausted, he stops 
           swimming and sinks below the surface. 

           They all stare out across the water, and a dread-filled 
           silence falls over the boat. 

           The rope suddenly PULLS TAUT. Isaiah grips it, startled. 
           Judah breaks through the surface, pulling himself up hand 
           over hand. He climbs the rope back toward the boat and the 
           slave family celebrates and CHEERS. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be damned.

           Colin wraps an arm around KC and holds her tight. Her 
           instinct is to pull away, but still reeling from the run-in 
           with the ferryman, she allows him to comfort her.

           EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

           A BOOT pours out water. As Judah does his best to get dry, 
           the freed slaves say their good-byes to Colin and KC. 

                                 ISAIAH
                        Never thought I’d set foot outside 
                        Missoura. 

                                 COLIN
                        The river leads all the way to 
                        Nebraska. Best stay off the roads. 

                                 ISAIAH
                             (eyeing Judah)
                        Sure ya won’ come with?

           Judah shakes his head. Isaiah nods and leads his family away.

           The Little Girl turns and runs back to Colin. She holds out a 
           fist. He taps it and she opens it to reveal the clay marble. 

           Colin accepts the gift with a nod. She runs back to Isaiah 
           and holds his hand as they walk away.   

           EXT. KANSAS PLAINS - DAY

           Judah and Colin ride side by side. KC sits behind Colin, 
           holding him around the waist as they gallop. The sky is dark, 
           and fierce winds whip the prairie grasses. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TOPEKA, KS - DUSK

           Atchinson and Stringfellow ride hard into Topeka. 

           INT. GOVERNOR SHERMAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Atchinson bangs open the door and strides inside with 
           Stringfellow. Governor Sherman looks up from his desk. 
                                 ATCHINSON
                        More bad news, Governor. The girl 
                        flew the coop.   

           Governor Sherman’s face darkens. He leans back in his chair 
           and looks thoughtfully out the window. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Does Robinson know? 

           EXT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A group of armed BODYGUARDS watch Charles Robinson’s porch. 
           They shoulder their guns as Governor Sherman and the Border 
           Ruffians ride up to the house. The governor dismounts. 

                                 BODYGUARD
                        Whadda you want, Sherman? 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        A word with my neighbor is all. 

           INT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Charles Robinson sits at his kitchen table in dim 
           candlelight, glowering at Governor Sherman. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Lovely home you have here Charles. 
                        Very rustic. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Where’s my daughter? 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Personal matters will have to wait.  

           Charles Robinson SLAMS his fist on the table. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I want to see KC. Then we’ll talk.  

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        If you ever want to see her, you’ll 
                        talk now. 
                             (off Robinson’s silence)
                        Your men are causing quite a stir 
                        across the territory. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I don’t know what you mean. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        John Brown and his militia. 
                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        That’s no business of mine. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        We have detained one of Mr. Brown’s 
                        Jayhawkers who will testify that 
                        the guns terrorizing lawful Kansans 
                        are from your personal arsenal. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                             (insincere)
                        That’s absurd. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        Arming an insurrection is treason, 
                        Charles. If you wish to confess, 
                        and resign your candidacy, then I 
                        can make sure your crime is viewed 
                        with an eye toward clemency. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        If you’ve got evidence, you can 
                        have me arrested. 

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                             (lying through his teeth)
                        Unfortunately our sheriff got 
                        himself killed in Missouri. Caught 
                        trespassing. 

           Charles Robinson swallows hard.   

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be better for everyone if you 
                        turn yourself in. Then I can deploy 
                        all my resources in service of your 
                        daughter’s safe return.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Get out of my house.  

                                 GOVERNOR SHERMAN
                        The judge will be at your disposal 
                        until midnight, ready to receive 
                        your confession. If it does not 
                        arrive, neither will she. 

           Governor Sherman smiles thinly, and takes his leave. 

           EXT. KANSAS PLAINS - NIGHT 

           THUNDER RUMBLES. Judah opens his eyes. Colin sleeps soundly 
           beside him, but KC is wide awake. She stands on the other 
           side of the fire, watching a LIGHTNING STORM in the distance. 
           Judah goes to her and offers his blanket. She wraps it around 
           her shivering shoulders, her eyes fixed on the horizon. 

                                 KC
                        I keep seeing that man’s face.

                                 JUDAH
                        You done what you had to.

           KC takes that in, watching the storm dance across the plains.

                                 KC
                        I never could sleep in a thunder 
                        storm. My mother would have to come 
                        and hold me til I fell asleep. 
                             (holding back tears)
                        When she passed, I didn’t know what 
                        death meant. Not til we had a 
                        storm, and no one came to hold me.  
                             (then)
                        Daddy did the best he could. 
                        Brought me out here to work for the 
                        cause, like he thought she’d want. 
                        Probably regrets it now. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Wager he’d do it again. 

                                 KC
                        Last time I saw him, we had a 
                        fight. I said some dreadful things. 

           Judah turns inward, thinking of his own fight with Atchinson. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Always family that cut the deepest. 

                                 KC
                        I never imagined he’d marry me off 
                        and be rid of me. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Lotta men done worse’n hitch a girl 
                        up to a man that loves her. 

                                 KC
                        The Sheriff doesn’t even know me. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Don’t mean he don’t love you.  

           On the other side of the campfire, COLIN IS NOW AWAKE. He 
           strains to hear their conversation, but can’t. He watches KC 
           caress the side of Judah’s head, and seethes with jealousy.  
           Across the fire, KC smooths the bandage over Judah’s wound. 

                                 KC
                        Looks as though it’s healing. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Bound to in time. 

           Unable to hear their words, Colin imagines the worst. He 
           turns away bitterly, pulling his blanket tight. 

           EXT. KANSAS PLAINS - THE NEXT MORNING

           Judah and Colin pack up the horses in silence. 

                                 JUDAH
                        That horse is beat. She can ride 
                        with me a spell. 

                                 COLIN
                        My horse is fine. 

           He beckons for KC to step up onto his horse, and Judah offers 
           his hand to help her up. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Keep your hands off.

           His angry tone surprises KC. She looks to Judah, who simply 
           shakes his head and goes back to his own horse. KC takes 
           Colin’s hand and climbs up into the saddle. 

           EXT. LAWRENCE, KS - DAY

           SMOKE BILLOWS UP from the wreckage of smoldering buildings. 

           John Brown and the band of Jayhawkers crest a hill and catch 
           sight of what remains of the Free-Soil town of Lawrence.

           EXT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

           John Brown leads his men through the ransacked streets of 
           Lawrence and stops in front of the newspaper office. A 
           “HERALD OF FREEDOM” sign dangles above a broken window. 

           The EDITOR sweeps up the charred remains of his business. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        What tragedy befell this place? 

                                 EDITOR
                        Cyrus Wilkins come through with a 
                        whole posse of Ruffians. Took what 
                        they pleased and burned the rest. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDITOR (CONT'D)
                        Chucked my press in the crick on 
                        the way out.  

                                 OLIVER
                        Did you fight? 

                                 EDITOR
                        Some did. Buried them this morning. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Where can we find Wilkins?    

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - DAY

           Colin and Judah ride briskly up the dirt road, steering their 
           horses toward the familiar front yard of the Robinson home. 

           KC’s lips part into the beautiful smile that we’ve always 
           suspected, but never seen. She slides down from Colin’s horse 
           before it can even come to a stop and rushes past the gate. 

                                 KC
                        Daddy! We’re back!

           Her words hang in the still air. The whole property is quiet. 
           Colin and Judah exchange a glance, while KC hurries inside. 

           INT. CHARLES ROBINSON’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           KC bursts into the foyer. 

                                 KC
                        We made it, Daddy! I’m home... 

           She falls silent, waiting for a response. It doesn’t come.

           EXT. TOPEKA, KS - DAY

           The town square bustles with activity. Free-Soilers and pro-
           slavers are out in force, clustered around the COURTHOUSE. 

           Colin, KC, and Judah hitch up their horses in front of a 
           GENERAL STORE, a safe distance away. A TOWNSPERSON passes by-  

                                 COLIN
                        What’s goin’ about? 

                                 TOWNSPERSON
                        Charles Robinson confessed. 

                                 KC
                        Confessed?! To what? 
                                 TOWNSPERSON
                        Treason. 

           A commotion breaks out on the steps of the Courthouse as 
           Charles Robinson is led out in handcuffs by Atchinson, WHO 
           NOW WEARS A BADGE ON HIS CHEST. 

           Judah steps back when he sees Atchinson, ducking out of view.

           The crowd JEERS at Charles Robinson, head down as he limps 
           along, surrounded by armed Border Ruffians.    

                                 CROWD
                        Traitor!... Scoundrel!... 

           KC takes off, sprinting across the square toward her father. 

                                 COLIN
                        KC wait!

           Colin chases her. The crowd follows Atchinson as he and his 
           men lead Charles Robinson from the Courthouse to the Jail.  

                                 KC
                        Let me through! 

           KC pushes and weaves her way to the front of the crowd. 

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        Father! 

           Charles Robinson’s face lights up. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        KC! Thank heavens, you’re- 

                                 KC
                        -What’s happened? 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        You’re safe. That’s all that 
                        matters.

           Colin finally catches up, stopping at KC’s side. 

                                 COLIN
                        Sorry we weren’t here sooner, sir! 

           Charles Robinson sees Colin, then spins on Atchinson. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        He’s alive?! You didn’t have her?!  
                                 ATCHINSON
                        Lock him up.

           The Ruffians drag Charles Robinson into the jailhouse. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        My confession was forced! Sherman 
                        kidnapped my daughter! 

           His voice can barely be heard amid the jeers of the crowd. KC 
           tries to follow her father into the jail- 

                                 KC
                        Daddy! DADDY!

           But the Ruffians shove her back. KC turns to Colin. 

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        Can’t you do anything?! 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        There’s new law in town, ma’am.
                             (taps his badge)
                        Appears the old sheriff ran off, 
                        chasing some local tail.  

           Colin’s hand drops to the gun at his side. Ruffians raise 
           their rifles, ready to fire. Atchinson smiles. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        I oughta write you up for that. 
                        Citizens can’t carry in town.  

           Colin looks at the rifles. He wouldn’t even get a shot off. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Turn it over nice and slow. I’d 
                        hate to get blood on the steps. 

           Colin reluctantly hands his Colt revolver to Atchinson.

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        How boring. Suits you. 

           Atchinson steps into the Jail. KC looks to Colin, but he 
           can’t bear to meet her gaze. 

           EXT. STABLES - DAY

           A dozen horses mill around the public CORRAL.

           Judah stands beside Brandy, tightening the saddle. As he 
           moves to the reins, she nuzzles her face into his hands. 
           Judah smiles and rubs her nose.
                                 JUDAH
                        Missed you too, girl. 

           KC and Colin approach. She pauses, realizing that Judah is 
           preparing to depart. 

                                 KC
                        You’re leaving?

                                 COLIN
                        No. He’s runnin’. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Now she’s back, I’m free to go. 

                                 KC
                        But we need your help. 

                                 JUDAH
                        With what? Diggin’ the grave?

           KC’s eyes well up with tears. 

                                 COLIN
                        Don’t mind him. He’s just a nigger. 

           Judah puts a hand to his wound, as though straining to hear. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Come again? I don’t hear too good 
                        outta my right ear. 

                                 COLIN
                        Said you’re a worthless, one-eared, 
                        thievin’ nigger who don’t care 
                        about nothin’ but a damn horse. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Least I ain’t gonna get killed over 
                        a girl who don’t know my name.  

           Judah steps into the stirrup, but Colin grabs his shoulder 
           and holds him down. Judah spins and punches Colin in the 
           face, knocking the Sheriff into the dirt.

                                 COLIN
                        Ya want freedom? This here’s the 
                        best shot you’ll get to prove it. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Can’t be free when you’re the law. 

                                 COLIN
                        Atchinson’s the law now. 
                                 JUDAH
                        Only difference between you and him 
                        is you’re an ignorant redneck fuck.

           Judah digs his heels in, racing Brandy toward the opposite 
           end of the corral. The STABLE MASTER takes notice- 

                                 STABLE MASTER
                        Hey! Where d’ya think you’re goin’?

                                 JUDAH
                        Canada. 

           Brandy gracefully LEAPS over the fence, and they’re gone. 

           KC shakes her head, bitterly disappointed. She turns and 
           exits the stables, leaving Colin alone.

           EXT. CANYON HIDEOUT - DAY

           A large stone rolls out of the way and Judah’s hand reaches 
           behind it to pull out a hidden AMMO BELT AND TWO REVOLVERS. 

           Judah straps the guns around his waist. As he leaves his 
           hideout for the last time, he KICKS one of the whiskey 
           bottles in his “bottle garden”, SHATTERING IT. 

           EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

           Judah rides north along the lonely road, bracing himself 
           against the cold wind. As he crests a hill, he sees VULTURES 
           circling high above a dead sycamore tree. 

           Brandy looks back at Judah and flicks her tail. 

                                 JUDAH
                        We got no time for this. They’s at 
                        least a day or two ahead already. 
                             (pauses as if listening)
                        Don’t matter. I ain’t stoppin’. 
                             (listens again)
                        Ah, shit. Come on then. 

           Judah leads Brandy off the road. 

           EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

           A large IRON CAGE hangs from the lifeless branches of the 
           sycamore. Vultures perch on every bar, crowding in tightly on 
           whatever is inside. 

           Judah rides past an Abandoned Farmhouse and approaches the 
           tree. As he nears the cage, he sees a hand-scrawled sign 
           hanging from the bottom: “RUNAWAY NIGER”. 
           He pulls his gun and FIRES into the air. The vultures fly up 
           to the branches above, revealing-

           A HIDEOUSLY DISFIGURED BLACK MAN. His skin has been pecked 
           mercilessly, and blood oozes from a hundred open sores. His 
           eyes are gone. Judah turns his head in disgust. 

           The Black Man stirs, lifting his head slightly and MOANING in 
           agony. The man weakly tries to speak. 

                                 BLACK MAN 
                        Iiiii...eeeeee.... 

           Judah dismounts and comes closer, trying to hear him clearly, 
           but sees that the man’s tongue has been cut out. 

                                 BLACK MAN (CONT’D)
                        Iiiiiilll... meeeee......

           Judah aims his pistol at the man’s head. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Want it to end? 

           The man simply nods. Judah pulls the trigger, putting him out 
           of his misery. The gunshot ECHOES across the valley. 

           Judah starts to walk away, but stops as a bold VULTURE flies 
           down to the body. The carrion bird pecks at the corpse. 

           Something inside Judah snaps. 

           Years of pent-up anger break loose, and Judah SHOOTS the 
           bird. Its body falls to the ground, but that isn’t enough. 
           Judah draws his other pistol and starts firing into the tree. 

           BAM BAM BAM BAM! Dead birds rain down from the branches until 
           Judah runs out of bullets. But there are still plenty of 
           vultures circling above. 

           Judah holsters his empty pistols and approaches the cage, 
           wincing at the smell. He looks at the rope connecting the 
           cage to a branch above it. 

           Judah climbs the tree and crawls out over the branch that 
           holds the cage. He saws through the rope with the BONE KNIFE, 
           and the cage CRASHES to the ground. 

                                 DOYLE (O.S.)
                        Nice work, Jim Crow. 

           Doyle and his two sons point their pistols up at Judah. The 
           old slave catcher’s good eye never wavers, but his cloudy 
           white eye rolls around the socket with excitement.
                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Better fly on down now. 

           Judah slides off the branch and drops to the ground. 

           Will and Drury seize Judah’s arms and haul him to his feet. 
           He lets go of the knife and they hold him as Doyle grabs the 
           collar of his shirt, ripping it open. 

           The men all stare at the “BAR A” branded on his chest. 

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a long way from home, little 
                        birdie.

           Judah SPITS in his face.  

                                 DOYLE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I’d be happy to kill you. But 
                        then you’d be free.

           Doyle looks to Drury, who KNOCKS Judah on the head with the 
           butt of his gun. 

           The world spins. Judah drops to his knees. Drury and Will set 
           upon him, kicking him furiously. 

           Judah raises his hands, trying to protect his head. But he is 
           helpless to escape the blows as they rain down upon him. 

           Judah’s VISION BLURS. The world melts into a dreamy haze of 
           sounds and images as he swims at the edge of consciousness. 

           KA-CAW! A single BLACK CROW flutters onto a branch of the 
           tree above. Judah locks eyes with the bird. His assailants 
           disappear. The bird launches into the air, out of sight. 

           WHAM! A fierce KICK jolts Judah’s head to the side. His cheek 
           rests on the grass, his vision focused on the IRON CAGE. A 
           vulture perches on the bars, picking at the body inside.

           KA-CAW! The crow flies at the vulture, attacking with its 
           talons. The vulture beats its wings, driving the crow off. 

           The crow circles around, this time joined by another. Then 
           another. The THREE CROWS work together, taking turns SWOOPING 
           at the vulture, CAWING and swiping with their talons. 

           The vulture cannot fight off the attacks from all sides. It 
           gives up and flies away, and the crows give chase.  
           Judah smiles. Doyle takes this as a personal offense, and 
           STOMPS on his temple. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           RAINDROPS PLUNK down on a wooden roof.

           Judah’s eyes flutter as he slowly regains consciousness. His 
           vision comes into focus, bringing us to-

           INT. FRONTIER CABIN - NIGHT

           The Doyles sit at the kitchen table inside a small log cabin 
           with CYRUS WILKINS, an angry, bearded man in his 40s. Cyrus’s 
           wife MARTHA throws a log on the fire as the men SLURP soup 
           and drink whiskey. 

           Judah finds himself propped up in a wooden chair in the 
           corner of the room, his hands bound beneath him. 

                                 MARTHA
                        More stew?

                                 WILL
                        Thanks ma’am. Mighty tasty. 

                                 CYRUS
                        Y’all keep an eye out. Them 
                        Jayhawks‘re fired up.  

                                 DRURY
                        Sure they’re none too happy ‘bout 
                        Lawrence.

                                 CYRUS
                        Gave the Yanks some southern 
                        hospitality.

           The Doyles chuckle.

                                 DRURY
                        How many’d you get, Cyrus? 

                                 CYRUS
                        Only one. My sword got stuck in his 
                        ribs. 

           He points to a heavy CAVALRY SWORD with an ornate hilt, 
           hanging in its sheath against the wall. 

                                 CYRUS (CONT’D)
                        By the time I got it loose, rest of 
                        ‘em was running scared. 
           The sound of a SCREAM pierces the night. The four men freeze. 

           EXT. ANOTHER LOG CABIN - NIGHT

           A short distance up the road, John Brown and his men drag TED 
           HARRIS, 30s, away from his home. Harris’s face is fixed with 
           defiant silence, while his wife SCREAMS in terror. 

                                 OLIVER
                        Stay inside, ma’am. We only need a 
                        word with your husband. 

                                 WIFE
                        Please! He didn’t do anything! 

                                 OLIVER
                        If that’s the truth, my father will 
                        have him home in no time.  

           INT. FRONTIER CABIN - AT THE SAME TIME

           Cyrus and the Doyles stand at the window, watching the 
           Jayhawkers drag Harris down to the creek. 

                                 MARTHA
                        What’s goin’ on out-

                                 CYRUS
                        -Quiet, woman!
                             (looks around)
                        Where’s my rifle? 

                                 MARTHA
                        Don’t go, Cyrus. 

                                 CYRUS
                        They’ll be here next. 

           The men prepare their guns, checking ammunition. 

                                 DOYLE
                        Will, you’re with us. Drury, you 
                        guard the bounty. 

                                 DRURY
                        Aww Pa, he ain’t goin’ nowhere. 

                                 DOYLE
                        Damn right he ain’t, ‘cause you’re 
                        stayin’ put. 

           Doyle, Will, and Cyrus pull on their hats and coats and step 
           out into the downpour with their rifles. 
           Drury seethes with rage, KICKING the door shut behind them. 
           Martha scurries away, leaving him alone with Judah. 

           As Drury paces, Judah eyes the sword on the wall. 

                                 JUDAH
                        They leave you back ‘cause you’re 
                        stupid? Or ‘cause you’re small? 

                                 DRURY
                        Maybe it’s ‘cause of my temper.  

           Drury KICKS him savagely, knocking over Judah and the chair. 
           Judah wriggles his bound hands down the wooden legs as Drury 
           sits at the table and pours a glass of whiskey. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Got one for me? 

           Drury pours a shot, and TOSSES it in Judah’s face. Judah 
           slips his hands free from under the chair. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        What’s it like bein’ the runt?

                                 DRURY
                        You must like pain.

                                 JUDAH
                        Haven’t felt nuthin’ yet.

                                 DRURY
                        Don’t worry. I’m warmin’ up. 

           He goes to the fireplace, and places a poker into the flame.  

           As soon as Drury turns his back, Judah ROLLS across the 
           floor, using the momentum to spring onto his feet. He hops 
           around the dining table, going for the CAVALRY SWORD. 

           Just as Judah pulls the sheathed sword off the wall, Drury 
           turns back with the RED-HOT POKER in his hand. The slave 
           catcher’s eyes dart to the SHOTGUN against the wall. Too far. 

           Drury LUNGES with the poker and Judah parries. Drury tries to 
           take advantage of Judah’s immobility by circling around him 
           and slashing from above and below. 

           Judah ducks and blocks Drury’s swipes. Engages the poker in 
           an arcing spin that finally twists it out of Drury’s hand. 

           The poker CLATTERS to the floor. Drury looks at Judah’s bound 
           feet, and BOLTS around the table, DIVING for the shotgun. 
           Judah WHIPS the sheath off the sword, ROLLS across the 
           kitchen table, KNOCKS AWAY Drury’s rising shotgun barrel- 

           And PLUNGES THE BLADE into the slave-catcher’s chest. Drury’s 
           lifeless body slumps to the floor.  

           Martha peeks out from the bedroom. Judah puts a finger to his 
           lips, shushing her. She nods, and ducks back into hiding. 

           EXT. CREEK BED - NIGHT

           John Brown interrogates Harris at the edge of a small creek 
           that winds through tall trees. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Wilkins spilt innocent blood in 
                        Lawrence. Is that the sort of man 
                        you cast your lot with?

                                 HARRIS
                        At least he ain’t no nigger-lover.  

           John Brown PISTOL-WHIPS Harris across the face. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Point us to his place and your 
                        children won’t grow up missing 
                        their father. 

                                 HARRIS
                        Better a dead father than a coward. 

           EMBANKMENT

           Doyle, Will, and Cyrus peer down on the interrogation below. 
           Doyle signals, and they fan out, taking up firing positions 
           in a semi-circle above the Jayhawkers.

           Will steadies his rifle over a rocky outcropping. He looks 
           along the ridge and sees Cyrus and Doyle poke their barrels 
           through the brush.  

           Will settles in, preparing to fire. A RUSTLE in the forest 
           startles him. He looks behind him as-

           Judah SWINGS the cavalry sword in a deadly arc.  

           CREEK BED

           John Brown hears a sickening sound and looks up as-

           WILL’S HEAD ROLLS DOWN THE EMBANKMENT and comes to rest 
           beside his boot. The men all stare in shock. 
           The Jayhawkers draw their guns and take cover. Harris runs 
           for it, splashing across the creek and making his escape. 

           EMBANKMENT

           Cyrus looks down at the severed head, then swivels around, 
           searching for the attacker. He’s surrounded by the ominous 
           branches of the pitch-black forest. 

           Cyrus packs up his gun and flees blindly through the trees.

           THUNK. Cyrus is stopped by cold metal. He looks down to see 
           his own sword buried in his gut. Judah pulls the blade loose.

                                 CYRUS
                        Oh holy mother of-

           Cyrus clutches the mortal wound, he collapses forward. Judah 
           looks up for his last opponent. 

           Not far away, Doyle stalks quietly through the trees, peering 
           into the darkness with his one good eye. The steady rain 
           muffles his footsteps over the fallen leaves. 

           A RUSTLE. Doyle whips around. BAM BAM! 

           But there’s nothing behind him. He backs against the trunk of 
           a MASSIVE TREE, searching the shadows for any movement. 

           On the opposite side of the tree, Judah leans his back 
           against the bark, gripping his bloodied sword. 

           Doyle circles the tree slowly, leading with his pistol as he 
           scans the forest in front of him. 

           Judah watches the pistol edge out around the trunk. Doyle 
           creeps forward ever so slightly...

           SHINK. The blade flashes downward and SEVERS Doyle’s hand. 

           Doyle grabs his amputated stump in horror, dropping to his 
           knees. He looks up at Judah.  

                                 DOYLE
                        Go ahead boy. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Then you’d be free. 

           Judah turns his back on Doyle, who SPUTTERS in agony. 

           BAM! A bullet rips through Doyle’s chest, putting him out of 
           his misery. Oliver emerges with two Jayhawkers at his side.  
                                 OLIVER
                        Come with me. 

           CREEK BED

           Oliver leads Judah down to the creek. John Brown sees Judah, 
           and the minister’s eyes dawn with recognition. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        You. I know you. The thief we 
                        passed on the road. 

           Judah nods. John Brown looks up at the embankment. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        How many?

                                 OLIVER
                        Three, carrying rifles and pistols.

                                 JOHN BROWN
                             (to Judah)
                        So you saved us.

           John Brown approaches Judah slowly.

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        That hothead lawman still with you?  

                                 JUDAH
                        Naw. On my own now. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        What happened to him? 

                                 JUDAH
                        I finally got free.   

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        You know brother, you don’t have to 
                        be alone to be free. 

           This pierces Judah. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        You’re with us now. God has put you 
                        here to do His work.

           Judah thinks, then exhales as he makes a decision.  

                                 JUDAH
                        I saw a vision.  

           The Jayhawkers look at Judah with awe. 
                                 JOHN BROWN
                        What did you see, brother? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Crows. That chased away a vulture. 

           EXT. TOPEKA, KS - TOWN SQUARE - MORNING

           The town comes to life as the sun rises over the Courthouse. 
           Border Ruffians with rifles patrol the square. 

           Stringfellow stands on the stage, which today clearly serves 
           as a gallows. He pulls a lever and the trap door RELEASES, 
           hanging a sack of flour with a THWUMP. 

           Across the square, Colin watches the hanging-test from the 
           steps of the CHURCH, a canvas bag slung over his shoulder.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Colin pushes through the large wooden doors and removes his 
           hat, revealing a BLACK EYE. He walks between the rows of 
           empty pews. As he nears the sacristy, KC steps inside. 

                                 KC 
                        Colin, wait!

           He stops as she hurries down the aisle. 

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’re doing? 

                                 COLIN
                             (points upward)
                        Always wanted to see the old bell 
                        they got up there. 

                                 KC
                        My father wouldn’t want you to die 
                        today.  

                                 COLIN
                        Might at least give him some 
                        company. 

                                 KC
                        You won’t prove anything except 
                        that you’re even more muleheaded 
                        than I thought possible! 

                                 COLIN
                        I mighta been wrong about us. ‘Bout 
                        a lot of things, even. But I know 
                        I’m right about this.
           He hikes the bag up on his shoulder and prepares to leave, 
           but pauses for a moment. He grabs KC and KISSES her mouth. 
           She is so caught off guard, she doesn’t have time to resist. 

           He releases her. She stares at him for a beat... then SLAPS 
           him across the face. He smiles, as though it woke him up. 

                                 COLIN (CONT’D)
                        Alright then. 

           She watches, dumbfounded, as he goes up a staircase. 

           INT. CHURCH TOWER - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

           Colin comes up the steps to an open-air second-story platform 
           inside the tower. He climbs a ladder up to a trapdoor. 

           EXT. CHURCH BELFRY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Colin pushes through the trapdoor to the top of the bell 
           tower. A small walkway circles the central column, with a 
           rope hanging down from the large CAST-IRON BELL. 

           Colin pulls a Sharps rifle from his sack. He reaches into his 
           pocket and begins pulling out BULLETS, lining them up on the 
           ledge. He reaches in again and pauses. 

           Colin pulls out a clay marble, the Little Girl’s “shooter”. 
           He places it at the end of his row of ammunition and smiles. 

           CLICK. A pistol cocks behind him. He stiffens. 

                                 JUDAH (O.S.)
                             (imitating Colin)
                        One wrong move and you’re diggin’ 
                        your own grave. 

           Colin turns to see Judah. They size each other up. 

                                 JUDAH (CONT’D)
                        Nice shiner. 

                                 COLIN
                        Never figured on ya comin’ back. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Me neither. 

                                 COLIN
                        Guess we were both wrong. 

                                 JUDAH
                        What’s the plan?
                                 COLIN
                             (indicates his rifle)
                        You’re looking at it. 

                                 JUDAH
                        We can do better. 

           He points to the town square below. Colin looks down and sees- 

           JOHN BROWN AND OLIVER, hitching up their horses. John Brown 
           looks up to the belfry and gives a curt nod. Colin nods back.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           GONG! GONG! GONG! THE CHURCH BELL RINGS OUT THE TIME, as the 
           square below buzzes with spectators. 

           Governor Sherman stands out in front of his office, happily 
           watching the square fill up. 

           KC hides her face under a bonnet as she slips into the crowd.  

           EXT. JAIL - DAY

           Ruffians stand at attention on the front steps of the Jail. 
           Atchinson emerges, BADGE gleaming on his chest. Charles 
           Robinson comes out next, spurred along by Stringfellow. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Lovely day, isn’t it, Charles? I 
                        may yet take a liking to Kansas. 

           The spectators quiet as Charles Robinson limps up the steps 
           of the gallows. Stringfellow leads him to the trap door. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Charles Robinson. For providing 
                        material support to a rebel 
                        militia, you have been found guilty 
                        of treason against the Territory of 
                        Kansas. Any last words? 

           Charles Robinson stares out into the crowd.

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        I will not waste breath pleading my 
                        case, but before I draw my last, 
                        let me say this: The question of 
                        freedom renders us deaf to all 
                        reason. If we cannot find a civil 
                        way to disagree, have no doubt, 
                        this nation will tear itself apart.

           His eyes find KC, her face flushed with emotion. 
                                 CHARLES ROBINSON (CONT’D)
                        I do not regret the actions for 
                        which I am condemned. But in my 
                        pursuit of justice, I may have 
                        compromised that which matters 
                        most. I pray forgiveness from those 
                        who are closest to my heart.   

           Stringfellow puts a black hood over Charles Robinson’s head, 
           and cinches the noose around his neck. 

           The crowd falls silent in anticipation. Then-

           WHEE-OO-WHEET! A shrill whistle echoes out over the square.

           A COMMOTION starts up, as spectators point down the street at 
           an unseen source. The sound of GALLOPING HOOVES approaches. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        What the hell... 

           A riderless black mare gallops into view. Brandy.  

           A BANGED-UP WELLS FARGO STAGECOACH follows her, pulled by two 
           white stallions. The coach careens through the town square, 
           SCATTERING TOWNSPEOPLE as it heads for the stage.

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Positions! 

           The Ruffians form a defensive line in front of the stage, 
           taking aim at the stagecoach. But there is no driver.

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        Fire! 

           The Ruffians FIRE a volley at the oncoming coach. They start 
           to reload, but scatter as the coach bears down on them. 

           Brandy runs under the stage. The carriage horses follow, but 
           the coach CRASHES into the lip of the stage, just as it did 
           after the bank robbery, coming to a jarring halt. 

           The collision JOSTLES Charles Robinson, who wobbles with the 
           noose around his neck. Atchinson watches the black mare run 
           under the stage and stop in front of the Courthouse.  

           Judah runs out from behind the Courthouse and LEAPS UP into 
           Brandy’s saddle. He draws the CAVALRY SWORD and rides full 
           speed, directly toward the stage. 

           ATCHINSON’S EYE TWITCHES.
           The door of the coach is thrown open. A frightened Ruffian 
           peeks inside. No one. Only a WOODEN BARREL MARKED “WINE”- 

           AND THE HISS OF A BURNING FUSE. 

           Atchinson draws on Judah but can’t get off the shot before- 

           KA-BOOM! The POWDER KEG explodes, blowing the stagecoach into 
           wooden shards, knocking the Ruffians to the ground. 

           The explosion shatters the support beams of the gallows. The 
           entire structure COLLAPSES. 

           Charles Robinson slides forward. The noose tightens. 

           Judah rides into the cloud of BLACK SMOKE, sword raised above 
           his head. He scatters the panicked Ruffians and SLICES the 
           hangman’s rope. Charles Robinson drops to the ground.  

           As the politician GASPS for breath, Judah leaps down from 
           Brandy and pulls the hood from his head. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON 
                        Am I dead? 

                                 JUDAH
                        Not yet. 

           CHAOS ENGULFS THE SQUARE

           Governor Sherman tries to blend in among the fleeing 
           townspeople, glancing back over his shoulder until-

           He SLAMS into something and falls down. 

           The governor looks up at John Brown and Oliver, who point 
           rifles down at him. He raises his arms in surrender. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        The bell tolls, governor. 

           John Brown takes off his hat and waves it in the air. 

           EXT. CHURCH BELFRY - DAY

           Colin sees John Brown’s hat waving, and pulls the rope of the 
           church bell. It GONGS out over the town square. 

           Jayhawkers respond to the signal and pop up from hiding on 
           nearby rooftops. They take aim and FIRE at the Ruffians. 
           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Bullets rain down on the Ruffians as they scramble for cover. 
           Stringfellow fires back from behind the wrecked stagecoach. 
           Another Ruffian cowers on the ground nearby. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        Shoot, you chickenshit! 

           Stringfellow pulls him to his feet, and a bullet pierces the 
           man’s skull. Stringfellow lets go and the body drops back 
           down into the dirt. Another shot WHIZZES past. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW (CONT’D)
                        Fall back!

           Stringfellow leads the Ruffians as they retreat to the 
           buildings at the edge of the plaza. 

           AT THE GALLOWS

           KC runs through the thick clouds of smoke. She finds Judah, 
           hoisting her father up into Brandy’s saddle. 

                                 KC
                        Judah?! 

           Judah looks up and makes a quick decision. He grabs KC and 
           helps her up into the saddle in front of her father. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        KC?! What are you-

                                 JUDAH
                        -Ride!

           Judah WHACKS Brandy’s hindquarters, and she starts trotting.

           Judah drops the sword and draws his gun, laying down covering 
           fire as he escorts KC and Charles Robinson to safety. Shoots 
           in all directions, firing his pistol in a deadly ballet. 

           A giant Ruffian astride a Clydesdale barrels down on Judah 
           with sword held high. Judah turns, raises his pistol, and- 

           CLICK. Out of bullets. The Ruffian windmills the heavy blade, 
           and then-

           Miraculously tumbles off the horse and falls to the ground, 
           landing at Judah’s feet. Dead. A bullet hole in his back.  

           Judah sees Colin looking down from the bell tower. Colin tips 
           his hat. Judah nods in thanks, runs to catch up with Brandy. 
           AMIDST THE RUBBLE

           A WEATHERED HAND reaches up through the wreckage of the stage 
           and pushes aside a burning plank. Atchinson pulls himself out 
           of the debris, covered in soot but mostly unharmed. 

           He surveys the fire fight that is now underway. He spies KC 
           and Charles Robinson, riding away on Brandy. 

           A MOAN of pain somewhere nearby. Atchinson follows the sound 
           to a Border Ruffian pinned down by a heavy beam. 

                                 RUFFIAN
                        Bourbon! Please, my leg... 

           Atchinson kneels as though to help. But instead, he grabs the 
           Ruffian’s rifle and stalks off, ignoring the man’s pleas.

           Atchinson DRAWS A BEAD on Charles Robinson. He sights down 
           the crosshairs, inhales deeply, exhales slowly-

           BANG! The bullet hits Charles Robinson in the back. 

           Atchinson sights down his second barrel, preparing to take 
           another shot. He inhales and- 

           CRACK! A bullet digs into the timber inches from Atchinson’s 
           arm. He takes cover, looks for the source of the shot- 

           And sees Oliver, shooting from a position in the front window 
           of the General Store. 

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Judah leads Charles Robinson and KC around the corner. The 
           politician topples out of the saddle, THUDDING into the dirt.  

                                 KC
                        Daddy!

           KC hops down to aid her father, but Judah stops her.  

                                 JUDAH
                        Not here.

           He drags Charles Robinson into an alleyway.  

           INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

           The Jayhawkers are dug in on one side of the plaza, 
           exchanging fire with the Ruffians across the vacant square.

           John Brown and Oliver kneel to reload.
                                 OLIVER
                        I saw him, Pa. Atchinson. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Where, son? 

                                 OLIVER
                        I won’t miss again.  

           Oliver snaps his rifle shut and pops up, taking aim. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        Oliver, wait-

           Too late. A bullet PIERCES Oliver’s chest. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        No! 

           EXT. CHURCH BELFRY - DAY

           Colin FIRES from the belfry, then ducks back down. He hears a 
           GUN COCK on the platform a story below him and freezes. 

           BOOM! A shotgun blast splinters through the floor right next 
           to him. He scrambles away just as- 

           BOOM! Another shot comes up through the wooden decking. 

           INT. CHURCH TOWER - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Stringfellow reloads his shotgun, staring up at the belfry. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW
                        Come on down, Sheriff! Ain’t gonna 
                        hurtcha none. 

           He snaps the stock shut and aims it up at the ceiling above. 
           He listens closely... 

           GONG! GONG! GONG! The church bells ring wildly, creating a 
           cacophony that makes Stringfellow wince. He FIRES up again, 
           blowing another hole in the ceiling. 

                                 STRINGFELLOW (CONT’D)
                        Shut that racket up! Come down like 
                        a man! 

           The bell stops ringing. 

                                 COLIN (O.S.)
                        Alright then. 
           Stringfellow spins to see Colin hanging from the church bell 
           rope, after rappelling down from above. Colin stands on the 
           window ledge, his pistol leveled at Stringfellow. 

           Colin SMOKES him. 

           INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

           John Brown cradles his dead son on the floor. He clutches his 
           BIBLE as tears run down his cheeks. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        He who pleased God was beloved of 
                        him, so speedily was he taken away. 

           A bullet SHATTERS a nearby window, interrupting his prayer. 
           He takes a deep breath, then continues. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        Youth cut short condemns the wicked 
                        man grown old. The righteous dead-

           Another VOLLEY OF GUNSHOTS pepper the store, and John Brown 
           looks up from the Bible with an unholy fire in his eyes.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           The two sides are locked in a stalemate, exchanging rifle 
           shots across the square. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (O.S.)
                        Raaaaahhhhh!!!

           John Brown SHOUTS with a primal rage. He emerges from the 
           General Store, arms wide, gripping a rifle in his right hand 
           and a Bible in his left. Marches into the square. Defiant. 

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        His enemies rejoice at his death, 
                        but God shall laugh them to scorn. 

           As he draws fire, John Brown drops the Bible, raises his 
           rifle, and FIRES on the entrenched Ruffians.

                                 JOHN BROWN (CONT’D)
                        For the Father shall rend them, and 
                        cast them down headlong!

           He reaches the fountain at the center of the plaza, and other 
           Jayhawkers run forward. The tide of the battle is turning. 

           As the Jayhawkers advance, Atchinson is cut off from his 
           Ruffian allies. He recognizes the impending defeat of his men 
           and decides to save himself. 
           Beyond the line of buildings, he sees a way out. The river. 

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY

           Judah stands at the corner of the alley with his pistol, 
           keeping watch for KC as she ministers to her father. He’s 
           itching to join the fight, but won’t leave her again.  

           Across the square, he spots Atchinson ducking low and cutting 
           through the buildings toward the river. 

           Judah considers giving chase, then looks back at KC. 

                                 KC
                        Kill him. 

           A vengeful fire burns in her eyes. Judah takes a deep breath, 
           weighs his options, then gives her his pistol. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Do what you gotta. 

           Judah takes off after Atchinson. 

           EXT. KAW RIVER - DAY

           Judah runs down the alleyway, emerges on the river bank.

           A SPLASH draws Judah’s attention, and he spots his former 
           master SWIMMING ACROSS THE RIVER. The strong current carries 
           Atchinson further downstream as he makes his way across.

           Judah stares out at the swirling rapids, petrified. Atchinson 
           is getting away. 

           Judah takes a deep breath, then charges headlong into the 
           river and DIVES into the dark current. 

           He bursts up through the surface, flailing his arms and 
           fighting to stay afloat.  

           Atchinson clings to a rock, catches his breath. Looks back 
           and sees Judah thrashing toward him. GAINING. 

           Atchinson pushes off, races toward the opposite bank. 

           Atchinson nears the edge of the river and his feet touch down 
           into the sand. He stands up and pulls his knife. 

           Judah reaches the shallows a few yards away. He rises up and 
           draws the Bone Knife. 

           The two men square off. Water drips from their clothes. 
                                 ATCHINSON
                        You learned to swim. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Got tired of runnin’. 

           Judah lunges, STABBING. Atchinson steps aside. Circles him. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        I should’ve taught you manners.  

                                 JUDAH
                        You taught me to kill. 

           Judah attacks again. Atchinson dodges, counters. 

           Judah parries with the Bone Knife, but Atchinson’s steel 
           blade SHEARS IT IN HALF. 

           Judah retreats out of range and looks at his broken weapon. 
           Tosses it aside. Prepares to fight with his hands. 

                                 ATCHINSON
                        Now I’ll teach you to die. Like 
                        your mother. 

           Judah’s face falls. His defenses drop for a fraction of a 
           second. That’s all Atchinson needs. 

           He springs forward, SLASHES viciously, SLICING JUDAH’S ARM. 

           Judah spins away, clutching the wound. Blood pours through 
           his fingers, swirling into the water below. 

                                 ATCHINSON (CONT’D)
                        That blood belongs to me. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Then get what’s coming to you. 

           Atchinson rushes him with the blade.  Judah waits to the last 
           possible moment, twists away, catches Atchinson’s wrist. 

           Atchinson BARRELS into Judah, knocks him to his knees. But 
           Judah keeps hold of Atchinson’s knife arm. 

           The blade wavers, inches from Judah’s neck. 

           Atchinson towers over Judah. Presses the deadly point closer.

                                 ATCHINSON
                        You still got a debt to pay.
           Judah knows he can’t resist. He releases Atchinson’s arm and 
           rolls, letting the knife PLUNGE into his shoulder. 

           The sudden release surprises Atchinson. He loses his footing 
           and SPLASHES into the river. 

           Judah scrambles on top, wraps his uninjured arm around 
           Atchinson’s neck. Forces Atchinson’s head underwater. 

           Atchinson bucks up, GASPING for breath. But Judah is in 
           control, and slowly muscles him lower and lower. 

                                 JUDAH
                        You’re right. I owe you. 

           Judah pins his father down in the turbulent river. Atchinson 
           flails frantically, but Judah holds tight-

           DROWNING HIM in three feet of water.

           Atchinson kicks, thrashes, slaps the surface. His movements 
           slowly subside. A few final BUBBLES. Then all is still. 

           Judah clenches his teeth and pulls the knife out of his 
           wounded shoulder. He uses it to cut the leather strap that 
           has hung around his neck for so many years. 

           He removes the LIBERTY DOLLAR MEDALLION and presses the coin 
           into Atchinson’s palm, closing the dead fingers around it. 

           Judah unpins the TIN STAR on Atchinson’s breast. He lets go 
           of the body and watches the current carry it downstream. 

           He stands in the shallows, closes his eyes, and breathes.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Judah leads Brandy back into the town square, where the 
           battle has come to a conclusion. The Jayhawkers have won the 
           day, and now patrol the plaza, rifles at the ready. 

           John Brown walks among the bodies of the fallen combatants, 
           pausing to pray over each man. Judah steps up beside John 
           Brown, who doesn’t look up but senses his presence. 

                                 JOHN BROWN
                        If this is the fight we’re meant 
                        for, I don’t understand why God 
                        sets the price so high.

                                 JUDAH
                        Maybe so we don’t forget. 
                                 JOHN BROWN
                        I’ll need men like you to finish 
                        what we started today. 

                                 JUDAH
                        I’m done fighting, Mr. Brown. 

           John Brown nods. Judah walks away, cradling his wounded arm. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JAIL - THE NEXT DAY

           The jailhouse now doubles as a makeshift hospital. Charles 
           Robinson lies on a cot in the cell Judah once occupied. KC 
           tends to the gunshot wound in his back as Colin steps inside.  

                                 COLIN
                        Feelin’ better, Mr. Robinson? 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Better than ever! I’m running 
                        unopposed now! 

           He points to the next cell, where Governor Sherman broods 
           behind bars. Colin smiles and tips his hat to his old boss.  

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON (CONT’D)
                        You must be in high spirits too. 
                        Come to claim your reward, I 
                        suppose. 

           Charles Robinson looks at KC, and she turns away. 

                                 COLIN
                        Thank ya, but I reckon that what I 
                        asked for ain’t yours to give. 

           Charles Robinson breathes a sigh of relief.  KC looks up at 
           Colin, beaming. He nods to her and takes his leave. 

           KC watches him go, then turns back to help her father. 

                                 CHARLES ROBINSON
                        Your mother wouldn’t want you to 
                        spend your life fussing over me.  

           EXT. JAIL - DAY

           Colin comes down the steps to find Judah climbing into 
           Brandy’s saddle, his wounded arm bound up in a sling. 

                                 COLIN
                        Headin’ out west then? 
                                 JUDAH
                        Naw. Goin’ back to the Kaw, if 
                        they’ll take me. 

           Colin extends the hand that was cut in the Indian ceremony. 
           Judah does the same, and they shake.

                                 COLIN
                        Safe travels. Brother. 

           Judah nudges Brandy on, but pauses and turns back. He pulls 
           out the Sheriff’s Badge, and tosses the tin star to Colin. 

                                 JUDAH
                        Nearly forgot. 

                                 KC (O.S.)
                        Colin!

           KC hurries down the jailhouse steps. She stops in front of 
           the Sheriff and collects herself. 

                                 KC (CONT’D)
                        I was hoping perhaps we could have 
                        that picnic? 
                             (looks at Judah)
                        I’d love to hear how you 
                        apprehended the Black Bandit. 

           Colin smiles, speechless.  

                                 JUDAH
                        Reckon I’d like to hear that one 
                        too. Some day. 

           Judah nods a goodbye, and urges Brandy into a walk, leaving 
           KC and Colin together on the front steps. 

           Judah rides Brandy through the town square, leaving Topeka 
           behind, and heading into an uncertain future. 

           Free at last.  

                                                              FADE OUT.
