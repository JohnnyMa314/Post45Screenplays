           INT. GREY MARKET - LATE AFTERNOON

           A bazaar ringed with rusty riot barricades stacked into walls. 
           Its tent top, a rough patchwork of sun-bleached vinyl adverts.

           Third World hustle-bustle. Vendors hawk wares and services.

           Fast hands swap goods for CHINESE YUAN. Dirty fingers peel 
           bills off wads gripped close to the vest.

           Nonperishable foods and spices. Canned soda, bottled booze.

           Clothing and sneakers. Brand name, imitation. New, stolen. 

           Tools and kids toys. All of it imported, all of it crap.

           Repairmen tinker with electronics. An iPod, a toaster.

           False prophets peddle religious paraphernalia.

           Drugs trade hands in the darker corners. Shifty eyes ogle 
           bins of guns and ammo. AK-47s, grenades.

           JOHN ALDEN (35) sits on milk crates behind a table of pirated 
           DVDs. Threadbare and undernourished, John’s the icon of the 
           post-collapse, a common man, save for his rugged good looks.

           Escaping the tedium, he puts the final touches on a hand-
           carved figurine with his “USMC“ stamped Ka-Bar knife. 

           Sheathing the blade, John fishes another figurine out of his 
           pocket. He grins to see them side by side - A PAIR OF DOVES.

                                 MARKET CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                            <Subtitled Spanish>
                        <How much?>

           Not looking, John reflexively points to a sign priced in YUAN.

                                 MARKET CUSTOMER (O.S.)(CONT’D)
                        <No. For the birds.>

           John pockets them, and turns his gaze to the MARKET CUSTOMER - 
           an older man spotted with lesions, several fingers missing.

                                 JOHN
                        <They’re doves, and not for sale.>

           RING-RING. Closing bell signals the end of trade. A private 
           security guard gestures for folks to “Wrap it up.“

           Two other guards open a large gate for the vendors’ carts, 
           revealing THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN, visible through the steel 
           skeleton of a fire-gutted building. Welcome to Los Angeles.
           EXT. GREY MARKET - SHORTLY AFTER

           A pack of feral dogs cannibalize an unlucky stray outside the 
           shuttered doors of Hollywood’s Capitol Records Building.

           John watches from across the street, standing alone as the 
           last of the other vendors depart, and the guards lock up. 

           Anchored to his cash box and milk crates filled with unsold 
           DVDs, John’s an easy target. He pats his concealed shoulder-
           holster for reassurance, checks his cell for the time - BANG!

           Eyes dart to the corner of Hollywood & Vine. Recognition as a 
           pickup rumbles over the sandy pavement, dust cloud trailing.

           BANG! The truck backfires once more. THREE THUGS hop out - 
           RED BEARD, THROAT TATTS, and SKIN HEAD.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re late again.

           John hands over his cash box. Ignoring him, Red Beard tallies 
           yuan as Throat Tatts counts unsold discs, stacking them atop 
           hundreds more in the truck bed. Skin Head stands to the side.

                                 THROAT TATTS
                        Whatchu got?

                                 RED BEARD
                        Nine-eighty.

           Throat Tatts nods. Red Beard passes John several yuan notes.

           John tallies the meager sum, glares at Red Beard.

                                 RED BEARD (CONT’D)
                        New rate.

                                 JOHN
                        Bullshit. 

           John’s eyes flash with rage. His fist tightens.

           Plastic bags roll across the street behind him, tumbleweeds 
           of the post-collapse. John’s hand relaxes.

                                 RED BEARD
                        Yeah, that’s what I thought. See ya 
                        bright and early.

           The thugs turn to leave. John grabs Red Beard’s shoulder. 

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t afford another cut. 
           Red Beard looks down at John’s hand, chuckles, then explodes 
           with a spinning elbow strike aimed for John’s gut. 

           John deflects the blow with skill that betrays training, and 
           steps back to avoid escalation, but they’re unleashed now. 
           Throat Tatts and Skin Head crack open expandable batons.

           John deflects a flurry of blows with his forearms, and 
           somehow draws the Glock 17 pistol from his shoulder-holster. 

           He aims to shoot - WHAM! Red Beard swats his wrist with a 
           third baton. The blow sends John’s gun flying. 

           John unsheathes his Ka-Bar, taking a slice out of Skin Head 
           in one motion. Just as fast, Throat Tatts disarms him.

           Their target defenseless, the thugs thrash John until he’s 
           sprawled out across a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

           Red scoops up John’s gun as Skin Head checks his gash.

                                 SKIN HEAD
                        I say we ghost him.

           Red aims down. BAM!-ZING! The bullet ricochets off the Walk 
           of Fame Star’s brass inlay. John shudders. Red grins.

                                 RED BEARD
                        Not yet. He got anything?

           Tatts yanks John’s wallet along with the yuan they just paid 
           him, and hands it all over to Red Beard.

           Red rummages through. No cash. No cards. Just a driver’s 
           license, and photo of John’s beautiful wife and daughter.

                                 RED BEARD (CONT’D)
                        Ain’t that some shit.

           Red passes the photo to Skin who eye-fucks and pockets it.

                                 SKIN HEAD
                        I’ll keep that.

           Red squats down next to John, now barely conscious.

                                 RED BEARD
                        I ever see you ‘round here again…

           Red taps to the address portion of John’s license with the 
           tip of John’s pistol as if to say “I know where to find you.“

                                 RED BEARD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make me come knockin’.
           EXT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Darker now, especially without functioning street lights. 
           Bruised and bloody, John treads the sidewalk beneath a web of 
           wires. Everyone’s spliced into the cable and electric lines. 

           A white jeep prowls by, blue helmets inside, iconic “UN“ 
           lettering on the hood.

           John passes boarded-over windows, doors shackled with chains, 
           murals of ANTI-BANKER and ANTI-CHINESE GRAFFITI. Underfoot, 
           curbside rot pulses with the scurry of rats and roaches.

           Checking over his shoulder to make sure that he’s not being 
           followed, John ducks into his building’s entryway.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, COMMON ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John enters his apartment. Coughs. Smoke in the air.

                                 JOHN
                        Pris?… Izzy?

           On edge, he follows the smoke into the kitchen.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           John dashes past the stacks of canned food and scrap wood to 
           find a smoking pot of burnt beans on a jerry-built stove.

                                 JOHN
                        Goddammit, Pris…

           He moves to grab the pot, then freezes.

           On the floor - a knife laying in a pool of blood.

           Nightmare scenarios blast through John’s mind. He draws his 
           Ka-Bar. Chases the blood trail to the bathroom door.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Pris? Pris, you in there?

           No response. Knife raised. Deep breath. 

           John bursts in. A woman SCREAMS.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           PRISCILLA “PRIS“ ALDEN (30) rips out her iPod earbuds, one 
           hand clamping a bloodied towel against her opposite wrist. 
           Even an ashen complexion can’t dull her radiant beauty. 
                                 PRIS
                        Jesus, John! You scared the shit--

                                 JOHN
                        --I scared you? What happened?

           John moves to examine her wound. She lets him handle it, 
           passing the alcohol swab she was just about to open.

                                 PRIS
                        Tried opening a can with a knife…

           She notes John’s raised eyebrow.

                                 PRIS (CONT’D)
                        …I know, I know, it was stupid. The 
                        damn can opener broke again.
                            (beat)
                        Where were you?

           Pris waits, but John’s focused on cleaning her wound.

                                 JOHN
                        Here, just hold pressure there.

           John places gauze on Pris’ arm. She takes it, and he peels 
           off his shirt, revealing fearsome bruises and a faded USMC 
           shoulder tattoo. Pris reaches out to touch him. 

                                 PRIS
                        Oh my God!

                                 JOHN
                        I’m fine--keep pressure on that.

           Her eyes tear up. John embraces her, strokes her hair.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, hey, it’s alright, really.

           Pris, gazing over John’s shoulder into the mirror, can’t take 
           her eyes off John’s fearsome bruises.

                                 PRIS
                        I don’t want to do this anymore.

                                 JOHN
                        I know… I know.

           She recomposes herself as John opens a pack of bandages.

                                 PRIS
                        Babe, I got this. Could you get 
                        Izzy from Carlos? I told him I’d…
           Her voice trails off as John puts his hands on her cheeks, 
           and kisses her forehead. He wipes away a falling tear with 
           his thumb. She eyes his shirtless body, lean, but ripped.

                                 PRIS (CONT’D)
                        My sexy man.

           John glimpses his bruised back in the mirror, skeptical.

                                 JOHN
                        Are you kidding? - I look like a 
                        blueberry.

           He pinches her nose, playful. She scrunches it up, cute.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT COMPLEX, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           ANTI-BANKER and ANTI-CHINESE graffiti smattered walls. Holes 
           in the dry-wall where copper piping’s been ripped clean out. 

           John steps out of his unit, checks that the hall’s clear, 
           then knocks on the adjacent door. TAP--TAP--TA-TAP--TAP.

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        Daddy!

           John smiles at the pitter-patter of footsteps coming from the 
           other side, followed by a reply. TAP-TAP.

           The dead bolt clicks open, and the door swings in revealing 
           CARLOS COLUMBUS (75), a tiny, squinty man with coke-bottle 
           glasses, and little, bespectacled ELIZABETH “IZZY“ ALDEN (8), 
           costumed in a pink cape, crazy socks, and a plastic tiara.

                                 IZZY (CONT’D)
                        Daddy, Daddy, Daddy!

           John hoists her up. She latches on like a monkey. He winces. 

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks, Carlos, sorry I’m late.

                                 CARLOS
                        <Everything okay? I heard-->

                                 JOHN
                        <--A little accident, it’s nothing.>

           Carlos looks John over, concerned by his battered appearance.

                                 CARLOS
                        <There’s no sacrifice too great for 
                        family, John. Hang in there.>
           John forces a smile. Carlos hands two books to Izzy.

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t forget these, my Queen.

                                 IZZY
                        Thanks, Uncle Carlos.

                                 CARLOS
                        You take care of this guy, okay?

                                 IZZY
                        I will!

           John casts a wary glance down the hall towards the stairwell. 

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER

           John and Pris do the dishes. John washes. Pris dries. Passing 
           a large pot, he groans in pain, breaking the awkward silence.

                                 PRIS
                        We still got 8 Vicodins, and 5 
                        Percocet. Let me get you--

                                 JOHN
                        --I took Ibuprofen.

           Pris glares at John, wishing he wouldn’t be so stubborn.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        That stuff’s for you and Iz. Never 
                        know when…

           Beat. Pris’ eyes water. She draws into herself. John regrets 
           his pessimism. Places a reassuring hand on her shoulder.

                                 PRIS
                        I’m sorry… It’s just… I can’t get 
                        this one news clip out of my head. 
                        This morning, there was this little 
                        girl from downtown, all skin and 
                        bones, same age as Iz. The reporter 
                        asked her what she wanted to be 
                        when she grew up. You know what she 
                        said, John? - Nothing… nothing, 
                        John, an eight year old.

           Pris trails off, her glassy eyes finding Izzy’s door.

                                 JOHN
                        Let me finish these. You go tuck 
                        her in, alright?
                                 PRIS
                        I look at her, and I don’t know how 
                        much longer I can keep telling her 
                        that everything’s gonna be okay.

                                 JOHN
                        Everything is gonna be okay - we’re 
                        gonna make it be okay, better even.

           Pris moves away so that John’s hand falls from her shoulder.

                                 PRIS
                        I think you should put her to bed.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, IZZY’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John approaches the closet, light sifting through the 
           louvered doors. He knocks in code. TAP--TAP--TA-TAP--TAP.

           She answers from the other side. TAP-TAP.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, IZZY’S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           John opens the closet revealing Izzy, nose buried in a book, 
           headphones on. Packed with comfort items and vibrant colors - 
           the closet’s a shelter from reality. Crayon drawings, DVDs, a 
           bed of pillows, and umpteen books render the floor invisible.

           Izzy holds a finger up to say, “One moment.“ Another one 
           traces down the last few lines of the page, her lips moving.

           He chuckles, squatting down as she removes her headphones.

                                 IZZY
                        When are we getting a new dog?

                                 JOHN
                        How about… 

           John digs through his pocket, pulls out the dove figurines.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        …a pair of doves?

           She lights up. Bookmarks her page. Snatches the birds.

                                 IZZY
                        They’re beautiful!

           Izzy pops open a beautiful handmade “Noah’s Ark“ jewelry box, 
           and places the doves alongside dozens of other intricately 
           hand-carved animal pairs.
           John picks up the book she was reading - “From the Mixed-Up 
           Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler.“

                                 JOHN
                        Good one?

           Izzy nods enthusiastically.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What’s your favorite part?

                                 IZZY
                        The Metropolitan Museum of Art! 
                        Daddy, are there still museums?

                                 JOHN
                        Not here, but somewhere else, sure.

                                 IZZY
                        Why can’t we live somewhere else?

           Beat. John forces a smile, hiding the fact that something 
           deep down inside just came a little bit closer to dying.

                                 JOHN
                        Come on, we gotta get you to bed.

           Izzy shakes her head.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Boogie man’s back, huh?

                                 IZZY
                        He doesn’t know to look in here.

                                 JOHN
                        Smart thinking. Okay, kisses?

           She kisses him, then he kisses her forehead as he did Pris.

                                 IZZY
                        Will you… keep an eye out for him?

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, COMMON ROOM - LATER

           John sits by the window in the dark, a resolute sentinel. 
           Remington 870 shotgun cradled in his arms, body wrapped in a 
           BULLET-PROOF VEST. Faded letters read, “LAPD: GANG UNIT.“

           He stares down, across the street at the only visible light, 
           a neon sign behind a security gate, “WE BUY GOLD. PAY YUAN.“

           John’s eyes tighten at the sound of an approaching vehicle.
           Sure enough, a car pulls up next to the building. 

           Two men get out, dressed in all black. 

           John tightens his grip on the gun.

           The guys enter John’s building.

           Believing it’s his worst fear realized, John moves to his 
           door. Eye to the peep-hole. Fish-eye of the hall.

           The men emerge from the stairwell, heading straight for John. 
           He presses the barrel of the shotgun against the door.

           Different guys than the thugs from outside the grey market. 
           They pull up bandannas as they near John’s door. 

           At the last moment, they turn, stopping at Carlos’ adjacent 
           door, and set to work with a professional lock-pick.

           John squints, wondering, “Who the hell are these guys?“

           Locks open, the men pocket their B&E tools, draw suppressed 
           Ruger MK III .22 pistols, and enter Carlos’ apartment.

           Once they’re inside, and Carlos’ door is loosely closed 
           behind them, John eases his open.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT COMPLEX, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           John slides up to Carlos’ door. Peers in through the crack - 
           GUNMAN 1 points out a photo of Carlos’ son to GUNMAN 2.

                                 GUNMAN 1
                        Check it.

                                 GUNMAN 2
                        Yeah, that’s him.

           They continue on to the bedroom door. Gunman 1 gives Gunman 2 
           a silent countdown. On “Three“ Gunman 2 kicks the door. WHAM!

                                 JOHN
                        Hey!

           The gunmen swing their pistols at John, but are blinded by the 
           flash of John’s tactical strobe light.

           A quick exchange of fire. PFFT!-PFFT!-BAM!-BAM! The whisper 
           of suppressed .22 overpowered by two pumps of 12ga 00 Buck.
           INT. U.N. COMMANDEERED LAPD STATION - MORNING

           “LAPD“ emblazoned everywhere, but the cops have been replaced 
           with militant UN Peacekeepers, many of them foreigners.

           John, heavy bags under his eyes, leans against the wall in 
           the main bullpen. Phone cradled between his ear and shoulder,  
           he rubs his wrists, still bearing cuff-marks. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hey… Yeah, I’m okay. Just getting 
                        out now… Free and clear, yeah. I’m 
                        sorry I couldn’t call yesterday, 
                        but I got lucky today. Dan 
                        Fitzpatrick recognized me… No, no 
                        ‘Handsome Dan’ was Dan Fritz, the 
                        rookie. Fitzpatrick’s the, uh…

           John looks over at DAN FITZPATRICK (40), standing beside him, 
           the ugliest Peacekeeper in the room.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Well, let’s just say he’s no 
                        Handsome Dan… 

           Dan flips John the bird. John cracks a smile.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Alright, I gotta go. Be home soon… 
                        Love you, too.

           John hangs up the wall phone.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Thanks Dan.

                                 DAN
                        Least I can do. How’s Pris and 
                        little Iz anyway? Y’all doing okay?

                                 JOHN
                        On the level? - I gotta find work.

                                 DAN
                        Y’know, you’re still my first call 
                        if anything here opens up.

                                 JOHN
                        I appreciate it.

                                 DAN
                        Hey, my sister in law, Gail - she 
                        just started at an employment 
                        office. Lemme give you the deets.
           Dan grabs a pen, jots it down, passes it to John.

                                 DAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll call ahead, make sure she gets 
                        you on the fast track.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks, Dan. Means a lot.

           John gazes at Dan’s note like it’s a winning lottery ticket.

           INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - LATER

           John sits, crammed into a packed waiting room. He puts the 
           final touches on an application affixed to a clipboard.

                                 GAIL (O.S.)
                        Mr. Alden?

           John glances up. GAIL FITZPATRICK (45), homely and impatient.

           INT. EMPLOYMENT OFFICE, GAIL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gail scans John’s application. He sits across from her.

                                 GAIL
                        Let’s see… Marine vet… Ex-Cop… 
                        Chinese speaker - Are you fluent?

                                 JOHN
                            [Subtitled Chinese]
                        [What would you like me to say?]

                                 GAIL
                        Perfect. I’ll log this in now, and 
                        we’ll call if there’s a match.

                                 JOHN
                        Dan kinda gave me the impression you 
                        might be able to speed things along?

                                 GAIL
                        Hun, this is Mach speed. See those?

           Gail points to a mountain of applications, floor to ceiling.

                                 GAIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m supposed to log them in first.
           EXT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT COMPLEX - NOON

           Two private security contractors slinging Kel-Tec SUB 2000 
           carbines stand guard beside an armored Land Rover.

           John eyes them suspiciously as he enters the building.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT COMPLEX, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           John traipses towards his door, slowing when he sees that 
           Carlos’ is wide open. He inches up. Peeks in. 

           The gunmens’ body’s are gone, but the bloodstains remain. 
           However, John’s more shocked to spot a third contractor.

           John nods politely to the armed man, then turns for his door.

                                 CARLOS (O.S.)
                        John! <My saviour!> Hold on!

           John glances back to find Carlos emerging from the bedroom, 
           not only unshaken, but ecstatic.

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        There’s someone I want you to meet.

                                 MICKEY (O.S.)
                        <Goddamn piece o’ shit!>

           Carlos shouts back into his bedroom.

                                 CARLOS
                        Michael, John’s here!

                                 MICKEY (O.S.)
                        Well, get him in here!

                                 JOHN
                        You sure? If you’re busy--

                                 CARLOS
                        --No, no, come in, come in.

           INT. CARLOS’ APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John enters just as MICHAEL “MICKEY“ COLUMBUS (35), Carlos’ 
           son, as pictured in the photo, rips a suitcase free from the 
           grasp of the closet’s top shelf. Arms raised, Mickey’s flashy, 
           waist-holstered Kimber 1911 sticks out under his suit jacket.

                                 MICKEY
                        <Fuck, Pa, cram it in good enough?>
                                 CARLOS
                        John, this is my son, Michael.

           Flamboyant in all mannerisms, Mickey slams the empty suitcase 
           onto the bed beside packed bags. John eyes them, curious.

                                 MICKEY
                        Mickey.

           Mickey extends his hand. John shakes cautiously, taking in the 
           spectacle that is Mickey - three piece suit, RED SHIRT, and a 
           medical face mask bouncing around his neck over a gold chain.

                                 MICKEY (CONT'D)
                        Christ, John, you look like shit. 
                        You eaten yet? Who am I kiddin’ - 
                        come on, I’m takin’ you out.

                                 JOHN
                        You know, I really should--

                                 MICKEY
                        --John - I insist.

           An invitation’s never sounded more threatening. Mickey breaks 
           the tension with a giant grin, and suddenly grabs Carlos in a 
           headlock. He playfully kisses the old man’s bald spot.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        <Seriously. I can’t tell ya how much 
                        this geezer means to me.> Change up 
                        and we’ll go. Pa, you in?

                                 CARLOS
                        No, no, you boys go ahead.

           EXT. FIAT RESTAURANT - LATER

           The same contractors guard the Land Rover outside a run-down 
           restaurant. John and Mickey dine on the balcony overhead. 

           INT./EXT. FIAT RESTAURANT, COVERED BALCONY - SAME

           Stained tablecloths, mismatched dishware, cutlery, and near-
           empty condiments attest to the far reach of urban decay.

           John shovels food as Mickey’s entrée lies largely untouched. 
           Mickey downs a pill with rusty water, and offers the bottle.

                                 MICKEY
                        Cipro?
           Mouth full, John waves him off.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        It’s crazy… Pa used to bring me 
                        here Saturdays as a kid, back when 
                        Ma worked weekends, bless her soul…

                                 JOHN
                        A lot’s changed.

           Beat, Mickey stares off into the distance, shakes his head.

                                 MICKEY
                        Hate to think what I’d’ve done had 
                        anythin’ happened to the old man.
                            (beat)
                        I’m takin’ him with me. Back to 
                        Hong Kong.

                                 JOHN
                        Can’t imagine what an exit visa 
                        costs these days--

                                 MICKEY
                        --Two-million USD.

                                 JOHN
                        Two?

                                 MICKEY
                        Two an’ change. Two covers his 
                        share of the national debt. The 
                        rest greases Chinese paper pushers. 

           Mickey grins, studying John to see if he’s as impressed by 
           Mickey as Mickey is with himself.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Ever think about gettin’ outta 
                        here? Starting over in China? 

                                 JOHN
                        Who doesn’t?

                                 MICKEY
                        You know, John, not just anyone 
                        could’a done what you did for my 
                        old man. I could use a guy like you 
                        watching my back. 

           Mickey passes John a folded contract. John opens it, reads.

                                 JOHN
                        You’d get me into China?  
                                 MICKEY
                        In exchange for a ‘term of service’ 
                        for me, and my organization.

                                 JOHN
                        You know I’m an ex-cop, right?

                                 MICKEY
                        You got skills, I got a use for ‘em.

           John eyes him, wary, as he wipes his hands clean, finished.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Look, I ain’t no gang banger, John. 
                        I’m just tryin’ to make a buck like 
                        anyone. Hong Kong’s Americatown is 
                        the Wild Wild East. Expats need guys 
                        like us to, ya know, protect ‘em. 

                                 JOHN
                        For a price.

                                 MICKEY
                        Name somethin’ that don’t have one.

           Mickey grins. Pulls out a fat envelope. Slides it to John. 
           His eyes devour the stack of high denomination yuan notes.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        No strings, just a thank you for 
                        what you did. I don’t need an  
                        answer now, think on it.

                                 JOHN
                        And my family?

                                 MICKEY
                        Plenty there to hold them over ‘til 
                        you’d be in the position to start 
                        sendin’ more back. In a couple 
                        years, you’ll be able to pay their 
                        way over. Same as I’m doin’ for Pa.

                                 JOHN
                        Two years?

                                 MICKEY
                        Two, three tops. Up to you. Over 
                        there, you set your own limits.

           A pregnant WAITRESS (18) slides up to the table, too chipper 
           for the black eye she’s sporting. Could be Izzy in ten years.
                                 WAITRESS
                        You fellas ready for dessert?

                                 MICKEY
                        Go ahead, get somethin’.

           John scans the dessert menu in the middle of the table. Half 
           of the items have been redacted with thick black marker.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll take the apple pie, thanks--

                                 MICKEY
                        --To go. An’ bring me the bill.

                                 WAITRESS
                        One apple pie, one bill, comin’ up!

           Mickey watches her go, shakes his head in disgust.

                                 MICKEY
                        My pa loves your little girl like 
                        his own grandkid… You got a shot at 
                        givin’ her somethin’ better.

           John stares at the contract, deliberating.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        We roll out at sundown.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, IZZY’S CLOSET - LATER

           Izzy hides in her closet, headphones on, nose buried in a 
           hardback copy of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.“

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Hello? Pris?

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, IZZY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John enters Izzy’s room, fork and doggie-bag in hand. He 
           moves for the closet, but two framed photos on her rickety 
           vanity catch his eye. He pauses to examine them.

           Homemade macaroni frames with “DAD“ written along the base in 
           crayon. John’s military portrait, and a candid snapped at his 
           police academy graduation, baby Izzy in his arms.

           John looks up from them to Izzy’s cracked vanity mirror only 
           to find himself confronted by an older, scruffier, less 
           dignified version of himself. He’s torn.
           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, IZZY’S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           The secret knock. Izzy replies. TAP-TAP. The door opens 
           revealing John, somber. He squats beside her.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey you, where’s Mom?

                                 IZZY
                        Asking Uncle Carlos for a can 
                        opener, but it’s taking long.

           John’s face twists at the thought of Pris over there with 
           Mickey. The smell of the pie lures Izzy’s gaze from her book.

                                 JOHN
                        Got you something.

           He slides a Styrofoam container out, pops it open.

           Izzy’s sunken eyes brighten at the sight of the apple pie.

                                 IZZY
                        For me?

           John nods, handing her the fork. She freezes, distressed.

                                 IZZY (CONT’D)
                        Mommy said we can’t afford restaurant 
                        food… Maybe you should take it back?

           John deflates, but forces a smile as he takes the fork from 
           her frail hand. He scoops up a bite, brings it to his nose.

                                 JOHN
                        But it smells so… mmmm.

           She gives in as he moves the food to her lips. Chews slower 
           than any child ever has, savoring it.

           John watches her, conflicted… deliberating. BZZZ-BZZZ. 

           He checks his phone, opens his mouth to apologize--

                                 IZZY
                        --It’s okay, you can take it.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, COMMON ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John answers his cell, stepping out of Izzy’s room.

                                 JOHN
                        Hello?
                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        John, it’s Gail. I’ve got something.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s terrific.

                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        It’s amazing. It usually takes 
                        weeks before we get a match.

                                 JOHN
                        What are we looking at?

                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        Part time. Every other Friday. Now, 
                        it is a full 8 hour day, but it’s 
                        broken up into two 4 hour shifts 
                        with a 4 hour break between.

           Long silent beat. John looks like he’s been sucker punched.

                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        What kind of position?

                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        Parking lot security, LAX.

           Sucker punch numero dos. John sighs.

                                 GAIL (V.O.)
                        Hun, I hate to say it, but ‘round 
                        here, vets and ex-cops are a dime a 
                        dozen. Now, I know you don’t have 
                        office experience per se, but, if 
                        you want me to fudge it on your 
                        app, we may be able to get you an 
                        interview at a Chinese language 
                        telemarketing or tech support--

           John lowers his cell, defeated. Finds himself staring across 
           the apartment into his open bedroom closet, black as a cave. 
           He looks over to Izzy’s, light pouring out. Then back to his.

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           John closes the blinds. Pulls a suitcase from his closet. 
           Places it on the bed. Lifts out a military duffel bag. 

           He fishes a small SAFE out of the duffel, checks that the 
           bedroom door’s closed, then unlocks it. 
           John removes a stack of small denomination yuan and his 
           passport. Lays them out across the duffel. 

           Turning back to the open safe, he pauses on a folder marked 
           “LAPD: GANG UNIT,“ Lots of memories here. Not all good ones.

           Everything’s stamped “CONFIDENTIAL“ and “TRIAD TASK FORCE.“

           Subfolders labelled with various Chinese names. 

           Dossiers on TRIAD GANGSTERS and INFORMANTS.

           Stake-out photos from LA’s Chinatown, pre-collapse. Snapshots 
           of undercover meeting between John and Triad informants.

           Finally, he finds what he’s looking for - a folder marked 
           “CHINA,“ and a subfolder labelled, “HONG KONG PD.“ 

                                 JOHN
                        Come on… Come on… Be here…

           John pulls out a wallet-size photo - an official department 
           portrait of a Chinese cop in full uniform. On the back, it’s 
           annotated “DET. LUO YONGHAO,“ and lists TWO PHONE NUMBERS.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Gotcha.

                                 PRIS (O.S.)
                        Man, that Mickey’s a creep, huh?

           John pockets the photo, and looks up just as Pris walks in. 
           She freezes at the sight of John’s deployment bag.

                                 PRIS (CONT’D)
                        What… what are you doing?

           She’s paralyzed, eyes locked on the duffel. John moves to 
           her, and firmly, but gently, turns her gaze to face his.

                                 JOHN
                        Baby, wait--

                                 PRIS
                        --What the hell’s going on, John?

                                 JOHN
                        Just look--

           John cuts her off, stuffing the yuan-filled envelope Mickey 
           gave him into her hand. She’s flabbergasted.

                                 PRIS
                        I don’t understand. Where did you?
                                 JOHN
                        Mickey. He’s offered to pay my 
                        share of the debt, Pris. He wants 
                        to hire me.

                                 PRIS
                        In China?

                                 JOHN
                        --You remember what I said the other 
                        night? This is the chance to make it 
                        happen. That’s enough cash to cover 
                        you until I get set up over there. 

                                 PRIS
                        It’s also enough to cover us while 
                        you look for a better job here.

                                 JOHN
                        Here? What about that little girl 
                        on the TV? You said it yourself, 
                        Pris, something’s gotta change.

                                 PRIS
                        And you’re gonna do that by 
                        becoming a gangster?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve got a friend over there, a 
                        cop. We used to trade case files. I 
                        trust him. If Mickey can get me 
                        into China, this guy can help. 

                                 PRIS
                        You mean get you into his gang?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a world I know.

                                 PRIS
                        I don’t like it.

           John sighs, taking a beat to get ready for one more push.

                                 JOHN
                        I can do this, but I need to be 
                        there to make it happen.

                                 PRIS
                        Well, you better think real hard 
                        about how you’re gonna tell Izzy.

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        Tell me what?
           John and Pris turn to find Izzy in the doorway. Awkward beat. 

                                 JOHN
                        Uncle Carlos and I are takin’ a trip.

                                 IZZY
                        Can I come?

                                 JOHN
                        Not yet. I’m gonna be real busy at 
                        first.

                                 IZZY
                        Like when you were a detective?

                                 JOHN
                        Kind of, but a little different.

           Pris glares at John, taking care that Izzy doesn’t notice.

                                 IZZY
                        So where are you going?

                                 JOHN
                        Hong Kong.

                                 IZZY
                        China!

                                 JOHN
                        The land of opportunity. And before 
                        you know it, you and Mommy’ll be 
                        there with me and Uncle Carlos, too.

                                 IZZY
                        So… if you’re going away, can I 
                        have a puppy to keep me company?

                                 JOHN
                        Tell you what, as soon as we’re 
                        back together, you get one. Okay?

                                 IZZY
                        You promise?

                                 JOHN
                        Pinky promise.

           They lock pinky fingers, shake. Izzy beams.

                                 IZZY
                        Wait, I wanna give you something!

           Izzy darts out of the room as suddenly as she appeared. John 
           turns to Pris. She stares daggers.
                                 PRIS
                        I’ll give you six months.

           Long, silent beat. Eyes locked.

           A tear streams down her cheek. The pitter-patter of footsteps.

           She wipes it as Izzy runs back in with the DOVE FIGURINES, and 
           HANDS ONE TO JOHN, her innocent face glowing.

                                 IZZY
                        For good luck. 

           INT. ALDEN FAMILY APARTMENT, COMMON ROOM - SUNSET

           Pris stands at the window. Izzy kneels on the window seat, 
           hugging a teddy bear costumed in a mock military jumpsuit. 
           John’s real Silver Star medal hangs pinned to its chest.

           Below, John signs Mickey’s contract on the hood of the car. 
           Mickey at his side. Carlos within. Security flanking them. 

           John shoulders his duffel bag, and looks up to the window. 

           Waves and blows a kiss. Carlos does the same.

           Izzy blows two kisses back, waves. 

           Pris fights back tears. 

           EXT. LAND ROVER - SHORTLY AFTER

           The Land Rover rumbles down eerily vacant Los Angeles 
           streets, rolling through stop lights. Two of the contractors 
           stand outside on the running boards, guns ready.

           INT. LAND ROVER - CONTINUOUS

           The third contractor drives. John rides shotgun. Mickey sits 
           with Carlos in the back. 

           John gazes out the window, torn with reservations as they 
           pass cardboard-collecting scavengers, crippled-veteran 
           beggars, and a burning car on the other side of the road.

                                 MICKEY
                        Ya doin’ the right thing, Johnny.

           John rests his head on the window, dark circles under his 
           eyes. Eyelids droop, then close as he falls asleep…

                                                      FADE TO BLACK.
           MONTAGE - JOHN EMIGRATES TO CHINA

           --The Land Rover passes an LAX checkpoint with machine gun 
           turrets manned by both US military and foreign UN troops.

           --Mickey shells out $4,000,000 USD (in $10,000 BILLS) to a US 
           Customs Agent at an “EXIT VISA“ checkpoint.

           --TSA agents wearing FULL RIOT GEAR colored the iconic TSA 
           blue monitor John as he passes through a naked-body scanner. 

           --An “Air China“ flight takes off over LAX. Runways empty of 
           US carriers. Instead, foreign planes and UN vehicles.

           --Hong Kong Airport’s IMMIGRATION LINES A LA ELLIS ISLAND.

           --Mickey pays off a Chinese immigration officer, prompting 
           John and Carlos to be ushered to the front of the line.

           --John steps up to a CHINESE IMMIGRATION REGISTER.

                                 IMMIGRATION REGISTER
                        [State your name.]

                                 MICKEY (V.O./PRE-LAPSE)
                        John… Johnny Boy…

           INT. MICKEY'S CADILLAC - AFTERNOON

           Mickey rides shotty. John dozes next to Carlos in the back. 
           FRANK BASS (25) a hustler, too serious for his age, drives. 

                                 MICKEY
                        …John!

           Mickey raps John’s knee. He jolts awake.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t wanna miss this.

           Mickey points to “Liberty Gate,“ the entrance to Hong Kong’s 
           “AMERICATOWN,“ built in homage to Lady Liberty’s crown. 

           Beyond - Vintage American cars. Coke and Pepsi neon signs. A 
           candy striped barber pole. Hotdog and pretzel stands. 
           Lampposts flying American flag banners.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Somethin’ else, eh, Pa?

           In contrast to Carlos’ jubilation, John eyes it cautiously. 
           It’s Americana, and it’s nostalgic, but it’s tainted by that 
           inescapable, dark, gritty undertone of American Chinatowns. 
                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Alright Johnny, Frank here’s gonna 
                        drop Pa an’ I off at my place, then 
                        you an’ him’ll go back to his. You 
                        two get to play roommates for now.

           Half-listening, John’s gaze locks on a family walking a dog. 
           He slides the dove figurine from his pocket, grips it.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re jet-lagged, but fuck 
                        that, there’s a thing tonight for 
                        the boss’ daughter, and we gotta 
                        show face. It’ll be good though, ya 
                        know, we’ll make sure you meet all 
                        the right folks.

           EXT. AMERICATOWN, HONG KONG - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey’s RED CADILLAC grows smaller below as Americatown’s 
           revealed to be an isolated ghetto in the belly of Hong Kong. 

           Perimeter barricades block cross-town traffic. Only way in or 
           out of this virtual prison is through “Liberty Gate.“

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, STAIRCASE - LATER

           John follows Frank up a steep stairway, down a narrow hall. 
           Oriental accents in the design. Peeling Chinese wallpaper. 

                                 JOHN
                        Been workin’ for Mickey long?

           Frank stops just before his door at the end of the hall. He 
           signals for John to wait, and to be quiet. John tenses.

           Frank's hand inches towards the doorknob. Just as his 
           fingertips touch it - an explosion of barking. Frank grins.

                                 FRANK
                        Every goddamn time. Come on in.

           INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Frank scoops up his bulldog, SMEDLEY, and nuzzles him. John 
           frowns as he surveys the glorified closet, crammed with a 
           jury-rigged weight-lifting set and a dingy mattress.

                                 FRANK
                        This is it. Mi casa, su casa. And  
                        Mickey? - Two years. 
           Frank notes the military markings on John’s duffel bag as he 
           sets Smedley down.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You served?

                                 JOHN
                        Force Recon. PSYOP support. 

                                 FRANK
                        Messing with people’s heads, eh?

                                 JOHN
                        Something like that. You?

           Frank strips off his shirt revealing a massive USMC tattoo 
           spotted with still healing bullet scars.

                                 FRANK
                        Infantry.

                                 JOHN
                        Those beauty marks look fresh.

           Frank slides on a white dress shirt from his closet.

                                 FRANK
                        Sears Boys. Punks from one of the 
                        other expat syndies. Fuckin’ Mickey 
                        knows how to rile ‘em up good.

                                 JOHN
                        Comes with the territory, no?

                                 FRANK
                        Sure. But Mickey? - He’s got making 
                        enemies down to an art… Those guys 
                        you bumped in his pop’s flat? Sears 
                        called it in.

           A beat as John considers the potential implications. Like a 
           shark drawn to blood, Frank registers it as weakness, probes.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mickey, said you were a cop… This 
                        must be a total mindfuck, huh?

           John, realizing he’s being tested, reasserts his confidence.

                                 JOHN
                        Eh, two sides of the same coin. You 
                        heard of Chinese proverbs?

           Frank raises an eyebrow, skeptical.
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Corruption’s like a river’s  
                        current. Fight against it, you 
                        drown. Do nothing, you get pushed 
                        around. But swim with it, and you’ll 
                        go farther than you ever dreamed.

           Frank smiles. John’s his kind of guy after all. John grins in 
           turn, but drops the charade when Frank returns to the closet. 
           John holds up his cell - he’s getting almost full reception.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Not even one friggin’ bar…

                                 FRANK
                        Try the roof. We got a few mins.

           EXT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           John crests the fire escape, hops onto the roof. The Hong 
           Kong skyline and flashy Chinese billboards pulse with an 
           energy long absent from Los Angeles. Phone to his ear, John 
           takes it all in with cautious optimism.

                                 PRIS VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                        This is Priscilla, leave a message.

           BEEP. In his other hand, John fingers the dove figurine. 

                                 JOHN
                        Pris, hey, it’s me. I got in okay. 
                        I know you can’t call me here with 
                        our plan, so I’ll try again soon. 
                        I’m still getting my bearings, but 
                        I… I got a good feeling about this. 
                        Tell Izzy I say hi. Miss you both 
                        and love you.

           John pockets the dove, trading it for the photo of Chinese 
           Det. Luo Yonghao. He dials the first number on the back.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        [Hello?]

           Lots of background noise on the other end.

                                 JOHN
                        [Luo, hey, it’s Detective Alden, 
                        John Alden, from Los Angeles.]

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        Oh my God, John? Is that really 
                        you? It’s great to hear your voice. 
                                 JOHN
                        You, too, Luo. You, too.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        It’s been so long, I wondered if… 
                        Are you still in LA?

                                 JOHN
                        Hong Kong. Was hoping to meet up.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        You’re kidding! Americatown?

                                 JOHN
                        What are you, a detective or 
                        something?

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        Listen, I’m out with the family 
                        right now, but come by my office 
                        tomorrow. You free in the morning? 

           INT. MICKEY'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

           Uncomfortable silence. John sits in the back. Frank drives. A 
           sweaty, nervous Mickey rides shotty carrying a large box 
           wrapped with a ridiculous, OVERSIZED RED BOW.

           John gazes ahead at a regal, urban townhouse. The gem of the 
           block, not a single broken window.

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Caddy pulls up to the curb between classic American 
           muscle cars and a pristine Bentley, all shades of RED. Young 
           WARNER SOLDIERS acting as valets open the mens’ doors.

           Mickey wipes the sweat from his brow with a red handkerchief 
           as the four approach the house, almost drops the box.

                                 JOHN
                        Beautiful. You wrap it yourself?

                                 MICKEY
                        Funny. Now, if you know what’s 
                        good, you’ll keep your mouth shut 
                        an’ jus’ follow my lead.

           Weird. John’s never seen Mickey like this. Super tense. 
           Almost like he’s a different person. 

           At the door, Warner soldiers pat down John and Frank.
           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, MAIN FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           A butler collects Mickey’s gift as he, John, and Frank enter 
           the crowd of WARNER SYNDICATE MEMBERS.

           John stares in awe, not at the expensive furniture, Persian 
           rugs, and vaulted ceilings, but at the massive collection of 
           FRAMED BULLION COINS. GOLD and SILVER. ANCIENT and MODERN.

                                 MICKEY
                        Come on.

           Following Mickey past large french doors looking in on a 
           stately office, John eyes two older men in suits, arguing - 
           NOAH WARNER (65) and THOMAS WARNER (60). Both sport RED TIES. 

                                 FRANK
                            (whispering)
                        Boss man, Noah, and his brother, 
                        Thomas. Sleeping beauty’s Noah’s 
                        daughter, Hannah, birthday girl.

           Between them - HANNAH WARNER SINCLAIR (30). Wheelchair-bound, 
           expressionless, a ruby-studded tiara sparkles above her empty, 
           glassy eyes. Paralyzed. A gold coin hangs from her neck. 

           Approaching the kitchen, John notes the pattern of the senior 
           men wearing red, open-necked shirts, or suits with red ties.

                                 JOHN
                        Guess I should’a worn red? 

                                 FRANK
                        Ties for the boss and his counsel. 
                        Shirts, like Mickey, captains. 

                                 JOHN
                        But not us?

                                 FRANK
                        Soldiers don’t fly colors. S’where 
                        we differ from, like, the Bloods 
                        and Crips. I.E. You only somebody--

                                 JOHN
                        --Through association. Got it.

           Mickey glances back over his shoulder.

                                 MICKEY
                        I.E. Keep my ass alive, or you’re 
                        dead in the water.

           Which might be funny, if only Mickey wasn’t so damn nervous.
           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mickey, John, and Frank enter the designer kitchen where 
           several WARNER CAPTAINS stand gathered around OLIVER “OLLIE“ 
           SINCLAIR (30), a greasy devil in a vest with a RED TIE.

                                 OLLIE
                        …He better hope it ain’t true - 
                        losing Casablanca’s not something 
                        Noah’d just overlook--

                                 MICKEY
                        --What about Casablanca?

           Ollie grins, only just now noticing Mickey.

                                 OLLIE
                        Speak of the devil.

           Ollie looks John up and down.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s this? Run out of locals 
                        crazy enough to work with you?

           The Warner captains snicker. Mickey shifts uncomfortably.

                                 MICKEY
                        This is the guy who saved my pa.

                                 OLLIE
                        Ah, your old man, right. Sears were 
                        smart, diverting you like that.

           Beat. All eyes on Mickey, awaiting his response as he 
           struggles to suppress his temper, fire in his eyes.

                                 MICKEY
                        I appreciate your concern.

                                 OLLIE
                        Easy, Mickey, I’m just saying it’s 
                        nice you can find time for a 
                        vacation, you know, when your 
                        revenue base is defecting faster 
                        than CIA spooks. Which brings me 
                        back to Casablanca…

           The Warner captains chuckle again. Mickey, usually quick to 
           respond, wavers, tongue tied. Ollie turns serious.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        My two cents? Stem the tide before 
                        you get swept out with it.
           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mickey bursts out the front door, John and Frank in tow. 

                                 MICKEY
                        That fuckin’ shifty motherfucker, 
                        fuckin’ threatenin’ me…

           John looks to Frank, like, “Who the hell was that guy?“

                                 FRANK
                        Ollie - Noah’s son-in-law.

           Mickey cuts off an eager valet before the kid can speak.

                                 MICKEY
                        Just give me my fuckin’ keys.

           INT. MICKEY'S CADILLAC - SHORTLY AFTER

           The guys sit in the Caddy at a red light, just a ways from 
           Casablanca, a tacky, American diner, the kind of place where 
           adventurous Chinese families go to eat “American food.“

                                 MICKEY
                        You gotta be shitting me…

           Mickey fumes as two fat men in green shirts, SEARS CAPTAINS, 
           and two SEARS SOLDIERS exit, and take off in a GREEN LOWRIDER.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Time to earn your keep, boys.

           John doesn’t like the sound of that.

           INT. “CASABLANCA“ DINER, DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A temple to Americana. The jukebox pumps American classics. 
           Walls bleed American pop-art. License plates from all 50 
           states tile the ceiling. Patriotic knickknacks everywhere. 
           Mickey storms into the joint, John and Frank on his heels.

           Manager and host, SAMMY (50), bulging out of a white dinner 
           jacket, tries to cover his initial caught-with-his-pants-down 
           reaction with a casual greeting.

                                 SAMMY
                        Mickey, hey, good to--

           WHAM! Frank doubles Sammy over with a gut punch. Shocked 
           gasps roll through the packed dining room.
           INT. “CASABLANCA“ DINER, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Mickey and Frank shove Sammy into the kitchen. The expat 
           kitchen staff scatters. John follows, keeping his distance.

           Frank draws his Sig P226 pistol, holding Sammy at bay. Mickey 
           dangles an empty cash box, furious.

                                 MICKEY
                        Where’s my money, Sammy? 

                                 SAMMY
                        Look, I’m sorry, Mickey, but the 
                        Sears Boys… Come on, you saw ‘em.

                                 MICKEY
                        No, no, whatever money you gave 
                        them is theirs. Where’s my money?

                                 SAMMY
                        Gave? They stole it, Mickey. Same as 
                        you do! How’s it on me if they 
                        decide this place is theirs? 

           Sammy laughs in disbelief, but Mickey’s not amused.

                                 SAMMY (CONT’D)
                        You’re actually mad at me over this?

           Mickey looks at him like, “Why the fuck wouldn’t I be?“

                                 SAMMY (CONT’D)
                        Protection money? There’s a reason 
                        they call it that. You supposed to--

                                 MICKEY
                        --Yeah, and who the fuck died and 
                        made you Merriam Webster?

                                 JOHN
                        Mickey, he’s right. If we got beef, 
                        it’s with those Sears guys, not him.

           Mickey goes silent, smiles. He draws his Kimber 1911, and 
           offers it to John by the barrel. Sammy’s eyes go wide.

                                 MICKEY
                        Take it.

           Tense Beat. John refuses. Mickey holds it outstretched.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        John, the gun… 
           Frank flashes a look at John, “Don’t make this any worse.“

                                 JOHN
                        If it’s the money you want, lets go 
                        get it. I’m down. Let’s roll.

                                 MICKEY
                        What I want, John, is for you to 
                        shoot Sammy, here, in the head.

                                 JOHN
                        No. Not happening.

           Wooden, Mickey takes a proper grip on his pistol, then points 
           to a “White House“ souvenir snow globe on a nearby shelf.

           Frank grabs it, and passes it to Mickey. Sammy looks at the 
           glass orb, gulps. Mickey levels his gun at Sammy’s face. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Open your mouth.

           Mickey cocks back his pistol’s hammer. CLICK. Sammy gives in. 

           The snow globe barely fits. Scratches against Sammy’s teeth.

           Mickey chuckles. Suddenly swings at Sammy’s mouth. 

           Sammy flinches. Mickey stops an inch away. 

           Mickey busts up laughing. Frank mimics his amusement, uneasy.

           Mickey presses the pistol’s barrel into Sammy’s brow.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move a fuckin’ muscle.

           With his free hand, Mickey reaches out, and WINDS UP THE TURN 
           KEY IN THE BASE OF THE SNOW GLOBE. When he let’s go, it 
           emanates a tinny instrumental of The Star-Spangled Banner.

           Mickey sways his head to the music. Frank forces a chuckle. 
           Tears stream down Sammy’s face. John remains detached.

           Suddenly - BAM! Mickey shoots Sammy THROUGH THE SNOW GLOBE.

           He drops like a sack of potatoes. 

           Mickey locks eyes with John.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Americatown.

           On the floor, water, glass, and blood leak from Sammy’s head.   
           INT. HKPD HEADQUARTERS, LUO’S OFFICE - LATE MORNING

           John, worse for wear, sits across from DET. LUO YONGHAO (50), 
           the man from the photo. Luo’s German Shepherd lies nearby.

                                 JOHN
                        […Literally, a USD’s only worth it’s 
                        BTUs. Everyone’s carrying yuan now.]

                                 LUO
                        [I still have a hard time wrapping 
                        my head around it.]

           Luo’s German Shepherd whines, begging for food. Luo pretends 
           to shoot it with a finger pistol.

                                 LUO (CONT’D)
                        Bang.

           The dog plays dead. Luo tosses it some breakfast leftovers as 
           John notes Luo’s bulletin board - a web of news clippings and 
           mug shots surround the larger photos of two TRIAD BOSSES. 

                                 JOHN
                        [Uncle Song and Uncle Huang coming 
                        up in the world?]

                                 LUO
                        [A lot’s changed here, too.] 
                            (beat)
                        So what can I do? You got a place? 
                        You need help with a job?

                                 JOHN
                        Actually, I’ve got a proposal.

                                 LUO
                        Of course you do.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re familiar with the Warners?

                                 LUO
                        Christ, John, are you serious?

                                 JOHN
                        No other option for getting here.

                                 LUO
                        How long’s your contract?

                                 JOHN
                        Just as long as it takes you to get 
                        me into witness protection.
                                 LUO
                        John, I can’t ask you to do that.

                                 JOHN
                        No? Who better than me to feed you 
                        intel on the expats?

                                 LUO
                        I hear you, but it’s a bad time--

                                 JOHN
                        --Luo--

                                 LUO
                        --I’ll help you find other work-- 

                                 JOHN
                        --What do you stand to lose?

           Beat. Luo’s torn over whether or not to tell John something.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        What? Tell me.

                                 LUO
                        Have they made you do anything yet? 

                                 JOHN
                        Dunno - am I working for you?

                                 LUO
                        Give me time. Just lay low for now? 

           Beat. John can’t believe Luo’s not jumping at this. 

                                 LUO (CONT’D)
                        Look, they’re not like the Triads, 
                        John, these guys don’t understand 
                        balance, honor - they’re animals. 
                        Last night three Warners barged 
                        into a packed restaurant and just - 
                        BAM - shot the owner dead.

           BZZZ-BZZZ. John checks his cell. Text from Mickey. 

                                 JOHN
                        Any leads?

           Luo shakes his head.

           John reads the text - “California Blvd. & Maine Dr. ASAP.“

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Shit, I gotta run.
           EXT. “HOME SUITE HOME“ FURNITURE STORE - SHORTLY AFTER

           The corner of California Blvd. & Maine Dr. - Chinese street 
           signs stenciled over with spray paint in English. 

           John pays an expat cab driver, turns to face the Home Suite 
           Home furniture store. Mickey, Frank, and Carlos are lounging 
           in the display window bedroom set. Mickey waves John in.

           INT. “HOME SUITE HOME“ FURNITURE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           John climbs up on the window display stage, back to the glass. 
           Mickey and Carlos sit on the bed. Frank dozes on the loveseat.

                                 MICKEY
                        Whaddya think, Johnny? Think 
                        this’ll help the old man slay ‘em?
                            (off Carlos’ stink eye)
                        Don’t give me that. You don’t know 
                        the shit you say when you’re asleep.

           Frank chuckles along with Carlos. John remains detached.

           Outside, visible through the glass wall, a van slows. 

           The side door slides back, revealing the Sears Boys, strapped 
           with AK-47 assault rifles. BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!-BAM!

           They light up the store front. No warning. Instant chaos.

           Mickey shields his father. Blasts back with his 1911. 

           Frank flips a bureau. Fires his P226 from cover.

           The guys are outgunned. Only a matter of time.

           It’s like shooting fish through a fish bowl.

           Pedestrians shredded in the crossfire.

           Unarmed, John’s pinned behind a steel support column between 
           the display windows. Bullets whiz by from both directions.

           A burst of 7.62×39mm rounds splits Frank’s left thigh open. 

           His P226 skitters across the floor - half-way to John.

           John looks up, searching the wall. Spots something.

           He lunges for Frank’s gun. Grabs it.

           Rolls. Aims BAM! BAM! BAM!
           John shoots out the GEAR BOX controlling the display window’s 
           security gate - A HEAVY, GARAGE-STYLE DOOR CRASHES DOWN.

           Bullets pockmark the metal, but don’t penetrate. The AK-47 
           gunfire ceases. Tires squeal as the Sears tear off.  

           Mickey keeps firing even after the makeshift shield’s in 
           place. Reloads. Empties it again. Totally irrational.

           Mickey’s okay. Carlos has a few scratches, but Frank’s barely 
           alive, bleeding out through his blown open thigh. 

           John grabs loose bedding, pounces on Frank’s gushing wound.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Those motherfuckers want war, I’ll 
                        give ‘em a fuckin’ war!

           Mickey’s gaze lands on John, shredding sheets for bandages.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You. You’re gonna do it.

           John hears, but is too busy trying to save Frank’s life.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        You fuck this up like you choked at 
                        Casablanca, an’ you can forget 
                        about ever seein’ your fam--

                                 CARLOS
                        --Michael--

                                 MICKEY
                        --You’ll kill ‘em all. Swear on it!

           John pulls car keys from Frank’s coat. Tosses them to Mickey.

                                 JOHN
                        Pull it around front, hurry.

                                 MICKEY
                        Tell me you’ll do it.

                                 JOHN
                        Goddamnit, Mickey, Frank’s dying!

                                 MICKEY
                        Swear it!

                                 JOHN
                        Yes, Christ, I’ll do it, just go!

           John binds Frank’s wounds with torn sheets as Mickey exits.
                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Hang in there, Frankie, come on--

                                 FRANK
                        --Pink Burger…

                                 JOHN
                        Say that again?

                                 FRANK
                        The burger joint. After last time, 
                        I tailed ‘em, the Sears, for weeks--
                            (coughs up blood)
                        --but I pussied out… Drive-thru 
                        every night. Fuckin’ fat bastards.

           INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER

           John rummages through the closet. Pulls out an M16 rifle with 
           a 100 round drum. Smedley pulls at his pant leg, whining.

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t worry, he’ll be home soon.

           John lays the M16 on the mattress beside his old LAPD body 
           armor, Frank’s Sig P226, and extra mags. He’s skeptical.

           John rests his head against the window, thinking. 

           He gazes across the street - an Americatown Fireworks shop. 
           July 4th sale on their “WARCHEST: Fireworks Finale-in-a-Box.“ 

           Light bulb moment. He dials his cell.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        [Hello?]

                                 JOHN
                        [Luo, I need a favor.]

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        [Please tell me you had nothing to 
                        do with that mess at the furniture 
                        store…]

                                 JOHN
                        Two unmarked cars, two to three 
                        officers each, on standby in the 
                        Pink Burger parking lot tonight.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        The Sears Boys’ hangout? Jesus…
                                 JOHN
                        I need this.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        John, put yourself in my shoes.

                                 JOHN
                        Just in case.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        Just in case what?

                                 JOHN
                        After all the intel we’ve swapped, 
                        you can’t just trust me?

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        We were both cops then.

           Beat. That stings. Luo backtracks, softens his tone.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        [Fine, but just this once.]

           EXT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Two unmarked HKPD cruisers stake-out the “Pink Burger“ 
           parking lot. Quiet night at the all-pork patty eatery.

           INT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           John sips coffee at a table positioned to give him the best 
           view of the drive-thru entrance. Sunglasses on. Zip-up Lakers 
           hoodie with the hood up. He checks his cell for the time.

           Anxious, he pockets the phone, and resumes fiddling with the 
           END OF A WICK poking out above the hoodie’s zipper. 

           In front of him, the dove figurine lies beside a LIGHTER. 
           Beneath the table, a ‘pot belly’… something under his hoodie.

           EXT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           The Sears Boys’ green lowrider pulls into the parking lot. 

           INT. UNMARKED HKPD CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           One cop nudges his dozing partner, points to the lowrider.
           INT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           John watches as the Sears Boys’ lowrider cruises right by his 
           window, feeding into the drive-thru track. 

           As they disappear around the back, John looks to the CCTVs 
           behind the front counter by the pick-up window.

           Three camera feeds chart the Sears Boys’ progression.

           Camera 1 - the Sears Boys pull up to the order menu. 

           John pulls down his hoodie’s zipper a bit more.

           Camera 2 - the car pulls up to the pay window.

           Cradling his payload, John hops up, supporting his faux pot 
           belly with one hand. The other hand reaches for his pocket.

           He moves up to the counter, eyes glued to the CCTV’s. An 
           expat PINK BURGER CASHIER eyes him, leery. 

                                 PINK BURGER CASHIER
                        Hi… May I take your order?

           As the Sears approach the pick-up window, John moves behind 
           the counter. A Chinese PINK BURGER MANAGER steps to block him.

                                 PINK BURGER MANAGER
                        [Sir, you can’t--]

           John shoves the barrel of Frank’s pistol into the man’s face. 

           INT. UNMARKED HKPD CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           The HKPD OFFICER behind the wheel eyes the lowrider as it 
           pulls up to the pick-up window, yawns. 

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [What a waste of time.]

           Suddenly, through the windshield, they watch as THE WARCHEST 
           (Fireworks-in-a-Box), wrapped with SMOKE BOMBS and duct tape, 
           sails out of the pick-up window and LANDS IN THE LOWRIDER.

           The officers startle, eyes wide as… 

           EXT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           The lowrider, BILLOWING MULTI-COLORED SMOKE, lurches forward. 

           Blindly roars across the lot. 
           SLAMS INTO A PARKED CAR.

           INT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           John darts for the exit. Glances out the window when he hears 
           the crash - THE LOWRIDER’S QUICKLY ENGULFED BY THICK SMOKE.

           EXT. “PINK BURGER“ FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           The click of doors opening. The Sears Boys stumble out of the 
           lowrider, pistols drawn. Blinded by the smoke, coughing.

           Weapons raised, the officers surround the smoke cloud.

           Press closer. Both groups blind to one another.

           The Sears Boys emerge through the smoke.

           Suddenly face-to-face with the cops.

           Guns aimed at each other.

           Long tense stand-off.

           POP! POP! POP! - THE FIREWORKS ERUPT WITHIN THE LOWRIDER. 

           Both groups react as if the other fired the first shot.

           A chorus of gunshots and exploding fireworks.

           John sprints off in the background.

           When the shooting finally stops, the Sears Boys are dead. 

           EXT. “TWO-BY-TWO“ VETERINARY CLINIC - MORNING

           Mickey’s Caddy sits parked in front of Two-By-Two, a run-
           down, Americatown animal clinic with Noah’s Ark motif murals. 

           INT. “TWO-BY-TWO“ VETERINARY CLINIC, STAFF LOUNGE - SAME

           John stumbles into the staff lounge. Frank’s asleep on the 
           couch, properly bandaged, I.V. in place. Mickey’s watching a 
           newscast about the “Pink Burger“ shootout.

           Mickey jumps up, and bro-hugs a slightly shell-shocked John.
                                 MICKEY
                        You’re a fuckin’ genius, Johnny 
                        Boy. I dunno how the hell you 
                        pulled that off, but god damn-- 

                                 JOHN
                        --How’s Frank?

                                 MICKEY
                        Fine, fine, but seriously, what you 
                        did - the police got no clue, and 
                        the fuckin’ Sears’ think the pigs 
                        set ‘em up! It’s perfect.

           Through glass, John spots Carlos down the hall chatting up a 
           pretty young nurse, his minor bumps and bruises patched up.

                                 JOHN
                        Carlos looks good.

                                 MICKEY
                        Shit, the vet told him to go home 
                        hours ago, but the old horndog’s 
                        been chasing tail all night.

           Mickey turns solemn. Something he has to get off his chest.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, about Casablanca--

           To his relief, he’s cut off by his obnoxious ringtone.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Hello?… Yeah… Yeah, he’s right here.

           His enthusiasm fades. Total tonal shift.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Just him?… No, no problem… Of 
                        course. He’ll be waiting.

           Mickey hangs up. Looks to John.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Boss man’s sending a car for you. 

                                 JOHN
                        Is that a good thing?

           Mickey shrugs. Not the reassurance John was looking for.
           INT. NOAH’S BENTLEY - SHORTLY AFTER

           John sits in the back of Noah’s Bentley, directly behind 
           Noah’s brother, stone-faced Thomas. One soldier drives, a 
           second, young, FRECKLED SOLDIER sits beside John. 

           Awkward silence. The freckled soldier feels compelled to 
           break it. He whispers to John.

                                 FRECKLED SOLDIER
                        Everyone’s talking about what you 
                        did, you know, with the drive-thru.

           John looks the kid over, unsure of how to respond.

                                 FRECKLED SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        It’s cool to meet you.

           Via the rear-view, Thomas glares at the freckled soldier.

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, ROOFTOP GARDEN - SHORTLY AFTER

           Warner soldiers, armed with KRISS Vector submachine guns 
           loosely concealed under long coats, eye the street below from 
           the four corners of an expansive garden. Veggies, fruit trees. 

           Noah culls rotten apples. Hannah, shielded by a cherry red 
           sun-hat, sits at a nearby table in her wheelchair, 
           expressionless as before. A butler escorts John towards them.

                                 NOAH
                        John? Noah Warner.

           Noah removes his gloves, greeting John, then reaches for the 
           pitcher of sangria on the table where Hannah sits.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s an honor, sir.

                                 NOAH
                        Please-- 

           Noah gestures for John to sit, and pours two glasses. Joining 
           John at the table, they sit on opposite sides of Hannah. Noah 
           notes John staring at her gold coin necklace.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        ‘86 Eagle. First year minted. My 
                        first buy. Gold fever after that.

                                 JOHN
                        Not a bad hobby.
                                 NOAH
                        Cost $340 bucks back then. Bartered 
                        ten just like it for this place 
                        when I first landed.

                                 JOHN
                        Every crisis is an opportunity.

                                 NOAH
                        Which brings me to why you’re here. 
                        I’ve been monitoring the escalation 
                        between Mickey and the Sears Boys 
                        for some time. In my opinion, what 
                        you’ve pulled off is nothing short 
                        of a miracle…

           Noah lets it hang there, studying John.

                                 JOHN
                        You see ‘suicide by cop,’ as many 
                        times as I have, you realize that 
                        sometimes the answer’s just a gun 
                        pointed in the wrong direction.

                                 NOAH
                        And the cops?

                                 JOHN
                        Anonymous tip.

           Beat, Noah considers it, then pulls a manila folder from the 
           back pocket of Hannah’s wheelchair. He delicately lays it on 
           the table. Face off. Hannah framed between them.

                                 NOAH
                        Picking your brain, as an ex-cop, 
                        what’s the preferred term - is it 
                        ‘rat’? ‘Snitch’? ‘Informant’? 

           Tense beat. John’s heart skips one.

                                 JOHN
                        Depends.

           Noah slides the manila folder towards John. 

                                 NOAH
                        Well, whatever you call it…

           Noah Nods. John opens the manila folder. Slides out photos, 
           much like those from his police days. A snapshot of Ollie.

                                 JOHN
                        Your son in law?
           A weight lifted from John, realizing he’s in the clear. Noah 
           puts his hand over Hannah’s, covering her wedding ring.

                                 NOAH
                        Mickey’s explained your situation 
                        to me. Handle this as well as you 
                        tidied his mess, and I’ll bring 
                        your family over, simple as that.

           John freezes as he flips to the next photo - IT’S OLLIE WITH 
           DET. LUO YONGHAO. The weight crashes back down, tenfold.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        They meet in the main courtyard of 
                        the Botanical Gardens every Sunday - 
                        tomorrow. I want it public. I want 
                        it brutal. I want to send a message. 
                        Afterwards, you’ll find me here--

           Noah hands John a business card for “THREE-BALL“ billiards.

                                 JOHN
                        And by ‘handle this’ you mean--

                                 NOAH
                        --Both of them.

           Beat. John’s eyes glued to the picture of his friend. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        This stays strictly between us. No 
                        one else can know, not even Mickey.

           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT - LATER

           John wipes vomit from his mouth as he flushes the toilet. His 
           cell’s on the sink top. 4 Missed calls. Another incoming.

           John gives in, answering. Says nothing.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        [I can hear you breathing you son 
                        of a bitch.] “Two cars… Just in 
                        case…“ [You couldn’t have given me 
                        any more of a heads up? My boss is 
                        breathing down my neck wanting to 
                        know where that ‘hot tip’ came 
                        from. What the hell am I supposed 
                        to tell them, John?]

                                 JOHN
                        Tell them it came from Ollie.
           Dead silence on the other end of the line.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You should’ve told me, Luo.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        How?

                                 JOHN
                        You mean who told me you already 
                        had a mole in the Warners?

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        Dammit, you know how these things 
                        work. I told you not to get involved.

                                 JOHN
                        Noah Warner. 

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        Christ…

                                 JOHN
                        On the plus side, if I kill you, he’s 
                        promised to bring my family over.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        If you’re willing to testify to 
                        that, I can pull you out now. 
                        Witness protection, the works.

                                 JOHN
                        And my family?
                            (beat)
                        I don’t see a clean way outta this.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        We need to bring Ollie into the 
                        loop. Put our heads together. Sort 
                        it out. Maybe he knows something.

                                 JOHN
                        Alright.

                                 LUO (V.O.)
                        I’ll text you a safehouse address 
                        and the cover name I use with him.

           EXT. HKPD SAFEHOUSE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           A classy part of Hong Kong, far removed from Americatown’s 
           grime. The only expats on this block are cabbies and doormen.
                                 OLLIE (V.O./PRE-LAPSE)
                        I’m not trying to sound like an 
                        asshole here, but I don’t see how 
                        this changes our plans other than 
                        by speeding up the time frame…

           INT. HKPD SAFEHOUSE, DINING ROOM - SAME

           John, Luo, and Ollie sit around the dining room table. A mess 
           of American food take-out containers, cigarette butts, and 
           empty bottles. Luo’s German Shepherd sits by Luo’s side.

                                 OLLIE
                            (to Luo)
                        …I’m still gonna give you Noah, and 
                        you’re still gonna get what you 
                        need. 
                            (to John)
                        I mean, it’s not like you’re going 
                        to kill us…

           John’s grip tightens around the dove figurine in his hand.

                                 LUO
                        John’s the only reason we’re not 
                        dead tomorrow--

                                 OLLIE
                        --Yeah, but--

                                 LUO
                        --I pull you out now, that’s a 
                        death sentence on his wife and kid.
                            (beat)
                        Nobody’s getting left out to dry.

           Back to square one. Blank faces all around.

           Luo’s German Shepherd whines, begging Luo for food. 

           John watches as Luo pretends to shoot the dog, finger pistol.

                                 LUO (CONT’D)
                        Bang.

           The dog plays dead, then gets a treat. John’s eyes light up.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s it… 

           Luo and Ollie look to John. 

           He points finger pistols at them. Mouths, “Bang. Bang.“
                                 LUO
                        Stage it, then play dead long enough 
                        for Noah to make good on his word.

                                 JOHN
                        And once they’re here--

                                 OLLIE
                        --Police arrest Noah--

                                 LUO
                        --And I put both your families into 
                        witness protection. 

                                 OLLIE
                        Fucking brilliant.

                                 JOHN
                        Do we have enough time?

                                 LUO
                        It’ll take me all night, but… I 
                        think so. You two camp out.

           EXT. HKPD SAFEHOUSE, BALCONY - LATER

           John stands on the balcony, ringing cell to his ear. Behind 
           him, inside, Ollie surfs the web on a computer. 

           In John’s free hand, he fingers the dove figurine.

                                 PRIS VOICEMAIL (V.O.)
                        This is Priscilla, leave a message.

                                 JOHN
                        Pris, hey, me again. Just saw your 
                        email, but wanted to try you by 
                        phone. I got some news… How do I 
                        say this without jinxing it…? 

           A faint tapping noise draws John’s eyes to the sliding door 
           behind him. Luo’s German Shepherd paws the glass. John smiles.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        …I think it’s okay to tell Izzy to 
                        start brainstorming names for a dog.

           John turns to face the beautiful Hong Kong skyline… much 
           closer and brighter now compared to the view when he last 
           called. So close, he can almost touch it.
           INT. HKPD SAFEHOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

           John stumbles into the kitchen, bleary-eyed, lured by his 
           nose. Ollie’s cooking breakfast. Frozen bacon and just-add-
           water pancakes. He serves up two plates.

                                 OLLIE
                        Grab a seat.

                                 JOHN
                        Any word from Luo?

           Ollie serves John, then takes a seat across the table.

                                 OLLIE
                        I owe you an apology. Last night. I 
                        didn’t mean to be… insensitive.

                                 JOHN
                        Water under the bridge.

           Ollie manages a weak smile, digs in. After a few bites, he 
           realizes John still hasn’t picked up his fork.

                                 OLLIE
                        Second thoughts?

                                 JOHN
                        You’ve known Noah for some time?

                                 OLLIE
                        We pull this off today, your 
                        family’ll be here tomorrow. You 
                        don’t have to worry about that.

           Another awkward beat, still something on his mind.

                                 JOHN
                        What happened? If you don’t mind--

                                 OLLIE
                        --To make me stab him in the back?

           John nods. Ollie rubs his wedding ring.

                                 OLLIE (CONT’D)
                        Hannah wasn’t always like she is 
                        now. A few years back, Noah made a 
                        push into the neighboring Triad’s 
                        turf. One thing lead to another… 
                        she caught a bullet meant for him.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry.
                                 OLLIE
                        I don’t blame him for that - I’m as 
                        guilty as him. What I blame him for, 
                        is for making me sit on my hands.

                                 JOHN
                        But going against the Triads--

                                 OLLIE
                        --Would’ve been suicide, yeah, but 
                        that was then, and this is now. 

                                 JOHN
                        The difference?

                                 OLLIE
                        Noah wasn’t wrong to expand, just 
                        wrong to go it alone. Thomas, on the 
                        other hand, understands this.

                                 JOHN
                        Noah’s brother…

                                 OLLIE
                        He’s gonna unify the expats, and 
                        take on the Triads in a big way. 
                        Noah’s the last obstacle.

                                 JOHN
                        You think they’d stand a chance?

                                 OLLIE
                        Hell, I’m willing to find out. The 
                        neighboring Triad boss died three 
                        months back. Local elders are 
                        divided now between these two guys, 
                        Song and Huang. It’s getting ugly.

                                 JOHN
                        Uncle Song and Uncle Huang?

                                 OLLIE
                        They’re why Luo’s giving Thomas a 
                        free pass. Americatown bullshit’s 
                        nothing compared to warring Triads, 
                        especially if it goes regional.

                                 JOHN
                        Lou’s shepherding the expat merger 
                        to give the Triads a common enemy--

                                 OLLIE
                        --The enemy of my enemy is my 
                        friend.
           CLUNK. The dead bolt flips over. Both men whip their heads 
           toward the front door. Hands reach for their holsters.

           Just Luo. Large black duffel bag in hand.

                                 LUO
                        Easy boys.

                                 JOHN
                        We good?

                                 LUO
                        Golden.

           Luo plops the bag onto the counter. Pulls out a BLANK GUN and 
           two SQUIB VESTS rigged with tiny explosives and blood packs.

           Luo points out the complex wiring on the vests.

                                 LUO (CONT’D)
                        Audio-activated squibs. Blanks set 
                        ‘em off sequentially.

           Ollie handles the very realistic blank gun.

                                 OLLIE
                        And you’re sure there’s just blanks 
                        in this thing?

           INT. SUZUKI MINI-TRUCK - DAY

           John gazes out at the happy Chinese families touring the 
           gardens from behind the wheel of a “[Zoological and Botanical 
           Gardens]“ mini-truck.

           Disguised in a gardener’s uniform, he blends in seamlessly 
           with the exclusively expat garden staff.

           His attention sharpens as Luo and Ollie converge in the 
           crowded courtyard, dead ahead.

           John lets them talk, theater for the security cameras.

           Dons a neoprene face mask. Draws the BLANK GUN. 

           EXT. ZOOLOGICAL AND BOTANICAL GARDENS - CONTINUOUS

           The mini-truck putters to life. Rolls towards the crowded 
           courtyard. Slows as it nears Luo and Ollie. Window lowers.

           Eye contact with Luo and Ollie. Luo nods. John opens fire.
           BAM! BAM! The loud “pop“ of the simulated gunshots trigger 
           the audio-activated BLOOD SQUIBS on Ollie and Luo’s vests. 

           Three “shots“ into each. Matching blood bursts.

           The crowd flees in an expanding circle.

           Ollie and Luo drop, playing dead.

           John hits the gas. Go time.

           By all appearances, John just gunned them down in cold blood.

           Nearby, an OFF-DUTY COP, touring the gardens with his wife, 
           draws a concealed Kahr PM9 pistol and EMPTIES HIS MAGAZINE.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! John’s windshield spiderwebs. He swerves. 

           Fish tails. Brakes. Stops adjacent to the line of fire.

           BAM! BAM! BAM! The truck’s flank absorbs the shots.

           John rolls for cover out the other side.

           Ends up face-to-face with Luo. 

                                 LUO
                        [Who the fuck is that?]

           Luo remains motionless, still feigning dead.

                                 JOHN
                        How should I know?!

           The off-duty cop reloads. Flashes a badge.

                                 OFF-DUTY COP
                        [Hong Kong Police, freeze!]

           BAM!-PFF!--BAM!-PFF! Tires deflate.

                                 LUO
                        What do we do?

           John fires blanks, a bid to buy time.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know.

           The off-duty cop presses closer.

           BAM! A bullet nicks John’s arm.

           He ducks behind the truck.
           BAM! He’s pinned. Folds.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        [Wait, wait, wait--]

           Suddenly - BOOM! A shot from a rifle echoes across the park. 

           The off-duty cop’s neck explodes, spinning him.

           He staggers. BOOM! A chest hit drops him.

           Luo and Ollie can’t help but react - A LAPSE IN PLAYING DEAD 
           AS THEY, LIKE JOHN, TURN HEADS TOWARD THE MYSTERY SNIPER.

           Across the way, MICKEY LIES IN THE BUSHES, staring down the 
           scope of a Remington 700 SPS Tactical sniper rifle.

           No way the guys can see it’s him, but through the scope, 
           MICKEY CAN CLEARLY SEE LUO AND OLLIE MOVING… “STILL ALIVE.“ 

           Ollie looks to Luo.

                                 OLLIE
                        Noah must’ve sent--

           BOOM! The side of Ollie’s head erupts. 

           Luo looks to John - BOOM! 

           Luo’s skull craters. 

           BOOM! BOOM! John watches in horror as Mickey puts one more 
           round into each - LUO AND OLLIE ARE NOW ACTUALLY DEAD.

           Two uniformed cops approaching behind John open fire. 

           ZING! A bullet ricochets of the truck. John bolts. 

           In the distance, Mickey ditches his gun, flees.

           John sprints across the bridge over the gondola canal. Cops 
           beat feet after him. Tourists scream. Flee.

           John disappears into an alley between greenhouses.

           Bolts down another alley, makes a quick turn.

           A cop slips behind him, loses seconds.

           The other plows on. Gains on John.

           John darts into the rose garden.

           Knocks over two tourists.
           Drops his shoulder. Demolishes a fence.

           The cops jump the fallen tourists.

           Duck through the fence hole.

           John splashes into a shallow hydroponics pond. Looks back.

           The trailing cop stops running. Fires off a wild shot.

           John dives underwater. Takes cover under vegetation.

           He swims. Bullets streak through the water.

           The cops jump into the pond behind him.

           John surfaces at the other side. 

           Fires blanks. BAM!-BAM!--CLICK.

           The cops duck underwater.

           John rolls over the edge of the pond. Slides down a steep 
           embankment. Tumbles into the middle of a service road.

           A large garden truck swerves around him. Brakes squeal.

           An EXPAT GARDENER on a dirt bike stops beside John.

                                 EXPAT GARDENER
                        Jesus, you alright?

           EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           BRAAAP-BRAAAAAAAP! John wheelies out of a Botanical Gardens 
           service road on the dirt bike. Bursts onto the city streets.

           Slaloms the approaching column of HKPD cruisers. 

           Three HKPD motorcycles U-turn after him.

           John blasts between a pair of busses.

           Veers back into the proper lane.

           HKPD bikes quickly catch up.

           Surround John. Pinch in. A foot away on either side and rear.

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [Stop the bike!]

           Red light ahead. John throttles into the intersection. 
           Traffic blocks his path. He swerves. Wobbles.

           Recovers - aimed straight at a gas station.

           He cuts narrowly between the pumps.

           Zips into the alley behind.

           HKPD bikes on his tail.

           Vacant alley. The cops open fire from their bikes.

           John leans hard. Cuts into another alley.

           A busy four lane street dead ahead.

           An open park on the other side.

           John grits his teeth.

           Full throttle.

           BRAAAP-BRAAAAAAAP! John guns it across the street.

           One of the cops nails a car. Flips over the hood.

           Brakes squeal. Cars pile up on either side.

           John’s bike goes airborne into the park.

           The two other cops follow suit.

           Engines scream as RPMs spike.

           One of the cops loses control as soon as he hits the grass.

           Falls off the back. Motorcycle wrecks a drinking fountain.

           John steers for rough turf - the dirt bike’s strength.

           The remaining cop follows. Struggles with the bumps.

           Edge of the park. John rips down a set of stairs.

           Cruisers approaching from down the street.

           Incoming helicopter just ahead.

           John jumps onto the sidewalk. 

           Pedestrians flee.

                                 JOHN
                        [Get out of the way!]
           John clips the corner of an EXPAT STREET VENDOR’s table. 

           Pirated DVDs spill out across the sidewalk.

                                 EXPAT STREET VENDOR
                        Asshole!

           The motorcycle cop behind John opens fire.

           John swerves across the street.

           The helicopter buzzes by.

           T-intersection ahead.

           A shopping mall.

           Open doors.

           John revs.

           INT. CHINESE MALL - CONTINUOUS

           The roar of the dirt bike echoes through the building.

           The motorcycle cop follows him in. Still shooting.

           Runs out of ammo. Reholsters. Accelerates.

           Neck and neck with John. Bumps him.

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [Pull over!]

           A fountain straight ahead.

           John bumps the cop back.

           At the last moment they swerve opposite directions.

           The cop careens towards a storefront. 

           Jumps off the motorcycle.

           WHAM! It wrecks hard. 

           EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           John zips back onto the street. An army of HKPD inbound.

           A tunnel under Victoria Harbour just ahead.
           A race for the tunnel mouth.

           John gets there first. 

           Swerves between cars, intentionally triggering a pile up.

           Cops blocked by the wreckage in his wake.

           John disappears down the dark tunnel.

           INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           John zooms up behind a pickup truck with a tailgate net.

           Leaps off the bike. Grabs the net. Climbs into the bed. 

           The driver looks back through the rear window. John’s already 
           got the blank gun pointed at the back of his head.

                                 JOHN
                        [Don’t stop.]

           EXT. “THREE-BALL“ BILLIARDS - NIGHT

           Overcast skies. Thunder. John, forlorn, sits in a cab, idling 
           across the street from Noah’s Bentley and Mickey’s Caddy.

           The two cars sit parked below red neon lights that spell out 
           “THREE-BALL“ in the same font as the business card Noah gave 
           John. The RED #3 BALL LOGO glows like an Eye of Providence.

           John’s thousand-yard stare reaches out to a happy Chinese 
           couple and their daughter at a nearby ice cream stand. 

           An expat serves them. The father hands his daughter a cone.

           RAP-RAP-RAP. The EXPAT CABBIE taps the Plexiglas divider.

                                 EXPAT CABBIE
                        Buddy. Hey buddy… This is it, 
                        right? This is what you wanted?

           John can’t take his eyes off the family.

           INT. “THREE-BALL“ BILLIARDS, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Warner captains and soldiers fill the pool hall. The freckled 
           soldier from Noah’s Bentley points out John to his posse as 
           John trudges in. They raise their drinks in a show of respect.

           Mickey spots John from the bar, a deer in the headlights.
                                 MICKEY
                        Hey, hey. There he is. Where the 
                        fuck you been?

           John merely nods his head in recognition.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        So we’re even now, huh?

           John doesn’t follow.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Come on, don’t pretend like you’re 
                        not impressed…

                                 JOHN
                        That was y--

                                 MICKEY
                        --Headshot!

           Beat. Mickey doesn’t get John’s forsaken tone.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Damn, cheer up, son, you still get 
                        full cred. Far as Noah’s concerned 
                        you’re golden, you did your bid.

           John forces a smile.

                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Thatta boy. Let’s go on up.

           INT. “THREE-BALL“ BILLIARDS, NOAH’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Mahogany furniture. Romantic Era art. John Martin’s “The 
           Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,“ hangs over a palatial 
           desk between additional displays of GOLD AND SILVER BULLION. 

           Mickey escorts John in to find Noah and Thomas in the middle 
           of an 8-Ball game. Hannah sits silently in the corner. 

           Noah runs the table. Thomas grimaces.

                                 NOAH
                        Rack ‘em.

           Noah slings the rack at Thomas, then turns to John. Behind 
           his back, Thomas’ eyes flash with contempt.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        John, what are you drinking?
                                 JOHN
                        Whatever you’re having, thanks.

                                 NOAH
                        Mickey, thanks for bringing him up.

           Mickey doesn’t take the hint.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        If you wouldn’t mind…

           Noah gestures to the door. Slighted, Mickey exits, but shares 
           a conspiratorial glance with Thomas as he does - a look 
           unseen by John and Noah. 

           Noah pours John a scotch. Tops off his own. Toasts.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        To new friends.

                                 JOHN
                        New friends.

           John takes it all in. Numerous photos of Noah at Americatown 
           ribbon-cutting ceremonies. Thomas always in the background.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Impressive office.

                                 NOAH
                        Keep it up, you’ll have your own 
                        soon enough.

           John manages a smile. Almost looks authentic.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        I owe you an apology, John.

           Thomas’ ears perk as if Noah’s never before used these words.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Knowing the nature of your previous 
                        work, I had to consider that, maybe 
                        what happened with the Sears was 
                        more than just luck. 

                                 JOHN
                        No harm, no foul. Hate to think 
                        what that off-duty hero would’a 
                        done if Mickey hadn’t been there.

                                 NOAH
                        Well, one thing’s for sure - I don’t 
                        have to worry about you anymore.
           John forces another smile. Noah passes him a paper.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        The itinerary for your wife and 
                        daughter. Everything’s in order, 
                        but you might want to give them a 
                        heads up before the car arrives to 
                        take them to LAX, or whatever 
                        they’re calling it these days.

           John stares at the itinerary like it’s a death sentence.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know what to say.

                                 NOAH
                        Thomas’ll be there tomorrow to meet 
                        them at immigration, and personally 
                        guarantee their safe entry.

           Noah smiles. John’s at a loss for words.

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        Call your wife. Pick up a couple 
                        suits, and some nice shirts, while 
                        you’re at it.

           Noah winks, passing an envelope of yuan as they shake hands. 

                                 NOAH (CONT’D)
                        You’re part of the family now.

           INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - LATER

           Frank reads the Bible in bed with Smedley. Propped up on 
           pillows, heavily bandaged, but the color back in his face.

           Suddenly an explosion of barking from Smedley. Frank looks 
           over to the door as a weary John enters, cell in hand.

                                 JOHN
                        Frank, hey, how you feeling?

                                 FRANK
                        Better than you look, Cap’n.
                            (off John’s confusion)
                        Mickey told me. It’s great news. 

                                 JOHN
                        Oh… Oh, the shirt thing, yeah.

           John checks himself in the mirror. He does look like shit.
                                 FRANK
                        “The shirt thing,“ Pfff. You kill 
                        me, man. You’re set. You’re in for 
                        life, bro.

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry, been a long day is all.

                                 FRANK
                        Nah, I’m jus’ playin’. Probably a 
                        little jealous too, but, seriously, 
                        congrats. And thank you, for what 
                        you did for me. I owe you one. 

           John notices Frank’s bible.

                                 JOHN
                        Some light reading?

                                 FRANK
                        Shit, I’m tellin’ you, John, I’ve 
                        had too many close calls. Thinkin’ 
                        it’s better to lay it all out there 
                        now, and make amends--

                                 JOHN
                        --before it’s too late…

                                 FRANK
                        Amen.
                            (off John’s cell phone)
                        You let ‘em know yet?

           It takes John a second before he remembers the cell in hand.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t let me hold you up.

           EXT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

           Alone, John gazes out at the Hong Kong skyline, clouded by a 
           thick fog. Phone to his ear, ringing. Dove figurine in hand.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        Hey.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        I’ve been on pins and needles since 
                        your last message. What was that? I 
                        couldn’t bring myself to tell Iz.
                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said 
                        anything.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        So…?

                                 JOHN
                        You’ll be here tomorrow night.
                            (off Pris’ silence)
                        There’s a car coming to pick you 
                        and Iz up in an hour.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        How?

                                 JOHN
                        My friend. We made a deal. It all 
                        just kind of followed from there. 

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        And who’s paying our share of the 
                        national debt?

           John looks at the dove figurine, deliberating.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                        The Chinese. They’re willing to pay 
                        if the informant’s worth it. 

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        Worth it? You just got there--

                                 JOHN
                        --I know… just a hair shy of six 
                        months.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        John. You know I didn’t…

                                 JOHN
                        Can I talk to Iz?

           Silent beat.

                                 PRIS (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, John. I was wrong.

           John winces, tears welling in the corners of his eyes.
           INT. LUXURY DEPARTMENT STORE - MORNING

           Wealthy Chinese shoppers. Expat salesmen. A tailor’s pedestal. 
           John stands atop it in a three piece suit and red shirt. 

           Swarmed by expat tailors. Beset by mirrors. Barraged by his 
           reflection. John metamorphoses into Pris’ worst nightmare.

           He stares into the mirrors with the same disconnect he  
           experienced looking at his old photos in Izzy’s room.

           By the expression on John’s face, the tailors may as well be 
           measuring him for a coffin.

           BZZZ-BZZZ. Mickey. 

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, wha--

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        --Whatever the fuck you’re doing, 
                        drop it now.

                                 JOHN
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I need you at the hospital--

                                 JOHN
                        --Which hospital?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Noah. He’s unconscious. Maybe 
                        poisoned. He’s in an ambulance.

                                 JOHN
                        Where?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I’ll text you the address. Just 
                        meet me there. 

                                 JOHN
                        On it.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        John.

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Hurry.
           EXT. HOSPITAL - SHORTLY AFTER

           John jumps out of a cab. Pushes through a crowd of Chinese 
           pedestrians towards the hospital entrance.

           INT. HOSPITAL, 5TH FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           John exits the elevator. Hustles past Chinese doctors and 
           nurses. Approaches a CHINESE NURSE at the nurses’ station.

                                 JOHN
                        [I’m looking for Noah Warner - I 
                        was told he’s on this floor.]

           The name doesn’t register.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        [A white man… about 65 years old… 
                        would’ve just checked in--]

                                 CHINESE NURSE
                        [--Room 505. End of the hall.]

           John bolts down the hall, sizing up the scene as he goes. 
           Doctors and nurses, the standard layout.

           Room 505. John gazes in through a tiny window. 

           Inside, the privacy curtain’s drawn. 

           INT. HOSPITAL, ROOM 505 - CONTINUOUS

           John pokes his head in. A typical hospital room.

                                 JOHN
                        Mickey?… Noah?

           John moves to the privacy curtain, opens it. Eyes go wide.

           Noah’s blood-spattered body. Multiple stab wounds. 

           Long beat. John’s heart skips. He’s frozen.

           Commotion behind him. John glances back.

           HKPD COPS rush the nurses’ station. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           He lunges for the door. Closes and locks it. Pulls the shade.
           Grabs a chair. Props it up under the door handle.

           Disappears behind the privacy curtain. 

           Checks the outside window. 

           Five stories below, HKPD cruisers surround the entrance. Red 
           lights flashing. Overhead, storm clouds gathering.

           The door shudders. Handle rattles against the chair.

           BZZZ-BZZZ. Unknown caller, but John knows who.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Thomas.

                                 THOMAS (V.O.)
                        Sorry, John, but with Oliver 
                        unavailable to testify, this was 
                        the best alternative.

                                 CHINESE POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        [Police! Open the door!]

                                 JOHN
                        The Triads will eat you alive.

                                 THOMAS (V.O.)
                        Told you about that, did he?

                                 JOHN
                        They’ll kill you, and then they’ll 
                        tear down everything Noah built.

                                 THOMAS (V.O.)
                            (John hit a nerve)
                        “Everything Noah built?“

           THUMP! THUMP! The cops pound the door.

                                 CHINESE POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                        [You’re surrounded! Open up!]

                                 THOMAS (V.O.)
                        Let me explain how this works, 
                        John. You’re going to surrender to 
                        the police, confess to killing 
                        Noah, Ollie, and that undercover 
                        cop, and then you’re going to keep 
                        your mouth shut. Forever.

           THUMP! THUMP!
                                 JOHN
                        How about I find you, and then I 
                        slit your throat?

                                 THOMAS (V.O.)
                        I beg your pardon, John, but you’ll 
                        excuse me - I have an insurance 
                        policy to pick up at the airport.

           John snaps his cell shut. Checks the time. Fuck. Pockets it.

           He disconnects Noah’s oxygen tank. Sets it against the door.

           John shoves Noah off of the gurney. THUD. 

           THUMP! THUMP! Cops shoulder the door.

           John flips the gurney onto its side.

           Barricades himself. Raises his gun.

           Aims at the high-pressure tank.

           INT. HOSPITAL, 5TH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           BOOM! The exploding oxygen tank blows the door off its hinges. 

           Cops fly backwards across the floor, alive but stunned. 

           John darts into the hallway under a hail of debris.

           Emergency lights pulse through the dust.

           Everyone’s coughing, squinting.

           Doctors and nurses scatter.

           The fire alarm wails.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Thunder rumbles. HKPD cruisers surround the hospital 
           entrance. Chinese cops everywhere. 

           John exits, head and hands wrapped in gauze. 

           Passes through the line of cops.

           Disappears down the subway.
           I/E. SUBWAY - CONTINUOUS

           John pushes through hordes of Chinese commuters. Unwinds his 
           “bandages“ with one hand. Dials his cell with the other.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        ‘Sup?

                                 JOHN
                        Has anyone else contacted you?

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        Has anyone contacted you? Tried to 
                        tell you anything about me?

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JOHN
                        Frank, listen to me. I’m calling in 
                        that favor.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Anything.

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever Thomas or Mickey might try 
                        to tell you about me’s a lie. I 
                        need you to trust me--

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        --Hold on--

                                 JOHN
                        --I’m coming by for my passport, 
                        ammo, and I need you to have a car 
                        waiting. I don’t care how you do 
                        it, just do it, but keep the 
                        Warners out of it.

           John jumps the subway turnstile. A security guard shouts.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        What’s going--?

                                 JOHN
                        --Noah’s dead, Frank. Thomas is 
                        trying to pin it on me--

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        --Noah?
           John’s eyes dart from sign to sign. Security guard in pursuit. 

                                 JOHN
                        Look, I need get to my family at 
                        the airport before Thomas does.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Then what?

                                 JOHN
                        Cause a scene, get them deported. 
                        Anything to get them out of here. 

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Jesus, John, that’s fu--

                                 JOHN
                        --I can figure it out from there. 
                        So long as Tommy doesn’t have them.

           The train ahead chimes for departure. Security’s closing in.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        You’re the only one I trust, Frank. 
                        Anyone else calls you, you haven’t 
                        heard from me. Got it? 

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        I dunno about this, John.

           John dives into the train. Doors snap shut. The security guard 
           pounds the window. Chinese commuters back away from John.

                                 JOHN
                        Swear on it!

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        Alright, alright.

                                 JOHN
                        Now do it.

           John snaps the cell shut, checks the time.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Goddamnit… 

           EXT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DUSK

           John emerges from the subway into a torrential downpour. 
           Sprints through puddles across the street for Frank’s place. 

           Cars swerve. Slam brakes. Slide. Honk.
           INT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           John runs up the staircase, dripping wet, breathing heavy. 

           Treads down the claustrophobic corridor, pistol in hand. 

           Creeps towards Frank’s door at the end of the hall. 

           Reaches for the doorknob. Stops. Hears something.

           John puts his ear to the door. Listens.

           Smedley’s whining, scratching something. John doesn’t like it. 

           He takes cover against the wall beside the door. Wraps his 
           fingers around the doorknob - no barking.

                                 JOHN
                        Frank? Frank, you there?

           He tightens his grip on the pistol… deep breath.

           WHAM! John kicks the door open. 

           BAM!-BAM!-BAM! Bullets tear through the door. Full-auto.

           John sidesteps. Returns fire through the solid wood.

           John never sees the gunman. Just shoots and prays. 

           A brutal exchange. Nowhere to take solid cover. 

           His assailant returns fire through the wall.

           John ducks and weaves as he shoots back.

           Powderized drywall fills the air.

           Wooden support beams splinter.

           BAM!-BAM!-BAM!--CLICK. 

           John runs out of ammo the same time the gunfire on the other 
           side of the wall falls silent.

           Long beat. The sound of his mystery assailant staggering, 
           then collapsing inside the room.

           John draws his Ka-Bar blade. Inches towards the door.

           Pushes the door open, knife raised.
           INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           John lowers his knife. Staggers in, bruised, bloodstained, 
           new clothes in tatters.

                                 JOHN
                        Frank…

           Frank, slouched against his dresser, wet with blood. M16 rifle 
           with 100 round drum at his side. Floor littered with brass.

           Two gunshots, center mass. Frank’s dead.

           Smedley whimpers inside the closet.

           John reaches for his cell. A bullet hole through his pocket. 
           Fragments of his phone within.

           He grabs Frank’s off the dresser. Checks the time.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           John scans the recent calls.

           Two calls logged with Mickey. One INCOMING right before John 
           called Frank, one OUTGOING right after John and Frank spoke.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You stupid sonovabitch…

           John glares at Frank. A flash of lightning. Thunder rumbles.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You stupid, fucking sonovabitch!

           EXT. FRANK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Pouring outside. John bolts from the apartment building. Runs 
           directly into the middle of the rain-slicked street. 

           An oncoming Chevelle SS 454 skids to a halt. 

           John draws his gun on the driver.

                                 JOHN
                        Out of the car! Now!

           John rips the door open. Drags the driver out. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Out! Out! Let’s go! Move it!
           EXT. HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The Chevelle tears through the airport drop-off loop.

           Weaves between cars. 

           Roars past a cop. 

           INT. CHEVELLE SS 454 - CONTINUOUS

           John’s swerves like a mad man. Rain pelts the windshield. 

                                 JOHN
                        Come on… Come on…

           He scans the curb for an opening. Spots one. 

           Cuts off a car. Causes an accident.

           Drives up onto the curb. 

           EXT. HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           John snatches the vintage “Team Chevelle“ leather bomber 
           jacket from the passenger seat, moves to exit. 

           Jumps out, car running. Sprints for the airport doors.

           Cars stuck behind the accident pound their horns. 

           An HKPD OFFICER blasts his whistle.

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [You, stop! Hey!]

           INT. HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM! John explodes through a rotating door, and into the 
           crowd of expat bag handlers and affluent Chinese travelers. 

           The chinese cop’s on his heels, whistle blasting.

           John scrambles to pull on the bomber jacket.

           Nearby cops take note, join the pursuit.

           One shouts into his radio for backup.

                                 HKPD OFFICER 2
                        [Positive ID on the hospital 
                        killer! Baggage claim, Terminal 7!]
           John glances aside. Reinforcements in riot gear bearing AK-47s 
           swarm into the terminal through a service door.

           John strains to sprint even faster. Almost drops his pistol.

           He transfers it from his waistline to his jacket pocket. 

                                 HKPD OFFICER 3
                        [He’s got a gun!]

           John fakes right, then cuts left for the escalator.

           Jumps up, slides down the center divider.

           Hits the floor running. 

           Behind, the cops hit a wall of people at the escalators.

           John disappears into the crowd below. 

           Slows to match their pace. 

           Puts on the aviators. 

           Pops his collar.

           His eyes dart as cops flood into the room from all angles. 

           Big screen TVs everywhere boast security cam images of John’s 
           face as he entered the hospital next to video footage of his 
           escape under the title, “[MURDER SUSPECT AT LARGE].“

           John moves to the glass wall fencing in the immigration 
           quarters. Lines of Americans a la Ellis Island.

           He desperately scans the faces.

           A cop spots John. Whispers into his radio. Draws his gun. 

           John suddenly freezes, hands pressed against the glass. 

           The cop edges closer through the scattering crowd.

           John watches through the glass as Thomas and his entourage 
           escort Pris and Izzy past the Chinese Registrar.

                                 JOHN
                        Pris! Izzy!

           John beats the glass, but to no avail. They don’t notice.

           Clutching her teddy bear, Izzy turns her head John’s way, but 
           at the last second, Pris grabs her hand and pulls her along.
           The blood drains from John’s face. He watches, powerless, as 
           Pris and Izzy disappear out of sight with Thomas.

           Behind John, cops circle in tighter, AK-47s trained on him.

           John sees the cops advancing in a reflection off the glass. 

           Pulls the P226 from the jacket pocket. Cops stop cold.

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [Drop your weapon!]

           All arms trained on John, save for his own.

           John looks over his shoulder, then back to the cops - if they 
           shoot now, they’ll be firing into the lines of immigrants.

                                 HKPD OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        [There’s no way out.]

           John puts his gun to his head. Barrel to his temple.

                                 JOHN
                        [Don’t come any closer!]

           John cocks back the hammer. CLICK. 

           Cops’ fingers tighten around their triggers. 

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [Easy now, just put down your gun.]

           Long tense beat, then John slowly lowers his weapon.

                                 JOHN
                        [Okay… Okay…]

           BAM! John shoots the corner of the glass pane behind him. 

           The panel shatters into a thousand pieces. 

           He dives through the rain of glass.

           The cops aim, but can’t shoot - hundreds of immigrants beyond 
           John, directly in the line of fire.

                                 HKPD OFFICER
                        [Everybody down! Get on the floor!]

           John plows through the lines of terrified immigrants.

           The officers bottle-neck through the shattered pane.

           John bursts free from the crowd on the other side.
           Behind him, the mass of cops struggles to push through the 
           immigrants, desperate not to lose their place in line.

           John lunges for the emergency exit.

           EXT. HONG KONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

           John bursts out of the terminal. Roaring jets, sheets of rain. 

           He dashes past expat bag handlers and runway personnel.

           Narrowly leaps onto the back of a passing fuel truck. 

           Cops pour out of the building, weapons raised. 

           They scan the area. Too dark, too hectic. 

           People and vehicles everywhere. 

           Moving into the distance, John watches from the fuel truck.

           In vain, the cops halt the closest baggage carrier. Surround 
           it. Raid the individual containers.

           EXT. MARSHLANDS - SHORTLY AFTER

           John hops off the fuel truck as it coasts along the foggy 
           wetlands at the edge of the airport tarmac, reminiscent of 
           the infamous New Jersey Meadowlands.

           He wades into the tall grass. Rain only a sprinkle now. Gazes 
           back at the airport’s flashing lights, a broken man.

           RING-RING. Frank's cell. John answers.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Yo, Dickhead, what happened to you 
                        callin’ me when you was done?

                                 JOHN
                        You son of a bitch.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        John?… Shit--

                                 JOHN
                        --You’re fuckin’ dead to me, Mickey. 

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        What do you want me to say?
                                 JOHN
                        Listen, I didn’t kill Noah. Thomas--

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        --I know.

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        He gave me a tie.

                                 JOHN
                        After what I’ve done for you… for 
                        your father…

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry, it ain’t personal it’s--

                                 JOHN
                        --just business. Right.

                                 MICKEY (V.O.)
                        Johnny--

           John snaps the phone shut, and staggers into the marshland. 
           Behind him, the roar of jet engines as a plane blasts by.

           EXT. HOUSE OF BLUES BAR - LATER

           American style bar basked in blue. Banners welcome, “HAPPY 
           4TH OF JULY!“ The bouncer greets a gangster in a blue shirt. 

           Nearby, teens set off firecrackers, run through puddles, 
           trampling a tattered red shirt, discarded on the sidewalk.

           INT. HOUSE OF BLUES BAR - SAME

           An expat syndicate joint. Blue captains and soldiers dominate 
           the crowd. Beers, darts, good times.

           John nurses whiskey at the bar. Bomber jacket still on. Only 
           a stained beater underneath. The TV drones behind him.

                        the long-established Triads…

           John pulls the photo of Det. Luo from his wallet.
                                 HONG KONG NEWSCASTER (TV) (CONT’D)
                        …our source says that concealing 
                        the detective's true identity is 
                        essential in order to protect his 
                        past informants.]

           Light bulb moment. John glances around. Spots a pay phone. 

           He clambers to his feet, slaps a handful of yuan onto the 
           bar, scrambles for the phone. 

           John desperately flips through the phone book. Scans.

           Innumerable entries for “LUO YONGHAO.“ Shit.

           He checks Luo’s photo for the second phone number scrawled on 
           the back. Compares it against those in the phone book. Match.

           John whips out Frank’s cell, snaps a photo of Luo’s address.

           Back at the bar, the shattered remains of the dove figurine 
           linger beside John’s empty glass.

           EXT. DET. LUO’S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN

           Upper middle class. Manicured lawns. Quiet streets. A cab 
           idles beside the sidewalk, out of place.

           INT. CAB - SAME

           Meter ticking. An excessive fare. The expat driver’s head 
           nods, on the verge of dozing off.

           John sits in the back. Bloodshot eyes locked on a house just 
           around the corner.

           His gaze narrows as the house’s front door opens.

           Luo’s wife and daughter exit, dressed for a funeral. Nearly 
           the same ages as Pris and Izzy.

           Luo’s wife helps the girl into the minivan in the driveway.

           EXT. LUO’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           John sneaks around to the back door of the garage. 

           Reaches for the door knob. Locked.

           He checks to make sure no one’s watching, then slides a 
           homemade pick into the lock. 
           INT. LUO’S HOUSE, GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           John opens the door. Pockets his pick tool. Slides inside.

           Treads around to the side of a grey Volkswagen Santana. 

           Luo’s German Shepard barks from inside the house.

           INT. LUO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John tiptoes into the house. Pistol at the ready.

           Creeps further in. The dogs’s barks ever louder.

           John nears the kitchen. Suddenly - WHAM! 

           The dog lurches in its crate. 

           John swings his aim at it.

           The big dog bares teeth. Barks ferociously.

                                 JOHN
                        [Easy boy.]

           John grabs a handful of dog treats from a box on the counter. 
           Tosses them into the crate. The big dog settles.

           EXT. LUO’S HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - SAME

           The minivan pulls back into the driveway. 

           Luo’s little girl hops out.

           INT. LUO’S HOUSE - SAME

           John slinks down a long hallway. Framed pictures of Luo’s 
           family, much like John’s family photos back in LA.

           CLUNK. The front door’s dead bolt flips. 

           John ducks into the bathroom. 

           Cocks back his pistol’s hammer.

           Luo’s daughter enters, eyes wet with tears. 

           John peeks around the door frame, spots her as she pauses by 
           the kitchen, confused by her dog’s loud munching.

           She looks around, hesitates, then brushes it off, moves on. 
           Passes right by John, disappears into the master bedroom.

           Moments later, she emerges with Luo’s HKPD uniform hat. 

           A momentary break in John’s tough guy visage.

           She moves back past him, none the wiser. 

           THUD. The front door closes behind her. 

           Watching the minivan depart, John hardens his resolve, then 
           goes for the master bedroom.

           INT. LUO’S HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           John pulls the remaining yuan that Noah gave him from his 
           pocket, and tucks it inside a simple handwritten note. He 
           places it on Luo’s wife’s bedside table beside Luo’s photo.

                                 JOHN
                        [I’m sorry.]

           A brief moment of silence, then back into action. 

           John systematically searches the room. 

           Raids the luggage in the closet.

           Checks under the mattress.

           Rummages through drawers. 

           Feels under the bed. 

           Got it. He withdraws a heavy shoebox. Places it atop the bed. 
           Opens it. Retrieves a small SAFE from inside.

           Picks the lock. Safe pops opens.

           An EXPANDABLE BATON like the ones used on him in LA lies on 
           top. John snaps it open. Smacks it closed. Pockets it.

           Next, he removes a BINDER BOUND IN RED LEATHER.

           John flips through. A stash of investigation related folders 
           and documents nearly identical to those John had in LA. 

           Everything’s marked “[CONFIDENTIAL]“ and “[TRIAD TASK FORCE].“

           He opens a thick, heavy folder labelled “[TRIAD ELECTION].“

           Two sub-folders. “[SONG FACTION]“ and “[HUANG FACTION].“ 
           John opens the one marked “[SONG FACTION].“ 

           Dossiers on informants, key players. 

           John examines the dossier on “[BOSS SONG SHIWAN].“ The 
           attached photo is identical to one of the two that was tacked 
           to the center of the bulletin board in Luo’s HKPD office.

           John scans Luo’s notes with his finger. Stops when he reaches 
           the header “[FREQUENT LOCATIONS/ REGULAR APPOINTMENTS].“ 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Bingo.

           INT. HULLETT HOUSE HOTEL, “GUILLOTINE“ RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The finest French restaurant in the East. Silver chandeliers 
           and Louis XVI chairs. Expat waiters serve up foie gras, 
           braised snails, and French wine to China’s nouveau riche.

           John, in a busboy uniform, clears half-empty wine glasses off 
           a table, balancing them on a silver platter.

           His eyes lock on a quiet table across the room.  

           BOSS SONG SHIWAN (50), the stern Triad faction head pictured 
           in the dossier, talks shop with four associates.

           John scans the room’s perimeter, wary - a dozen or so menacing 
           Triad enforcers stand sentry at the various doorways. 

           John lifts his platter, heads for the kitchen.

           Song’s table lies directly in his path.

           As John nears Song, he stumbles. The silver platter wobbles. 
           Tips. Red wine cascades onto Song’s white dinner jacket.

           Jaws drop. The room goes silent. 

           Song looks down at his jacket.

           Then up at John, ice cold.

                                 JOHN
                        Sir… I’m so sorry, sir.

           The Triad enforcers on the periphery whisper to one another, 
           but hold their ground, unsure of how to respond.

           John grabs his dish towel, blots Song’s soaked clothes.

           A CHINESE HOST rushes over, red-faced. 
                                 CHINESE HOST
                        [Mr. Song… sir, I’m so, so sorry.]

           The host pushes John aside, stealing his towel. Song glares.

                                 CHINESE HOST (CONT’D)
                        You--You’ve done enough. Out! 
                        You’re fired! [Fired! Get out!]

           John exits for the kitchen as the host blots Song’s clothes.

                                 CHINESE HOST (CONT’D)
                        [Sir, I can’t even begin to tell 
                        you how embarrassing this is.]

           Song’s associates move to stand as he rises with a grunt, but 
           he signals them to stay put. The host grabs an expat server.

                                 CHINESE HOST (CONT’D)
                        [Meet me at the Chef’s room with our 
                        finest loaner, and send the table 
                        three bottles of our best wine.]

           INT. HULLETT HOUSE HOTEL, KITCHEN QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           The host leads Boss Song and two TRIAD ENFORCERS down a hall 
           leading from the rear of the kitchen to the Head Chef’s room 
           where the expat server waits, black dinner jacket in hand. 

                                 CHINESE HOST
                        [Right this way, Mr. Song, the Head 
                        Chef’s private room is just ahead. 
                        After you’ve changed, we’ll have 
                        your clothes sent to our in-house 
                        cleaner, complimentary of course.]

           The host looks from the black jacket to Song’s white jacket.

                                 CHINESE HOST (CONT’D)
                        Was there nothing more in line with 
                        Mr. Song’s sensibilities?

                                 BOSS SONG
                        [It doesn't matter if the cat is 
                        black or white, so as long as it 
                        catches mice.]

           One of the enforces seizes the jacket, and the three disappear 
           into the room. The host looks to the server, perturbed.

                                 CHINESE HOST
                        Have you ever seen that busboy 
                        before?
           INT. HULLETT HOUSE HOTEL, HEAD CHEF’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           The enforcers lock the door, and follow Song inside.

           An elegant space styled after the backstage changing rooms of 
           late night television hosts, albeit with a culinary twist.

           The enforcers scan the room for threats, then, satisfied, 
           turn to face the door while Song undresses behind them. 

           INT. HULLETT HOUSE HOTEL, HEAD CHEF’S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the closet, light sifts through the louvered doors, 
           falling across the unconscious body of a naked expat busboy 
           bound with duct tape on the closet floor.  

           Two legs standing over him lead up to John’s face, a streak 
           of light through his eyes as he stares out between the slats. 

           Boss Song’s naked from the waist up, pot-belly drooping.

           John fidgets with something in his hands - the expandable 
           baton taken from Luo’s house.

           John tightens his grip as Song reaches for the closet.

           INT. HULLETT HOUSE HOTEL, HEAD CHEF’S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

           WHAM! The doors fly open, knocking Song back as John leaps 
           out. The baton expands as it sweeps through the air.

           THWACK! It lands between Song’s shoulder and head.

           He crumples. His enforcers go for their holsters.

           John targets their wrists with sickening force.

           WHACK!-WHACK! Guns scatter across the floor.

           The baton swings upward at one’s head.

           CRACK! A jaw unhinges. Teeth fly.

           John looks down just as Song raises his pistol - SMACK! John 
           swats it into a mirror, shattering his reflection.

           The enforcers grab kitchen knives with their intact hands.

           Lunge at John, but can’t match the baton’s reach.

           John deflects the blows, a tornado of force. 
           THUMP! THUMP! Knock-out skull strikes.

           The enforcers collapse unconscious on either side of Song, 
           their boss still conscious himself, but immobilized by pain.

           John leans over Song.

                                 JOHN
                        [You’ll thank me later--]

           WHAM! The baton’s butt end strikes Song’s temple. 

           EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - NIGHT

           The Santana approaches a nightclub basked in neon white, the 
           “[WHITE LOTUS].“ Several TRIAD BOUNCERS guard the front.

           INT. VOLKSWAGEN SANTANA - CONTINUOUS

           John reaches for a picture laying atop Luo’s red binder on 
           the passenger seat.

           The photo shows the “[WHITE LOTUS]“ nightclub, same as the 
           one before him. Handwritten on it, “[BOSS HUANG WEI].“ 

           EXT. “WHITE LOTUS“ CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           John pulls into the drop-off zone beside the club doors. The 
           bouncers quit joking around, and turn on their tough-guy act.

                                 TRIAD BOUNCER
                        [Can’t park there, buddy.]

                                 JOHN
                        [Got a delivery for Mr. Huang]

                                 TRIAD BOUNCER
                        [Don’t know who you’re talking 
                        about. Go on, beat it.]

                                 JOHN
                        [I need someone to sign for it. 
                        Maybe you could? Right here…]

           John holds up Luo’s police dossier on Boss Song Shiwan. The 
           bouncer snatches it from John with a look of recognition. 

           Muffled screams and thumps lure the bouncer’s attention to 
           the trunk. He looks back to John, startled. 
           John uses his eyes to draw the connection between the photo 
           of Boss Song and the noises emanating from the trunk.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        [Is there somewhere I can park?]

           INT. “WHITE LOTUS“ CLUB, UNDERGROUND GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Armed Triad enforcers flank John. A TRIAD DEPUTY takes John’s 
           keys, and walks around to the Santana’s trunk. 

           Long beat before the deputy pops it open.

           The deputy stares down in shock - RIVAL BOSS SONG SHIWAN 
           SQUIRMS, shirtless, helpless, bound with duct tape. 

           The deputy immediately slams the trunk. 

           Looks to John in sheer disbelief.

                                 TRIAD DEPUTY
                        [That’s Uncle Song…]

                                 JOHN
                        [Tell Uncle Huang that Uncle Song 
                        and I are here to see him.]

           The deputy remains silent, still wondering if the joke’s on 
           him. The car jostles as Song writhes.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        [Uncle Song would prefer sooner, 
                        rather than later.]

           INT. “WHITE LOTUS“ CLUB, BOSS HUANG’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Red lights. Raging fireplace. BOSS HUANG WEI (50) sits at one 
           end of an antique Chinese tea table. Devilish goatee. A pair 
           of eels twist in a tank behind him. One black, one albino. 

           Huang watches, intrigued, as the deputy leads in John and 
           Boss Song, shirtless, bruised, but free of the duct tape.

           Huang gestures for John and Song to sit as if this is normal. 

           A bespectacled expat servant girl (12) enters, steaming tea 
           kettle in hand. Her eyes meet John’s - glasses identical to 
           Izzy’s. He averts his gaze as she performs the tea ceremony.

           Lighting a cigarillo, Huang silently studies John until the 
           tea is poured, and the girl and his deputy gone. 
                                 BOSS HUANG
                        You’re the man from the hospital?

                                 JOHN
                        [And the gardens, and the airport.] 

                                 BOSS HUANG
                        A cop killer? I’d earn a lot of 
                        favors for turning you in.

           Long beat. Huang lets John sweat it out, but John’s unfazed.

                                 BOSS HUANG (CONT’D)
                        And this…
                            (off Boss Song)
                        …are you trying to start a war?

                                 JOHN
                        Quite the opposite.

           Song manages a sarcastic snort, then squints with pain.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        [My apologies, Uncle Song, for the 
                        circumstances, but I trust that 
                        both yourself and Uncle Huang will 
                        find my proposition worth any 
                        temporary inconvenience.] 

                                 BOSS HUANG
                        And you bring what to the table?

                                 JOHN
                        Americatown.

           Huang drags on his cigarillo, dissecting John. Despite John’s 
           battered and bruised physique, his confidence is arresting.

                                 BOSS SONG
                        [He’s insane.]

                                 JOHN

                        Thomas Warner’s leading the charge.

           Song flashes a skeptical glance at Huang, far from sold.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve always had the muscle to

                        It would be an endless insurgency.

                        The expats are opportunistic thugs,

                        They won’t even know it was you, 
                        with one exception - the Warners.

                        Not exactly.

           John opens Luo’s red binder. Slides out a thick folder.

           Places it on the table - “[ACTIVE TRIAD INFORMANTS].“ 

           Song and Huang’s eyes light up.

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, ROOFTOP GARDEN - SAME

           Four Warner soldiers patrol the rooftop. 

           Guns in hand. Eyes on the streets.

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, HANNAH’S ROOM - SAME

           A room draped in lavish Victorian style. Pris brushes Izzy’s 
           hair as she sits before Hannah’s elegant vanity mirror. Teddy 
           in her lap, Izzy nervously fingering her dove figurine.

                                 IZZY
                        Mommy, when do we get to see Daddy?

                        Why do we have to stay in here?

           Beat. Pris struggles to not let on that anything’s amiss.

                                 PRIS
                        What’s wrong with in here? It’s 
                        really pretty, isn’t it?

                                 IZZY
                        I guess… You think Daddy will be 
                        here tonight?

           Pris chokes up, eyes wet with tears.

                                 IZZY (CONT’D)
                        Mommy, why are you crying?

           Pris wipes her eyes, desperate to hide her fear as she opens 
           the vanity drawer, rummages, and digs out Hannah’s ruby-
           studded tiara. Much like Izzy’s toy one, but now real.

                                 PRIS
                        Just being silly, no reason.

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           An armed Warner soldier sits on guard outside Hannah’s room. 
           He admires an Asian centerfold in a Chinese nudie mag.

                                 IZZY (O.S.)
                        It’s beautiful…

           The Warner soldier raises his eyebrows, nodding his head as 
           if agreeing with Izzy’s sentiment, then flips the page.

           INT. “WHITE LOTUS“ CLUB - SHORTLY AFTER

           Huang pulls pages out of Luo’s red book that John gave him, 
           and hands them to his deputies.

           The Triad deputies scan the information - PHOTOS OF TRIAD 
           INFORMANTS LABELLED WITH ADDRESSES.

           INT. TRIAD DEPUTY’S PENTHOUSE - SHORTLY AFTER

           A TRIAD DEPUTY struts in, startling the entourage of Triad 
           enforcers lounging in his swanky penthouse.

           The enforcers snuff out their cigarettes, remove their feet 
           from the tables, straighten up. The deputy holds up the 
           papers given to him by Huang.

                                 TRIAD DEPUTY
                        [Payback time.]

           The enforcers chuckle, deviant smirks creasing their faces.

           INT. TRIAD DEPUTY’S RESTAURANT - SAME

           Another Triad deputy sits in a restaurant booth, flanked by 
           another entourage of Triad enforcers. 

           They pore over the materials Huang gave the deputy, drawing 
           up a plan of attack based on a house in one of the photos.

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, NOAH’S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER

           Mickey, wearing a red tie, reclines in the chair tucked into 
           the corner. Pen in hand, he sketches a copy of the painting 
           on the wall, Thomas Cole’s “Destruction,“ on a napkin. 

           Thomas sits at what was Noah’s desk, phone to his ear.
                                 THOMAS
                        Well call me if he does.

           Thomas slams the phone down, and looks to Mickey, frustrated.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        And he still hasn’t contacted you?

           Mickey shakes his head, crumples the napkin, and steals a 
           nervous glance at the adjacent bank of security monitors.

           INT. MICKEY’S APARTMENT COMPLEX, LOBBY - SAME

           A security monitor inlaid into the front desk shows three 
           “BUSINESSMEN“ passing a lobby mural modeled after Emanuel 
           Gottlieb Leutze's “Washington Crossing the Delaware.“

           One of them carries Frank’s dog, Smedley, in his arms.

           A CONCIERGE greets them. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        [Hi, may I help you gentlemen?]

                                 TRIAD “BUSINESSMAN“
                        [We’re here for Mr. Columbus.]

           The “businessman“ slides a thick envelope across the counter.

           INT. DRY CLEANER - SAME

           An expat dry cleaner flips through a yuan-stuffed enveloped.

           Behind him, ENFORCERS GRAB POLICE UNIFORMS off the rack. 

           Arms full, they exit out the rear door.

           INT. HKPD CRUISER - SHORTLY AFTER

           The “officer“ driving pulls a wad of yuan from his pocket.

           EXT. HKPD CAR YARD - CONTINUOUS

           FIVE CRUISERS approach the guard tower at the edge of the lot. 

           The lead car stops at the gate. The Triad “officer“ inside 
           pass the wad of yuan to the guard in the tower.

           The guard opens the gate, waves them through. 
           EXT. LUXURY APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

           An expat doorman opens the door for a Chinese man heading out. 

           A nearby Triad enforcer MATCHES THE MAN AGAINST ONE OF LUO’S 
           “INFORMANT“ PHOTOS, drops his cigarette, tails him.

           As the informant approaches a white van, the enforcer 
           suddenly zaps the informant with a stun gun.

           The van door slides open. Arms pull the man in. 

           The van squeals away, burning rubber.

           INT. BROTHEL, HALLWAY - SAME

           Squealing tires give way to the exaggerated cries of a hooker 
           feigning orgasm behind a closed door.

           A pimp carrying a thick envelope leads four Triad enforcers 
           down a hallway toward the source. 

           INT. BROTHEL, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Triad enforcers quietly slip into the room. The expat hooker 
           shrieks when she notices, facing the door as a BLINDFOLDED 
           CHINESE MAN goes at her doggy style, none the wiser.

                                 BLINDFOLDED CHINESE MAN
                        [Yeah, you like that!]

           The lead enforcer MATCHES THE BLINDFOLDED MAN’S TATTOOS WITH 
           ANOTHER OF LUO’S “INFORMANT“ PHOTOS. He nods to the others.

           The others taser the man from multiple angles. 

           He falls off the bed - WHAM!

           INT. MICKEY’S APARTMENT - SHORTLY AFTER

           TV volume on blast. Spanish-language Mexican wrestling. The 
           challenger throws the title holder from the ring - WHAM!

           Carlos watches from bed, propped up against the headboard.

           WOOF! SMEDLEY TROTS INTO THE ROOM, jumps onto the bed. 

                                 CARLOS
                        <What the hell?>
           Carlos looks from the dog to the bedroom doorway just as the 
           “businessmen“ enter, silenced Walther PPQ pistols in hand. 

           One gestures for Carlos to “Shhh,“ holding his silencer up 
           to his lips like a finger. Smedley barks.

           EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME

           Dogs bark as other enforcers drag a Chinese man from a house, 
           heels digging into the grass as he struggles to break free.

           A woman shoots at them with a shotgun from the second floor. 
           Hits an enforcer who drops one of LUO’S INFORMANT PHOTOS.

           The remaining enforcers fire back. Shred her.

           She falls from the window. 

           WHAM! Crashes through a white trellis below.

           Spikes of splintered wood jut skyward.

           EXT. AMERICATOWN STREETS - SAME

           The seven white spikes of the “Liberty Gate“ crown. Below,  
           the five, stolen HKPD cruisers roll into Americatown.

           Two Triad enforcers dressed as “officers“ per car.

           Expat children playing on the sidewalk wave. 

           EXT. HOUSE OF BLUES BAR - SHORTLY AFTER

           Expat drunks wave to the bouncer from a departing cab, freeing 
           up a parking space that a cruiser slides into alongside a BLUE 
           MERCEDES BENZ G-CLASS in the bar’s loading zone.

           The bouncer pulls out a two-way, radios it in.

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - SHORTLY AFTER

           BZZZ-BZZZ. Mickey’s cell vibrates. He flips it open. A 
           picture of Carlos, blindfolded. 

                                 MICKEY
                        Sonuvabitch…

           His obnoxious ringtone blares. Mickey answers.
                                 MICKEY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, John.

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Shoe’s on the other foot.

                                 MICKEY
                        Yeah, an’ what the fuck you want me 
                        to do? Huh?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        Listen carefully - there’s going to 
                        be a time, soon, when the Warners 
                        look to you and ask, “What do we do 
                        now?“

                                 MICKEY
                        ‘The fuck you talkin’ about?

                                 JOHN (V.O.)
                        They’re going to ask you, “What do 
                        we do now?“ And, if you ever want 
                        to see your old man again, at that 
                        moment, you’ll remain silent and 
                        you’ll look to me. Understood?

                                 MICKEY
                        You fuckin’ crazy, John. Give it up. 
                        You got family to think about--

           INT. DEFUNCT “U.S. BEEF“ WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A defunct “U.S. Beef“ warehouse converted into a DVD pirating 
           facility. Meat hooks dangle over rows of DVD copiers and milk 
           crates packed with pirated discs, like those John sold in LA. 

           John stands in a black tactical jumpsuit beside Boss Huang.

                                 JOHN
                        --So do you.

           John snaps his cell shut. 

           Surrounding him, two dozen Triad enforcers in black jumpsuits, 
           just like his. They check their weapons. AK-47s, grenades.

                                 BOSS HUANG
                        [We good?]

                                 JOHN
                        [Golden.]

           John pockets the phone. Zips up his jumpsuit. 
           EXT. SEARS TOWNHOUSE - SHORTLY AFTER

           A TRIAD “OFFICER“ unzips a briefcase, and serves a “warrant“ 
           written in Chinese characters to a GREEN CAPTAIN at the door. 

                                 TRIAD “OFFICER“
                        Warrant for arrest of Mr. Sears.

           The Green captain and SOLDIER beside him stare, bewildered.

                                 GREEN CAPTAIN
                        Is it legit?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Fucked if I know.

           Behind them, another “officer“ opens the cruiser’s door, 
           parked between a GREEN MASERATI and GREEN PORSCHE. 

           The car’s radio crackles within.

           EXT. AMERICATOWN BARBERSHOP - SAME

           Triad “officers,“ lead a handcuffed, obese YELLOW BOSS out of 
           the building. One of them reholsters his radio. 

           A YELLOW CAPTAIN and his SOLDIERS tail them, protesting. 

                                 YELLOW SYNDICATE MEMBERS
                        Oy! What’s this all about? / You 
                        Can’t do this! / Come on, officers--

           The captain grabs an “officer’s“ arm - the “officer“ pistol-
           whips the captain, then aims at the soldiers. 

           The other “officer“ stuffs Yellow Boss’ fat ass into the 
           cruiser, parked right behind a YELLOW HUMMER.

           INT. DEFUNCT “U.S. BEEF“ WAREHOUSE - SAME

           Enforcers strip the now unconscious, ABDUCTED INFORMANTS, and 
           DRESS THEM IN THE SAME ALL BLACK GARB THE ENFORCERS WEAR. 

           The “costumed“ informants are then stuffed into body bags.

           Behind them, enforcers line the concrete floor with large 
           plastic tarps.
           EXT. AMERICATOWN ROOFTOPS - SHORTLY AFTER

           A Triad sniper lays out his gun case that doubles as a mat. 
           Scans the area through the Dragunov rifle’s massive scope.

           Three blocks down, the Warner Townhouse rooftop garden.

           The scope focuses on a patrolling Warner soldier.

           Clear enough to discern individual roses.

           EXT. HONG KONG STREETS - SAME

           Two unmarked, white vans whiz by a Chinese flower shop as an 
           expat florist refills the display of roses out front.

           INT. WHITE TRIAD VAN 1 - CONTINUOUS

           John sits in the back with seven Triad enforcers, suited up 
           for action. Two benches of four facing one another. 

           TWO STUFFED BODY BAGS on the floor between them. 

           John’s radio crackles.

           The handcuffed Sears Boss studies the warehouses, nervous.

                        This some kinda joke?

           No answer. The car moves deeper into the dockyard maze.

           checks the number, pushes her headset aside, answers.

           INT. DEFUNCT “U.S. BEEF“ WAREHOUSE - SAME

           A cruiser passes into the warehouse. Triad enforcers dressed 
           in all black shut the barn-style doors behind them.

           INT. HKPD CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Yellow Boss goes white in the backseat. Can’t look away…
           Through the window, he watches as Triad enforcers dismember 
           Blue Boss in the area lined with plastic. 

           They place his remains into one of five 50-gallon barrels. 

           COLORED TIES LIE DRAPED OVER THE RIMS OF FOUR OF THEM.

           EXT. “LIBERTY GATE,“ AMERICATOWN - SAME

           Two cruisers block the gate, STOPPING ALL IN-AND-OUT TRAFFIC.

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - SAME

           The two white vans pull up in front of the townhouse. Park in 
           the middle of the street, disregarding all other traffic.

           The Warner soldiers at the front door look to the vans, then 
           to one another. Radio it in. A car behind the vans honks. 

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, ROOFTOP GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           The honking draws the Warner soldiers to the roof’s edge.

           EXT. AMERICATOWN ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS

           Illuminated reticles overlay the Warner soldier doormen.

           A sniper’s finger slides into his trigger guard.

           John’s finger squeezes his radio’s talk-button.

           Every other enforcer pulls a flashbang’s pin. 

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sniper shots ring out from all directions. 

           Warner soldiers go down simultaneously.

           The white vans’ doors fly open. 

           Triads rush the townhouse.
           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Windows shatter. Flashbangs skitter across the floor around 
           the base of Hannah’s wheelchair in the middle of the living 
           room, a red bow in her hair. She doesn’t even flinch as… 

           BAM!-BAM!-BAM! Deafening pops. Pulses of blinding light.

           Warners inside clench their bleeding, ringing ears.

           Triads breach the front door with shotguns. 

           Hannah, static amidst the chaos.

           Triads charge, guns blazing. 

           Warners drop like flies.

           Most surrender. 

           Abandon guns. 

           Hands up.

           A Triad enforcer shoots the Warner soldier guarding Hannah’s 
           room where Pris and Izzy are held. Kicks the door open.

           Enforcers raid Noah’s office. Drag Thomas and Mickey out.

           Triads seize weapons. Herd everyone into the kitchen. 

           Pris and Izzy packed in along with the gangsters.

           Four Warner captains. A dozen soldiers. 

           TWO BOSSES - THOMAS AND MICKEY.

           John, DISGUISED AS A TRIAD ENFORCER, points out Thomas and 
           Mickey. He gestures as if pulling down on an imaginary tie. 

           The enforcers move in to grab them. Mickey resists. 

           An enforcer slugs him with the butt of an AK-47.

           Izzy screams. Pris shields her.

           Thomas goes willingly.

           A coward.
           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Triad enforcers drag Thomas and Mickey from the kitchen. 
           Others close the doors, sealing off the Warners from view.

           The enforcers lead Thomas and Mickey into the living room.

           Zip-tie them to chairs. Duct tape their mouths.

           Arrange them in a triangle, facing Hannah.

           John gives a signal. Half of the enforcers now quietly exit.

           He hands off his AK-47, and REMOVES HIS BLACK BALACLAVA. 

           Thomas and Mickey’s eyes widen. John signals, “Shhh.“ 

           He strips out of his jumpsuit.

           Three piece suit beneath.

           Mickey rocks his chair.

           Thomas, frozen.

           John loosens Thomas’ red tie. Thomas whimpers, pathetically.

           John passes his Ka-Bar to the Triad enforcer at his side. 

           Behind him, the enforcers that exited now return…

           CARRYING IN THE STUFFED BODY BAGS.

           The enforcers precede to open the bags, DUMPING OUT THE 
           ABDUCTED INFORMANTS’ BODIES, COSTUMED AS TRIAD ENFORCERS.

           The Ka-Bar wielding enforcer steps around behind Thomas.

           Pulls back Thomas’ head, presenting his neck to John.

           Thomas’ eyes beg John for Mercy. John nods.

           The enforcer SLITS THOMAS’ THROAT.

           Mickey stares in horror as Thomas gurgles his last breath.

           The enforcer moves behind Mickey, pulls back his head.

           Mickey screams through the duct tape. 

           The blade depresses his flesh.

           Long beat. 
           John stares into Mickey’s soul, then finally shakes his head. 
           The enforcer releases Mickey, wipes the blood off the knife. 

           John moves away from Mickey towards the front door. An 
           enforcer hands him Frank’s M16 rifle with 100 round drum. 

           He cocks it. 

           In pairs of two, TRIAD ENFORCERS HOLD UP THE UNCONSCIOUS, 
           ABDUCTED INFORMANTS COSTUMED AS TRIAD ENFORCERS.

           John counts down with his fingers. Three… Two… One…

           KNOCK-KNOCK. He raps the front door as if he were outside.

           Then steps aside, but remains close.

           The enforcers with free hands shoot at the door beside John, 
           as if John was just now entering the Warner townhouse.

           John fires several bursts into the wall behind them.

           Back and forth they go. Shooting, missing.

           CREATING THE ILLUSION OF A GUNFIGHT. 

           A PSYOP against those listening…

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The clap of gunfire and the feigned screams fills the kitchen.

           Warners duck for cover. Plug their ears.

           Izzy cries, holds her ears. 

           Pris pulls her tight.

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The “gunfight“ rages on around the trio seated in the center 
           of the living room. Dead Thomas, bound Mickey, and Hannah.

           John levels his rifle at the unconscious, abducted informants. 

           SHOOTS THE INFORMANTS ONE BY ONE, generating “dead Triads.“

           Each shot triggers a burst of blood - the type of spatter 
           patterns that only come from shooting something alive.

           Enforcers drop the dead informants.
           The informants all dead, the enforcers PLANT THEIR OWN AK-47s 
           BESIDE THEM, grab the body bags, and slip out the front door. 

           John fires as they “retreat,“ intentionally missing them.

           AROUND HIM, EVIDENCE OF AN APPARENT ONE-MAN MASSACRE. 

           INT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The fading squeal of tires outside. Warners look to one 
           another, aghast. Approaching footsteps break the silence. 

           They back away from the kitchen door, eyes glued to it. 

           Izzy wipes her tears away. Pris draws her closer.

           SNAP! The kitchen door’s lock turns. 

           CREEEAK. The doors swing open. 

           Warners gasp in awe.

           Fearless, armed, a bloody path of destruction in his wake, 
           JOHN STAND BEFORE THEM, AN ICON OF POWER… 

           …the perfect answer to a power vacuum.

           Warners hold their breath.

                                 IZZY
                        Daddy!

           Izzy breaks free from Pris’ hold. Runs to John. He slings the 
           M16 over his shoulder, and catches her in his arms.

           A collective sigh of relief from the surviving Warners.

           John can’t help it. Tears well up in his eyes.

           But he refuses to let them fall. Not now. 

           He pulls Izzy in tight. 

           Shielding her.

           The Warners tread lightly, parting around John as they move 
           into the living room where, BY ALL APPEARANCES, JOHN SEEMS TO 
           HAVE SINGLE-HANDEDLY VANQUISHED THE TRIAD HIT SQUAD.

           A WARNER SOLDIER spots Mickey, shaken and pallid, but alive.

                                 WARNER SOLDIER
                        Mickey!
           The soldiers cut him free.

           Pris struggles for words as she bounces between the joy of 
           seeing John, and her anger and confusion on the other hand.

           Before she lands on an emotion, John wraps her in an embrace. 
           She gives in to him, crying into his shoulder, overcome.

           Cut free, Mickey slowly rises, traumatized.

           The terrified captains hovering over Thomas’ corpse turn 
           their gaze to him, LOOKING TO MICKEY FOR GUIDANCE.

                                 WARNER CAPTAIN
                        What do we do now?

           John’s ears perk as the moment he prophesized manifests. 

           He turns his eyes to Mickey.

           Long beat. Silence. 

           Mickey, dumbfounded, TURNS HIS GAZE TOWARDS JOHN.

           John scans the room, ALL OF THE WARNER SYNDICATE MEMBERS NOW 
           LOOKING TO HIM - HIS SOLDIERS, HIS CAPTAINS, HIS SYNDICATE. 

                                 JOHN
                        We need to move. Cops’ll be here in 
                        minutes. Grab anything of value.

           John observes as the Warners obey, scattering, stripping the 
           walls of Noah’s framed gold and silver bullion coin displays.

                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Torch the rest. Regroup at Three-
                        Ball.

           John spots the young, freckled soldier who was earlier 
           fawning over his successful hit against the Sears Boys.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        You, take my wife and daughter on 
                        ahead. Use Noah’s car and driver. 

           To Pris’ horror, John hands Izzy to the freckled soldier.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Take them out the back.

           The freckled soldier turns to Pris.

                                 FRECKLED SOLDIER
                        Right this way, Ma’am.
           Pris looks to John, bewildered, his back turned to her.

                                 PRIS
                        What about you?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll catch up.

                                 PRIS
                        This isn’t--

           He looks over his shoulder.

                                 JOHN
                        --I’ll catch up.

           Cold beat. The ugly truth hits her like a crushing wave.

           Baffled, she staggers back, then turns, and follows the 
           freckled soldier carrying Izzy out.

           Alone, John steps toward the window seat behind him.

           Looks down through the glass at the red Bentley. 

           His reflection stares back, resolute, save for forlorn eyes.

           EXT. WARNER TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           John towers in the window above, overlaid with the reflection 
           of the Bentley off the glass as the freckled soldier ushers 
           Izzy into the car, Hannah’s ruby tiara perched atop her head.

           Pris pauses before getting in. 

           Aims her stony gaze at John. 

           Behind him, Mickey pushes Hannah through the kitchen, her 
           wheelchair leaving a trail of blood. 

           In the foreground, a single tear falls down John’s cheek.

           Pris closes the door. The car starts.

           INT. NOAH’S BENTLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Izzy gazes back at the townhouse as the Bentley drives away, 
           a hint of a smile fading…

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.
