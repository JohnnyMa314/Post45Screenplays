           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING.

           A frosty morning. Clear blue sky. The park is abuzz with 
           cyclers, walkers, joggers. 

           [SLOW MOTION] A man runs. His hips rotate left and right, 
           each willingly taking its turn, conceding it. A sculptured 
           arm stands guard on each side of the torso. Cocked, at the 
           ready. We move up the body to the head. To the face...

           CLIVE’s face (30s). He’s handsome. His nostrils flare. His 
           mouth is ajar. His cheeks are splotched with haphazard 
           patches of pink, red. 

           He is a man, very much alive.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

           [POINT OF VIEW] A sudden awakening. Panic. It’s dark. We are 
           alone in bed, the queen-sized mattress sitting on the floor. 
           The sound of our own disturbed panting. We struggle against a 
           mound of twisted sheets and blankets. But we can’t get free. 

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Clive? 

           A figure appears at the doorway. We settle.

                                 WOMAN
                        You OK, baby?

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           [POINT OF VIEW] A light switches on beyond, it’s glow 
           radiating into the room. Whipping looks from side-to-side. A 
           sparsely-furnished bedroom, boxes, floorboards, high ceiling. 
           We are wracked with anxiety. 

           The sound of a tap running, a glass filling with water.

           The figure returns, turns on a lamp. It’s is SUSIE (30s). She 
           is unaffectedly beautiful, sincerity written all over her. 
           She holds a glass of water and some pills out to us. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Here. Take these. 

           We do. Susie sits down on the bed, fatigued. She regards us 
           with concern. Like a mother tending to her newborn on yet 
           another sleepless night. 

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           Clive stirs. He sits up, rubs his face. Disoriented. Faint TV 
           sounds drift in from another room. He looks around. He is 
           alone. 
           Clive blinks hard, consciousness moving through him in waves. 
           His eyes drag groggily, sleep coming for him again.

           But Clive resists. He jolts to life, tosses the bed covers 
           aside. 

           Clive draws a sharp intake of breath as he catches sight of 
           his body, his mental fog clearing in an abrupt instant. Clive 
           stares at himself, quietly. Privately. The TV program’s 
           canned laughter echoes into the room. 

           Clive releases his breath, lies down...

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           ...and drops onto his back.

           Lying on the floor, Clive gazes up at passing clouds through 
           a skylight directly above him. He is numb. 

           Looking down on Clive we see that he wears a white t-shirt, 
           jocks. And that below his groin, he has only two bandaged 
           stumps for legs. 

           Clive is only half a man.

           OPENING TITLE:   CLIVE

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive lies on his back, staring up at the skylight.

           Cardboard boxes marked “living room”, “bedroom” etc are 
           piled around the room. Individual belongings have been 
           sorted into stacks. A relocation, in progress.

           Clive licks his dry lips but brings little moisture to 
           them. His pulse thumps in his neck. After each blink, his 
           pupils quickly contract into pin pricks. 

           A BLOWFLY buzzes. Clive’s eyes track it. 

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        Where should we put things like 
                        scarves and beanies?

           Susie enters from the bedroom. She holds a box crammed with 
           wintry accessories. Clive doesn’t respond. Doesn’t move.

                                 SUSIE
                        Maybe we’ll just keep them in the 
                        box for now.

           She tries to be cheery. Clive does not. 
           Susie puts the box down, sits near Clive. She looks over 
           the surrounding keepsakes, artifacts, designer accessories. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        God, look at all this stuff.

           Clive focuses on the fly. It flits erratically.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Remember when your mum gave you 
                        this?

           A distinctive creaking sound captures Clive attention. He 
           sees Susie holding an open ORNATE WOODEN BOX. It’s unique. 
           And beautiful. Clive is aghast.

                                 CLIVE
                        Why did you bring that here?

                                 SUSIE
                        I don’t know. I didn’t know what 
                        we’d need. How long we’re gonna 
                        be here. I brought everything. 

           Clive spots the fly whizzing around a closed high window. 
           Susie contemplates the wooden box in her hands. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        You really should call her. Your 
                        mum. She’ll be so worried.

           Clive clenches his jaw. Susie is delicate.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        A lot of people will be wondering 
                        how you are. Where you are. 

           The fly buzzes louder. Clive is getting agitated.  

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you even want to check your e-
                        mail? You must have like a thousand 
                        by now.

           Susie’s coaxing has no effect on Clive. She despairs.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        We can’t just disappear and think 
                        no one will notice!

           The fly bangs itself against the closed window. Desperate 
           to get out. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Just send a group e-mail, say I’m 
                        fine and ask that we be left alone 
                        for the time being. It’s no one’s 
                        damn business where we’ve gone.
                                 SUSIE
                        But, Clive...

                                 CLIVE
                        Close the box, Susie! Put it away!

           Susie gets up hurriedly, emotional. She carries the box to 
           the bedroom.

           The fly swoops down at Clive, provocatively. Clive waves at 
           it. Music starts up in the bedroom. A garish symphony.  

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Susie! Turn that off! 

           The music cuts. The fly dives at Clive, and escapes. 
           Taunting him. Clive can’t contain his irritation any 
           longer. He swipes at the fly fiercely.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking..fucking...!

           Susie returns. She stops at the bedroom doorway. Susie 
           watches Clive, lying on the floor, waving his arms in the 
           air, madly. Hopelessly.  

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Die! Die! You fucking...thing!

           Clive looks pathetic. Committed to an impossible task.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Deep dark. The whole apartment is quiet. Clive sleeps, 
           partially covered by sheets.

           Clive rouses. He turns to see Susie sitting up on the other 
           side of the bed, staring at him, at his new body. Clive 
           quickly covers himself with the blanket.

                                 CLIVE
                        What are you doing?

                                 SUSIE
                        Nothing, baby.

           Susie reaches out to Clive, touches his arm. Clive 
           blanches, wriggles away from Susie. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Don’t touch me!

           The whites of Susie’s eyes glint through the dark. She is 
           more than hurt, she’s humiliated. 

           Clive turns over onto his side, facing away from Susie. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive looks up, through the skylight. 

           Susie bounces in from the kitchen. She holds a plate of 
           food - a hearty, cooked breakfast.

                                 CLIVE
                        I said I don’t want it.

           Susie puts the plate down beside Clive. He glares at her 
           hatefully. 

                                 SUSIE
                        You haven’t eaten for days. 

                                 CLIVE
                            (under his breath)
                        I don’t want it.

                                 SUSIE
                        You’re wasting away.

                                 CLIVE
                        I don’t want it!

           In one motion, Clive wipes the food off the plate. A 
           smashed egg drips over the plate, onto the floor.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Susie paces. Clive is listless. 

                                 SUSIE 
                        Can’t we just try it? Please?

           She motions to a wheelchair standing in the far corner of 
           the room. It’s covered with clothes and blankets. 

                                 CLIVE
                        No.

           Clive is obstinate. Susie rubs her eyes.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        How about a shower? Can I put a 
                        shower on for you? Clive? 

           Clive purses his lips. Taking his silence as acceptance, 
           Susie squats down to Clive. She pulls at his t-shirt. 

                                 CLIVE
                        What are you doing?

           Susie struggles to wrest Clive’s top off without his 
           assistance.
                                 SUSIE
                        We’ll have a shower. Then you’ll 
                        feel much better.

                                 CLIVE
                        No, I won’t. 

           Clive is grave. Susie disregards him. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (gentle)
                        Susie, listen to me.

           Susie rigorously perseveres in trying to undress an 
           unwilling Clive. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Stop it.

           She doesn’t. Clive grips Susie’s wrist. Hard. 

                                 SUSIE
                            (light)
                        It’s just a shower, Clive. 
                        Everyone needs a shower.

                                 CLIVE
                        Stop it, Susie. Stop all of it. 

           Susie smiles through tears. 

                                 SUSIE
                        I can’t. You’re my man.

                                 CLIVE
                        What sort of man looks like this?

           Susie turns away. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a man. I’m a lump of 
                        meat. I’m a pudding. I am a 
                        carcass. And a carcass doesn’t 
                        need showers. It doesn’t need 
                        music. And it doesn’t need any 
                        fucking beanies!

           Susie reaches out to Clive. He swats her hand away 
           instinctively, accidentally connecting roughly. Susie 
           yelps. Clive aches with regret, but turns his face away 
           from Susie to hide it. 

           Susie stands. She’s distraught. Her hands shake. Clive 
           returns his stare to the skylight.

                                 SUSIE
                        I’m...ah...gonna head out for a 
                        bit. Get some groceries. OK?
           No response from Clive. 

           Susie leaves a bottle of pills and a glass of water within 
           Clive’s reach. She switches the TV on, mutes its sound and 
           drops the remote control beside him. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back. As soon as I can.

           Susie grabs her bag, phone, keys. At the front door, Susie 
           turns to Clive. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Clive?

           Susie waits for something from Clive, anything, but gets 
           nothing. She leaves.

                                 CLIVE
                        Run, Susie! Run..run...run...

           Clive draws deep breaths. Their sound melds with those of 
           the even breaths taken during exercise.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Run...run...

           The sound of feet pounding turf in constant, steady rhythm.

           INT. GYM. DAY. **FLASHBACK**

           A pair of sneakered feet strike a treadmill’s belt.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Run. Gravity. Heavy with gravity. 
                        I am heavy. (whispers) Run. Run.

           Bare calves stretch and strain. Thighs ripple with sinew, 
           each stride producing a distinct pattern that flashes to 
           life, then quickly fades away.

           Clive runs. He is in rapturous focus.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive, wet with perspiration, roams through the gym. He 
           sees athletes pull cables, lift barbells. Their movements 
           are charged with ambition, executed with grace.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive lies on his back on an exercise mat. He throws his 
           legs up, points his feet to the ceiling. Contracts and 
           releases his calf muscles in turn, left-right-left. Clive 
           watches them fondly, through half-open eyes. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive lies on his back. But above him, now, is only the 
           skylight. Only the sky. Unreachable.

           Clive turns his head towards the TV.

           ONSCREEN: the news. Soldiers march, power through drills, 
           run from gunfire. 

           Clive points the remote control at the TV, switching to: 

           Sports. Men chase balls, cycle bikes, swim in the sea, 
           stand on surfboards.

           Click. A DIY show. A blokey man renovates a house. 

           A movie. The onscreen couple roll around together, 
           passionately. Clive eyes their entwined legs.

           Bear Grylls powers through the wilderness.

           Clive clicks channels rapidly, scrolling through images of 
           activities that are no longer available to him.

           Clive hurls the remote control at the TV. It smacks against 
           the screen, bounces off.

           Clive grabs a bottle of pills from the coffee table beside 
           him. He downs several tablets with water. He allows his 
           head to drop, heavily. Bang.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           The apartment is desolate. Clive’s eyes creak open. The 
           closed front door is the first thing he sees.

           Clive raises himself up onto his elbows and pulls himself, 
           backwards, to the kitchen. He puffs from the effort.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER.

           It’s dark. Clive stretches up to the light switch, but 
           can’t reach it. He can barely see. He can barely move. 

           Clive rummages around within a low kitchen cupboard.

           Clive urinates into a soup pot. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT. 

           Clive drags himself across the room on his stomach. His 
           skin scrapes against the floorboards. Clive grabs a cushion 
           from the couch. He lies front-down onto it and ‘surfs’ the 
           floorboards to the front door.
           Clive sits up, faces the front door. He waits.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive sits, encircled by his ‘things’. Suit pants. Ties. 
           Wallet. Watch. A coffee mug. He surveys them.

           Clive moves to a low table. Laptops and devices are lined 
           up like soldiers. Clive picks up his phone. Feels the 
           weight of it. He turns it on. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive is surrounded by active screens, his face illuminated 
           by their collective cold white. He operates them all at 
           once, in a searching frenzy.

           Flashes of personal messages [“where are you?” “we heard 
           about your accident” “so sorry to hear”]; professional 
           photos of a suited Clive; online reports [“Clive Matthews, 
           CEO, in sickening accident”]. 

           Clive holds his head in his hands. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive howls as he slams the iPhone against the corner of 
           the table. Its screen cracks. Clive swings an iPad, smashes 
           a laptop with it. Soon, all the computers are in pieces.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive feeds himself a handful of pills. He sees that there 
           are six tablets left in the bottle. He takes them too.  

                                                        CUT TO BLACK.

           The sound of the front door opening and closing. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           [POINT OF VIEW] We open our eyes. We see Susie coming through 
           the front door, carrying bags of purchases. She runs to us. 
           She wears a brightly coloured outfit. Her hair has been done. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Guess what! I got us in to see 
                        the best rehab doctor tomorrow!

           She bounds away. We ogle her legs. Lithe and long.

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        Clive! What happened to all the 
                        computers?!

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           [POINT OF VIEW] It’s blurry. Susie potters. A dog’s soft 
           whine floats through.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive sleeps, his head on Susie’s lap. Susie strokes his 
           hair. Clive wakes. He looks up at Susie. She smiles. He 
           doesn’t. 

                                 SUSIE
                        Hungry?

           Clive says nothing. Does nothing. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t gone too long, was I? 
                        Were you OK on your own?

           Clive’s eyes are vacant.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I thought I should leave you for 
                        a bit. Give you some space. 

           She seems to be persuading herself.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I missed you. Did you miss me?

           A dog’s whimper. Susie wipes away the water collecting in 
           her eyes before tears can form. She perks up.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s someone here you have to 
                        meet!

           Clive is alarmed. 

                                 CLIVE
                        What? No..no...

           Susie eases Clive off her lap, gets up. She disappears 
           behind him. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Susie! Susie?!

           Susie appears before Clive cradling a 10-week-old mixed 
           breed PUPPY. The puppy is asleep in Susie’s hands. He’s 
           completely trusting, helpless. And adorable. 
                                 SUSIE
                        Clive. Meet Barry. The newest 
                        member of our family. 

           Susie is excited. Clive looks at her, dumbfounded.

                                 CLIVE
                        What have you done?

           Susie ignores Clive. 

                                 SUSIE 
                        Isn’t he beautiful?

           But Clive won’t look at BARRY. He is consumed by anger.

                                 CLIVE
                        Get him out of here!

                                 SUSIE
                        Clive...

                                 CLIVE
                        I mean it! Now!

           Susie shakes her head. Clive seethes.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Susie. I want him gone.

           Susie hugs Barry close, her lifeline. Clive regards her, 
           the two of them. And he feels impossibly far away.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        And I want you to go too.  

           Susie looks at Clive, the wind knocked out of her. Clive is 
           steely.  

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I want you to leave, Susie.

                                 SUSIE
                        You can’t be serious.

           He is.

                                 CLIVE
                        I do need space. You were right.

                                 SUSIE
                        No, I shouldn’t have left you on 
                        your own. That was a bad idea.

           Clive’s eyes are cold. Susie kneels down to him.
                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m back now, baby. I want to 
                        stay here. With you.

                                 CLIVE
                        No, you don’t.

                                 SUSIE
                        Of course I do.

           But Susie doesn’t know what she wants.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m your wife. I love you.

           Clive is unmoved.

                                  CLIVE
                        I don’t need your love. I don’t 
                        need your help. I don’t need your 
                        comfort. I don’t need your pity. 

           Susie winces, stung. But Clive is resolved.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t need anything anymore. 

           Susie is shattered. Barry cries intuitively. Susie cuddles 
           him, looks around. She can’t conceive of any way to deal 
           with this.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Go, Susie.

           She shakes her head, furiously. Like a child.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (raves)
                        Goooooooo!!!!

           Susie carefully puts Barry down. He doesn’t move.

           Susie hastily collects her bag, keys, gathers some clothes. 
           Tears drop from her eyes. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Susie stands at the front door, watching Clive. He remains 
           motionless. Emotionless.

           Clive hears the front door close. He exhales. Continues to 
           stare up at the skylight.  

           Barry whines. Clive turns to see the tiny dog standing 
           exactly where Susie left him. 
                                 CLIVE 
                        Fuck.

           Clive returns his stare, above. In moments, he hears Barry 
           tread through the apartment. Hears his sniffing. The patter 
           of his pads against the floorboards, starting and stopping.

           Then, silence. Clive turns to see Barry creeping 
           soundlessly along a rug in Clive’s direction.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Stay away from me.

           Clive’s tone is severe and stops Barry in his tracks. Barry 
           changes direction, skips away. Clive, again, looks up.

           A trickle hits the floorboards. Barry pees in the corner. 

           Clive closes his eyes.

           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. [MUTE] **ANOTHER TIME**

           On Clive’s face, his eyes closed. 

           Clive runs. And runs.

           The sound of a dog crying.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM / BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Barry whines. Clive wakes. The kitchen’s light spills into 
           the room. Clive sees Barry huddled in a dark corner. 

           Clive moves himself, backwards, to the bedroom. Barry 
           recedes from his view.

                                 CLIVE
                        Don’t you look at me like that! I 
                        didn’t bring you here!

           Barry starts towards Clive. Clive picks up the pace. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        No! Back! Get away!

           Barry closes in on Clive, but Clive makes it inside the 
           bedroom and slams the door shut behind him.  

           Clive leans against the door, exhausted. He hears Barry 
           crying, on the other side.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Shut up.

           Silence. Then, a scratch at the door. 
                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Fucking shut up! I swear!

           Quiet again. Clive hauls himself towards the bed. He grabs 
           a bottle of pills from the bedside table. He tips out the 
           last four tablets and swallows them, dry. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING.

           Clive sleeps on the floor, beside the mattress. He wakes with 
           a start. He clutches his stumps, the pain excruciating.

           Clive snatches the pill bottle beside the bed. It’s empty. 
           He tosses it onto the already cluttered floor.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING.

           Clive explodes from the bedroom with all the speed he can 
           muster. Barry lies under the coffee table.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Fevered, Clive hunts for relief. He rifles through 
           accessible piles, upturns pillows and furniture, but 
           everything seems jumbo-sized and out of reach. And all the 
           pill boxes and bottles he finds are empty. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive wails in pain. He grabbles for his cramping legs. But 
           finds only negative space. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive discovers a box of Panadol within a stack of 
           magazines. He pops out the pills, eagerly downs them with 
           Whiskey glugged straight from the bottle. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive leans against the couch. Still. 

           Clive eyes Susie’s scarf, lying across the couch. Her 
           sunglasses on the coffee table. The mark of her lips left 
           on a drinking glass. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive sits, watching the front door. Waiting. 

           Clive turns to Barry. Barry watches Clive from his usual 
           corner. Also waiting.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Clive lies on the floor on his side, staring at the 
           blowfly. It lies dead, on its back, pointed up towards the 
           closed high window above.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive lies on his back. Looking up through the skylight. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           Clive sleeps in bed. Clanking noises sound from the other 
           room. Signs of life. Clive’s eyes burst open.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive barrels in clumsily from the bedroom.

                                 CLIVE
                        Susie?

           Clive’s face falls as he realises it was Barry who caused 
           the commotion. Cushions are torn, their stuffing exposed. 
           Plates have been knocked over. Tissues are in shreds. And 
           Barry is amongst it all.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!

           Barry looks up from the wreckage. Clive scuttles to him and 
           Barry scoots to his safe corner at the far end of the room.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you do this? To get my 
                        attention? Well, fuck you! You’re 
                        not getting it!

           Clive scurries to Barry. Barry quivers, petrified.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I bet you’re hungry, huh? I bet 
                        you’re scared. I bet you want me 
                        to feed you and give you a hug 
                        and make it all better. Well bad 
                        luck for you, dog! You got stuck 
                        with the wrong arsehole! You are 
                        not getting shit from me! I’ve 
                        got nothing to give. Nothing!

           Clive’s raving sets him off balance and he falls over 
           gracelessly. He bangs the floor in frustration. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!!
           Clive turns over, onto his back. He can just see through 
           the skylight from his position. The sun is almost overhead. 

           Barry steps away from his corner. Slinks towards Clive.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t try it. I’m warning you.

           But Barry continues, undeterred. His young gait is awkward.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Stay the fuck away from me!

           Barry gets closer. Clive wheezes. In anticipation.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I hate you! You fucking thing!

           Barry approaches Clive. So slowly.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I hate you.

           Clive’s voice cracks. 

           Barry sniffs the air around Clive. He brings his nose to 
           Clive’s stumps, investigating. Clive kicks his stumps out 
           at Barry, wildly. Barry side-steps, evading them. 

           Clive listens keenly for information. There’s no sound.

           Barry appears at Clive’s head. Clive doesn’t move. Barry’s 
           nose scrapes against Clive’s face as he sniffs him, learns 
           him. Clive clenches his hand into a shaking fist, trying to 
           summons a monster within himself. 

           The sound of Barry’s sniff is suddenly loud inside Clive’s 
           ear. Its intensity makes Clive’s breath catch. The sound of 
           life. Clive holds his look on the skylight, on the sun 
           above, whose rays now stream onto Clive. Into him.

           Barry explores Clive’s face. He sniffs Clive’s eyelids, 
           cheeks, forehead, his hair. Barry continues across Clive’s 
           body, his arms, Clive’s closed fist.

                                 CLIVE
                            (weak)
                        I hate you...

           Barry nuzzles his nose into Clive’s hand until Clive’s fist 
           unclenches, his fingers unfurl. Barry lies down, curls up 
           to Clive. He rests his head within Clive’s palm. And in 
           seconds, Barry is asleep. 

           And Clive’s body relaxes. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATER. 

           Barry sleeps on Clive’s chest. His whole self rises and 
           falls with Clive’s breaths. Clive studies Barry. His fine 
           whiskers, his pristine coat. Barry yawns in his sleep, 
           revealing baby tic tac teeth. 

           Clive slowly brings a hand towards Barry. And touches him. 
           Clive gently strokes Barry. Feels his warmth. His fragile, 
           burgeoning life.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Bags of groceries sit on the bench where Susie left them. 
           Like aging still-life paintings. Clive stares up at them.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive opens the fridge. He grabs the sole milk carton.

           Clive reaches high within a drawer. He searches blindly 
           within it, retrieves a bowl. Clive puts it on the floor, 
           pours milk into it. Barry watches Clive from the doorway, 
           inquisitive about every little thing.

                                 CLIVE
                        Come here, Barry.

           Barry is wary. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. You need to eat.

           Barry doesn’t move. Clive dips a finger into the milk and 
           stretches towards Barry. Barry steps over to Clive, his 
           curiosity overwhelming him. Barry sniffs Clive’s finger, 
           looks at Clive, full of inquiry. Clive nods, encouragingly. 

           Barry tentatively licks the milk from Clive’s finger. Clive 
           draws Barry to the bowl and soon, Barry is lapping the milk 
           up from it. Clive watches Barry drink, warmed.

           A key in the front door. Clive jerks his head towards it.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive charges into the main room.

                                 CLIVE
                        Susie?

           Barry dashes out from the kitchen. He quickly gets ahead of 
           Clive, runs to the front door.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Barry! Stay back!
           Clive slams his hand down on the floor authoritatively but 
           Barry doesn’t obey. The front door opens...revealing...

           ROSA (60s). A diminutive Eastern European woman. Clive is 
           speechless.  

                                 ROSA
                        Away, doggie!

           Rosa nudges Barry from the door and edges inside the 
           apartment. Clive pulls a blanket from the nearby couch and 
           covers his stumps with it.

                                 CLIVE
                        Hey, get out! You’re in the wrong 
                        apartment! 

                                 ROSA
                        This 18A, yes? Mr. Clive?

           Clive hushes, his mind racing.  

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Amputations, yes?

           Clive can only blink in response. Rosa steps to Clive.

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        I am Rosa. Carer. From Agency. I 
                        come to clean, to cook. 

                                 CLIVE
                        I didn’t call for any carer.

                                 ROSA
                        No. You is patient. Mrs. Clive, 
                        she is client. 

           Clive shakes his head.

                                 CLIVE
                        There’s been a mistake. My wife 
                        will be back soon, thank you.

           Clive moves to the door, signalling Rosa to leave. She 
           doesn’t.

                                 ROSA
                        You patient. No client. I stay.

           Rosa steps past Clive, heads further into the apartment. 
           She sees puddles of dog pee, mess and mayhem. 

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        My God.

           Clive trails behind Rosa. He catches a glimpse of first aid 
           paraphernalia inside her shoulder bag and his spirits rise.
                                 CLIVE
                        Hey, do you have painkillers on 
                        you? I’ve got a lot of pain in 
                        my...where my legs used to be. 

           Rosa spins around to face Clive.

                                 ROSA
                        I no Doctor. I carer. You need 
                        Doctor, I call Doctor for you.

           Clive is disappointed.

                                 CLIVE
                        No, I don’t want a Doctor. 

                                 ROSA
                        No Doctor, no drugs.

                                 CLIVE
                        I don’t want a Doctor. And I 
                        don’t want a carer! 

           Rosa is affronted. Clive composes himself.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m sorry for your trouble. 
                        But I’d like you to leave now.

           Rosa smiles sweetly, shakes her head.

                                 ROSA
                        Impossible. This my job. I stay.

           Clive thinks hard for a solution.

                                 CLIVE
                        Maybe we can make a deal. What 
                        hours have you been booked for?

                                 ROSA
                        All days. And sometimes nights.

           Clive’s eyes widen.

                                 CLIVE
                        Really? For how long?

           Rosa shrugs. Clive processes the meaning behind Rosa’s 
           indefinite employment. He feels queasy. 

           Rosa takes off, tidies the room.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        No, leave it! (beat, thinks) How 
                        about this?

           Rosa turns to Clive. 
                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Tell the Agency you’re working 
                        here, but leave now and don’t 
                        come back. I won’t tell anyone. 
                        You make the money but won’t have 
                        to work for it. How’s that?

           Rosa looks at Clive, skeptical. 

                                 ROSA
                        No, I cannot do this. 

           Clive sighs.

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Your wife, she worry. She pay for 
                        caring for you.

                                 CLIVE
                        I get that but I...have a carer. 
                        My...lover. My wife doesn’t know. 

           Rosa is outraged. And very disapproving.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll get paid and I’ll get 
                        cared for. Everyone wins. OK?

           Rosa ruminates on this.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive sees Rosa out. She turns around to him. 

                                 ROSA
                        For legs pain, drug no work for 
                        you. Close eyes. Remembering legs. 
                        Feel legs, like still here. Then 
                        pain stop. Poof. Like magic. 

           Clive nods, politely. But he’s dubious.

                                 CLIVE
                        Sure. I’ll do that. Thanks.

           Rosa smiles at Clive. 

                                 ROSA
                        You nice man. 

           Clive returns a benign smile. Rosa leans down to Clive, 
           touches his face softly. Like a mother would.

                                 ROSA (CONT’D)
                        Angry, yes. But nice. 

           Clive looks at Rosa, earnestly. Wanting to believe her. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Barry sleeps in his corner. Clive sits at the front door, 
           keeping watch. Despondent, Clive turns away from the door. 
           He shuffles to the bedroom. Barry gets up, follows him.

                                 CLIVE
                        No, Barry. This is my room.

           Barry stops. Clive disappears inside the bedroom and closes 
           the door. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive leans his back against the door. Barry cries. Clive 
           drops his head, pained by the sound of pure yearning. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Barry cries on. Clive lies in bed. He stares at the pillow 
           beside him, a head’s shape imprinted on it. He reaches out 
           to it. Barry’s crying grows louder. Clive sits up quickly.

                                 CLIVE
                        Quiet!

           The jarring movement sends spasms through Clive’s ‘legs’ 
           and Clive cries out in agony. Barry’s whine continues. 
           Clive sinks down. He tears the blanket off. Closes his 
           eyes. Concentrates...

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER. **DREAM**

           Clive lies in bed, eyes closed. A slow pan down his face...

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        The lips. The throat. Adam’s apple.

           ...down his body...

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        The chest. Lungs. My heart. 
                        Abdomen. Spleen. Guts.

           The pan continues...down his naked legs. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        The groin. Quads. Vastus 
                        medialis. Lateralis. Sartorius.

           Clive activates, then relaxes, each muscle in turn. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        The hamstrings. They’re tight. 
                        Calves. Anterior heads, always 
                        overdeveloped. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLIVE (V.O.) (cont'd)
                        Left achilles tear, healed. The 
                        heels. High arches. 
                        Toes...toes...

           EXT. BEACH. DAY. **DREAM**

           Toes dip into sparkling ocean waters on a hot Summer’s day. 
           Feet plunge into the soft sand.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Tickles. Like a thousand 
                        fingertips. Like love.

           Looking back along the beach, the feet have marked the sand 
           with a trail of flawless footprints. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. **DREAM**

           Clive rolls over in his sleep. Barely awake, Clive pulls 
           back the blanket, swings himself over the edge of the bed.

           And stands straight up.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. **DREAM**

           Clive sleepily stumbles from the bedroom to the bathroom. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. **DREAM**

           Clive flips up the toilet lid within the simple bathroom. 
           It claps loudly against the cistern. 

           Clive’s eyes open. He looks down and sees...his long, hairy 
           legs, extending out from the bottom of his boxer shorts. 
           Clive breaks into a wide smile of gratitude. He pinches, 
           squeezes his legs, overjoyed.

           Clive releases a strong stream of urine. The sound of it 
           reverberates through the quiet. Clive’s eyes close in 
           satisfaction. He smiles. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING.

           On Clive’s smiling, sleeping face. 

           Clive wakes behind closed eyes. His smile dissolves. He 
           opens his eyes. Pulls back the bed sheet. He sees that he 
           still has no legs. And that he has wet himself. 

           Clive’s face twists into a tortured scowl. The scowl 
           becomes a smile. Becomes a chuckle. Becomes a roaring 
           laugh. 
           INT. APARTMENT. VARIOUS ROOMS. MORNING.

           Clive’s laughter sounds through the main room. Fills the 
           kitchen. Rebounds off the bathroom’s walls.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive pops the few remaining Panadol tablets into his 
           mouth, swallows them with the last mouthful of the Whiskey.  

           A familiar trickle sounds. Clive turns to see Barry 
           squatting in the corner.  

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Clive’s fingers grope the bench top, stretching towards a 
           cardboard box full of fruit and vegetables. Barry barks 
           baby yaps of alarm from the doorway.

           Clive springs up as best he can, and brings the box down 
           with him. He shields himself against a shower of carrots 
           and broccoli. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive rips a wall off the cardboard box, lays old 
           newspapers down inside it. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry?

           Barry is nowhere to be seen. Clive ducks his head under the 
           coffee table and finds Barry hiding there.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Come here.

           Barry won’t budge. Clive reaches under the table. Barry 
           runs away. Clive sits back up.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not going to chase you.

           Barry cavorts friskily all over the room. Clive leans this 
           way and that, and finally catches Barry. Barry squirms, 
           enjoying the game. He soft bites Clive’s hands, teething.

           Clive looks across at the box, now a distance away. Clive 
           tries to shuffle to it while holding Barry, but he can’t 
           move effectively without his hands. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Just...stay here.
           Clive puts Barry down and he immediately runs off. Clive 
           looks after him.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Barry sits atop a large pillow. Clive pulls the pillow, and 
           Barry, across the room in short bursts. Barry is amused. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           Clive lifts Barry, places him inside the ‘puppy litter’ 
           box. Barry doesn’t move. Clive sits at the box’s open wall, 
           blocking Barry’s escape. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        This is where you pee and poo. 

           Barry just looks at Clive.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Go on, do it now. Pee.

           Barry tries to get out of the box. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        No you don’t. Not until you pee. 

           Barry pulls his ears right back. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I tell you to do something and 
                        you do it. That’s training.

           Clive waits. And waits. Barry remains still.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t defy me, dog. Not that long 
                        ago, grown men would have willingly 
                        crapped into their panties if I’d 
                        asked them to. You don’t know who 
                        you’re fucking with.

           Barry trembles, not comprehending what is being asked of 
           him. Clive thinks. 

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Clive holds a bowl of milk in the air. Barry sits at 
           attention, staring at it. Clive moves the bowl left and 
           right. Barry’s eyes don’t leave it.

                                 CLIVE
                        Now we’re working together...
           Clive puts the bowl down, pours the last bit of milk into 
           it. Barry drinks it up. Clive peers into the empty carton.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive tears stale bread into pieces. Rips up slices of 
           cheese. Plops spaghetti out from a tin.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Clive opens a packet of sliced ham. Barry licks his chops 
           in expectation, his face smudged with food and sauce. Clive 
           hands Barry a chunk of meat. Barry snatches at it.

                                 CLIVE
                        Be nice.

           Barry responds, nibbles daintily at Clive’s offering. Clive 
           smiles at Barry. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Good boy.

           Barry pulls the meat away, carries it off to the main room. 

           Clive looks over the food surrounding him, his stomach 
           moaning for nourishment. He packs the food away.

           Coughing, spewing sounds from the main room. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive enters to see Barry throwing up his meal. Clive 
           scrambles over to him. Barry licks up his own vomit.

                                 CLIVE 
                        No..no...leave that.

           Clive lifts Barry up, rescuing him from his sick. Clive 
           puts Barry onto his ‘lap’ and strokes him, comforts him. 
           Barry looks up at Clive gratefully.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive searches through the cupboards. He pulls out a vacuum 
           cleaner, feather dusters...and finally finds what he was 
           looking for. A landline phone. 

           Clive plugs the phone into a line near the front door. He 
           stares at the handset, willing its function. Clive turns it 
           on. A dial tone sounds. Clive exhales, relieved.  
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive cradles the telephone, looking through take-away 
           menus. He chooses one, makes a call.

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        Hi. Do you deliver?

           Clive scrunches up the menu.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive makes another call, holding a different menu.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        Can I make an order for delivery? 
                        What, even if I pay extra?

           He hangs up. Sifts through menus. Tries another place.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        Yeah, I’d like to get some food 
                        delivered. 

           Clive listens, heartened. He points his thumb up at Barry. 
           Barry looks at Clive, droll, walks away.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        Actually I need puppy food. Wait, 
                        don’t hang up! I need it for my 
                        dog but I can’t go out. I’ll pay. 

           Clive picks up the menu.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, that’s fair. How much do 
                        I have to order then? 

           Clive browses the pictorial menu. The food looks good.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Just bring whatever. 15A Blake 
                        Street. And don’t forget the 
                        puppy food, yeah? Like six cans 
                        of whatever the best brand is. 
                        Oh, and some milk too..?

           They hang up. Clive is satisfied. 

           He jangles the phone in his hand. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           Clive brings the phone to his ear. It’s ringing. Clive 
           clears his throat. A voicemail welcome message clicks over.

                                 SUSIE (V.O.)
                            (through phone)
                        Hey, this is Susie...

           Clive hangs up. He drops the phone like a hotcake.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT. 

           Clive and Barry face the front door. Waiting. 

           The buzzer sounds.

           Prepared, Clive uses a pair of kitchen tongs to reach up 
           and press the button on the intercom system.

                                 CLIVE
                        Third floor.

           He hears a click, releases the button. Clive draws Barry 
           into his arms. Barry nestles in. 

           Footsteps sound down the corridor. They get closer. Barry 
           growls. Clive growls too, bares his teeth at Barry. Barry 
           barks at him. Clive smiles, impressed. 

           A knock at the door. Barry yaps, madly. Clive allows an 
           acceptable time to pass before responding.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Who is it?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Got food for y’all. And your pup.

           The man has an American accent.

                                 CLIVE
                        Can you leave it at the door?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Whatever bakes your noodle, man.

           Clive nods. This is going well.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s forty two dollars. But if 
                        you make it an even fifty, I’ll 
                        wash the dishes.

           Clive opens his wallet, releases Barry. Barry goes to the 
           door.

                                 CLIVE
                        Here’s fifty.
           Clive slides the cash under the door. He sees a pair of 
           flashy red sneakers on the other side. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        And don’t worry about the dishes.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Thanks, man!

           The sound of bags rustling. Barry sniffs under the door. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Have a good one! 

                                 CLIVE
                        Hey one more thing?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Yep, shoot.

                                 CLIVE
                        You think we can do this weekly? 
                        And getting extra stuff?

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                            (suspicious)
                        What kinda stuff?

                                 CLIVE
                        Nothing weird. Just groceries.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        You can order that shit online, 
                        bro.

           Clive looks over at the destroyed devices.

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah. No. I can’t.

           No response from the other side. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you an extra ten, no 
                        twenty bucks. Every week. OK? 

           Clive anxiously awaits the man’s answer.

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Alright. When I can, I’ll do it.

           Clive is glad.

                                 CLIVE
                        Great. Thanks. 
           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           STEFAN (28, African American) stands outside Clive’s door, 
           bags of hot meals at his feet. Stefan is a hulk of a man, 
           but his gentleness is just as visible as his strength.

                                 STEFAN
                        ‘Til next time.

           Stefan heads down the hall.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. SAME TIME.

           Clive listens to footsteps retreating down the hallway. He 
           picks Barry up, holds him tight.

                                 CLIVE
                        Stay...stay...

           Barry pulses with excitement.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           Stefan spies the length of the hall from around a far 
           corner. The hallway is empty except for bags of food and a 
           pizza box sitting before one of the doors. 

           An apartment door opens. An arm reaches out, low to the 
           floor, takes the bags and pizza. Stefan watches, intrigued.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive spoons puppy food out of its tin and into a bowl. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Wait...

           Clive uses a strict tone and it works. Barry sits politely. 
           Clive slides the bowl towards him. Barry lunges at it.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Barry stops. He looks up at Clive. Clive controls him with 
           his stare.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        OK.

           Barry’s face dives into the bowl. Clive turns and sees the 
           bags and pizza box standing at the front door. 

           Clive drops a pillow onto his lap and moves to the 
           packages. He places the pizza box onto the cushion and 
           shuffles back to Barry. 
           Clive opens the box and steam flows out. Barry looks up, 
           mid-chew. Clive pulls a slice of pizza from its constituent 
           whole. Hangs it before his face. Slowly, so slowly, Clive 
           leans towards it. Like a kiss. A first kiss. 

           Clive bites the pizza. He savours the sensation. Its heat. 
           Its flavours. The feeling of the morsel moving around 
           within his mouth. Barry resumes his meal. Clive bites at 
           the pizza again, and again. 

           Clive smiles at Barry. And Barry smiles back at him.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive heads towards the bedroom. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Night, Barry.

           Clive turns and sees Barry lying under the table, watching 
           after Clive longingly. Clive continues to the bedroom, 
           opens the door. He stops. Turns his head around.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive and Barry both sleep soundly, in Clive’s bed. 

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME. KITCHEN. DAY. **FLASHBACK**

           YOUNG CLIVE (4) sits alone at a kitchen table. His bare 
           legs swing through the air, over the end of the chair.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        My legs dangle. Light. Free. 

           His toes reach downwards. We pan past them, to the floor.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        When will I be tall enough? When 
                        will I finally reach the ground? 

           Clive’s feet slide into frame. They are bigger, the legs 
           longer. They stretch down...the toes reach the ground. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        It happens. But I feel only 
                        sadness. Because, now, I know.

           The feet flatten on the floor.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        The lightness has gone forever.
           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING.

           Clive awakes, alone in bed. He wears only his jocks. 
           Clive’s stubble is thick. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive urinates into a pot in the corner of the room. 
           Several other full pots stand beside it. Clive is dirty, 
           dishevelled. You can almost see the stink on him.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MORNING.

           Clive enters from the bedroom. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry?

           Clive sees that Barry has made his way up furniture to 
           reach a high window. Barry looks outside, full of wonder.

           Barry turns to Clive, his eyes pleading. Clive’s shoulders 
           drop. He shakes his head. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        How about the ball instead? 
                        That’s good exercise.

           Barry’s tail wags, hopefully.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           Clive rummages through bags and suitcases. 

                                 CLIVE
                        There’s definitely one here.

           Clive pulls the wardrobe doors open. Looks inside. Pauses. 

           Clive retrieves the ornate wooden box. He opens it and it 
           produces its familiar squeak. Clive peeks inside...and 
           closes the box. 

           He buries it at the back of the wardrobe. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive swigs from a bottle of Coke, puts it down beside him. 
           He holds up a squash ball. Barry stares at Clive.

                                 CLIVE
                        Don’t look at me, look at the 
                        ball. 

           Clive points the ball at Barry. Barry sniffs it.
                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Good. OK, ready?

           Barry looks at Clive.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Go...get it!

           Clive tosses the ball past Barry. The ball bounces beyond. 
           Barry doesn’t react to it at all.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive tosses the ball. Barry keeps his eyes on Clive.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive throws the ball. Barry turns to watch it go. Clive 
           cheers.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Barry sleeps on the floor. The ball bounces past him.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive searches for the ball, tired. He’s the one getting a 
           workout. Clive spots the ball under the couch. He reaches 
           towards it. Clive spots a dog turd nearby.

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry!

           Clive turns and sees Barry sniffing the mouth of Clive’s 
           open Coke bottle.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Barry, no!

           Startled, Barry flinches and knocks the bottle over. The 
           drink pours out, all over the floor. Barry runs away. Clive 
           looks at the turd, at the drink. Exasperated.

           Growling sounds from the bedroom. Clive looks towards it.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           Clive appears at the doorway to see Barry tugging on the 
           bed’s blanket. It’s ripping.

                                 CLIVE
                        Hey! Stop that now!

           Barry darts around the side of the bed.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Barry! Come back here!
           Clive rounds the bed and sees Barry hunched in the corner.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I said, come here!

           Barry turns his face away, rebelliously. Clive ignites. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you disobey me!

           Clive scampers to Barry. Clive looms over Barry, raises his 
           hand. Barry braces himself against whatever is to come. Clive 
           freezes. He stares at his hand in disgust. Clive pats Barry. 
           Barry shrinks away from Clive, still on guard.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I’d never hurt you. It’s OK. I’ll 
                        never hurt you. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Barry stands in his litter box, his tail between his legs. 
           Clive sits at the box’s open door.  

                                 CLIVE
                            (to himself)
                        Why won’t you use the box?

           Clive and Barry face off.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        OK. So I’m Barry. 

           Clive drops down to Barry’s level. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        And I need to piss. What do I do?

           Clive crawls around on his stomach, looking for clues. 
           Barry takes his opportunity and sneaks out of the box.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not random. Something is 
                        telling me...where...to...go. 

           Clive finds an old turd and aging urine stains in the 
           corner. He sees the same in a different corner. Clive looks 
           up, around. These corners are safe. And discreet.

           Clive looks back at the litter box. It’s right in the 
           middle of the room. Clive turns to Barry.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        So you lick your balls in front 
                        of me but you crap in private?

                                                           CUT TO:
           Clive pushes the box into a quiet corner. Barry watches 
           from afar, nonplussed.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. AFTERNOON.

           Heavy rain. Several bar heaters are alight. 

           Clive lies on the floor on his back, topless. Raindrops 
           pelt the skylight above him. Barry sits at his window, 
           watching the rain splash against it.

                                 CLIVE
                        I could do anything. Surf 10 foot 
                        waves. Ski triple black runs. 
                        Bench 250 pounds. I hiked the 
                        fucking Kokoda trail, Barry! 

           Barry turns around to Clive. 

           Clive’s sorrow is endless.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I could do anything...anything...

                                                     TIME LAPSE TO:

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Day has become night. Clive still stares up at the 
           skylight, swimming in memories. Barry lies on the couch. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                            (whispers)
                        ...anything...anything...

           The skylight’s glass has become reflective, by night. It 
           mirrors Clive, producing an image of him that ends at his 
           waist. Clive is mesmerised by the sight.

                                                           CUT TO:

           [POINT OF VIEW] Susie’s face appears above us, on top of 
           us. She laughs. We grip her and roll into a wrestle.

           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. **FLASHBACK**

           Clive and Susie complete the roll, in bed, within a swanky 
           bedroom. They wear only their underwear. Clive has legs.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive and Susie sleep together, a pair of spoons. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           Clive and Susie dance, elegantly. Susie folds into Clive, 
           then twirls away. He lets her go... 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE NIGHT.

           TV ONSCREEN: a woman spins. Her dancing partner reaches out 
           for her and she returns to him. They melt into each 
           together, become part of the same being.

           Clive lies atop cushions spread across the floor. He 
           watches the silent TV, downhearted, his stumps silhouetted 
           against the bright screen. Against the dancing couple.  

           A muted trickle. Clive turns tiredly towards it and sees 
           Barry, squatting in his puppy toilet. 

           Clive, finally, allows himself to smile. 

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           A home in absolute decay. Dirty plates and bowls cover the 
           floor. Rubbish is everywhere. A sound pattern repeats: ball 
           bouncing, paws trotting, paws scraping, ball bouncing...

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           Pots full of human excrement are scattered, clothes are 
           strewn. The ball/scurry sound pattern continues.

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. DAY.

           The bathroom looks abandoned, coated by a film of filth.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. / APARTMENT HALLWAY. DAY.

           Clive wears a light beard, jocks, and nothing else. Clive 
           eats cereal as he throws a tennis ball to Barry who chases 
           after it, catches it masterfully, and returns it to Clive. 

           Most of Barry’s puppy fat has gone. He’s obsessed with this 
           game. He pants, but nothing will stop him playing on.

           Clive admires Barry’s movement. His four legs, working in 
           unison. His youth. His potential.

           The buzzer sounds. 

           Clive and Barry both zip to the door. Clive picks up the 
           tongs left beside it, uses them to press the intercom 
           button. Barry dives onto Clive’s lap. He looks up at Clive, 
           adoringly. Clive burrows his nose into Barry’s fur.

           Footsteps sound down the hall. A ‘usual’ knock at the door. 
                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                            (girly voice)
                        Housekeeping.

           Clive smiles, plays along. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Can’t you read the sign? It says 
                        ‘Do Not Disturb’!

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        But sir, I’ve come all this way! 
                        And in my rush I forgot to put on 
                        any underwear!

           Clive laughs. Stefan grins at the sound of it - he likes 
           this guy.

                                 CLIVE
                        What do I owe you?

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        Hundred and nineteen.

           Clive looks in his wallet. There’s not much cash in there.

                                 CLIVE
                        Can we do plastic?

                                 STEFAN
                        Sure, no problem. 

           Clive passes a credit card to Stefan under the door.

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        I just gotta sight ya. Open up 
                        and we’ll get sorted.

           Clive’s eyes boggle. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Ahh...can’t we just...

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        It’s procedure, my man. You could 
                        be any fricken body.

                                 CLIVE
                        But you know me. Clive Matthews.

                                 STEFAN
                        Yeah. I’m Stefan and my mama’s 
                        Frida. But I still gotta put my 
                        eyes on you and your ID, bro.

           Clive is distressed. 
                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                            (low voice)
                        There’s nothin’ you are that I 
                        ain’t seen before. I promise you.

           Barry looks up at Clive, confident. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Just keep your leathers and 
                        chains on and open the damn door!

           Clive toughens. He grips Barry close, edges the door open. 

           Clive looks up. He sees Stefan but it takes Stefan a moment 
           to find Clive, down on the floor. It’s a quaint sight - 
           Clive sitting with Barry on his lap. It’s not obvious that 
           Clive doesn’t have any legs.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, there y’all are!

           Stefan smiles at Clive and Barry kindly. Barry leaps off 
           Clive and flies out the door.

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry!

           Clive clambers after Barry, tumbling over in the process. 
           Stefan takes off after Barry.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Barry! Stay!

           Barry triggers and comes to a grinding, obedient halt. 
           Stefan swoops him up.

                                 STEFAN
                            (to Barry)
                        Where you runnin’ to so fast?

           Stefan heads back to the apartment, carrying Barry. Clive is 
           splayed on his stomach in the hall, his double amputation now 
           very apparent. Stefan is jolted by the sight.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.

           Clive wriggles himself back up to sitting.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit, lemme help you, man...

                                 CLIVE
                        I’m fine!

           Stefan backs off.
                                 STEFAN
                        Alright then. I’ll just drop the 
                        bags and the furry dude inside.

           Clive has no chance to argue. Holding Barry, Stefan picks 
           up the groceries and thuds past Clive, into the apartment. 
           Clive follows him.

                                 CLIVE
                        Wait! Stop!

                                 STEFAN 
                        Woaw! Somebody die in here?

           Stefan screws his nose up dramatically. Clive chases after 
           Stefan, humiliated. He thrusts his credit card up towards 
           Stefan’s back.

                                 CLIVE
                        Here! Take the card.

           Stefan doesn’t. He puts Barry and the bags down and roams 
           around the apartment, enthralled.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Don’t go in there!

           Stefan tours through the kitchen, bedroom. Everywhere.

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        Man, that’s disgusting!

                                 CLIVE
                        You’re breaching my privacy!

           Stefan returns.

                                 STEFAN
                        Y’all can’t live like this! This 
                        is some seriously fucked up shit.

                                 CLIVE
                        Take the card!

           Stefan fumes. He reluctantly takes Clive’s credit card from 
           him. They complete the transaction in silence.

                                 STEFAN
                        I should call the RSPCA on you.

                                 CLIVE
                        Just get the fuck out of here.

           Stefan towers over Clive.

                                 STEFAN
                        You gonna make me, sport?
           Stefan suddenly seems a menacing presence. Clive quiets, 
           realising his vulnerability.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        If you wanna kick me out, then go 
                        ahead and do it with whatever 
                        feet you got left. ‘Cause all 
                        your pissin’ and shittin’ all 
                        over the place won’t do nothin’!

           Barry barks a feeble young bark at Stefan, full of spirit.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, pup! Fight! Protect 
                        your tiny ass against the world!

           Clive burns. Barry barks on and on.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m goin’. 

           Stefan struts flamboyantly to the front door, his burly frame 
           a curious counterpoint to his effeminate manner.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not coming back ‘til you 
                        got this place all cleaned up! 

           Stefan leaves. As soon as the door’s closed, Clive erupts.

                                 CLIVE
                        You faggot!! Fucking faggot gay 
                        fucking prick bastard!!!

           Clive slams his fists against the door, against the 
           floorboards, screams. Barry barks at the door. 

           Clive smacks himself. His body. He pounds his stumps over 
           and over. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive exerts his vengeance on the apartment. He tips over 
           toilet pots. Rips up papers. Smashes plates. Barry’s 
           metronomic barks punctuate the strikes of Clive’s violence.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MORNING.

           Clive sits still, in the middle of the room. Barry sleeps 
           on the couch. Clive takes a slow look around at the 
           apartment, at the destruction he caused. Ashamed. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. DAY.

           Solemn, Clive empties toilet pots into the toilet bowl.
           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Clive stacks dirty dishes.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive tips bits of broken crockery into a rubbish bag. He 
           spies a note amongst the rubble. Picks it up. Susie’s 
           handwriting and doodles are scrawled on it. Clive traces a 
           finger across the pen marks. A caress. 

           Clive drops the note into a rubbish bag.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive lugs a blanket, loaded with rubbish, across the room. 
           Barry dives on top. Clive tries to shoo him off but Barry 
           won’t be moved. 

           Clive pulls Barry along with the load.

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive leans into the shower, washing plates and cutlery in 
           the stream. Something captures Clive’s attention. He turns 
           the water off. It leaves a constant drip.

           Clive puts down the plate he was holding. He leans low, 
           inspects a tiny insect that has been splashed by water. The 
           insect battles courageously for life, struggling against 
           the pull of water beads around him. 

           Clive grabs a box of tissues nearby, rushes to the insect. 
           It has nearly been consumed by a water drop. Clive touches 
           a tissue to the water around the insect, soaking it up. The 
           insect is freed. But it doesn’t move.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Come on. You’re OK. 

           The insect shakes. Clive is jubilant. He places a dry 
           tissue before the insect. The insect crawls onto it.

           Clive carries the tissue holding the insect to the other 
           side of the bathroom, lays it down. Safe. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           Clive sorts through boxes and suitcases, forms piles of 
           clothes. Mischievous growls sound behind Clive. Clive turns 
           to see Barry rolling on his back among socks and ties. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Leave that, Barry.
           But Clive isn’t committed to the command and Barry knows 
           it. He continues his frolic.

           Clive grabs the end of a tie hanging from Barry’s mouth and 
           tugs on it lightly. Barry flips upright, dives back on his 
           haunches. Clive drops down onto his stomach. Barry growls. 
           Clive growls back. Both are thoroughly enjoying themselves.

           Clive lets the tie go and Barry shoots off to the main room 
           with it in his mouth. Clive ponders. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY. 

           Clive ties a necktie around a drawer handle. He pulls on 
           the tie and the drawer opens easily. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Barry yanks on the necktie, tied to the drawer handle. The 
           drawer opens. Clive celebrates, hugs Barry.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           A tie in his mouth, Barry drags a package attached to the 
           tie across the room to Clive. Clive gives Barry a treat. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM / MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive sits against the far bedroom wall. He throws a ball 
           out of the room, to the front door. We follow the ball and 
           see that the whole apartment is spick and span.

           Barry sprints after the ball, slows, catches it in his 
           mouth with aplomb. He brings the ball to Clive, proud of 
           himself.

                                 CLIVE
                        Now grab the phone for me?

           Barry drops the ball, jogs off. Clive digs around in his 
           pocket for a treat. Scraping sounds beyond. Barry returns 
           with the phone, pulling it via a necktie tied to it.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

           Barry noses around within Clive’s hand for his treat as 
           Clive makes a call. Clive tosses the ball. Barry chases it. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        Hey. Lemme speak to Stefan.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive opens the front door, holding Barry. Stefan is on the 
           other side, an eyebrow arched. Barry’s tail wags happily.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive, Barry and Stefan sit together on the floor, all 
           eating dinner. Stefan surveys the newly-tidied environs. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Not a bad place you got here.

           Stefan inhales, theatrically.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        And fresh as a daisy! 

                                 CLIVE
                        I did it for you, not me. 

                                 STEFAN 
                        What, you like living in your own 
                        shit?

           Clive nonchalantly swigs from a can of drink, not giving 
           anything away. Stefan munches his meal. He notices the 
           wheelchair in the corner of the room.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Now there’s a nice ride.

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s yours if you want it. I 
                        don’t use it.

                                 STEFAN
                        Why not?

           Clive fidgets with the drink can. Stefan turns to Barry.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Barry)
                        Why don’t he use the chair?

           Barry pants at Stefan.

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry.

           Barry plods over to Clive, half sits on him. Clive pulls 
           Barry’s meal towards them.

                                 STEFAN
                        He’s good with you, huh. Does 
                        whatever you say.
                                 CLIVE
                        He’s helpless. What choice has he 
                        got?

           Clive cuts a look through Stefan, emphasising his point.

                                 STEFAN
                        Come on, man...

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s fine. I get how things are. 
                        You won. And it’s fine. Really. 

           They all continue eating.

                                 STEFAN
                        So what happened to your legs?

           Clive drops his fork. It clangs against his plate. Barry 
           looks up.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey it’s not everyday you meet a 
                        dude with no legs.

           Clive eyes his food, suddenly not very hungry. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Well?

                                 CLIVE
                        What does it matter? 

                                 STEFAN
                        Just curious, man. If it don’t 
                        matter, then why not tell me?

           Clive pats Barry’s head. 

                                 CLIVE
                        It was a Saturday morning. I was 
                        outside a shop, looking in the 
                        window. At bed sheets (laughs). 
                        How stupid, right? Fucking linen!

           Clive stops laughing.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        A car drove off the road and into 
                        me. Could’ve happened to anyone. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Man, I’m sorry.

                                 CLIVE
                        For the accident or for bringing 
                        it up?
                                 STEFAN
                        It don’t need bringing up. It’s 
                        right there on you. Plain as day.

           Clive pushes his food aside.

                                 CLIVE
                        Well this has been fun.

                                 STEFAN
                        So how do you...do shit?  

           Clive looks at Stefan blankly.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Like, out in the world?

                                 CLIVE
                        You do that for me.

                                 STEFAN
                        That’s it? That’s all you got?

           Clive pats Barry.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You got no family?

           Clive shakes his head.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        No friends? 

                                 CLIVE
                        There’s no one. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Except him, right? You got him.

           Stefan gestures to Barry. Clive smiles at Barry.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        What happened to the other guy?

           Clive turns to Stefan, questioningly.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        The fucker who drove his wheels 
                        into your legs?

           Clive looks back to Barry.

                                 CLIVE
                        He died. Right in front of me.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive sees Stefan out. Stefan scans a shopping list.

                                 STEFAN
                        Anything else?

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah, actually.

           Stefan turns around. Clive is sheepish.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You think you could, maybe, one 
                        day, take Barry to the park? I’ll 
                        pay you whatever you want. He’s 
                        never been outside. Ever. And...

                                 STEFAN
                        Man, I would love to do that. For 
                        both of you.

           Clive smiles, appreciative.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        But I won’t. 

           Clive’s smile fades.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You will. 

           Clive is flabbergasted.

                                 CLIVE
                        And how the hell am I supposed to 
                        do that?

                                 STEFAN
                        Just open the door and go.

           Clive looks down at his stumps.

                                 CLIVE
                        What, like this?

                                 STEFAN
                        In that goddamn chair, fool!

                                 CLIVE
                        That’s not what I mean.

                                 STEFAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 CLIVE
                        You expect me to go out, in 
                        public, like this?
           Stefan shrugs, innocently. Clive scoffs.

                                 STEFAN
                        What’s your damn problem?

                                 CLIVE
                        Isn’t it fucking obvious?

                                 STEFAN
                        Nope.

           Clive shakes his head in disbelief. Stefan persists.  

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Why do you refuse to be a person?

                                 CLIVE
                        Because I am not a person!

           Stefan is appalled at this concept, this attitude. He 
           shoves Clive’s chest. Clive pitches backwards. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?!

                                 STEFAN
                        Well you’re a weak fucking 
                        person, that’s for damn sure.

           Clive sits up, rattled. Stefan pushes him again and Clive 
           falls back.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        See? 

                                 CLIVE
                        Stop it!

                                 STEFAN
                        Look at those puny motherfuckin’ 
                        arms! You’re skinnier than a 
                        supermodel! 

                                 CLIVE
                        There’s nothing wrong with my 
                        arms! I’m fucking strong, OK?

                                 STEFAN
                        Really?

                                 CLIVE
                        I can do thirty chins a minute!

                                 STEFAN
                        Not with them chopsticks. 
                                 CLIVE
                        I could bench 250 pounds if I 
                        wanted to! 

                                 STEFAN
                        Well why wouldn’t you want to?

           Clive looks away, exposed. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Why won’t you be a person? 

           Clive’s lips tighten into a fine line. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You lock yourself away, surround 
                        yourself with poop. You won’t 
                        smile. Won’t do or feel a damn 
                        thing!

           Clive endures the onslaught.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        So please, tell me. What. Is. 
                        Your. Damn. Problem?

                                 CLIVE
                        I’ve got no legs!!!

                                 STEFAN
                        WHO GIVES A SHIT?!

           Clive blinks at Stefan. The apartment descends into a sudden, 
           significant silence. Stefan sighs, shakes his head. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Man, if that’s all you got, then 
                        you really are one lucky fucker.

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah? How’s that?

           Stefan bends down, leans in close to Clive’s face.

                                 STEFAN 
                        ‘Cause you don’t need legs to 
                        fly.

           Clive’s breath holds. Stefan takes a long look at Clive. He 
           stands up straight, leaves through the front door.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        See you Monday, punk.

           Stefan closes the door behind him. Clive can’t move. He 
           stares at the door, Stefan’s words hanging in the air.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Barry sits at his window, looking out. Scraping sounds from 
           behind him. Barry turns to see Clive pulling the wheelchair 
           out from the corner, its locked wheels grinding against the 
           floor. Clive scoots behind the chair and pushes it towards 
           Barry. Barry sees the chair arrive beside him. 

                                 CLIVE 
                            (muttering)
                        Fucking supermodel arms...

           Clive strips the chair of its blankets. He looks up at the 
           chair’s seat. It seems very high up.  

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        That prick doesn’t know what he’s 
                        on about. Does he, Barry?

           Barry pants, his interest piqued. 

           Clive reaches up to the chair’s arms, pulls mightily...and 
           barely lifts off the floor. He drops down. Barry’s mouth 
           closes. 

           Clive looks at Barry, in utter disbelief. Clive stares back 
           at the chair. It seems an unlikely opponent.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I can bench 250, for fuck’s sake.

           Clive directs all his power towards hoisting himself up, 
           but still only manages to lift a few inches. Clive drops. 

           Clive glowers at the chair, resentfully. He seizes its arms 
           and hurls it to one side. The chair topples over. Barry 
           runs away.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive takes the ornate wooden box out from the wardrobe, 
           puts it on the floor. Clive fingers the box’s corners. He 
           opens the box, turns it over...and hundreds of loose 
           photographs pour out. A mountain of images forms.

           Clive plucks a photo at random: Clive, standing at the 
           centre of an admiring group. The image torments Clive, but 
           he wills himself on. He tosses the photo aside, sifts 
           through the pile. 

           Images flash by. Clive with family members, friends. Clive 
           as a child. Clive’s graduation. 

           Clive pauses on one photo: Clive, wearing bathers at the 
           beach. His body is cut and muscular. 
           Clive takes off his t-shirt. He looks down at his body. At 
           his arms. His chest. Tummy. Clive sees himself. He is 
           scrawny. And very, very dirty. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive pins the BEACH PHOTO to the wall.

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.

           The shower runs. Clive sits outside it, naked. He stares at 
           his stumps, wrapped in protective compression bandages. 
           They are even filthier than he is.

           Clive manoeuvres himself over the lip of the shower. He 
           inches himself towards the stream.

           The water crashes down onto Clive. He gasps from the 
           sensation. Clive drops his head, lets the water thrash 
           against his neck. From above, Clive looks like an able-
           bodied man, sitting cross-legged.

           Clive opens his eyes. His bandages are getting soaked. 
           Clive unwraps them, ring by ring. Bits of grit and flakes 
           of skin are progressively released, mix with falling water.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive throws his hips up, bringing his naked stumps into 
           his view for the first time. He runs his hands along them, 
           across their stitched seams. He pokes and prods, flexes and 
           massages. 

           Clive lets his stumps go and they slap against the puddle 
           of water collecting at the bottom of the shower. 

           Then, without warning, Clive dry retches. Violently.

           Barry appears at the doorway, called by the noise. On 
           seeing running water, Barry steps backwards, fearfully.

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s OK.

           But Barry isn’t sure. Clive reaches out to him.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on. You’ll like it.

           Barry approaches Clive, reluctantly obedient. He sniffs 
           Clive’s wet hand, licks it.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        There you go.
           Clive wets his hand under the water’s stream and pats Barry 
           with it, moistening Barry’s head. Barry recoils, but keeps 
           his trusting eyes on Clive.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        It’s OK. Come on.

           Barry steps to Clive, apprehensively. Clive picks Barry up, 
           brings him into the shower. Clive holds Barry away from the 
           stream. He wets him, one handful of water at a time. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Nice, isn’t it?

           Clive puts Barry down. The stream’s outer sprays spit on 
           Barry and his body shakes involuntarily. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive towel dries Barry. Uncomfortable, Barry waits for it 
           to be over. Clive releases Barry and he sprints away. 

           Clive eyes Barry’s trail of wet paw prints left on the 
           floorboards. Clive reaches out to them. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Walk to me. You can do it.

           Clive’s finger touches a paw prints.

           INT. SUBURBAN HOME. LIVING ROOM. DAY. **FLASHBACK**

           A typical 1970s family home. Holding adult hands, INFANT 
           CLIVE (1) is helped up to standing. His pudgy legs shake.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                            (whispers)
                        You can do it, Clive. Step. Step.  

           Infant Clive places an unsteady foot forward. His fingers 
           squeeze the stabilising hand. He takes another step.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        That’s it. One foot in front of 
                        the other. 

           The adult hand pulls away. Infant Clive’s hand hangs in the 
           air.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. DAY.

           Clive grabs a full drink bottle from the fridge. Retrieves 
           tins of food from the pantry.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           The cans and drink bottle are lined up on the floor. Clive 
           connects a small stereo to power. Barry watches on.

           Clive picks up the iPod, connected to the stereo, scrolls 
           through the options. Barry eyes Clive, quizzically. Clive 
           enters a selection. Waits.

           Led Zeppelin thunders through the speakers. Clive smiles.  

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Music blares, the song throbbing with life. 

           Clive performs bicep curls, holding the drink bottle. He 
           watches his muscles twitch, his veins engorge with blood. 

           Clive performs shoulder flies holding two tins of food. 

           Clive lowers down into a push-up, but struggles to push 
           himself back up.

           Clive shoulder presses a hefty phone book.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. AFTERNOON.

           The music stops. Clive guzzles a bottle of water. It’s so 
           refreshing. Clive gasps. He’s tingling all over.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive struggles through sit-ups, unstable. Barry sits 
           beside him. He barks each time Clive reaches the top.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING. 

           The room is empty, and very tidy. The regular rhythm of 
           Barry’s barking and pausing rings out from the main room.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. LATE AFTERNOON.

           The kitchen is empty. Barry’s barking/pausing sounds 
           through the space. The pitch of his bark has deepened. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. DAY.

           The empty bathroom is clean. Barking and pausing.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Rain tinkles the skylight. Barry snoozes on the couch. He 
           has grown considerably.

           Clive expertly powers through dozens of sit-ups. His torso 
           is bare and his beard is thick. T-shirts are tied around 
           Clive’s wrists and palms, serving as supportive ‘pads’.

           Clive flips over onto his front and into push-ups. His arms 
           are chunky, strong. Clive grunts, pushing himself on. 

           Clive collapses. He rests, lying on his stomach. Clive 
           stares at the wheelchair. It lies on its side where Clive 
           left it, several weeks earlier.

                                                         JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive restores the wheelchair to its upright position. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive looks over the bedroom wall as he unwraps his ‘pads’, 
           massages his palms. A cluster of photos has been pinned up. 

           Thunder rumbles.

           Clive scrutinises the Beach Photo. He compares his body 
           then to his current self. He is now almost as muscular as 
           he once was. 

           Clive scans the photos. He leans towards an image of a 
           smiling Susie. His nose almost touches it. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Perfect.

           Clive closes his eyes.

           MONTAGE. INT. MODERN APARTMENT. NIGHT. [MUTE] **FLASHBACK**

           A standing POV of Susie.  

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Perfect.

           The thunder grumbles louder. Barry whines.

           Clive cuddles Susie as she cooks.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Perfect.

           Clive and Susie lie on a couch, their legs linked.

           Thunder claps. Barry barks.
           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive opens his eyes, Barry’s bark shattering his reverie. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive looks around but can’t see Barry anywhere.

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry?

           Thunder cracks. Clive ducks, automatically. The storm is so 
           close it feels like it’s in the room. 

           Barry barks. Clive finds him, under the table. Terrified.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        There you are. It’s OK. It’s just 
                        a storm. We’re safe in here.

           Clive leans towards Barry. Barry backs away from him.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, what is it?

           Barry won’t look at Clive. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Barry. Come out from 
                        there. It’s just a bit of 
                        thunder.

           Clive dives a hand under the table. Barry emits a warning 
           growl. Clive pulls his hand back.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

           Barry’s growl continues. Low, but insistent. His cheeks 
           puff out and deflate. Puff out, and deflate.

           Thunder cracks again. Barry barks wildly, teeth bared.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Hey that’s not on! Get out from 
                        there, now!

           Clive rattles the table. Barry’s growl, and his 
           desperation, deepen.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I said, get out! 

           Clive thrusts both arms under the table towards Barry. 
           Barry bites Clive in a whirl of snarls and snaps.

           Clive reels backwards. Shocked. Devastated. 
           His trance broken, Barry rockets out from under the table. 
           Clive scrambles to get away from him. Barry jumps onto 
           Clive, playfully, apologetically. Clive relaxes. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you do that to me? I was 
                        trying to help you.

           Barry whimpers. He cuddles into Clive. 

           Clive looks at his hands. Blood seeps out from several 
           puncture wounds. Clive gazes at the viscous red fluid 
           pooling on his skin. 

           The lights, all the power, turn off. Clive sits up, looks 
           around, skittishly. He breathes fast and shallow. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be scared. We’re OK.

           Clive pats Barry, reassuringly. He closes his eyes, listens 
           to the storm raging. It’s savage. Alive. And soon, Clive’s 
           breath settles. He is soothed. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MORNING. 

           The morning sun lights the room. Bird song can just be 
           heard. It is unmistakably Spring. 

           Barry is curled up in bed at the end of Clive, in the space 
           where Clive’s legs would otherwise be. 

           Clive lies, awake. He investigates the scars on his hands 
           that mark where Barry bit him. He examines his knuckles. 
           The lines crisscrossing his palms. Clive forms a fist, 
           opens it. Sees his blood come to the surface.  

           Soft orchestral music plays, in the main room.

           Clive bends and extends his fingers. Touches them together. 
           Slides them against each other. His hands move into a kind 
           of dance, their shapes and shifting dynamic expressing 
           evocative emotions. They are cheeky, they argue and fight, 
           they apologise. An entire universe exists here, between 
           only these two hands. And Clive is fascinated.

           We travel past Clive, out through the open bedroom door...

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           ...to the main room, day becoming night...to find Clive, 
           lying on his back, topless. The music continues, now in 
           full force. It’s sublime.

           Clive works through a regime of core exercises. He brings 
           his hips up high, lowers them down. 
           Swings his stumps from side to side. Turns onto his front 
           and pushes up, raising his body into the air. 

           Barry watches Clive, from his windowsill. But Clive is 
           somewhere else. He mouths the music’s melody, his body’s 
           movements unconsciously flowing in sympathy to it.  

           Clive hugs himself into a tight ball. He rocks forward and 
           back, forward and back, gaining momentum...

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           ...Clive launches himself upwards. The music has stopped. 

           Clive’s hands squeeze the wheelchair’s arms, his body 
           hanging in mid-air. Clive frowns at the chair’s seat. How 
           does he get onto it from here?

           Clive drops to the floor. He lands beside Barry.

                                 CLIVE
                        That was pretty good, hey?

           Clive’s optimism is contrived. He wipes his brow, preps, 
           sets, grabs the chair’s arms, and pulls up...but again his 
           body hangs in space. Clive lowers himself. Slumps.

           Barry soars through the air from behind Clive and lands on 
           the chair’s seat. The chair lurches, then accepts Barry’s  
           weight. Barry turns around in a circle, lies down. Clive 
           just blinks at him.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM / BEDROOM. DAY.

           Bread crumbs on the coffee table. A crack in a floor board. 
           Dust sailing through the air. Dried rain drops on the window. 
           Time. Slow. 

           The apartment looks different. Imaginative flourishes are 
           peppered throughout; jars filled with colourful scraps, 
           pillows piled to form abstract structures, magazines 
           stacked into pyramids. There is cosiness, care and 
           creativity now in this home. 

           Barry sleeps on the couch. Clive sits facing a white wall, 
           pencil in hand, mid-sketch. He looks over to Barry, in 
           reference. Clive’s drawing is the beginnings of an outline 
           of Barry’s likeness. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           Clive sits facing the couch, examining a sedate Barry. 
           Clive gently lifts one of Barry’s legs, scrutinises it. 
           Clive lightly brushes his forefinger against the hairs 
           between Barry’s pads. Barry’s leg twitches. Clive smiles, 
           experiencing the tickle with him. 
           Barry suddenly flips upright, pricks his ears up. Clive 
           straightens, assumes a similar body language. They both 
           listen, but Clive can’t hear anything.

                                 CLIVE
                            (whispers)
                        What is it?

           His suspicion confirmed, Barry dives off the couch and 
           races to the door, barking. Clive rolls his eyes.

           A knock at the front door. Clive jumps. He creeps to the 
           door. The knock, again. It has an unfamiliar rhythm.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Who is it?

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        The tooth fairy. 

           Clive is relieved to hear Stefan’s voice. 

                                 CLIVE
                        How’d you get up here?

                                 STEFAN
                        I flew. Fairies can do that, you 
                        know. 

           Clive smiles. 

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        So am I coming in or should I go 
                        get us some walkie talkies?

           Clive looks around at the apartment, at himself. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Just one sec.

           Clive swings at pace to the bedroom. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive rummages through his clothes. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        Coming!

           Clive takes off his t-shirt and pulls on a singlet. It 
           shows off his muscles nicely. He pumps his arms.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive opens the front door. Stefan enters carrying bags, a 
           satchel.  
                                 STEFAN
                        Hey fuzzy! Uncle Stefan brought 
                        you a present! 

           Stefan hands Barry a dog toy. Barry takes it in his mouth 
           and it squeaks. Barry carries the treasure away, chuffed.

                                 CLIVE
                        I didn’t recognise your knock.

           Clive sits up purposefully, keen for Stefan to notice his 
           physique. But Stefan continues inside, straight past Clive. 

                                 STEFAN
                        ‘Cause I’m here as a civilian. 
                        It’s OK, yeah? Havin’ a visitor?

                                 CLIVE
                        ‘Course.

           Squeaks sound intermittently from Barry’s toy. Stefan drops 
           his satchel on the coffee table, strides to the bathroom.

                                 STEFAN 
                        Can I use the bathroom?

                                 CLIVE
                        Sure. It’s just through...

           Stefan disappears, having already found it. Clive turns to 
           Barry, sees him gnawing on his new toy. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Can you look up Yellas Vodka Bar 
                        for me? My Mac’s on the table.

           Clive sees the edge of a MacBook within Stefan’s satchel. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive sits on the floor outside the bathroom, its door 
           ajar. He opens the laptop’s lid. Looks at its black screen. 

                                 STEFAN
                        You know how to use it, right?

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah. I know how to use it.

           Clive turns the computer on.

                                 STEFAN
                        Why don’t you keep it for a 
                        while? It’s my old one anyway...

                                 CLIVE
                        Nah, it’s OK.
           Clive peeks inside the bathroom through the door’s gap. He 
           sees Stefan leaning close to his own mirrored reflection. 

                                 STEFAN 
                        I insist. It’s a window to the 
                        world, my brother. 

           Stefan glimpses Clive out of the corner of his eye.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be shy! Come on in!

                                 CLIVE
                        I was just...

           Stefan pulls opens the door, wide. Clive sees that Stefan’s 
           face is partly ‘made up’ like a woman’s. Clive is stunned.

                                 STEFAN
                        What, never seen a dude in drag 
                        before?

           Clive shakes his head, dumbly. Stefan smiles broadly.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Well then you’re in for a real 
                        treat.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATER.

           Clive and Barry sit beside each other, a waiting audience.

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        Are y’all ready?

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah.

                                 STEFAN
                        I said, are y’all ready?!

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah!!!

           Stefan glides into the room. He wears thick make up and a 
           glamorous diva’s outfit. The combination of man and woman 
           is bizarre, and exquisite. In his singlet, Clive seems a 
           very traditional male by comparison.

                                 STEFAN
                        Stefan becomes...Stephanie!

           Stefan awaits Clive’s praise. Clive is awestruck. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        In a few short hours a sweaty 
                        crowd will be chanting my name. 
                                 CLIVE
                        But...why?

                                 STEFAN
                        Because I’m gorgeous!

                                 CLIVE
                        No, why are you doing this?

                                 STEFAN
                        ‘Cause it’s who I am, sweetie. 

                                 CLIVE
                            (incredulous)
                        A woman?

                                 STEFAN
                        Yeah. On the inside. And once I 
                        finish the program and they let 
                        me get the chopedy chop, I will 
                        be a she on the outside as well.

           Stefan clutches his crotch.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        I can’t wait, man. This dingle 
                        dangler makes me crazy. 

           Clive is perplexed.

                                 CLIVE
                        But you look like a guy?

                                 STEFAN
                        I know! I been having shots for 
                        months and got nothin’ for it 
                        except sore motherfuckin’ nips!

           Stefan strokes a nipple. He notices Clive’s discomfort.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        What is it, honey cake?

                                 CLIVE
                        Nothing. 

                                 STEFAN
                        It’s OK if you think I’m sexy. It 
                        don’t make you a fag or nothin’.

           Clive laughs, shakes his head. Stefan sits beside him. 

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s...I can’t even use mine and 
                        you’re chopping yours off..?
                                 STEFAN 
                        What happened to your peenie? 
                        They bust that off you too?

                                 CLIVE
                        No, it’s still there.

                                 STEFAN
                        Well does it work or don’t it?

                                 CLIVE
                        I don’t know.

                                 STEFAN
                        You don’t know?!

           Clive lowers his eyes, shyly.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit! You gotta see if that 
                        monkey can swing, bro!

           A realisation rushes at Clive.

                                 CLIVE  
                        Hey, look...

           Stefan laughs at Clive.

                                 STEFAN
                        I mean, on your lonesome! I know 
                        you’re straight. And don’t be 
                        worrying, you ain’t my type. 

           Stefan ruffles Clive’s hair. Clive smiles. Stefan gets up.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Even with those hot new muscles 
                        of yours. Damn, boy! 

           Stefan throws Clive a flirtatious look as he swans to the 
           bathroom. Clive looks at his arms, proudly. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATER.

           Clive sees Stefan out.

                                 CLIVE
                        Thanks for visiting.

           Stefan leans down and kisses Clive’s forehead. Clive 
           doesn’t move. Stefan smiles at Clive, leaves. 

           A lipstick shape is stamped on Clive’s forehead.
           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. LATER.

           A hand fumbles around within the sink. Clive reaches up 
           high, finds what he was looking for - Stefan’s lipstick. 
           Clive twirls it up and down. It’s red.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive touches the lipstick to his groin and runs it along 
           one of his stumps until it falls over its end.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive brings a stump up to his eyeline. Smooth new skin 
           covers the amputation wound. Clive traces the lipstick 
           along it. It looks like blood is gushing out from it. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive paints a heart on his left breast.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive writes C-L-I-V-E across his upper chest. 

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Clive, his body tattooed with squiggles, draws lipstick 
           across the fleshy pouch joining his thumb and forefinger. 
           He squeezes them together, forming a pair of lipstick lips.

           Clive switches off the bathroom light. Only a soft glow 
           sneaks in from the main room. Clive brings the red ‘lips’ 
           towards his. Clive closes his eyes, presses his mouth 
           against them. A loving kiss. Clive’s hand moves 
           responsively. The kiss feels entirely real.

           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. **FLASHBACK**

           A kiss of passion and knowing.

           Clive and Susie kiss hungrily. They drop onto a huge bed. 
           Clive and Susie make love. Skin. Heat. Passion. Susie’s 
           eyes look into Clive’s. Their bodies lock. Susie smiles.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM / MODERN APARTMENT. NIGHT.

           Clive lies in bed in the dark. He works on himself, his 
           face smeared with lipstick. Clive moans. 

           Barry appears at the door, responding to the call. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Not now, Barry.

           Barry leaves. 
           Clive’s action quickens. Images flash to him. Of Susie. Of 
           him. The pair of them moving together. The images flash 
           faster, repeat, become more abstract, repeat. 

           Clive climaxes. In the past, and now. 

           Clive turns, looks beside him. But he is alone. Clive 
           squeezes his eyes shut. Rejecting this place. This life. 

           Fury builds within Clive. His eyes fly open.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive storms out of the bedroom. Barry looks up from the 
           couch. Clive leers at the wheelchair in the corner of the 
           room, metallic and angular within shadows. Clive powers 
           towards the chair, his eyes narrow with intent. 

           Clive unleashes a primal scream as he launches himself at 
           the chair using significant, inspired force. Clive takes 
           flight. But, its wheels unsecured, Clive’s velocity tips 
           the chair over. They both crash down spectacularly. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive and the wheelchair lie in a jumble of machine and 
           body. Both seem broken. 

           Clive’s head rests on the floor. Barry arrives at Clive’s 
           face. He traces his nose along Clive’s eyes, his nose, 
           mouth, along his body. He whimpers, worried.

           Clive sees liquid splashed on the floorboards before his 
           eyes. He touches it, looks at his fingers. They are wet 
           with his blood. Clive stares at it. At the damage he made.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           MACBOOK ONSCREEN: a blank Google search page. 

           Clive sits, staring at Stefan’s laptop’s screen. Barry lies 
           with his head on Clive’s lap. Clive types.

           MACBOOK ONSCREEN: “double leg amputee wheelchair”.

           Clive hits the ENTER key. 

           MACBOOK ONSCREEN: thousands of hits. “Day in the life of a 
           DAK”. “getting into THAT wheelchair” “How a double amputee 
           gets around”.

           Clive’s mouth drops open. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive and Barry sit side-by-side, gaping at the wheelchair. 

           Clive reaches half-way up the chair. In control, Clive slowly 
           raises himself. He adjusts his weight, twists...and plops 
           onto the chair’s seat.

           Clive yelps, elated. Barry barks. Clive taps his lap and 
           Barry jumps up onto it. Clive unlocks the chair’s wheels. 
           Looks around the room.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        So this is what the place looks 
                        like, huh?

           Clive rolls them to Barry’s window. Barry looks out. Clive 
           sees a never ending sky of brilliant blue. Clouds of a 
           thousand shapes. Buildings in the distance. Parks nearby. 

           Birds soar past the window. Free. 

           MONTAGE. INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. VARIOUS DAYS.

           MACBOOK ONSCREEN: a young DAK talks to camera, showing the 
           viewer how he negotiates everyday tasks.

           Clive leans his weight on one arm, kicks his stumps out to 
           the side. His arm quakes under the strain. Clive rocks back 
           to the centre, repeats the movement.

           Clive studies another video, imitates the DAK’s style. 

           Clive ‘walks’ in a new technique, taking his weight on one 
           arm and throwing his body forward, shifting his weight to 
           the other side, and so on. It’s a fluent motion. 

           Clive bounces up onto the couch. Down. Up again. Down 
           again. He’s having fun.

           Clive bounds between couches and chairs, boxes and pillows, 
           through his own makeshift gymnastics circuit.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive and Barry line up at one end of the room. Clive turns 
           to Barry. Barry is chewing at the bit.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Go!

           They take off towards the front door. 

           [SLOW MOTION] Clive and Barry both ‘run’ as fast as they 
           can. Clive’s face is fixed in determination.
           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. [MUTE] **ANOTHER TIME**

           [SLOW MOTION] On Clive’s face. The same look.

           Clive runs. The track is busy with joggers, but everyone 
           else seems slower than Clive. Clive is unstoppable.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. AFTERNOON.

           Clive swishes across the kitchen bench to the cutlery draw 
           and then back again, preparing for the main game. He stops, 
           rests. Takes in all the possibilities.

           Clive ignites the stove. The fire lights large. Clive waves 
           his hand above the flame. Feels its power. Its potential.  

           Sunlight pours in through the window behind Clive. Clive 
           sees the shadow he casts on the kitchen floor. It’s the 
           shadow of a man, fully formed at the start, then 
           disappearing into space. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Clive stuffs clothes, socks and underwear into a pair of 
           tracksuit pants, filling them out. Clive pulls them on, 
           moulds them into shape.

           Clive leans back, balancing on the couch’s arm in an absurd 
           angle. Clive cranes his neck to the side. He smiles. 

           He sees that his shadow is now that of a whole man. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Barry sits at his window, looking out at the setting sun. 
           Clive rolls up beside him. He wears his stuffed pants.

           Clive opens the window a crack. A rich soundscape sails 
           inside. Birds squawking. Wind. The hum of traffic. The 
           world. Not far away. 

           Barry reacts to every sound. Awake to it. Delighting in it.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Should we go check out the 
                        neighbourhood?

           Barry snaps a look to Clive.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Barry sits on Clive’s lap. Clive rolls them to the front 
           door. Clive stares at the door’s handle. 
                                 CLIVE 
                        Ready?

           Barry yawns, trying to contain his excitement. Clive 
           reaches out to the handle. Turns it. He opens the door.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. CONTINUOUS.

           Clive’s apartment door opens. Clive wheels he and Barry out 
           into the hallway. The hall is otherwise empty. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Stay, Barry. Stay.

           Clive rolls them down the hallway. The chair’s wheels 
           rumble through the quiet. Clive sees a window at the end of 
           the hall, a staircase leading down. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You OK?

           He is really asking the question of himself. 

           They reach the stairs. Clive sees an elevator on his left. 
           The way out. Clive eyes the call button. He sweats...

           And suddenly, Clive reverses. He turns the chair around and 
           wheels back to the apartment at speed. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive rolls inside and swings the door shut. Barry jumps 
           down from the chair. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        That was fun, hey? 

           Barry is crushed. He walks away from Clive.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the big deal about 
                        outside, anyway? Everything you 
                        need is here. Food. Shelter. Me!

           Barry lies down, his back to Clive. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (almost to himself)
                        Why can’t you be happy with that? 

           INT. APARTMENT. VARIOUS ROOMS. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive rolls through the apartment. 
                                 CLIVE
                        I mean, look at this place. The 
                        deco features. Ample living 
                        space...

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive wheels inside. 

                                 CLIVE
                        ...renovated bathroom...

           Clive stops abruptly. Stares. His mirrored reflection 
           stares back at him. 

           Clive rolls to the mirror, agape. He pulls at his ragged 
           hair, his beard. Assesses his teeth, tongue. Clive sits 
           back in his seat. He could be a Neanderthal. Or a madman. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. LATER.

           Clive glides sharp metal scissors through a chunk of his 
           hair. He closes its jaws.

                                                           CUT TO:

           Hair covers the ground around Clive’s chair. Clive washes 
           the remnants of shaving cream from his cheeks, dries his 
           face. He touches his soft skin, wet hair. Assesses himself.

                                 CLIVE
                        Woof.

           Clive looks good. And it pleases him.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.

           Clive sits on the bench, ingredients and utensils spread 
           around him. Barry sits on the floor, watching.

           A pot of water boils, onions pan fry. Clive chops 
           vegetables. The boiling water spatters. Clive stretches to 
           reduce the flame and loses his balance, nearly falling off 
           the bench. There’s danger everywhere. 

           The buzzer rings. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        Finally!

           Barry runs to the front door.
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive presses the intercom with a wooden spoon. He turns 
           around, looks over the apartment. The coffee table is 
           neatly set. A dinner for three.

           Barry sniffs under the door, growls. A knock. It has an 
           unusual rhythm but Clive opens the door without noticing.

                                 CLIVE
                        About fucking time!

           Clive quickly sees that his visitor is not Stefan, it’s a 
           GIRL (23). She’s gorgeous and thin and wears short shorts. 
           Her long legs are the only thing Clive can see. 

           Clive is mortified. He slams the door shut.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello? Is that...Clive?

           The girl has an English accent. Clive pulls Barry close to 
           him, both covering and protecting himself. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I have a delivery for Clive 
                        somebody? Is that you?

                                 CLIVE
                        Where’s Stefan?

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        He couldn’t make it. He sent me.

                                 CLIVE
                        Just leave the bags at the door. 
                        Thanks.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I can’t do that.

                                 CLIVE
                        Why not? 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I have to deliver them in person. 

                                 CLIVE
                        That’s not the arrangement. If 
                        Stefan can’t come, the other 
                        guys...

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sorry, they’re my instructions. 
                        You can call Stefan if you like?

                                                           CUT TO:
           Clive sits, on the phone. Waiting.

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        Then I’ll wait for him. Well when 
                        will he call me back? Hello? 

           Clive hangs up. Furious.  

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        I’ll go. Maybe Stef can come 
                        tomorrow instead?

           Clive returns to the front door. He thinks, stressed. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        What should I do?

           Clive draws a deep breath, calms. 

           Clive opens the door, revealing LILA (20s). She smiles 
           sunnily, holds up bags of groceries.

                                 LILA
                        Where’s the kitchen?

           Lila sneaks past Clive. Clive shuts the door. 

                                 CLIVE
                        On your right.

           Lila prances off. Her legs are even more impressive in full 
           view. Both Clive and Barry eye them. 

           Barry canters after her.

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive enters to see Lila unpacking the groceries. Barry 
           loiters around her feet.

                                 CLIVE
                        I can do that.

           Lila continues, unphased. 

                                 LILA
                        It’s fine. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Really, I’ll take it from here.

                                 LILA
                        It’ll just take two seconds.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Please! Just leave it! 
           Lila stops fast. Barry looks at Clive in surprise. Clive is 
           contrite.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not a charity, you know.

           Lila squints at Clive.

                                 LILA
                        Why would you be?

           She’s genuine. Clive eases.

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        I’m Lila, by the way.

                                 CLIVE
                        Clive.

                                 LILA
                        Yeah, I know that.

           They smile at each other. Lila turns to the stove.

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        What’re you cooking? Smells 
                        amazing.

                                 CLIVE
                        Nothing much...

           Lila notices the set coffee table out in the main room.  

                                 LILA
                        Crap, I’m in the way, aren’t I? 

                                 CLIVE
                        No, you’re fine...

                                 LILA
                        I’ll get going.

           Lila grabs her handbag, prepares to leave. But suddenly, 
           Clive doesn’t want her to go.

                                 CLIVE
                        You can stay. If you like.

           Lila turns to Clive. 

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.

           Clive drops steaks onto sizzling fry pans. Vegetables 
           steam. Clive is in control. 

           A squeal from the main room. Clive turns to see Lila and 
           Barry tussling on the floor. Clive smiles. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Barry and Lila sit at the coffee table. It’s candlelit.

                                 LILA
                        How’s it going in there?

                                 CLIVE (O.S.)
                        Ready.

           Clive appears, towing a basket containing a bottle of wine 
           and three dinner plates laden with steaks and veggies. Lila 
           claps, delighted.

                                                           CUT TO:

           The trio sit at the table. Clive cuts up one of the meals, 
           slides the plate before Barry. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Slow, Barry.

           Barry eats. Slowly. Lila is charmed. 

                                 LILA
                        You two always eat like this?

                                 CLIVE
                        Nah, it’s a treat. First meal 
                        I’ve cooked in a long time.

           Clive transfers one of his potatoes onto Barry’s plate. 
           Barry licks it up. Lila smiles, enjoying their bond. 

                                 LILA
                        You’re so good to him.

                                 CLIVE
                        I don’t know about that. 

                                 LILA
                        I’ve never seen a dog so spoiled!

                                 CLIVE
                        He’s stuck in here all day, every 
                        day. It can’t be much fun.

           Lila sees Clive’s sadness. She touches his arm. Clive 
           raises his eyes to look into hers.

                                 LILA
                        You are good to him. Really.

           Clive takes a sip of wine, dislodging Lila’s hand in the 
           process.

                                 CLIVE
                        So how do you know Stefan?
           Clive eats his meal.

                                 LILA
                        We go way back. But most recently 
                        he’s been using me for my body.

           Clive laughs, nearly chokes. Barry looks at him. 

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t Stefan tell you he’s 
                        planning to transition?

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah?

                                 LILA
                        Well guess whose body Stephanie 
                        is going to be based on?

           She flings her arms out theatrically. 

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        Some day Stefan will have my 
                        boobs! And all of the etceteras.

           Clive’s cheeks redden.

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        It’s flattering, don’t you think?

                                 CLIVE
                        And very generous of you.

           Lila slips her cardigan off, exposing her shoulders. Clive 
           can’t help looking. She’s stunning.

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                        It’s just my body. 

           Clive snorts lightly.

                                 CLIVE
                        Just your body?

           Lila straightens. 

                                 LILA
                        Yeah.

           Clive drops his eyes, not really believing her. Lila takes 
           Clive’s hand.

                                 LILA (CONT’D)
                            (sincerely)
                        It doesn’t mean a thing.

           Clive looks up and into Lila’s eyes through the candlelight. 
           She looks back at him, with understanding. And with desire. 
           Clive leans back, slips his hand out from under hers.

                                 CLIVE
                        Could you do me a huge favour and 
                        grab the salt from the kitchen?

           Lila smiles, hiding the sting of Clive’s rejection. 

                                 LILA
                        Sure. 

           She gets up, sashays to the kitchen.

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s just next to the sink.

           Clive rubs his neck, troubled. Barry chews animatedly.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATER.

           Barry lazes on the couch. At the front door, Clive sees 
           Lila out. She wears her cardigan, holds a handbag. 

                                 LILA
                        Thanks so much for dinner.

           Clive is distant. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Thanks for bringing it over.

           Lila waits for more. But there is nothing more. 

                                 LILA
                        Bye, Barry!

           Barry looks up. Lila leaves. 

           Clive closes the door and his contained rage is immediately 
           released. It floods him. Clive tears across the room, grabs 
           the phone. He punches in numbers, steaming.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE NIGHT.

           Stefan’s familiar knock. Clive glares at the door from 
           across the room. He sits in his wheelchair.

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s open!

           Stefan enters, closes the door behind him.

                                 STEFAN
                        Look at you, up on your throne!

           But Clive is in no mood for banter.
                                 CLIVE
                        There was a girl here.

                                 STEFAN
                        Lila. Ain’t she great?

                                 CLIVE
                        You sent her here. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Yeah, I couldn’t make it, sorry.

                                 CLIVE
                        Bullshit.

                                 STEFAN
                        Come again?

                                 CLIVE
                        You think just ‘cause I’ve got no 
                        legs, I’m a moron?

                                 STEFAN
                        Hang on. What’re you on about?

           Clive rolls towards Stefan. Stefan steps backwards.

                                 CLIVE
                        You think I’m a freak who needs 
                        to pay to get laid!

                                 STEFAN
                        It’s not like that...

                                 CLIVE
                        Look me in the eye and tell me...

                                 STEFAN
                        She’s no whore, man...

                                 CLIVE
                        Did you, or didn’t you, pay Lila 
                        to fuck me? 

           Clive’s eyes pierce Stefan’s. Stefan’s resolve falters. 
           Clive turns around, bitterly disappointed. He rolls away. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Get out.

           Stefan steps towards Clive.

                                 STEFAN
                        There was no money, I swear. All 
                        I told her was...

                                 CLIVE
                        Get the fuck out!
           Stefan folds his arms.

                                 STEFAN
                        No.

           Clive turns around to face Stefan. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Don’t push me.

                                 STEFAN
                        You got nothing.

           Barry jumps off the couch, comes to Clive’s aid. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Stay back, Barry. 

           Barry stoops, on alert.

                                 STEFAN
                        You want me out? Then make me go, 
                        freak!

           Clive speeds towards Stefan. Fast. Stefan bravely stands 
           his ground. Clive gets closer. Stefan throws his hands 
           forward as Clive slams into him. Stefan cries out as he is 
           struck, falls. Clive is sick with regret.

           The men look at each other.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Stefan has taken his jeans off. He ices his legs. They are 
           smooth, shaped. Barry lies beside Stefan. 

                                 STEFAN
                        ...so I just said it’d be nice if 
                        my buddy got off. If she was into 
                        it. I didn’t pay her, man. I 
                        swear! She must really dig you.

           Clive is still upset.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Give her another chance.

                                 CLIVE
                        Not gonna happen.

                                 STEFAN
                        Why the fuck not? 

                                 CLIVE
                        Because I’m married. 
                                 STEFAN
                        You’re what?

           Stefan looks around for something he missed.

                                 CLIVE
                        She’s not here. But she’s still 
                        my wife.

                                 STEFAN
                        She know that?

           Clive throws Stefan a stern look.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Just saying...

                                 CLIVE
                        I sent her away, alright?

                                 STEFAN
                        Alright. But she left.

           Clive has no comeback for this. 

           Stefan removes the ice pack. Clive looks on, remorseful.

                                 CLIVE
                        How are they?

                                 STEFAN
                        Still attached. 

           Clive clears his throat aloud, articulating the irony.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit bro, I mean...

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s OK.

           Stefan stretches and flexes. Clive watches Stefan’s legs in 
           motion. Stefan feels his stare.

                                 STEFAN
                        They’re pretty hot, huh?

           Clive turns away, caught out.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Just ‘cause they’re on a fella 
                        don’t mean they can’t be nice.

                                 CLIVE
                        If you say so.

           Stefan has an epiphany.
                                 STEFAN
                        Omigod! Are you a homophobe?

           Clive is scandalised by the notion.

                                 CLIVE
                        Don’t be ridiculous.

           Stefan laughs uproariously. Teasing.

                                 STEFAN
                        You are! I bet you think you can 
                        catch the gayness!

                                 CLIVE
                        I do not!

                                 STEFAN
                        Are you racist too? A Communist? 

                                 CLIVE
                        Fuck off! 

                                 STEFAN 
                        What else don’t I know about you? 

                                 CLIVE
                        I’m not a racist. Or a homophobe.

                                 STEFAN
                        Then look at my beautiful black 
                        legs, bitch!

           Clive won’t. 

                                 CLIVE
                        No thank you.

                                 STEFAN 
                        What are you so damn scared of?

                                 CLIVE
                        I’m not scared of anything.

                                 STEFAN
                        You’re scared of all sortsa shit.

                                 CLIVE
                        I am not.

                                 STEFAN 
                        Just let it go, man.

                                 CLIVE
                        Let what go?

                                 STEFAN
                        All of it!
           Clive smiles, superior.

                                 CLIVE
                        You’re such a fucking hypocrite. 

                                 STEFAN
                        Come again? 

                                 CLIVE
                        You tell me to ‘let it go’ like 
                        you’re the Dalai Lama, but there 
                        you are, hiding in your man 
                        clothes everyday. You’re full of 
                        shit, Stefan.

                                 STEFAN
                        Hey I’m making the change...

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah. And in the meantime?  

           Stefan looks away. Clive is getting riled up.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You’re only you when the right 
                        people are around to love you for 
                        it. Well I can’t pack my stumps 
                        away when they’re not convenient. 
                        This freak show is 24/7!  

           Stefan peers into Clive.

                                 STEFAN 
                        There you are! I can see you now!

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah? What can you see?

                                 STEFAN
                        A scared dude who’s angry as 
                        fuck.

           Clive shakes his head, dismissive.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        I can see you. 

                                 CLIVE
                        No you can’t. 

                                 STEFAN
                        No. You can’t!

           Clive swallows. A nerve struck.
                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You think ‘cause I wear different 
                        clothes for different folks that 
                        makes me a hider? That shit’s 
                        convenient, yeah OK. But I ain’t 
                        hiding. I am always right here. 
                        You just won’t look at me.

           Clive keeps his eyes down. Stefan appeals.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Let it go.

           Clive squints hard. Defiant.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, man.

           Clive shakes his head.

                                 CLIVE
                        You don’t get it. I was tall. So 
                        strong. I could do anything. 

           Clive’s whole face scrunches. Trying to hang on.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I was...perfect. 

           Stefan nods, compassionate. 

                                 STEFAN 
                            (whispers)
                        Let it go.

           Clive exhales. Stefan squeezes Clive’s shoulder. And at his 
           touch, Clive dissolves. Surrenders. Clive’s body shudders. 

           Finally, and entirely, Clive weeps. 

           Stefan is still. Present with Clive. With his pain. 

           Stefan stands. He pulls off his t-shirt. His underwear. 
           Stefan has an athlete’s physique and silky skin.

           Clive looks up at Stefan. Stefan’s nudity is entirely matter-
           of-fact, scientific. Stefan stretches his arms out, turns in 
           a slow circle. Clive sees the details of Stefan’s form. His 
           muscles. His joints. Symmetry. Power. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Now this is pretty damn fuckin’ 
                        perfect, am I right? 

           Clive’s eyes tear in wonder. This vision of man is 
           breathtakingly beautiful. Clive nods.
                                 CLIVE
                            (weak)
                        Yeah.

                                 STEFAN
                        And soon it’ll be gone forever. 
                        It’ll just be a memory. 

           Clive absorbs this. Stefan stops. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        But don’t you worry, my friend.

           He looks down at Clive, intently.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause I’ll be right here. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. LATE NIGHT.

           Clive surveys the wall, now almost wallpapered with photos. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        A memory.

           In all the pictures, Clive looks divine. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Slippery.

           On closer inspection of the photos Clive’s eyes seem 
           unfeeling, his smiles plastered on.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Like water. 

           UNDERWATER. DAY. **FLASHBACK**

           In the ocean deep. Feet kick. Clive’s feet. They propel him 
           through the water. Through shards of sunlight.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Like light. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive looks over the wall, over the images of himself. 

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        Light.  
           UNDERWATER. DAY. **FLASHBACK**

           The water churns. Clive’s feet kick frantically, trying to 
           drive his body upwards. But Clive only submerges deeper.

                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                        I am light. I won’t sink. 

           Clive’s legs relent. They stop pumping. Stop fighting. 

           And gradually, Clive is allowed to rise to the surface.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY. 

           Clive stuffs clothes into a pair of jeans. He pulls them 
           on. Zips up a hoodie. Puts on a cap. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Barry sits at his window. 

                                 CLIVE (O.S.)
                        Wanna go to the park?

           Barry turns to see Clive, in his chair. Clive’s jeans look 
           bulky, strange, but passable as legs at a glance.

                                                      JUMP CUT TO:

           Barry sits on Clive’s lap, on the chair. Clive assembles a 
           collar and lead around Barry’s neck, fashioned from a belt 
           and tie. Barry wriggles, uncomfortable with the restraint.

                                 CLIVE
                        I know. It’s horrible. But it’s 
                        just a precaution, OK?

                                                           CUT TO:

           Clive and Barry stare at the front door.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY / ELEVATOR. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive and Barry roll down the hall. They reach the 
           elevator. Clive presses the call button, turns the chair 
           around to face the elevator doors. He pats Barry.

                                 CLIVE
                            (quiet, to Barry)
                        Excited? Hey?

           Ding. The doors open. A BUSINESSMAN (30s) stands alone 
           inside. Clive rolls in. The doors close. The Businessman is 
           preened, attractive. Clive eyes him discreetly as the 
           elevator travels.
           The elevator stops. The doors open. The Businessman holds 
           them open for Clive. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        After you.

           The Businessman accepts Clive’s gesture and leaves first. 
           As Clive rolls forward, the elevator doors start to close. 
           The doors bang Clive’s wheels, and jerk open again. 

           INT. FOYER. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive and Barry roll through the old, plush foyer. There 
           are a few people about, but no one takes notice of them.

           Clive and Barry roll through the exit’s automatic doors...

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, BUSY CITY STREET. CONTINUOUS.

           ...and out onto the street. 

           It’s mayhem. The traffic is obnoxiously loud, people stream 
           by in torrents. Clive and Barry are overwhelmed.

           Clive joins the sea of bodies. Clive and Barry are pushed and 
           shoved within a crowd of suits, colour, limbs. Barry barks, 
           but he can barely be heard. 

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING / CITY STREET. MOMENTS LATER.

           The throng line up, wait to cross. Clive and Barry are 
           amongst them. The green light ignites. The crowd takes off. 

           Clive and Barry are jostled and Clive’s anxiety escalates. 

           In the middle of the road, Clive turns to see the cars 
           lined up at the lights. Their machinery is monstrous, 
           intimidating. They seem poised to strike him down. 

           Clive and Barry reach the other side of the road. Clive 
           wheels them away as fast as he can go.

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Hey puppy dog!

           Clive turns to see a GIRL (14) waving at Barry. Clive 
           accelerates, trying to escape. The Girl pursues him.

                                 GIRL
                        What’s his name?

           Clive rolls faster. The Girl stops, lets them go.
           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET. DAY.

           Clive weaves around people, within a deafening cacophony of 
           sirens and screeches. Clive is on edge.

                                 BOY (O.S.)
                        Look at that man with the dog!

           Clive sees a BOY (4) pointing at him.

                                 BOY
                        He looks so weird!

           A woman berates the Boy without acknowledging Clive.

           Clive continues. From his POV, everyone everywhere demeans 
           him. A posse of punks gawk at Clive. Teenagers snicker, 
           whisper. A jogger eyes Clive smugly as he passes him by.

           Clive powers faster, faster. He doesn’t belong here. 

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING / BUSY CITY STREET. DAY.

           Clive and Barry wait to cross. The park is just across the 
           road. Cars zoom, loud and large and dangerous. Clive can’t 
           cope. He reverses away from the curb. Barry eyes the 
           receding park, longingly. 

           Clive backs the chair against a building. Safe. Clive takes 
           off his cap. He hangs his head, dejected.

           Clive feels his cap become heavy. He sees that a handful of 
           coins has been dropped into it.

           Clive pushes his face into Barry’s coat.

           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET. AFTERNOON.

           Clive hasn’t moved. Barry looks around happily, stimulated. 
           Passersby pat Barry, drop money into Clive’s cap.

           EXT. BUSY STREET. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Clive and Barry roll down the street. 

                                 VOICE 
                            (surreal)
                        Clive? Clive Matthews! Wait!

           Clive doesn’t register the voice. Or his name. 

           INT. FOYER. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Clive rolls through the foyer. He is dirty and depleted.
           A man enters. He wears an expensive business suit. 

                                 THE SUIT
                        Clive!

           THE SUIT (20s) waves after Clive, but Clive is oblivious. 

           The Suit watches him go.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.

           The front door opens. Barry jumps down from the chair. 
           Clive rolls inside.  

           Clive pulls off his jeans, dismantles his false legs. He 
           takes his cap off and tosses it aside. 

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. MOMENTS LATER.

           Barry laps a long drink. Clive sits on the floor, gulping a 
           bottle of water. 

           Barry stops drinking, springs to attention. He runs out of 
           the kitchen in a flurry of cautioning barks.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER. 

           Barry barks, crazed. Clive enters from the kitchen.

                                 CLIVE
                            (fatigued)
                        Barry...

           Clive stops dead.

           The Suit stands in the open doorway. He stares at Clive.

                                 THE SUIT
                        Clive?

           Clive is in shock.

                                 THE SUIT (CONT’D)
                        It’s Nick. Nick Henderson. From the 
                        office..?

           Clive can’t speak.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I called out to you. On the 
                        street. I wasn’t sure it was you. 

           Clive turns from Nick’s view. Nick steps inside, concerned.
                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Clive? Can you hear me?

           Nick enunciates clearly. It’s unintentionally patronising.

                                 CLIVE
                            (calm)
                        Yes. I can hear you, Nick.

           Clive is lucid. Nick is encouraged, having reached him. 

                                 NICK 
                        Clive! We’ve all been worried about 
                        you. You just vanished...

                                 CLIVE
                        You won’t tell anyone that you saw 
                        me. Understand? 

           Nick is hurt. And bewildered. Clive whirls around to face 
           Nick, but doesn’t look at him.  

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You never saw me!

           Clive’s sudden intensity is startling. Nick is taken aback.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        No, go.

           Nick doesn’t know what to say, or do. Now Clive looks at 
           Nick, his eyes ablaze.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Gooooooooooooo!

           Clive’s exclamation evolves into a grotesque scream. Loud. 
           Mad. Clive directs the scream towards Nick, an assault. Nick 
           recoils from the sound and the sight of Clive. He hustles out 
           of the apartment. 

           Clive drops onto his back but his scream endures, his face 
           becoming red. Barry cowers, afraid.

           Clive’s scream abates. He breathes out, huskily. Barry 
           curls into Clive. But Clive doesn’t reciprocate. He stares 
           up, through the skylight. Gone. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive hasn’t moved. Barry brings the ball to Clive, drops 
           it onto him. It bounces off Clive and rolls away. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Barry lies across Clive. Nuzzles him. Pleading. 
                                 CLIVE
                        I can’t...I can’t...

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           The apartment is dark. Barry licks at his empty food bowl, 
           nudging it across the room. Clive closes his eyes.

           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive rolls along, in his chair. Without Barry.

           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive undresses Susie. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Barry’s toilet box is overflowing. He squats outside it.  

           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive runs, passing joggers left and right.

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive sits, waits. Cars speed past in both directions.

           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Susie gives Clive a foot massage. Tickles his toes.

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. LATE NIGHT.

           Barry tries to drink from the toilet bowl.

           INT. HOSPITAL SURGERY. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           A medical saw butchers through a man’s leg. Amputating it.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY.

           Clive lies, looking up through the skylight. His face is 
           stubbled. Knocking at the front door. Barry lies at the 
           door, weak. He whines in response. 
           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Incessant knocking at the door.

           Clive and Susie make love. They move together in time with 
           the knocking’s rhythm. Susie looks down and her desire 
           quickly becomes disgust. Clive follows her eyeline to see 
           that he has no legs.

           INT. MEDICAL WASTE. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Two male legs are thrown into a waste dispenser already 
           full of discarded limbs. Knocking continues. A phone rings.

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive rolls onto the road.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive drags himself across the floor on his stomach. His 
           stumps are bandaged and bloody.

           INT. MODERN APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Susie enthusiastically rides a legless, petrified Clive. 
           The sound of Barry crying out. A tortured cry. 

           EXT. PEDESTRIAN CROSSING. DAY. **DREAM MONTAGE**

           Clive wheels across the road, alone in the crossing. Clive 
           turns and sees a lone car speeding towards him. He screams.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAY. 

           Clive screams, mad with pain. A heavy bang on the door. 
           Another bang. Another. The front door is busted open, Stefan 
           stumbles inside. He sees Barry near the door, lifeless, 
           barely whining. And Clive, lying as limp as a rag.

                                 STEFAN 
                        Holy shit.

           Stefan crouches down to Clive. He is ill with worry.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Why you doin’ this, huh?

                                 CLIVE
                        I’m dead. I died in the accident. 
                        This never happened. I’m not 
                        really here. You never saw me.
           Stefan scoops Clive into his arms, carries him across the 
           room as though rescuing him from a fire. Stefan eases Clive 
           into the wheelchair. Stefan turns to Barry.

                                 STEFAN 
                        Hey buddy.

           Barry growls at Stefan. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        Bite me if you got to. But do it 
                        fast. We are outta here.

           Stefan gingerly picks Barry up. Barry yelps in pain. 

           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET. DAY. 

           Stefan pushes the wheelchair holding Clive and Barry from 
           the building. Stefan steps to the curb, waves at a taxi.

           From Clive’s POV we see people staring, pointing. Revolted. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Yeah! I’ve got no legs! Everyone 
                        come check out the legless freak!

           INT. TAXI. DAY.

           Stefan sits in the front, holding Barry. 

           Clive lies across the back seat. He looks up, out through 
           the rear window. The sun finds Clive. He closes his eyes, 
           accepting it.

           And passes out.

           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. [MUTE] **ANOTHER TIME**

           [SLOW MOTION] Barry runs, alone in a deserted park. He runs 
           and runs. With joyful abandon. 

                                                       FADE TO WHITE.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. DAY.

           [POINT OF VIEW] The white blurs. It focuses, revealing a 
           fluorescent light globe. The light is fixed to a ceiling. We 
           are looking up. 

           A blurred face comes into our view. It sharpens...

           Susie.

                                                       FADE TO BLACK.
                                 CLIVE (V.O.)
                            (distant whisper)
                        Susie...Susie...

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. DAY.

           Clive’s eyes are closed. He slowly opens them and sees Susie, 
           sitting at his bedside. Susie smiles at him, mildly. Clive is 
           weak, but so happy to see her.

           Clive notices that he’s connected to beeping machines.  

                                 CLIVE
                        What’s going on? 

                                 SUSIE
                        You’re dehydrated, but you’ll be 
                        fine in a few days.

           Clive is muddled, and it’s obvious.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the last thing you 
                        remember?

           Clive strains for clarity until...panic arrests him. He 
           bolts upright.

                                 CLIVE
                        Barry! What happened to him?!

           Susie gets up, puts a settling hand down onto Clive.

                                 SUSIE
                        Clive...take it easy...

                                 CLIVE
                        Is he OK?

           She doesn’t know what to say. Clive is becoming hysterical.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Susie! Is he OK?!

                                 SUSIE
                        He’s sick, Clive. He hadn’t had 
                        any water or anything for days.

           Clive sinks down into the mattress. Down, into despair.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Don’t do that! Stop it, 
                        Clive!

           Clive grimaces. He’s falling. Susie shakes him, but it has 
           no effect.
                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop it!!! 

           But Clive won’t be roused. At a loss, Susie slaps Clive’s 
           face. Hard. They look at each other, both horrified. Susie 
           instinctively presses her palm to Clive’s cheek, to take 
           the slap away. She strokes Clive’s face. He closes his eyes 
           at her touch. 

                                 CLIVE
                        You’re here. You came back to me.

           Clive turns his face more fully into Susie’s open palm. The 
           gesture’s intimacy takes Susie by surprise. Susie continues 
           caressing Clive. So tenderly. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Clive. I can’t come back to you. 

           Clive opens his eyes. Susie keeps stroking his cheek.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I was very unhappy. 

           Clive pulls his head away. Sits up. 

                                 CLIVE
                        I was on heavy drugs, in pain...

                                 SUSIE
                        I know. I mean...

           Susie gathers courage. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Before. (beat) I was unhappy before 
                        the accident. 

           Clive is confused. 

                                 CLIVE 
                        What are you talking about? We 
                        were good. Happy. We were...

                                 SUSIE 
                        The perfect couple?

           Clive flicks a look up to Susie, bitten by that word. But 
           Clive doesn’t grasp her meaning. And Susie can tell. She 
           smiles at him, sympathetically.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Clive...

           Susie leans closer to Clive. She searches his eyes. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I have no idea who you are.
           Clive frowns, baffled. Susie runs her eyes over Clive’s 
           face, as though tracing memories across it. 

                                 SUSIE  (CONT’D)
                        You’re always posing. Always on 
                        show. Always so...perfect.

           She smiles, serene.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been unhappy with you for a 
                        very long time.

           Clive strikes a mental connect. He sits back, smug.

                                 CLIVE
                        I get what you’re doing.

           Susie is curious. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You feel bad about running away 
                        from...(slaps his stumps) this. 
                        You’re blaming me so you can stop 
                        feeling guilty about it!

           Susie shakes her head.

                                 SUSIE
                        No...Clive...

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know who I am? What 
                        bullshit is that? Clive Matthews, 
                        MBA. School Captain, 1993. First 
                        Class Honours in Economics, 1998.

           Susie runs her hands through her hair. 

                                 SUSIE
                        That’s not (what I mean)...

           Clive raises his voice, talking over her. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Dean’s List, three years running.

                        Entrepreneur, 2001...

           Clive is getting worked up. So is Susie. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I was BRW Man of the Year!

           Susie throws her arms in the air.

                                 SUSIE
                        So fucking what?!?!
           Clive silences, struck. Susie has had enough.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                            (appealing)
                        Clive, that’s your CV. You just 
                        spat out your CV.

           Clive squints. He still doesn’t understand.

           Susie sighs. She takes Clive’s hand.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        I love you. With no legs or with 
                        three. 

           He looks at her. Vulnerable.

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        But I want real, Clive. I want to 
                        be real. And you...can’t.

           Clive pulls his hand from hers. He lies down flat onto his 
           back. Stares up at the ceiling. 

           Susie drops her eyes, defeated. She stands. Kisses Clive’s 
           forehead. And leaves him. A tear spills out from Clive’s 
           eye, rolls down the side of his face. 

           The machines’ beeping becomes louder and louder. 

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. AFTERNOON.

           Clive lies on the linoleum floor, staring up at the ceiling. 

           A NURSE (20s) glances inside Clive’s room as she passes. She 
           sees Clive on the floor and flies into action. 

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Matthews? (calling out) Nurse!

                                 CLIVE
                        What are you doing?

           The nurse fusses over Clive. 

                                 NURSE
                        Just keep still and we’ll get you 
                        back into bed. Nurse!

                                 CLIVE
                        No! Stop it! 

           Another NURSE (20s) enters, joins in the commotion. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I want to stay down here!
           Yet another NURSE (20s) enters. They all grapple with Clive. 
           He fends them off. Swats at them. Like flies.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Leave me alone! All of you, leave 
                        me alone!

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. EVENING. 

           The beeping continues. Clive stares at the ceiling as a 
           nurse adjusts his machines.  

                                 NURSE
                        Feeling better now?

                                 CLIVE
                        I need to know if my dog’s OK.

                                 NURSE
                            (patronising)
                        I’m sure he’s fine.

           She pats his arm. Clive bores a look into her skull.

                                 CLIVE
                        You don’t understand.

                                 NURSE
                        Just a little prick.

           Clive recoils. He sees a needle stuck in his arm. A vial 
           fills with his sticky red life force. 

           The nurse finishes up. She reviews a machine and a chart. 

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Everything’s looking good.

           She turns to Clive.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You’re a very lucky man, you know 
                        that?

           Clive eyes the nurse, passively. She leaves. 

           Clive watches the machines’ lines blink on and off.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive sits in a wheelchair at the window. But there is only 
           blackness beyond.

           INT. APARTMENT. VARIOUS ROOMS. NIGHT.

           The apartment is dark. All the rooms are empty, lonely. 
           Barry’s squeaky toy lies on the couch. Clive’s sketches 
           grace the walls, works in progress. The phone sits on the 
           floor, a necktie tied to it. Everyday moments. Suspended.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. DAY.

           Clive sits in a wheelchair, before the window. Bleak 
           weather blankets the view. 

                                 DOCTOR (O.S.)
                        I am Doctor Singh, Rehab Physician. 

           Clive slowly looks up at DOCTOR SINGH (30s, Indian) standing 
           beside him. Doctor smiles a well-practiced smile.

                                 DOCTOR SINGH
                        How are you today, Mr. Matthews?

           Clive’s look says it all.

                                 DOCTOR SINGH (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to talk to you about 
                        your rehabilitation options.

                                 CLIVE
                        Aren’t I getting enough fluids?

                                 DOCTOR SINGH
                        I mean, rehabilitation regarding 
                        your amputations, Sir.

           Clive turns back to the window.

                                 DOCTOR SINGH (CONT’D)
                        According to your history, you 
                        have never received professional 
                        physical therapy or prosthetics?

                                 CLIVE
                        Not interested.

                                 DOCTOR SINGH
                        We have a specialised unit that 
                        operates world class outpatient 
                        services and you would... 

           Clive fires a look up to Doctor Singh.

                                 CLIVE
                        I’m not interested! 

           Clive returns his gaze to the window, the matter closed.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM. AFTERNOON.

           Clive lies in bed. Resigned.
                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Matthews?

           Clive halfheartedly turns towards the voice, but lights up on 
           seeing Stefan standing in the doorway.

                                 CLIVE
                        Stefan!

           Stefan rushes to greet Clive. Clive sits up.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        God, I’ve been so worried.

           The men grip each other’s shoulders.

                                 STEFAN
                        Hey, I’m alright, bro. 

                                 CLIVE
                        I mean, about Barry.

                                 STEFAN
                        I know that, fool! (beat) He’s...

           Clive holds his breath.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        OK. He’s doin’ OK.

           Clive trembles with relief. Stefan assesses Clive.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You look like shit though.

           Clive shakes this off, distracted.

                                 CLIVE
                        Where is he?

                                 STEFAN
                        At the pup hospital. I’ve just 
                        been visitin’. Made you a movie 
                        and everything.

           Clive is thrilled. Stefan pulls his phone out of his 
           pocket, opens the movie file. He hands the phone to Clive.

           The blood drains from Clive’s face.

           ONSCREEN: Barry lies in a cage, on a drip. Exhausted. 

                                 STEFAN (O.S.)
                        He’s a fighter. He’ll be fine.

           Clive is glued to the screen.
                                 CLIVE
                        I didn’t mean to hurt him.

                                 STEFAN
                        But you did. Poor pup nearly died 
                        ‘cause of you. 

           Clive stares at the video. Suffering. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        The doc says things gotta change 
                        for Barry. He needs outside. 
                        Sunshine. The park. Good things. 

                                 CLIVE
                        I know... 

                                 STEFAN
                        That’s not enough, man!

           Clive looks up at Stefan sharply.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        You flipped out. You can’t do 
                        that to him! It’s not fair! It’s 
                        not your right! You feel me?

           Clive is so sad.

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                        When you can give him a proper 
                        life, you can have him back. But 
                        if you can’t, bro, then you gotta 
                        give him up.

           Clive nods. Accepting this. 

           ONSCREEN: Barry staggers, drops. He gets back up.  

           Clive watches, near tears.

                                 CLIVE
                        I didn’t get hit by a car. 

           Stefan turns to Clive. Clive keeps watching Barry. 
           Confessing to him.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        There were no shop windows. No 
                        sheets. It wasn’t a Saturday. 

           Clive pauses. Pushes on.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        It was a Thursday night. There 
                        was a work dinner. I drove home 
                        alone. Maybe I wasn’t paying 
                        attention. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        (beat, reconsiders) I wasn’t 
                        paying attention. I didn’t think 
                        I needed to. Thought I had it all 
                        figured out. The drive. The 
                        night. Everything. This guy, he 
                        came out of nowhere. Just walked 
                        out onto the road. I wasn’t 
                        watching. I didn’t see him until 
                        he was right in front of me. I 
                        braked. I swerved. I missed him. 
                        But I hit a pole.

           ONSCREEN: Barry lies back down again. Spent.

           Clive touches the screen. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        It was my fault.

           Clive can’t take his eyes off Barry. And Stefan can’t take 
           his eyes off Clive.

           INT. HOSPITAL. CLIVE’S ROOM / HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           Clive rolls out of his room, turns down the hall. Nurses 
           mill at a station, visitors wander. Clive wheels along, 
           glancing in each room he passes. Patients watch TV, eat 
           meals, chat with visiting families. Clive eyes their 
           plastered limbs, patched eyes, trunks suspended by cables. 

           Clive stops outside one room. He sees an AMPUTEE (20s) 
           inside. He has lost an arm and a leg, his stumps heavily 
           bandaged. The Amputee lies on his back. He stares at the 
           ceiling.

           INT. HOSPITAL. AMPUTEE’S ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive enters. The Amputee is dead-eyed. 

                                 AMPUTEE
                        What?

           Clive stops. The Amputee turns to Clive. He sees Clive’s 
           chair, his body. The Amputee chortles, returns his stare to 
           the ceiling.

                                 AMPUTEE (CONT’D)
                        They send you in here to counsel 
                        me or some shit? 

                                 CLIVE
                        No. No one sent me here.

                                 AMPUTEE
                        ‘Everything’s going to be OK’. 
                        ‘Take it one day at a time’. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMPUTEE (cont'd)
                        I’ve heard it all, man, so save 
                        your breath and spare me the 
                        bullshit.

           Clive rolls closer to the Amputee.

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s not going to be OK. 
                        Nothing’s going to be like it was 
                        before, ever again. 

           The Amputee turns to Clive, boiling with hate.

                                 AMPUTEE
                        What the fuck do you want?

           Clive takes a moment.

                                 CLIVE
                        What do you want?

           The Amputee’s eyes water.

                                 AMPUTEE
                        I want to die.

           Clive swallows. He knows.

           INT. PATIENT TRANSPORT AMBULANCE. LATE AFTERNOON.

           Clive lies in the back of the ambulance. He looks out at 
           the passing city, smattered with golden light. The 
           Botanical Gardens. St. Kilda Road Boulevard. The beach.

           It’s magical.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive sits in the open front doorway, in his chair.

           INT. APARTMENT. VARIOUS ROOMS. NIGHT.

           Clive rolls through the apartment. The rooms are filled 
           with shadows, heavy with grief. 

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           The room is illuminated only by moonlight eking through the 
           windows. Clive switches on a floor lamp. He moves to the 
           bedroom wall, faces his photo wallpaper. 

           Clive looks over the images. Clive, the sporting star. 
           Clive, High School captain. Clive, successful entrepreneur. 
           Clive, handsome groom. 
           Clive plucks a photo off the wall - the Beach Photo. Clive 
           looks at it, fondly...then slices a tear right through it. 

           Clive picks another photo off the wall and rips it up. He 
           takes another. And another. Clive shreds through all of his 
           photos, using his fingers, his teeth. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. DAWN.

           Clive wheels across the room. The ornate wooden box sits on 
           his lap, full of bits of torn photos.

           Clive arrives at Barry’s window. Rain lashes against it. 
           Clive pulls the window open. Wind gusts inside. Traffic 
           sounds sail in from below. Clive looks out. Down...

           Clive leans the box out through the window and tips out its 
           contents. The wind wraps around the photo scraps. Clive 
           watches the most valuable souvenirs of his life drift away. 
           Vanish. And he smiles.

           Rain pelts into the apartment. Clive slides himself from 
           the wheelchair onto the windowsill. He arches back, thrusts 
           his hips upwards. He anchors his stumps against the inside 
           of the window, and leans his body outside through it.

           Clive’s face is quickly drenched with rain. He catches the 
           falling water on his eyelids, in his hair, in his mouth. 
           Clive opens his eyes. He sees the first birds of the new 
           day flying just above him. 

           And it’s as though he is one of them.

           INT. FOYER. MORNING.

           We follow behind Clive as he rolls through the hectic 
           foyer. People catch sight of him, quickly avert their eyes.

           EXT. BUSY CITY STREET. DAY.

           Clive rolls out of the apartment building. He wears a t-
           shirt and shorts, his stumps openly on display. 

           INT. HOSPITAL. VARIOUS HALLWAYS. DAY.

           We follow Clive as he rolls down corridor after corridor. 
           He passes nurses, patients, doctors, cleaners.

           INT. REHAB FACILITY. RECEPTION. DAY.

           Clive sits in his chair in the middle of the expansive 
           reception area. There’s no one around.
           Clive rolls up to a cabinet displaying various prostheses 
           as they’ve evolved over time - wooden sticks with ‘feet’ at 
           their ends; plastic limbs; a leg made of carbon fibre; 
           photos of athletes running, swimming, skiing, using 
           prosthetic limbs. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello there.

           Clive turns around. A sweet-faced RECEPTIONIST (40s) stands 
           behind the reception’s window.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?

           Clive considers the question. And, finally, he nods.

           INT. REHAB FACILITY. WORKSHOP. DAY.

           The Receptionist leads Clive through the workshop. 
           Sculptors weld and saw. Limbs and their parts hang from the 
           roof, are spread across tables, line the walls.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        ...and here’s where we do the 
                        customising. All limbs are tailor-
                        made.

           Clive is awed.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Your parents gave you one set of 
                        legs, now you can design yourself 
                        a new pair.

           The Receptionist continues through the workshop. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Anything is possible!

           Clive wheels up to a storage shelf. He looks up at the 
           hundreds of different feet above him. Of every type and 
           colour and shape.

           INT. REHAB FACILITY. GYM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive follows the Receptionist into the vast gym. It’s full 
           of equipment - benches, bars, balls and beams.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I’ll just be one moment...

           The Receptionist pops into an internal office. Clive waits. 
           Several voices ring out from around an unseen corner. Clive 
           rolls off in their direction. 
           Clive peeks around a pillar and sees a group of amputees 
           stretching, exercising, putting on their prostheses. 

           A double leg amputee bullets around the gym with striking 
           agility. He climbs and cartwheels, flies between benches and 
           chairs. Clive is agog. This man is more than human.   

                                 RECEPTIONIST (O.S.)
                        Clive?

           Clive turns around. The receptionist is flanked by GREG 
           (40s) and MARNEE (20s).

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        This is Greg, our Prosthetist, 
                        and Marnee, Physical Therapist. 

           They all shake hands, make introductions.

                                 GREG
                        How about we do an assessment, 
                        talk through the options, set 
                        some goals...

                                 CLIVE
                        I know what I want.

           Clive’s interruption is rude. He looks down, embarrassed.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        I have a goal already.

           Marnee smiles at Clive, curious.

                                 MARNEE
                        What is it, Clive?

           Clive looks up at Marnee. He’s intense. 

           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. **ANOTHER TIME**

           [SLOW MOTION] Clive runs. He closes his eyes.

                                 CLIVE  (V.O.)
                        I want to run.

           MONTAGE. EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. **ANOTHER TIME** / INT. 
           REHAB FACILITY. / INT. APARTMENT. VARIOUS ROOMS.

           Clive sits at the end of a bench. Marnee rolls a nylon 
           stocking over one of his stumps. 

           Greg takes measurements along and around Clive’s stumps. 

           A pair of new sneakers crunch the park’s path.
           Clive snaps open the bedroom blinds. And those in the main 
           room. And the kitchen. The apartment is filled with light. 

           Marnee helps Clive practice lifting his weight from 
           sitting, lowering himself down again. Up, and down again. 

           Clive dashes through the park. He veers off the path, heads 
           towards bushlands.

           Clive looks over his bedroom wall, bare without the photo 
           wallpaper. The plaster is irregularly stained where the 
           photos were. Clive runs his palm across the wall, pensively.

           Clive charges through dense shrubbery, cross-country. He 
           breaks through, to...

           INT. VETERINARY HOSPITAL. CLINICAL ROOM. DAY.

           A sterile, white room. Cages are stacked high, some 
           occupied by injured, sedated dogs and cats. Clive sits in 
           his wheelchair, the only human here. 

           Clive looks at the caged animals. Eyes stare back at Clive 
           from behind bars. Hopeless. A look that Clive knows. 

           Paw pads patter along the floor behind Clive. Clive detects 
           the sound only seconds before feeling a wet nose in his 
           hand. Clive sees Barry below, his whole body wagging up at 
           him. 

           Clive pulls Barry up onto his lap. Barry squirms, cries 
           with joy. Clive pushes his face into Barry’s fur.

           Stefan appears at the doorway. He props there, quietly 
           enjoying Clive and Barry’s reunion.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. LATE AFTERNOON.

           The afternoon sun strikes the room in articulated beams.

           Clive and Barry lie on the floor, on their sides, facing 
           each other. Clive pats Barry. He gazes at Barry’s hanging 
           cheek. His long eyelashes. His ever-wet nose.

                                 CLIVE
                            (barely audible)
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. 

           Barry looks back at Clive with all the love in the world. 

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Clive sits, on the phone. Waits. Barry chews a bone 
           contentedly on the other side of the room. Clive enters a 
           call. It’s answered.
                                 SUSIE 
                            (through phone)
                        Hello?

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        Hey Susie. It’s me.

                                 SUSIE
                            (through phone)
                        Oh hey.

           Susie sounds pleased to hear Clive’s voice.

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        Is it a bad time? 

                                 SUSIE
                            (through phone)
                        No, it’s fine. How are you?

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        I’m good. Back in the apartment. 

                                 SUSIE
                            (through phone)
                        That’s good.

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        With Barry. He says hi.

                                 SUSIE
                            (through phone)
                        Oh, hi Barry! 

           Susie giggles, nervously. Clive smiles, relishing its sound.

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        You know...he’d love to see you.

           Susie’s laughter stops. Clive waits for her response.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. EVENING.

           Clive, on the floor, opens the front door. Barry stands 
           beside him. They both look up as one, to see...Susie, in 
           the doorway. Clive’s eyes shine at her.

                                                             CUT TO:

           Susie stands, alone. Several lamps are on, producing tight 
           pools of light. The apartment is clean, spacious. 
           Clive zips into the room from the kitchen, ahead of Barry.

                                 CLIVE
                        I’ve only got red, is that OK?

                                 SUSIE
                        Sure. Red’s great.

           Clive scoots across the room, switches on another lamp. Susie 
           is dazzled by his adroitness.

                                 CLIVE
                        I’ll just be a sec.

           Clive heads back to the kitchen, followed by Barry. 

           Susie wanders. She eyes the fine details Clive has carefully 
           created - leaves of various age hang from a lamp shade, their 
           venous networks illuminated; spindly lines of various colour 
           painted into a floorboard’s grains; and everywhere, various 
           sketches drawn directly onto the wall at Clive’s height.

           Music floats into the room. A piano sonata. Susie listens, 
           spellbound. Clive watches Susie, unseen, from the kitchen 
           doorway. Susie senses him. She turns. Clive emerges from the 
           shadows, into the light. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        The music... 

           Clive moves to Susie, carrying a glass of red wine. He looks 
           up at her. His eyes are clear, soft.

                                 CLIVE
                        Beautiful, isn’t it?

           Clive reaches a hand up to Susie. She takes it, sits down 
           facing him. Clive passes Susie the glass. 

           Barry steals into the room. He lies down quietly near the 
           kitchen, behind Clive, keeping his distance. Clive watches 
           Susie sip wine, peer around the room. The sonata swirls all 
           around them. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (looking at Susie)
                        It’s OK, you can come closer.

           Susie swings a look of surprise to Clive. Barry gets up and 
           skips over to Clive, heeding his suggestion. Susie breaks 
           into a smile, comprehending. Clive casually lifts an arm to 
           accept Barry, and Barry snuggles in.

                                 SUSIE
                        God, he’s so big. I can hardly see 
                        the puppy in him anymore.

           Susie throws her arms out towards Barry.
                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Come here, gorgeous.

           But Barry is comfortable where he is. Susie drops her arms. 

                                 CLIVE
                        He can be a bit shy.

           Susie is wounded. She contemplates Barry.

                                 SUSIE
                        He probably hates me. The strange 
                        lady who grabbed him from the pound 
                        and then abandoned him. 

           Clive strokes Barry.

                                 CLIVE
                        I think...

           Clive picks his words carefully.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        You could’ve picked anyone. I think 
                        he’s just grateful you chose him. 

           Susie is stirred. Her eyes meet Clive’s. A warm energy hums 
           between them. 

           Susie breaks the moment. She gets up, paces around the room. 
           Clive continues patting Barry. 

                                 SUSIE
                        The place looks really amazing.

                                 CLIVE
                        Thanks. 

                                 SUSIE
                        There are so many tiny treasures 
                        everywhere. 

           Susie approaches a sketch on the wall. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        And when did you start drawing?

                                 CLIVE
                        I’d hardly call it drawing. It’s 
                        scribbling at best.

           Susie ducks into the bathroom, behind Clive. 

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                            (gushing)
                        Rose geraniums!
           Clive smiles, enjoying everything Susie. Susie’s boots’ heels 
           rap rapidly against the floorboards. She returns.

                                 SUSIE
                        They smell fantastic.

           Susie steps towards the bedroom. She stops. Clive turns 
           around and sees her propped at the bedroom’s open door.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Go on in. 

           She disappears inside. Clive takes a moment, eases Barry off 
           him and follows after Susie. Barry stays put.

           INT. APARTMENT. BEDROOM. CONTINUOUS.

           Clive arrives at the doorway. He sees Susie leaning close to 
           the bedroom wall. 

                                 SUSIE 
                        I really like this one.

           Clive approaches, arrives beside Susie. They regard the wall 
           together. A new artwork appears where Clive’s photo wallpaper 
           was. The piece is mostly in pencil. Lines of various density 
           sprawl in all directions, a collection of pink and red 
           speckles clumped at the centre. The speckles diffuse into 
           broken lines. Then spread, elongate. Gradually finding their 
           way out. 

                                 CLIVE
                        It’s a self-portrait. 

           Susie bursts out laughing. Clive smiles.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        No, really. It is.  

           Susie settles. She returns her attention to the image, trying 
           to see what she had missed.

                                 SUSIE
                        But...it’s so...

                                 CLIVE
                        It doesn’t look like me.

                                 SUSIE
                            (light)
                        Of course it doesn’t look like you!

           They analyse the drawing.

                                 CLIVE
                        Why not? What do I look like?
                                 SUSIE
                        I think I know what you look like.

           Clive turns to Susie. But she keeps her eyes on the artwork.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Susie...

                                 SUSIE
                        Mmmm?

                                 CLIVE
                        Susie.

           It’s almost a whisper. 

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Why won’t you look at me?

                                 SUSIE
                        I don’t need to look at you. I know 
                        what you look like!

           Susie’s overreaction is revealing. She sighs slightly, caught 
           out. Susie turns to Clive, looks up at him. Appeal is in her 
           eyes. She’s trying, but this is so hard.

           Clive holds Susie’s gaze as he unbuttons his shirt. Susie 
           can’t help turning away.

                                 CLIVE 
                        Please. Look at me.

           Susie swallows, discomfited. Clive pulls his shirt off. Susie 
           slowly lifts her eyes, sees his collarbones. His arms. His 
           torso’s lines. Clive removes his shorts, underwear. Susie 
           eyes his waist. Hips. His upper thighs. His stumps...

           Susie stands, fast. She lingers, searching for the right 
           words, any words, but finds none. She stomps out of the 
           bedroom. Clive doesn’t move. 

           Clive hears Susie pacing around the main room. A bundle of 
           keys jingle.

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        I’m...gonna go. OK?

           Clive nods, to himself.

                                 CLIVE
                        OK.

           A pause. Susie’s heels strike the floorboards in crisply 
           accented clacks. The front door opens and shuts. 

           Clive slouches, deflated. He leans back against the wall. 
           Clive is surrounded by his artwork. The drawn lines extend 
           all around him, appear to erupt from him. 

           INT. REHAB FACILITY. GYM. DAY.

           Silicone liners are rolled over each of Clive’s stumps.  

           Marnee and Greg attach prosthetic legs to Clive. Clive 
           winks at Barry, who watches from the far side of the gym. 

                                 GREG (O.S.)
                        All done.

           Clive looks down. His metal legs dangle over the bench. 
           They swing freely, above the ground.

           Marnee brings a frame over to Clive.

                                 MARNEE
                        Ready to stand up?

           Clive nods. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Yep.

           Clive plants both hands on the frame. He shuffles his 
           buttocks to the end of the bench.

                                 MARNEE 
                        Nice and easy. 

           Clive looks to Barry. His eyes stay locked on him as he 
           stands. We see Clive’s POV rise as he becomes tall. 

           Clive laughs, overcome. Barry barks. 

           Clive’s hands and arms shake.

                                 GREG
                        Let your legs do the work, Clive. 
                        You have to trust them.

           Clive cautiously relieves weight from his arms. His legs 
           give way beneath him. Marnee and Greg catch him. 

                                 MARNEE 
                        You’re OK. We’ve got you. 

           They help Clive back up to standing, keep hold of him. 
           Clive is flustered.

                                 CLIVE
                        Why aren’t they working?
                                 MARNEE
                        They are working. Walking on two 
                        legs isn’t easy. 

           Clive sweats. Concentrates.  

                                 MARNEE (CONT’D)
                        Feel for balance, remember? Take 
                        your time. Do you feel it?

           Clive shakes his head. Marnee and Greg share a look. 

                                 MARNEE (CONT’D)
                        You gotta feel, Clive. Every bit 
                        of the movement. Nothing can be 
                        automatic. Forget how you walked 
                        before. You have to start all 
                        over again.

           Clive pushes the frame ahead of him and throws a determined 
           step forward. Greg lets him go.

                                 MARNEE (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. 

           Clive takes another step. Marnee lets go of Clive. Clive 
           steps forward again. It’s wonky, but he’s doing it.

                                 MARNEE (CONT’D)
                        One foot in front of the other. 

           Clive keeps going. Barry barks. Clive gulps for air. 

           Marnee pulls the frame away, holds Clive’s hands out in 
           front of him. Clive walks with her. Step. Step. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           Marnee’s hands release Clive’s. They hover in the air.

                                                     FADE TO WHITE. 
                                                       FADE IN TO:

           EXT. CITY STREET. DAY. 

           White skies. Trees sway, languidly. Summer.

           Barry strolls along the street. Clive holds his lead. 
           Clive’s metal legs stick out from the end of his shorts. 

           Stefan walks alongside the pair. He’s dressed as a woman. 
           Stefan peers around, anxious. 

                                 CLIVE
                        Feels like people are looking, 
                        doesn’t it?
                                 STEFAN
                        Uh-huh.

           Clive smiles wisely.

                                 CLIVE
                        That’s ‘cause they are. 

           Stefan is instantly made nauseous by this.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        They’re wondering how the fuck a 
                        guy like me could ever get a 
                        chick like you.

           Stefan beams.  

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, CITY STREET. DAY.

           Stefan squats down to Barry, rubs his head.

                                 STEFAN
                        Bye bye beautiful.

           Stefan stands. 

                                 STEFAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Clive)
                        So what time Sunday should we...?

           Clive cuts Stefan off, pulls him into a hug. Stefan stands 
           stiff. Clive squeezes Stefan tight. Stefan slowly brings 
           his arms up and around Clive. 

           They hug each other. Standing tall.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY. DAY.

           Barry jogs down the hall, his lead trailing along the 
           floor. Clive walks a few steps behind.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Barry lopes to the kitchen. Clive tosses his keys onto the 
           coffee table.

           INT. APARTMENT. BATHROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive pees, standing up. He smiles, enjoying the feeling.

                                 SUSIE (O.S.)
                        Hello? Clive?

           Clive is startled. 
           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER.

           Clive enters from the bathroom and finds Susie standing in 
           the middle of the room, Barry beside her. Susie gapes at 
           Clive, blown away by the sight of him at full height.

                                 CLIVE
                        Hey. How’d you get in?

                                 SUSIE
                        I...I actually got the keys back 
                        from Rosa a long time ago.

           They share a sheepish, knowing smile. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, I shouldn’t have just let 
                        myself in...

                                 CLIVE
                        No, no, it’s fine. 

                                 SUSIE
                        It’s just, I brought over some 
                        shopping for you, and it had to 
                        go in the fridge...

                                 CLIVE
                        Susie. It’s great to see you.

           She nods.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t I cook us some dinner?

                                 SUSIE
                        Thanks, but I gotta do, go to...

           Clive saves her.

                                 CLIVE
                        That’s OK. 

           Susie picks up her bag, hunts around for her keys inside it. 
           Clive takes in her every move.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                        Maybe another night?

                                 SUSIE
                        Yeah, OK. 

           She grabs her jacket. Clive waits. Hopes. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow?
           Susie turns to Clive, expectantly. Clive nods, thankful. They 
           smile at each other.

           Susie heads to the door...and Barry trots after her. Hearing 
           his footsteps, Susie spins around to him. Barry stops, 
           confronted. Susie crouches down to Barry, opens her arms. 
           Encouraged, Barry steps to Susie, and into her embrace. 

                                 SUSIE (CONT’D)
                        There you are.

           Susie holds Barry. He leans against her affectionately. 

           Clive watches them, his stomach churning with love.

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. MOMENTS LATER. 

           Clive sits on the couch, takes his legs off. He peels the 
           linings off, massages his stumps. Barry sniffs Clive’s 
           prostheses, accessories, his stumps. Checking.

           Clive leans back, relaxes. Barry jumps up on the couch, 
           lies across him. Clive looks around at the apartment. 
           Afternoon sun floods the room. New books and magazines are 
           spread across the coffee table.  

           Home.

           Clive hears a soft snore. Clive looks down at Barry, asleep 
           so deeply, so fast. Clive strokes Barry, hums to himself...

           INT. APARTMENT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 

           Clive’s humming becomes Mozart Piano Concerto #20 in D 
           Minor, K 466. It plays through the apartment.

           Clive, legless, moves through the kitchen with ease. He 
           clears scraps from two plates into the bin, slides the 
           plates onto the bench top. He flings himself up onto the 
           counter, washes the dirty dishes in the sink.

           Clive eyes the phone, sitting on the bench nearby. It seems 
           to be staring back at him.  

           INT. APARTMENT. MAIN ROOM. NIGHT.

           Barry sleeps on the couch. Clive sits on the floor near the 
           windows. He fidgets with the phone, thoughtfully. Makes a 
           decision. 

           Clive turns the phone on, enters a call. The dial tone 
           rings and rings. Clive’s breath quivers. 

           The dial tone stops, the call answered. A woman’s voice 
           sounds, but we can’t discern it or her words. 
           Clive’s eyes squeeze shut, his heart breaking. He opens his 
           mouth to speak but produces no sound. He tries again. 

                                 CLIVE
                            (on phone)
                        Mum?

           Clive opens his eyes.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        It’s me.

           Tears fall from Clive’s eyes. He lets them.

                                 CLIVE (CONT’D)
                            (on phone)
                        It’s Clive.

           He smiles.

           EXT. PARK. EARLY MORNING. 

           The Concerto continues.

           The gardens are lush, brimming with growth in its prime. 

           Clive runs along the path. His arms pump powerfully. His 
           eyes water. Clive passes joggers, one after another. 

                                                             CUT TO:

           Clive bursts through the park’s bushes, emerging onto a 
           vacant, open field. 

           Clive looks down. His carbon fibre prosthetic legs extend 
           out from his shorts. They glimmer in the morning sun. 
           Working like honed machines, the limbs help Clive produce a 
           model running style.

           Clive turns to see Barry, running alongside him. Barry is 
           fully grown, fit and strong. He takes long, assured 
           strides. The pair are perfectly in tune with each another. 

           From afar we see Clive and Barry running through the park, 
           among the trees. 

           It’s just the two of them. 

           Free. 

           THE END
