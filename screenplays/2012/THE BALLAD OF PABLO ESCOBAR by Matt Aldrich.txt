                                                            OVER BLACK:

           “Don’t let it end like this.  Tell them I said something.”

                             -- the last words of Pancho Villa (alleged)

           EXT. FOREST AIRSTRIP - DAY

           A swath of clear-cut land, unpaved, surrounded on all sides 
           by forest.  The hum of propellers in the distance grows 
           louder and deeper until it’s a rumbling thunder.  

           OVERLAY:

           In the mid 70s, cocaine was introduced to the American 
           nightclub scene.  The demand was overwhelming.

           Colombian smugglers responded by establishing trade routes 
           through the Caribbean and into Miami.  Overnight, petty 
           thieves, kidnappers and strongmen became billionaires.

           Two rival syndicates emerged to control the trade.  The 
           smaller “Cali Cartel” was headed by the Rodriguez Orejuela 
           brothers.  The larger syndicate was run from the city of 
           Medellín.  Its leader was Pablo Escobar.

           Finally, a decommissioned military cargo plane swoops into 
           view just over the treetops, and makes a rough landing.

           Proudly watching: PABLO ESCOBAR (31).  Full, jovial face, 
           thick moustache, nest of curls atop his head.

           INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY

           The payload door lowers, revealing Pablo and three young, 
           cocky men with Uzis hanging off their shoulders.  They are 
           TYSON, EL MUGRE, and CHINO.

           The AMERICAN PILOT (40s), Nam-soured and unkempt, walks down 
           the ramp to meet him.  They greet each other warmly.

                                 PILOT
                        The man himself.

           Pablo walks past him to inspect the cargo.  Stacks of small 
           wooden crates line the walls, held in place by netting.

                                 PABLO
                        Is this all five hundred?

           The pilot lights a cigar.
                                 PILOT
                        White as the driven snow.

           Pablo looks genuinely pleased.

           EXT. NAPOLES, ENTRANCE - DAY

           Cargo trucks clatter up a dirt road and pass under a stucco 
           archway.  “NAPOLES” is painted on each leg, and a single-
           engine Piper -- the smuggler’s choice -- tops the arch.

           Following close behind: Pablo on a motocross bike.

           EXT. NAPOLES, ROAD - DAY

           Pablo twists the throttle and pushes past the trucks.  The 
           surrounding grassy hills gently loll, one after the next, 
           like a calm sea.  The sun shines gloriously.

           Pablo rides tall, his hair blowing back.  To his right, a 
           small herd of zebras gallop away from the twin trumpets of 
           the bike’s mufflers.

           With a whoop, Pablo accelerates, challenging the wild animals 
           to a race they’ll never win.

           EXT. NAPOLES, HACIENDA - DAY

           The size of a resort-hotel, Hacienda Napoles rises above the 
           river valley like a holy citadel.  Exhilarated from the ride, 
           Pablo enters the grand courtyard, calling out.

                                 PABLO
                        Juan Pablo!  Juan Pablo!

           EXT. NAPOLES, HILLSIDE BESIDE THE HACIENDA - DAY

           Pablo carries his four-year-old son, JUAN PABLO on his 
           shoulders.  The boy covers his eyes.

                                 PABLO
                        Don’t peek!  Are you peeking?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        No!

           Giddy, Pablo trots down the hill to where the wooden crates 
           are arranged in rows.  His men stand by.

           Pablo sets his son down.
                                 JUAN PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Can I look?

                                 PABLO
                        Not yet...

           Pablo signals his men with a nod.  They start lowering the 
           hinged doors on each one.

           At first nothing happens.  Then, a lone white rabbit 
           cautiously hops out one of the crates.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Okay, open!

           Juan Pablo opens his eyes to see five hundred white rabbits 
           hopping around.

           The boy can’t contain his joy -- doesn’t even try.  He 
           clumsily grabs for one after the next, but the rabbits easily 
           dart to avoid him.

           Pablo, engulfed by the tide of scattering rabbits, beams with 
           pride as he watches his son play.

           His heart dances.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT

           The car hits a bump, jarring Pablo back to the here and now.

           OVERLAY:  By 1988, Pablo Escobar had become one of the ten 
           wealthiest men in the world.  He had been living in hiding 
           for four years.

           Pablo, twenty pounds heavier, looks worn down, tired.  The 
           bumpy ride begins to annoy him.

                                 PABLO
                        Be careful.

           His driver, Limón, manages the best he can.

                                 LIMÓN
                        Sorry, Patrón.  It’s the roads.
                        Always have been shit, always will 
                        be shit.

           They stop at a traffic light.
           Out the window, Pablo notices a row of political campaign 
           posters for GALÁN -- A PRESIDENT FOR THE PEOPLE!

           The poster is modeled after the famous Ché print: Galán gazes 
           toward the horizon, hopeful and proud -- his mane of curly 
           hair a bonfire for democracy.

           Pablo stares at him.  The image of Galán perfectly aligns 
           with Pablo’s reflection in the glass.

           EXT. EL MONACO - NIGHT

           The five-story concrete block rises above the quiet, tree-
           lined street.  Its walls are made of thick, cheerless 
           concrete -- more a fortress than a home.

           Pablo’s Range Rover is met by ARMED GUARDS.  Pablo climbs out 
           with large bags full of gift-wrapped presents.  He nods hello 
           at the two men, then heads inside.

           INT. EL MONACO, GARAGE - NIGHT

           The ground floor garage features a showroom-quality 
           collection of classic cars, all Rolls and Mercedes.

           Pablo doesn’t take joy in them.  He passes through as if they 
           weren’t even there.  The elevator doors slide open for him.

           INT. EL MONACO, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           The elevator opens directly to the penthouse: marble floors; 
           plush furnishings; Degas and Picasso on the walls.

           Pablo is met by the comforting smells and sounds of dinner 
           sizzling in the kitchen.

                                 PABLO
                        ...Hello?

           His wife, MARIA VICTORIA (28) comes out of the kitchen, 
           wiping her hands on a dish towel.

           She’s a comely woman, full-figured.  The corners of her mouth 
           turn down, giving her a perpetually heartbroken look.

           She’s surprised to see her husband.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Tata.
           By now, the children have heard their father, and they rush 
           out from their rooms to meet him.

                                 CHILDREN
                        Papi!

           He hugs both his children at once.

           Juan Pablo is eleven now -- husky build, curly hair.  
           Starting to resemble his father.  And then there’s little 
           MANUELA (4), cute enough to top a cake.

                                 MANUELA
                        What’dja bring us?

                                 PABLO
                        I’m not good enough?

                                 MANUELA
                             (undeterred)
                        What is it?

           He laughs, then presents them each with one of his bags.

                                 PABLO
                        For you, Manuela, my princess... 
                        And for you, Prince Juan Pablo.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        What do you say...?

           The kids thank their father out of obligation only; their 
           focus is squarely on tearing into the presents.

           Pablo looks at his wife, a guilty little grin.

                                 PABLO
                        Smells wonderful.

           INT. EL MONACO, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The family around the table, heads bowed.  Pablo says the 
           blessing.  The food is simple, homemade -- served on an 
           imported mahogany table, below a lustrous chandelier.

           INT. EL MONACO, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Manuela sits on her father’s lap.  She blows on the dice in 
           Pablo’s hands for good luck.  He rolls double sixes.
           Pablo kisses her cheek, then moves the little silver top hat 
           twelve spaces to Boardwalk.  He counts off enough Monopoly 
           money -- which he keeps in a roll -- to buy it.

           ...Juan Pablo rolls the dice, lands on Boardwalk.  He lays 
           the bills in his father’s palm: one hundred, two hundred, 
           three hundred...

           ...Maria Victoria holds out the Community Chest card to prove 
           to all that she did, indeed, just win a beauty pageant.  She 
           smiles a churlish smile.  Pablo gives her a kiss.

           ...Pablo lands in jail.  He puts on a clownishly frown and 
           holds out his hands out to be cuffed.

           ...While Maria Victoria takes her turn, Juan Pablo spies his 
           father ever so casually swipe a stack of $500 bills from the 
           bank and tuck them under the sofa cushion.

           Pablo glances at his son, knowing the boy saw everything.  
           Pablo winks, and slips him a thousand to keep quiet.

           Juan Pablo grins, and pockets the money.

           INT. EL MONACO, PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           Pablo sits on the couch, very much into the latest Bond movie 
           on TV.  His arms are around both his kids.

           Maria Victoria watches Pablo more than the movie.  He feels 
           her eyes on him and turns.

           The kids are both asleep.

           INT. EL MONACO, HALLYWAY - NIGHT

           Pablo carries the sleeping Juan Pablo to bed; Maria Victoria 
           carries their daughter.  

           INT. EL MONACO, JUAN PABLO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo lovingly brings the covers to his son’s chin and kisses 
           his forehead.  He stands there a moment to admire the sight.  
           He takes a deep breath; his head drops.  Deep regret.

           INT. EL MONACO, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maria Victoria lifts her hair.  Pablo, standing behind her, 
           tenderly clasps an emerald necklace around her neck.  She 
           admires herself in the mirror.
           INT. EL MONACO, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maria Victoria and Pablo make love, gently rocking in rhythm, 
           their two silhouettes becoming one.

           INT. EL MONACO, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo laces up his white on white tennis shoes.  He dresses 
           simply: blue jeans, polo shirt -- almost looking second-hand.

           Maria Victoria comes out of the bathroom in her robe, seeing 
           her husband already dressed.  She stops short.

           He sees the disappointment in her face.  She approaches him, 
           sultry, turning it on again.  She lifts his chin with one 
           finger.  He looks up at her, resigned.

                                 PABLO
                        You know I can’t.

           She lets go.  Backs away.  Gets a cigarette.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Do you need anything?  It might be 
                        a few days before I can call.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        We need more grocery money.  Your 
                        men are eating me out of house and 
                        home.

           He nods.  Done.

                                 PABLO
                        Anything else?

           She pauses, weighing whether unload it all.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        No.  We’re doing fine, Pablo.

           Pablo sees the weight on her shoulders.  He goes to her.  
           Brushes hair from her face.

                                 PABLO
                        I’m trying to end it, Tata.

           INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

           The main room is now dark.  Pablo passes through quietly.

           Then, a small voice from behind:
                                 JUAN PABLO (O.S.)
                        Can I come with you?

           Juan Pablo stands just outside the hall.  Pablo takes a 
           moment, then waves his son over.

                                 PABLO
                        You have an important job here.  I 
                        need you to be my eyes and ears.  
                        Next time I see you, I expect a 
                        full report.  Every mark you’ve 
                        gotten in school, every goal you’ve 
                        scored, every funny thing that 
                        Manuela has said.  I trust you, 
                        Juan Pablo.  Do you trust me?

           The boy nods.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        One day soon, all this will be 
                        over, and we will be together 
                        again.  I promise.

           He makes the sign of the cross, then embraces his son.

           EXT. EL MONACO - NIGHT

           Pablo walks out of the building.  He politely nods to the 
           guards, and gets in the idling Range Rover.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - SAME

           Pablo shuts the door, settles in.  His brow is heavy, his 
           eyes distant.  Limón checks his boss in the rear-view.

                                 LIMÓN
                        Patrón?  Any more stops?

           Pablo shakes his head.  Limón pulls out.

           Pablo takes a joint out of his coat pocket.  He lights it and 
           takes an unceremonious hit, the way an aging salesman might 
           down two fingers of scotch at the end of a long day.

           INT. EL MONACO, JUAN PABLO’S ROOM - SAME

           From his bedroom window, a heavy-hearted Juan Pablo watches 
           his father motor away.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. EL MONACO - DAWN

           The pre-dawn sunlight casts everything in the same dull gray 
           as the concrete building.  Morning dew blankets the cars 
           parked up and down the road.

           The guards continue to keep watch, though their attention has 
           flagged.  They smoke and play cards to stay awake.

           A Renault parked on the street explodes with righteous fury.

           The shock wave tears the guards apart before the chunks of 
           steel even have a chance.

           INT. JUAN PABLO’S ROOM - SAME

           The windows burst into a thousand pieces and rain down over 
           the boy, who opens his eyes in time to see a column of smoke 
           and flame rising past his room.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        PAPI!!!!

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING

           The dirt road meanders to a one-story hacienda atop a hill.  
           We are far from the city; this is horse country.

           OVERLAY: Somewhere in the Magdalena River Valley

           Escobar’s SUV parks alongside three others.  Pablo and Limón 
           get out, both looking exhausted.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING

           Pablo unlaces his white tennis shoes.  He takes them off and 
           sets them neatly at the foot of the bed.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, BATHROOM - MORNING

           Pablo brushes his teeth.  He is mindful of each tooth.  And 
           when he is done, he puts more toothpaste on his brush and 
           starts again.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - MORNING

           GUSTAVO GAVIRIA (early 40s) knocks back another espresso, 
           though the twitch in his eyes say he hardly needs it.
           He studies a map of the Caribbean on the wall.  It’s a low-
           tech air traffic control system.  Pins and colored yarn track 
           the progress of cocaine north and money south.

           White yarn extends from Colombia to the US via Cuba and the 
           Bahamas.  Green yarn returns through the Caymans and 
           Nicaragua.

           The room is outfitted with ten separate land-lines, a short-
           wave radio, and a briefcase-sized satellite phone.

           The satellite phone rings, getting Gustavo’s attention.  
           Strange.  He picks it up.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Who is this?

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE, COURTYARD - MORNING

           Pablo sips a café and reads through the politics pages of El 
           País.  More stories and pictures of the fiery Galán.

           Gustavo comes out carrying the satellite phone.  Pablo looks 
           up, immediately reading the concern on Gustavo’s face.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Rodriguez brothers.

                                 PABLO
                        What do they want?

                                 GUSTAVO
                        They won’t tell me, the pig 
                        fuckers.

           Pablo sets the paper down, and picks up the phone.

                                 PABLO
                        Gilberto?  It’s been too long, my 
                        friend.

           INT. RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA RANCH - INTERCUT

           The gentlemanly GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA (40s) stands on 
           his veranda, having a morning espresso.  A few feet away, his 
           brother, MIGUEL (40s) listens.

           OVERLAY: Cali, Colombia

                                 GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA
                        Pablo.  I just heard.  They weren’t 
                        in the building, were they?
           Pablo steels himself.  He plays along.

                                 PABLO
                        ...Thank God, no.

                                 GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA
                        If you need, my people can take 
                        them to you.

                                 PABLO
                        That is kind, but I’ve taken care 
                        of that.  Forgive me, Gilberto, but 
                        I have many things to attend to 
                        this morning.

                                 GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA
                        Of course.  Miguel and I are at 
                        your service.  God be with you.

           Pablo gently hangs up.  He takes a long, deep breath.  His 
           face is a portrait of calm.  Gustavo waits impatiently.

                                 PABLO
                        We need to call Roberto.

           EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

           ROBERTO ESCOBAR (40s) runs with a purpose, brushing past the 
           idly curious, the shocked neighbors, to the police barricade.

           An officer tries to stop him, but Roberto barely slows.

                                 ROBERTO
                        That’s my family -- PLEASE!

           Roberto slips through the chaos until he comes upon:

           EXT. EL MONACO - CONTINUOUS

           The bomb has gored out a deep crater in the asphalt; burned-
           out hulls of cars litter the street.

           Roberto stops short.  He’s a thin man, muscular, but not 
           imposing.  His gentle face has been rendered aghast by the 
           sight of El Monaco.

           A fire brigade hoses down the building.  While its concrete 
           facade has crumbled, the structure itself -- miraculously --
           remains standing.

           Roberto wanders, gripping his skull, hopelessly calling out:
                                 ROBERTO
                        MARIA!  JUAN PABLO!

           His shouts elicit only cautious glances from police.

           Through the melee, he spots Maria Victoria with the two 
           children, being examined by paramedics.

           He runs to them.  They hug.

                                 ROBERTO (CONT’D)
                        Thank you...thank you God...

           He looks them over: smoke-stained, pocked with little cuts -- 
           only scratches, considering.  Overall, in one piece.

                                 ROBERTO (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay?

           Maria manages a nod, considering.

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        Señora, we need you to get in the 
                        ambulance.

                                 ROBERTO
                        This is my brother’s family.  
                        They’re coming with me.
                             (to Maria Victoria)
                        He has a doctor waiting.

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        We’re going to the hospital.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Do you know who my brother is?

           He nervously looks at his partner, who stares at the ground.

           EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Roberto carries his nephew and niece to a waiting SUV.  
           Roberto helps Maria Victoria and the girl inside.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Where are we going?

                                 ROBERTO
                        To see your papi.  Come on.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        But I wanna go back home.
           Roberto pauses.  The boy still looks dazed.  Disoriented.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Tranquillo, niño -- papi will take 
                        care of everything.

           Roberto loads Juan Pablo in, then gets in the passenger side. 
           The SUV speeds away.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Once on the main road, the driver, EL CHOPO (20s) hands out a 
           few pieces of black fabric.

                                 CHOPO
                        Put these on.

           Maria Victoria realizes what he’s asking; her stomach turns. 

                                 ROBERTO
                        They don’t need those.

                                 CHOPO
                        Orders.

           Roberto, resigned, takes the pieces of fabric and doles them 
           out to Maria Victoria and the children.

           Juan Pablo examines it: an opaque black bag.  He doesn’t know 
           what to make of it.

           Maria Victoria puts on a bright face for her daughter.  She 
           speaks loud and slowly.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Honey, we’re going to put these on 
                        and play a dress-up game, okay?

           The girl nods, unsure of the game.  Maria Victoria pulls the 
           hood over Manuela’s eyes, stopping short of her mouth.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (CONT’D)
                        There, don’t you look cute.

           Maria Victoria looks at her son, helplessly -- hopelessly -- 
           before putting her own hood on.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (CONT’D)
                        Now I’m wearing mine.  And we wear 
                        them until Chopo says stop.  Isn’t 
                        this fun?
           Juan Pablo looks to his uncle for some kind of reprieve.  
           Nothing.  Finally, he puts it on.  And everything goes black.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. NAPOLES, HILLSIDE BESIDE THE HACIENDA - DAY

           Pablo crouched down, holding one of the white rabbits.  Juan 
           Pablo pets its head.

                                 PABLO
                        Do you know why I got them?

           The boy shakes his head.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Because they’re good luck.  So this 
                        way, we’ll never run out.

           With his son’s help, Pablo releases the rabbit.  The entire 
           hillside is dotted with them.

                                                             RETURN TO:

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE, BACK FIELD - DAY

           Pablo looks out over the field behind the house, a gentle 
           slope segmented by horse fences.  No rabbits.

           Limón comes out of the house with a cell phone in his hand.

                                 LIMÓN
                        Patrón.

           Pablo turns his head slightly.

                                 LIMÓN (CONT’D)
                        Roberto has them.  They’re coming.

           Pablo simply nods.  His composure does not crack.  He returns 
           his gaze to the fields.

           INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           A neighborhood joint.  Not a single barber under sixty.  A 
           group of men argue politics and soccer.

           A paunchy man with thinning hair reclines in a chair, his 
           face wrapped in a hot towel.  The BARBER beside him hones his 
           straight razor on a strap.
           The neighborhood men quiet down to listen to the B&W 
           television.  The man under the towel can’t help but overhear.

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        ...ripping through the affluent 
                        Medellín neighborhood of Santa 
                        Maria de los Angeles shortly before 
                        dawn.  The building is believed to 
                        be one of the dozens of homes owned 
                        by elusive narcotrafficker Pablo 
                        Escobar.

           The man turns his head, ever so slightly.  The barber removes 
           his hot towel, and we see his face.  FELIX GONZÁLES(50s).

           He sees the remains of El Monaco on the set, and is clearly 
           troubled by it.  The barber, unaware, lathers his face.

                                 BARBER
                        Trim the nose today, Congressman?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        No thank you, Victor.  Just the 
                        shave.

           INT. EL MONACO, TELEVISION NEWSCAST - DAY

           The news camera explores the remains of El Monaco.  The 
           antique cars, now ruined.  The art.  And Maria Victoria’s 
           massive shoe collection.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)

                        works of art by Pablo Picasso and 
                        Salvador Dali, a wardrobe 
                        containing an estimated seven 
                        hundred pairs of shoes.

           INT. GACHA’S HILLSIDE MANSION - DAY

           JOSÉ RODRÍGUEZ “THE MEXICAN” GACHA (41) watches the very same 
           news broadcast while talking on the phone.  His office is the 
           size of a tennis court.

                                 GACHA
                        I’m watching it now.  Has he 
                        contacted you?

           Gacha sports alligator boots and an emerald-encrusted belt 
           buckle.  Everything about him is intentionally caballero.
                                 GACHA (CONT’D)
                        Maybe the FARC.  M-19.  DAS.  Cali.  
                        Maybe all of them.  Whoever it was, 
                        He’ll wanna go to war.

           EXT. POLO GROUNDS - DAY

           On the other end of the line: JORGE LUÍS OCHOA (39), looking 
           on-edge.  Behind him, purebred horses compete in dressage to 
           the polite applause of the well-heeled.

                                 JORGE LUÍS OCHOA
                        Is that what you want?

           He listens for a moment more.  His two younger brothers, JUAN 
           DAVID and FABIO, hang on his next word.

                                 JORGE LUÍS OCHOA (CONT’D)
                        I need to discuss it with my 
                        brothers first.  We’ll wait for his 
                        call.

           He hangs up.

                                 JORGE LUÍS OCHOA (CONT’D)
                        God damn it.

                                 FABIO OCHOA
                             (cautiously)
                        Who’s going to tell papá?

           They look to the gallery where the rotund FABIO OCHOA SR. 
           (65) fans himself absently like a sheik.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - EVENING

           Juan Pablo takes off his hood.  His eyes take a moment to 
           adjust.  He looks through the windshield and sees his father 
           and Gustavo waiting for them.

                                 MANUELA
                        Papi!

           Manuela hurries out of the car before anyone.

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - SAME

           Pablo runs to her.  Scoops her up and smothers her in kisses.

           The others get out, and walk to Pablo and Gustavo.  Juan 
           Pablo, however, lingers by the car.
           Pablo holds his wife, kisses her.  Maria Victoria can’t help 
           crying with relief.  Besos y abrazos all around.

           Pablo looks over to his son, who hasn’t moved.  Pablo waves 
           him over.  Juan Pablo still doesn’t come.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                             (a scold)
                        Juan Pablo...

           The boy shuffles over to his family.  Pablo breaks away from 
           the others to meet his son one-on-one.

           A moment of silence, then Pablo hugs him.  Juan Pablo returns 
           the gesture, pro-forma.  No feeling behind it.

           And Pablo can tell.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Maria Victoria puts the children to bed in the same room, a 
           far cry from the penthouse.  She leads them in prayer.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Our father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom 
                        come, Thy will be done, on Earth as 
                        it is in heaven...

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo adds another log to the already roaring fire.  He jabs 
           at it with an iron poker.

           Roberto and Gustavo sit behind him.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        They think because we’ve been 
                        laying low, we’re weak.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Won’t the others want proof it was 
                        Cali before they approve a war?

                                 GUSTAVO
                        We don’t need them to approve shit.

                                 ROBERTO
                        It’s not as simple as it was ten 
                        years ago.  The Ochoas have 
                        business with Gilberto now -- they 
                        own banks together.
                                 GUSTAVO
                        Fuck their banks.  And their drug 
                        stores, and whatever else they’re 
                        hiding behind.  Pablo and me built 
                        this from nothing, and I’m not 
                        letting some faggots from Cali make 
                        a play for it.  
                             (to Pablo)
                        How fast can Don Berna get his men 
                        into Cali?

                                 PABLO
                        We can’t move on them yet.  Not 
                        without proof.

           Silence.  Pablo stares into the fire.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Gilberto is a chess player.  He has 
                        just exposed his queen.  Do we go 
                        after her?  Or do we find the pawns 
                        protecting her?
                             (to Gilberto)
                        Call a meeting with the others.  We 
                        don’t need their approval, but we 
                        do need to know whose side they’re 
                        on.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo quietly opens the door to check on the children.  In 
           one bed he finds Maria Victoria sleeping, cradling Manuela.

           The other bed is empty.

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pablo ventures outside, where he finds Juan Pablo sitting 
           under a tree, knees pulled to his chest -- his breath making 
           little puffs of vapor in the chilly night air.

                                 PABLO
                        What are you doing, it’s freezing.

           Juan Pablo doesn’t look up.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I don’t wanna be inside.

           Pablo takes sympathy on his son.  He removes his heavy coat 
           and puts it around the boy’s shoulders.  He sits beside him.
                                 PABLO
                        You’re safe here.

           Juan Pablo nods, distantly.

           They sit together for a long time.  Pablo puts his arm around 
           his son, and looks up at the stars.  Or heaven.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                             (a whisper)
                        Sana, sana, colita de rana.  Si no 
                        sanas hoy, sanarás manaña.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. RODRIGO LARA BONILLA MONUMENT - DAY

           The granite obelisk points to the heavens.  Its inscription: 
           RODRIGO LARA BONILLA 1946-1984.  MINISTER OF JUSTICE.

           LUÍS CARLOS GALÁN (45), the presidential candidate, speaks at 
           the monument’s foot to a crowd of thousands. 

                                 GALÁN
                        Four years ago, Rodrigo Lara stood 
                        up to the cartels, and demanded an 
                        end to their wholesale corruption 
                        of the Colombian government.  The 
                        cartels murdered him, hoping a 
                        bullet would silence his voice.

           Galán shares the stage with a few other politicos.  Among 
           them is Felix Gonzáles, a supportive smile on his face, 
           placed just so.

                                 GALÁN (CONT’D)
                        No longer can this great nation 
                        tolerate the destructive force of 
                        the narco-terrorists!  Their 
                        bullets will not silence us.  Their 
                        bombs will not silence us.  They 
                        cannot silence peace!  They cannot 
                        silence democracy!  They cannot 
                        silence freedom!

           The crowd erupts with cheers and chants of Ga-lán!  Ga-lán!.  
           The candidate, a master of oration, lets the moment breathe.

           INT. BULLFIGHTING ARENA - DAY

           A MATADOR, partially outfitted, walks the sandy floor, waving 
           his cape, rehearsing for a bull that has yet to arrive.
           Pablo watches the matador from the otherwise empty stands, 
           admiring his movements.  He sits with Felix Gonzáles, who 
           uses the brim of his Panama to obscure his face.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        I saw something remarkable today: 
                        Luís Carlos Galán became the next 
                        President of Colombia.

                                 PABLO
                        I read you endorsed him.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        He won the nomination fairly; I 
                        don’t hold grudges.  The people 
                        want change, and they believe he 
                        can deliver.  He reminds me of you, 
                        once.

           Pablo chuckles to himself.

                                 PABLO
                        Are you trying to get me to run 
                        against him?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        You’re still beloved.  You 
                        transformed this place.  Some 
                        people condemn how you’ve done it, 
                        but the fact is you’ve brought 
                        enough money into this country to 
                        elevate us to first-world status.  
                        Since Pizarro, the world has been 
                        stealing from Colombia.  You 
                        finally brought the gold home.

           Pablo looks off.  The matador poses, swipes his cape.

                                 PABLO
                        The Spanish have a completely 
                        different style.  More fluid, 
                        lighter.  But it lacks passion, 
                        danger.  It’s too precise.  
                        Sometimes the beauty is in the 
                        flaws.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Why did you bring me here?

                                 PABLO
                        It’s time for this to end.  I need 
                        you to get a message to President 
                        Barco.  I’ve decided to surrender.
           Gonzáles takes that one in, does the math.  

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Can’t be done.  The Americans would 
                        force him to turn you over.

                                 PABLO
                        Not if he ends extradition.  I 
                        serve my time here, in Colombia, 
                        where I’m safe.

           Gonzáles pauses.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        There are plenty of countries that 
                        would take you in right now.  
                        Liberia.  The Philippines -- you’d 
                        live like a king.

                                 PABLO
                        I own this arena.  Everyone here 
                        works for me.  The police captain 
                        is a personal friend.  My only 
                        protection is here.  

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Bogotá isn’t Medellín.  After you 
                        disappeared, everyone started doing 
                        business with Gilberto and Miguel.  
                        In Bogotá, they aren’t narcos, 
                        they’re the owners of a chain of 
                        pharmacies, nothing more.  
                        Politicians lined up to take their 
                        money, Barco included.  You 
                        surrender now, and you’ll be 
                        surrendering to them.

                                 PABLO
                        I don’t see my children for weeks, 
                        sometimes months at a time.  It’s 
                        affecting them.  Either Barco ends 
                        extradition, and I turn myself in 
                        peacefully, or he’ll have a war on 
                        his hands.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                             (resigned)
                        I’ll do what I can.

           Gonzáles gets up, puts on his sunglasses, completing the 
           incognito look.  He takes a moment to observe the matador.
                                 GONZÁLEZ (CONT’D)
                        I’ve always preferred the Spanish 
                        style.

           Gonzáles walks down the stairs between the rows, and 
           eventually vanishes under the arena.

           Pablo watches the matador draw his sword, then pantomime 
           running the bull through.  Pablo’s gaze becomes remote.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. MEDELLÍN SOCCER PITCH - NIGHT

           A blinding strobe of flash bulbs.

           Pablo -- younger, leaner -- cuts a ceremonial ribbon 
           inaugurating PABLO ESCOBAR STADIUM.  He holds the pose for 
           the photographers.  The two clubs are lined on either side.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        Gooooooool!   Goooooool!!

           EXT. MEDELLÍN SOCCER PITCH - NIGHT

           Pablo runs a wide circle around the baseline following his 
           goal, pumping his arms in celebration.

                                 ANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.)
                        Goooooool ESCOBAR!

           The REFEREE blows the final whistle and waves his arms.  
           Pablo’s fellow players mob him; the crowd chants.

                                 CROWD
                        Pab-lo!  Pab-lo!  Pab-lo!

           They are toilers, sun-baked and street-worn.  Proud and 
           frugal, with a taste for the aguardiente.  And they love him.

           Pablo is met by Maria Victoria and the young Juan Pablo.  He 
           hoists his admiring son into the air.  The chants continue:

                                 CROWD (CONT’D)
                        Pab-lo!  Pab-lo!

           EXT. CITY SQUARE, MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           Thousands, young and old, chant his name.   They wave signs: 
           ESCOBAR ‘82; ESCOBAR FOR CONGRESS.  VICTORY!
                                 CROWD
                        Pab-lo!  Pab-lo!  Pab-lo!

           Pablo looks through the blinding stage lights onto the crowd.

                                 PABLO
                        The people have spoken!  Luis 
                        Carlos Galán and the New Liberals 
                        kicked me out of their party.  Now 
                        we know why -- they knew we’d win!

           More cheers!

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        For too long, our country has been 
                        controlled by the chosen few!  They 
                        own the factories but build nothing 
                        with their hands!  They drill our 
                        oil, but cannot dig a hole!  They 
                        sell our coffee but have never 
                        picked a single bean!

           Behind him, just beyond the throw of the lights, Felix 
           González beams.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        They are not Colombia.  We -- We 
                        are Colombia!  We are Colombia!

           Pablo pumps his fists, urging a new chant:

                                 CROWD
                        We -- Are -- Colombia!

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           The chants still echo, We -- Are -- Colombia!  Felix Gonzáles 
           raises a glass to Pablo, still aglow from the victory.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        By 1990, you’ll be President.

                                                             RETURN TO:

           INT. BULLFIGHTING RING - NIGHT

           Night has fallen.  The arena is dark.  Pablo has not moved.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. JUNGLES OF CAQUETA - ESTABLISHING

           From above: a vast carpet of treetops spreads uninterrupted 
           to the horizon -- impenetrable, primeval.

           EXT. CAQUETA JUNGLE PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

           Two shirtless men, soaked with sweat, stomp across a trough 
           of coca leaves.  Another worker with a rag over his mouth 
           sprinkles the trough with ammonia from a watering can.

           This trough is only one of ten identical ones, all with men 
           stomping hundreds of cubic yards of coca.

           CARLOS CASTAÑO (24) surveys the operation.  Never out of his 
           fatigues, never far from his sidearm.

           As he walks the compound, two classes emerge: INDIGENOUS 
           WORKERS processing the cocaine, and ragtag PARAMILITARY 
           TEENAGERS standing guard.

           The ramshackle encampment is little more than tarpaulins and 
           thatch strung across rotting posts.  Fifty-gallon drums of 
           ether and acetone rust away in crudely-lashed pyramids.

           At one station, workers pour gasoline into vats of crushed 
           leaves.  At another, the vats are strained, leaving behind 
           large cakes of the yellowish base.

           The jungle encroaches on everything, only inches and days 
           away from swallowing the place whole.

           INT. THATCH WATCHTOWER - DAY

           A BOY IN CAMO, no older than 15, crumbles chunks of basuko, 
           or coca base, in with his tobacco.  Licks it.  Rolls it.  
           Lights it.  Smokes it.  His eyes glass over. 

           A small noise grows louder: Thp-thp-thp-thp-thp-thp...

           The boy looks up.  To his horror, four helicopters thunder 
           toward him.  He scrambles for the radio.

                                 BOY IN CAMO
                        Jefe!  Jefe!  They’re coming!

           INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME

           The warning comes through the receiver, loud and clear.  But 
           no one is there to hear it.
           EXT. THATCH WATCHTOWER - SAME

           The chopper blades drown out the boy’s shouts altogether.

           As they buzz the watchtower, one slows.  Its side-mounted 
           machine gun trains on the boy.

           He opens a door in the floor and scrambles down the rickety 
           ladder -- he’s a good fifty feet off the ground.

           The chopper unloads a torrent of lead, tearing the flimsy 
           structure to pieces.

           Bits of thatch and canopy rain down.  Bullets riddle his 
           skull and torso.  His limp body plummets to the jungle floor.

           EXT. CAQUETA JUNGLE PROCESSING PLANT - SAME

           Castaño moves past a long stainless steel table where workers 
           measure and weigh the refined cocaine.

           He comes to a sturdier, wood plank structure.  From inside: a 
           woman’s voice is heard.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nariz.  Nariz.

           INT. CAQUETA SCHOOL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Castaño enters what we immediately recognize as a classroom, 
           full of kindergartners, practicing their spelling.

                                 CHILDREN
                        N-A-R-I-Z.

           The TEACHER, young and fair, gives Castaño a familiar grin.

           Thp-thp-thp....

           Castaño cocks his head.  She hears it too.

                                 TEACHER
                        Okay, children -- come with me...

           EXT. CAQUETA JUNGLE PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

           Castaño runs out of the school, shouting to his men.

                                 CASTAÑO
                        POSITIONS!  POSITIONS!
           Behind him, the teacher hurries the children away.

           The paramilitaries grab their weapons.  The workers abandon 
           their stations and flee into the jungle in all directions.

           The pulse of chopper blades fills the camp.  The treetops 
           rustle from the downdraft.  Castaño and his men aim their 
           guns up, but cannot see through the canopy.

           For a few tense moments, nothing happens.  Then one jittery 
           kid squeezes his trigger and fires a shot skyward.

           The helicopters return fire en masse.  The men who aren’t 
           instantly torn apart, run, shooting haphazardly into the air.

           Castaño, no fool, calls out the order.

                                 CASTAÑO (CONT’D)
                        FALL BACK!  FALL BACK!

           He and whoever is left sprint into the jungle.

           EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - DAY

           The fight is over.  The helicopters have landed.  Government 
           soldiers with DAS on their backs corral the prisoners.

           The dead lie in a row, uncovered.  A single-engine Cessna 
           burns.  The teacher tries to keep the children from looking.

           EXT. CAQUETA JUNGLE PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

           DAS soldiers photograph the caches of weapons and drugs.

           Others douse the processing decks with gasoline and set them 
           on fire.  Everything burns, even the schoolhouse.

           EXT. CAQUETA RIVER - DAY

           DAS soldiers slash kilo packs open and shake cocaine into the 
           river.  Others simply dump wheelbarrows full of the stuff 
           over a narrow foot bridge.

           Tons of coke flow down-river, turning the water into milk.

           EXT. CAQUETA JUNGLE - DAY

           Castaño, having reached higher ground with a small band of 
           men, looks down at the black smoke rising from the plant.
                                 PARAMILITARY KID
                        What now, jefe?

                                 CASTAÑO
                        We go see Don Berna.

           INT. PRESS ROOM, OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL - DAY

           The PRESS SECRETARY addresses the press corps.  He shares the 
           stage with DAS AGENTS, crisply dressed in their blues.

           Also displayed, on easels: pictures from the Caqueta raid, 
           including a file photo of Castaño.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        I’d like to congratulate General 
                        Maza and the DAS for carrying out 
                        the raid without a single shot 
                        being fired.

           He gestures to GENERAL MAZA (50s), the head of the DAS -- a 
           humorless man with pocked jowls and tiny eyes.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Along with the eight thousand 
                        kilos, we have obtained direct 
                        evidence linking Carlos Castaño and 
                        his right-wing paramilitary group 
                        to the Medellín drug cartel.  This 
                        office, in concert with the US Drug 
                        Enforcement Agency, has issued new 
                        arrest warrants for the leaders of 
                        the cartel:

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - INTERCUT

           New cars arrive at the house, each one carrying an entourage 
           of heavily armed men.  We cut to each leader stepping out of 
           his respective car as the Press Secretary rattles off names:

                                 PRESS SECRETARY (V.O.)

           “The Mexican” dons his snakeskin hat.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Jorge Luís Ochoa, Juan David 
                        Ochoa, Fabio Ochoa Jr...

           The two younger Ochoas pay clear deference to the eldest.  
           “Fabito” almost looks like a terrier tagging along.
                                 PRESS SECRETARY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Diego Murillo, a.k.a. “Don 
                        Berna”...

           Apple shaped, thick moustache, heavy brow -- DON BERNA (40s) 
           looks least at ease with the tranquil setting.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Gustavo Gaviria, and Pablo

           Pablo and Gustavo cordially greet their business associates.

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE, COURTYARD - LATER

           Lively music plays.  Almost a party.  Maria Victoria sets out 
           a tres leches cake for everyone.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Just a little something to hold you 
                        over.  I hope it turned out; I’m 
                        still getting used to this kitchen.

                                 PABLO
                        It looks delicious.

           He kisses her cheek.  She gives him a grin, more for the 
           others’ benefit -- she’s not as gracious as she’s letting on.

           He helps her spoon out portions.  Manuela scurries up, eager 
           for a piece.  Pablo sneaks her a bite off the spoon.

           The men pass the plates, all thanking her.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                             (veiled distaste)
                        I’m so glad we could all be 
                        together again, it’s been so long.

           Pablo spies his son lurking inside, and goes to him with a 
           piece of cake.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I’m not hungry.

                                 PABLO
                        Come say hello -- everyone’s asking 
                        about you.

           Pablo takes his son to the men.  They shout hearty hellos and 
           jostle the boy, remarking how big he’s gotten.
           Gacha holds up his palms, goading Juan Pablo to throw a 
           punch.  Juan Pablo obliges, and Gacha makes a show of being 
           hurt.  He musses the kid’s hair, and passes him along.

           Juan Pablo floats from one man to the next, feigning 
           enjoyment, desperately wanting to run.

           Pablo stands off his son’s shoulder, seeing Juan Pablo’s 
           discomfort.  He pulls his brother aside.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Take the kids riding.

                                 ROBERTO
                        You don’t want me to stay?

           Pablo shakes his head no.  Roberto goes along and gathers his 
           niece and nephew.

                                 ROBERTO (CONT’D)
                        Come on niños, let’s go see the 
                        horses.

           Pablo returns to his compatriots.

           The men relax, safe as sultans, talking business.  Pablo, the 
           consummate host, refills glasses with the finest brandy.

                                 DON BERNA
                        I don’t know how they found the 
                        lab.  Castaño’s my best man.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA 
                        Where is he?

                                 DON BERNA
                        He’ll contact me when it’s safe.

                                 GACHA
                        Would he have sold us out?

                                 DON BERNA
                        Castaño is loyal.  I trust him with 
                        my life.

                                 GACHA
                        Every man has a price.
                                 JORGE LUÍS OCHOA
                        To hell with the raid.  We’re here 
                        to talk about the bombing.  Do we 
                        know who did it?

           Pablo sets down the brandy.  For his part, he drinks water.

                                 GACHA
                        Had to be a foreigner -- no one 
                        here knows explosives.

                                 FABIO OCHOA
                        CIA.  They’ve got spy planes flying 
                        over the city, listening to the 
                        cellulars, you know...

                                 PABLO
                        Gilberto and Miguel ordered it.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        Do you have proof?

                                 PABLO
                        Enough, yes.

           A tense silence.  Juan David defers.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        We knew this was coming.  They’re 
                        businessmen like us; they’re not 
                        satisfied with half of anything.  I 
                        think we’re all agreed what has to 
                        happen now.

           He looks to Gacha first.

                                 GACHA
                        Absolutely.

           The Ochoas look visibly uncomfortable.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA 
                        We’re with you.

                                 PABLO
                        And your father?

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        I speak for my whole family.

           Pablo looks to Don Berna, who nods in agreement.
                                 PABLO
                        Castaño was paid off.  When he 
                        surfaces, I want him taken care of.

                                 DON BERNA
                        ...How do you know that?

                                 PABLO
                        Just deal with him.

           Don Berna -- against his every fiber -- nods again.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Settled.  Enough business.

           EXT. STABLES - DAY

           Pablo leans against the horse fence, watching his son ride 
           around the enclosure.  Roberto leads Manuela’s pony in a lazy 
           stroll.  Pablo finds it endearing.

                                 PABLO
                        My little Lady Godiva.

           He waves to his daughter, she waves back.  Couldn’t be cuter.

           Pablo glances over at the STABLE BOY coming out to fill two 
           buckets from the spigot.  Pablo fixes on him for a moment -- 
           bothered by something.

                                 LIMÓN
                             (calling)
                        Patrón!

           Pablo turns, sees Limón walking up with one of the large 
           cellular phones.  He hands it over.

                                 PABLO
                        Yes?

           A busy street in Bogota, the dome of the Chamber of

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        There won’t be a deal.

           Pablo pauses.

                                 PABLO
                        How much does he want?
                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        There won’t be a deal.

           Gonzáles hangs up, and gets into a waiting limousine.

           Pablo hands the phone back to Limón.  He cloaks his anger 
           with calm, measured movements.

                        Papi!  Look at me!

           Manuela holds her hands above her head as she rides.

                                 PABLO
                        I see, angel.

           Pablo looks back to the Stable Boy, who finishes filling up 
           the buckets.  The boy looks up -- directly at Pablo -- and 
           turns away quickly.  He brings the water into the stable.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                             (to Limón)
                        Who is that?  Where’s the regular 
                        kid?

                                 LIMÓN
                        I don’t know.  Sick I think.  
                        That’s his cousin.

           Pablo stares into the stables.

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

           The Ochoas, Gacha and Don Berna leave the house, entourages 
           and all, and get into their cars.  They waste no time.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, VARIOUS - DAY

           Inside, Pablo’s men break everything down.  They work 
           swiftly, but are not rushed.

           -- KITCHEN: men unload a cache of automatic weapons from the 
           topmost cabinets, and pack them into duffel bags.

           -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM: Gustavo and his men unplug the phones 
           and radios, and haul them out in boxes.

           -- BEDROOM: Roberto opens the closet and pushes the hanging 
           clothes aside.  He presses against the back wall, springing a 
           secret door hiding hundreds of thousands of dollars.
           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, PABLO’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Pablo removes tightly-wrapped bundles of cash from a crawl 
           space under the floor.  Maria Victoria hurries in.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        What’s happening?

           Pablo rises, goes to her.  Calm.  Gentle.

                                 PABLO
                        We’re leaving.  Get the children.

           He pets her face, reassuring her.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           He turns her around.  In a daze, she leaves to get the kids.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (O.S.)
                        Manuela?  Juan Pablo...

           Pablo opens the dresser and removes a silver-plated Sig 
           Sauer, a real gem.  He tucks it into his waist band.

           As he does, he catches sight of Juan Pablo down the hall, 
           watching him.  He saw the gun, saw the cash, saw it all.

           Pablo can’t mistake the fear in his son’s eyes.

           Maria Victoria appears and scoots Juan Pablo into his room.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (CONT’D)
                        Get your clothes together, mi amor.

           Pablo takes a deep breath, then resumes packing.

           EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY

           Roberto shuffles Maria Victoria and the children into Chopo’s 
           waiting car.  She hides her anxiety, but not very well.

           Pablo comes out of the hacienda with Gustavo.  He squints, 
           scanning the road, then the sky.  Everything’s clear.  

           He goes to his family.

                                 PABLO
                        I’ll call in a few days.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        You’re not coming?
           Manuela climbs over her mom to hug her papi.

                                 MANUELA
                        Come with us!

                                 PABLO
                        You’ll be fine, angel.

           Maria Victoria pries her crying daughter from Pablo.  He 
           looks to his son, who doesn’t shed a single tear.  Indeed, 
           Juan Pablo’s look is one of profound disappointment.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Remember the job I gave you.  Eyes 
                        and ears.  I’m counting on you.

           Juan Pablo nods, then draws the black hood over his own head.  
           Pablo pauses, disturbed by the sight.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Berto’s got ‘em, let’s go.

           Pablo turns away from his family and joins Gustavo in another 
           car.  He can still hear Manuela’s cries.

           Within a few moments, the last of the cars roll away from the 
           hacienda, leaving behind only dust.

           INT. COUNTRY HOUSE, VARIOUS - DAY

           -- KITCHEN: cabinets left open, and emptied.  Dirty dishes in 
           the sink and on the stove.

           -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM: tables are left, and some phone cord, 
           but little else.

           -- BEDROOMS: holes in walls and floorboards, exposing empty 
           hiding places.  Overturned mattresses, slashed open.  Dresser 
           drawers pulled out, exposing false backs and bottoms.

           -- COURTYARD: the music still plays.  The half-eaten cake has 
           been given up to the flies.

           -- STABLE: the Stable Boy lies in a heap, shot execution-
           style through the head.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           The SUV takes each bump in the dirt road hard.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Which one of them gave us up?
                                 PABLO
                        I don’t know yet.

           Once again, Pablo’s gaze is troubled.  He closes his eyes.

           In his mind, he hears rapid gun fire -- tat-tat-tat-tat!  He 
           hears tires screeching, and a car crash.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

           The TV reporter, distraught, fighting tears of his own, 
           struggles to look into the camera.

                                 REPORTER
                        It’s been confirmed: the victim in 
                        the fatal shooting is Minister of 
                        Justice, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla. 

           Behind him, a Mercedes is wrapped around a phone pole, 
           surrounded by police.  A corpse lays covered in the street.

           EXT. NAPOLES, HACIENDA - DAY

           Pablo hurries from the house with his pregnant wife and young 
           son.  No bags.  No time.

                                 REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Today, April 30th, 1984, is a day 
                        Colombia will never forget.

           They board a waiting helicopter, its rotors already spinning.

           INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

           The helicopter rises above Napoles.  Pablo watches his 
           beloved castle grow smaller by the moment.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Where are we going?

           Pablo can’t stop staring out the window.  Maria Victoria 
           comforts her child.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        It’s called Panama.  It’s a very 
                        nice place.  Very nice.
           Soon enough, Napoles is gone. And with it, Pablo’s dreams.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. BROTHEL - NIGHT

           Carlos Castaño descends a staircase, passing through the 
           beaded curtain.  The basement is painted in dirty velvet; 
           fleshy prostitutes loiter, smoking and looking bored.

           He looks past the women to the BOUNCER by the hall.  The 
           bouncer recognizes Castaño, and leads him into the back.

           INT. BROTHEL, BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Don Berna awaits Castaño.  The jungle fighter, looking out of 
           place and unsure, sits where he is directed.

                                 DON BERNA
                        They want me to kill you.

           Castaño, unafraid of his fate, is stone.  Don Berna leans 
           back in his chair and studies the young warrior.

                                 DON BERNA (CONT’D)
                        I said you were loyal.  Are you?

                                 CASTAÑO
                        To you, yes.

           INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT

           An aging TV plays EL MINUTO DE DIOS.  No sound.  The flowing 
           cursive title fades to FATHER RAFAEL GARCIA HERREROS (80s), a 
           kindly Catholic priest in an armchair, addressing the camera.

                                 PABLO
                        We have tried to negotiate a 
                        peaceful solution, but your vile 
                        wretch of a President will not 
                        negotiate.

           Pablo paces the room, composing.  EL POETA, one of Pablo’s 
           few literate men scratches down his boss’ every word.

           From elsewhere in the house comes an anguished scream, 
           throwing El Poeta off.

                                 EL POETA
                        ...vile...
                                 PABLO
                        Vile wretch of a President.

           El Poeta scribbles.  More screams from upstairs.  Pablo 
           glances up, but more out of annoyance.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        We demand nothing short of an end 
                        to this country’s policy of 
                        extraditing its citizens --

           More screams.  Pablo loses his train of thought.  Frustrated, 
           he stomps upstairs.

           INT. FLOP HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The SCREAMING MAN is strapped to a bed frame. JOHN “POPEYE” 
           VELAZQUEZ (20s) crouches by his feet, snipping off his toes 
           with a pair of pruning shears.  He’s on number seven.

           Gustavo stands against the wall, eating a sandwich.

           Pablo enters.  He pulls his Sig and shoots the man in the 
           forehead.  The screams stop, and for a second, it’s quiet.

           Pablo turns to the fourth man in the room: EZKIBEL -- half 
           naked, profusely sweating and shivering at the same time.

           Pablo gets down on his haunches to look the man in the eye.

                                 PABLO
                        What is your name?

           Ezkibel stares at the gore draining from the man’s skull.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Your name.

                                 EZKIBEL
                        ...R-r-rudolfo Ezkibel.

                                 PABLO
                        Ezkibel.  Basque.  ETA?

           He manages a nod.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        How much did Gilberto pay you to 
                        bomb my family?

           Ezkibel’s attention returns to the corpse.  Pablo snaps his 
           fingers in front of his eyes.
                                 EZKIBEL
                        ...A million U.S.

           Pablo shakes his head regretfully.  Ezkibel starts to weep.  
           Pablo gently wipes a tear from his cheek.

                                 PABLO
                        Would you like to make two million?

           EXT. DROGAS LA REBAJA, CALI - DAY

           A good rain falls.  A steady flow of customers come and go 
           from the brightly-lit corner drug store.

           The pharmacy explodes, unleashing the same hell as the El 
           Monaco blast.  Glass and body parts scatter in equal measure.

           OVERLAY: Cali

           EXT. SECOND DROGAS LA REBAJA, CALI - DAY

           A different drug store, same chain.  It burns wildly, having 
           just been bombed.  A mother wanders the street, blood running 
           down her face, screaming for her child.

                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        President Barco leaves us no choice 
                        but to fight back on behalf of 
                        those persecuted by his corrupt 
                        administration.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           Popeye hands out slips of yellow paper to a group of eager 
           YOUNG BODEGA BOYS.  We focus on one of them, LAGARTO (14), or 
           lizard, so named for his acne-devoured skin.

                                 PABLO
                        For too long, this country has been 
                        ruled by a chosen few who have sold 
                        it off, piece by piece.

           EXT. CALI STREET - NIGHT

           Lagarto sits on the back of a motorcycle, driven by one of 
           the other young men, as they weave through the traffic.
           EXT. CALI DISCOTEQUE - NIGHT

           Lagarto flips down his visor as the motorcycle rides up to 
           the busy nightclub.  A gang of CALI BOYS stand out front.

           Lagarto pulls his Uzi and sprays rounds at the Cali boys.  
           Skin pops open, limbs flail.  Some find cover, others die.

           EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - DAY

           Galán makes fiery pronouncements.  The crowd, in the 
           thousands, pulses with a fervor that cannot be contained.

                                 GALÁN
                        The narcoterrorists are afraid of 
                        justice!  When I am President, I 
                        will not hesitate to extradite each 
                        one of them and rid our nation of 
                        this cancer once and for all!

           EXT. CALI STREET - NIGHT

           A Cali city bus burns in the middle of the road, a gaping 
           hole in its side.  Charred bodies drape over melted seats.

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           A FEDERAL JUDGE (60s) reads Pablo’s open letter in El Tiempo.

                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        Extradition is a violation of our 
                        national sovereignty.  For every 
                        Colombian extradited, we will kill 
                        ten judges.

           The judge lowers the paper, his face drained of color.

           INT. JUDGE’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           The Judge types on official letterhead.  His missive begins: 
           LETTER OF RESIGNATION.

           INT. FISHERY - NIGHT

           Quick-cuts of an assembly line at a fish processing plant:

           -- Workers stuff balloons of cocaine down the gullets of sea 
           bass.
           -- The bass are stacked in crates of ice and loaded by 
           forklift into refrigerated shipping containers.

           -- DAS agents storm the facility, fully armed, lobbing tear 
           gas cannisters into the building, smoking the workers out.

           EXT. DAS HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           General Maza exits with his bodyguards.  Uniformed DAS Agents 
           stand guard, on point, seeing the director into his limo.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET, BOGOTA - DAY

           Maza’s car drives home.  About halfway up the block, it 
           passes a parked BMW.

           The BMW explodes, flipping Maza’s limo on its side.

           Maza and his bodyguards, bloodied but alive, climb through a 
           broken window and get to safety.

           INT. AUTO SHOP - NIGHT

           Lagarto trades in his yellow slip from Popeye for cash.  The 
           MECHANIC asks no questions, just hands over the hundreds.

           EXT. LAGARTO’S HOME - DAY

           LAGARTO’S MAMA lights up as her son carts in a brand new 
           refrigerator.  It’s the only new thing in the place; the 
           family lives in squalor.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           The Bodega Boys swill beer and smoke basuko.  Lagarto shows 
           his new Nikes off to his hermanos.

           A motorcycle speeds up -- before Lagarto can take cover, he’s 
           swallowed in an avalanche of machine gun fire.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           The bullet holes in the stucco are still fresh.  Popeye hands 
           out yellow slips to a new batch of eager young SICARIOS.
           INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT

           El Poeta looks up at his boss, waiting for more.  Pablo 
           considers his next words carefully.

                                 PABLO

           BLACK.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE, JUAN PABLO’S ROOM - DAWN

           Chopo shakes the boy awake.  Juan Pablo disoriented and 
           scared, sits bolt upright.

                                 CHOPO
                        We have to go.

           INT. SAFE HOUSE, GARAGE - DAWN

           El Chopo leads the exhausted family, still in pajamas, into a 
           Mercedes.  He opens the garage door and starts the car.

           OVERLAY: 1989

           INT. MERCEDES - DAWN

           Chopo backs out of the garage.

                                 CHOPO
                        Down, down.

           Maria Victoria and the kids duck below the windows.  They 
           aren’t scared -- this is routine by now.

           Juan Pablo looks up at the cloudless morning sky, broken only 
           by tangles of electrical wire strung across the street.  He 
           hears a rooster, and a dog barking, far off.

           EXT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Another nondescript apartment building, one of many on the 
           street.  The Mercedes pulls into the garage.
           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Chopo leads Maria Victoria and the children in.  They flick 
           on the lights, as the shades are drawn and will remain so.  
           The place is nicely outfitted, large enough for all of them.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, CHILDREN’S ROOM - DAY

           Maria Victoria walks with her kids into their new bedroom.  A 
           giant stuffed bunny waits for Manuela.  She hurries to it.

           Juan Pablo finds a present, too: a new Nintendo, with a pile 
           of game cartridges.  He’s not moved.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, CHILDREN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Manuela lies in bed with her daughter, holding a copy of “The 
           Gingerbread Man and Other Stories” while Pablo’s voice plays 
           on a casette player.

                                 PABLO (ON TAPE)
                        I ran away from the farmer, I ran 
                        away from the cow, I ran away from 
                        the chicken, I ran away from the 
                        horse, and I can run away from you, 
                        I can.

           Maria Victoria turns the page for Manuela.

                                 PABLO (ON TAPE) (CONT’D)
                        Run, run, as fast as you can, you 
                        can’t catch me, I’m the Gingerbread 
                        Man!

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Juan Pablo plays Duck Hunt on Nintendo; he points a pistol at 
           the screen and shoots pixilated ducks out of the sky.

           Maria Victoria enters with the cassette player, disquieted by 
           the sight of her son with a gun.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Your father made you a tape.

           Juan Pablo nods, looking past her.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Lemme finish this level.
           Maria Victoria yanks the plug from the machine.  The TV 
           screen turns blue.

                                 JUAN PABLO (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Maria Victoria puts the player on the coffee table and 
           presses play herself.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Show some respect.

           Juan Pablo crosses his arms and slumps down in the couch.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, PABLO’S ROOM - INTERCUT

           Pablo sits on his bed, recording the tape.

                                 PABLO
                        Juan Pablo, it’s me.  I was 
                        thinking about the trip we took to 
                        Disney, do you remember?  You were 
                        little.  You wanted to go on every 
                        ride.  You had no fear.  It was the 
                        happiest I ever saw you.

           Juan Pablo listens despite himself.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        We had fun on that trip.  We 
                        visited Washington, and Graceland, 
                        Las Vegas...  There are so many 
                        places in this world I want you to 
                        see.  I know a lot of what’s 
                        happening doesn’t make sense to 
                        you, but please, don’t be afraid.  
                        Pretend we’re at Disney, and this 
                        is just another big, fast ride.  It 
                        will be over soon.  Make me a tape, 
                        okay?  Give it to Chopo, he’ll get 
                        it to me.  I’d like to hear from 
                        you.  I want to know what’s 
                        happening.  Eyes and ears.  Okay?  
                        Good.  Good boy.  Listen to your 
                        mother.  Help your sister.

           Pablo presses stop.

           Juan Pablo looks up at his mother, whose cheeks are wet with 
           tears.  He gets up and plugs his Nintendo back in.
           EXT. REMOTE FOOTHILL ROAD - DAY

           José “The Mexican” Gacha rides in a wooden cart pulled by a 
           PEASANT FARMER and his donkey.  He takes every bump along the 
           uneven road in the ass.

           EXT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE - DAY

           An imposing stone wall surrounds a large but plain-looking 
           stucco home.  The Farmer and his donkey stop at the gate.

           Gacha gets out, gratefully.  Pablo comes out to meet him.

                                 GACHA
                        No phones I understand, but no 
                        roads?

                                 PABLO
                        Can’t be too careful.

           Gacha glances back at the farmer.

                                 GACHA
                        And him?

                                 PABLO
                        I built a school in his village.

           Pablo nods hello to the farmer, who tips his hat back.  The 
           two friends continue inside.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The inside is finely furnished -- deluxe entertainment 
           system, full bar, pool table -- Pablo and his men still 
           clearly live in comfort.

           Pablo racks the balls.

                                 GACHA
                        Gilberto wants to negotiate.

                                 PABLO
                        Of course he does -- he’s losing.

                                 GACHA
                        I say we offer Los Angeles.  We 
                        keep Miami and New York.

                                 PABLO
                        The war ends when extradition ends.
           Pablo breaks.  The balls scatter across the table, but none 
           sink.  Gacha takes his turn.

                                 GACHA
                        That’s fine for the newspapers, but 
                        let’s remember why we’re fighting. 

                                 PABLO
                        We’re not fighting, we’re winning.

                                 GACHA
                        That’s why it’s the right time to 
                        negotiate.  They’re desperate.

           Gacha sinks shot after shot.  He’s an expert.

                                 PABLO
                        In Washington that time, we went to 
                        the Eternal Flame.  You know that 
                        place?

           Gacha shakes his head.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        It’s where they buried Kennedy.  
                        You should see how many people go 
                        see it, you know.  That’s how you 
                        know you were important, when they 
                        line up to look at your grave.

                                 GACHA
                        The Ochoas want this.  So does Don 
                        Berna.

           Pablo pauses at the slight.  Gacha reads it.

                                 PABLO
                        You talked to them already?

                                 GACHA
                        DAS is fucking up everything.  It’s 
                        costing us three times as much to 
                        move the product north.  I like a 
                        good fight as much as you, but 
                        let’s get back to making money.

                                 PABLO
                        The next time you talk to the 
                        Ochoas, remind them what kind of 
                        world they live in.

                                 GACHA
                        What the hell does that mean?
                                 PABLO
                        This is a world where the DAS can 
                        grab us in the night, put us on a 
                        plane, and leave us to rot in a US 
                        prison for the next hundred years.  
                        It would take one phone call, 
                        hermano.  One person who knew were 
                        to find us.  We should all pray no 
                        one makes that phone call.

           Gacha has fallen silent.  Pablo motions for him to shoot.

                                 GACHA
                        Don’t you want it to be like it 
                        was?  Aren’t you tired of this?

                                 PABLO
                        Your shot, hermano.

           EXT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE - NIGHT

           A large van makes the bumpy climb to the house.  Tyson and El 
           Mugre get out, both smiling greedily.

           El Mugre slides open the panel door and helps out a 
           procession of beautiful PROSTITUTES.

                                 EL MUGRE
                        Right this way, watch your step.

           One girl, with particularly innocent eyes, looks up at the 
           house with trepidation.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo sits on the sofa next to Gustavo.  The other bodyguards 
           practically jitter with anticipation.

           The fleshy prostitutes, wearing cheap, flimsy nighties, 
           parade into the room like a dessert tray.

           The ladies all give Pablo seductive looks.  He examines each 
           of their faces patiently.

           His men vibrate awaiting their turns.

           Pablo’s eyes stroll from girl to girl, unmoved, until sees 
           the girl with the innocent eyes.  She’s the only one not 
           looking at him.  Her eyes are lowered.
           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

           Pablo sits on the edge of his bed.  The girl with the 
           innocent eyes stands in front of him.

           Elsewhere in the house, the fucking has begun; its vulgar 
           soundtrack reaches them easily.

                                 PABLO
                        Paisita linda...

           She cannot look right at him.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a father?

           She shakes her head.  Pablo runs his hand up her thigh, over 
           her hip.  He brushes her breast and finally cups cheek.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Neither do I.

           Pablo unbuttons his polo shirt, and pulls it over his head.  
           His belly hangs sadly over his belt.

           He lays her down, then slowly slides himself behind her, 
           spooning her.  He pets her hair.  Takes a deep breath, and 
           relaxes.  She takes quick, shallow breaths.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                             (singing softly)
                        Si yo tuviera el corazón, 
                        el corazon que dí... 
                        Si yo pudiera como ayer 
                        querer sin presentir...

           He wraps his arms around her, and holds her close.

           EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

           Roberto slides open the bay door, flooding the furniture 
           warehouse with daylight.  He and Limón enter.

           INT. WAREHOUSE, HIDDEN ROOM - DAY

           The metallic whir of an electric drill.  A door-sized panel 
           falls off the wall, revealing racks of chairs and ottomans.

           Roberto and Limón walk in, dragging a hand-truck.  The room 
           stores three six foot cubes of cash, on palettes -- tens of 
           millions, in dollars and pesos.
                                 LIMÓN
                        Smells like shit.

           Roberto immediately notices something wrong.  He kneels down 
           and shines his flashlight on the first palette: dozens of 
           holes have been carved out and the money shredded.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Fucking rats again.

           He shines his light on the other palettes which have been 
           likewise ravaged by the rodents, and shakes his head. 

           Then he shines the light on second row of palettes, this one 
           loaded with wooden crates.  Painted on their sides, in 
           English and Hebrew: DANGER -- EXPLOSIVE.

           There are hundreds of them.  Roberto goes pale.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT

           Pablo rides through Medellín, with its perpetually bumpy 
           roads.  He wears a prosthetic nose, wig, dark glasses, and 
           sports a goatee.  He hardly looks like himself.

           Gustavo and Popeye ride along with him, also in disguises.  
           The potholes annoy the hell out of him.

           INT. MEDELLIN HOTEL, VARIOUS - NIGHT

           -- SERVICE BAY: Pablo, Gustavo and Popeye get out of their 
           car.  Limón keeps it running.

           -- HALLWAY: The three pass a clutch of chamber maids taking a 
           smoke break.

           -- KITCHEN: Through the chaos of the line, the busboys, the 
           dishwashers, the three men pass unnoticed.

           -- SERVICE ELEVATOR:  They step in.  The doors close.

           INT. MEDELLIN HOTEL, PENTHOUSE SUITE - NIGHT

           Pablo peels the rubber nose from his face.  His hat, wig and 
           glasses sit in a pile beside him.  He looks out on the city 
           of Medellin -- his city.

                                 PABLO
                        They have no problem chasing me all 
                        over the country, but get them to 
                        fill a single fucking pothole...
           In the glass: Felix Gonzáles lights a Cohiba.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        If they filled the potholes, the 
                        people would have nothing to 
                        complain about.

           Gonzáles glances at Gustavo and Popeye.

                                 GONZÁLEZ (CONT’D)
                        I thought we’d be meeting alone.

                                 PABLO
                        I trust these men with my life.

           Gonzáles considers it; he continues.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Barco is dropping out; he won’t 
                        seek a second term.  Galán is in.

                                 PABLO
                        There’s still enough time before 
                        the election.  He’ll crack. 

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        He won’t.  You’ve made it 
                        politically impossible -- and Galán 
                        has staked his campaign on 
                        extraditing you.  You made your 
                        point, but it’s time to pull up 
                        your tents and leave town.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Are you telling us what to do?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        You know everything about your 
                        business.  Knowing Bogotá is my 
                        business.  This country has been 
                        blowing itself up since ‘49.  All 
                        your car bombs have done is make 
                        more potholes.
                             (pause, to Pablo)
                        You’re only alive because the banks 
                        still enjoy laundering your money.  
                        If they’re happy, Barco’s happy, 
                        and he keeps the DAS on a leash.  
                        But a President Galán is another 
                        animal.  If you want your freedom 
                        back -- if you want your family’s 
                        freedom back -- you need someone 
                        more empathetic in office.
           Silence, as Pablo sizes up Gonzáles.

                                 PABLO
                        Are you asking me to finance your 
                        campaign?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Galán is unbeatable at this point.  
                        Not even your money could change 
                        that.  But if he were to drop out, 
                        the party would have to name 
                        another nominee.

           More silence.  Pablo catches on.

                                 PABLO
                        Why would they name you?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        I came in second.  And then I 
                        swallowed my pride and endorsed 
                        that hack -- the party owes me.

                                 PABLO
                        So how could he be convinced to 
                        drop out?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Convincing people is your business.

           Pablo takes some time to think.  Gustavo leans in.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        What’s his security like?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Five to ten guards, normally.  
                        Armored convoy.  But when he gives 
                        speeches, very light.  He likes to 
                        appear accessible, one of the 
                        people.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        Yeah, but DAS got those fuckers’ 
                        backs in public -- watching the 
                        crowds, picking up guys two, three 
                        blocks away just ‘cause... 

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        I might have some sway there.

           Pablo finally returns to the conversation.
                                 PABLO
                        My answer is no.  Keep pushing the 
                        deal with Barco.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        This wouldn’t have to get back to 
                        you.  Galán has enemies everywhere, 
                        men who would not hesitate, given 
                        the chance.

                                 PABLO
                        So give them the chance.  Or make 
                        the deal.

           Gonzáles, seeing no wiggle room, extinguishes his cigar.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - NIGHT

           The men ride out of the city, car bumping along.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        It wouldn’t be hard.

                                 PABLO
                        I don’t like making the same 
                        mistake twice.

           Pablo, lost in thought, stares out the window.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. EL MONACO, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Pablo stands in his city penthouse bedroom, wearing a suit.  
           Hair neatly combed.  He ponders two neckties.

           Maria Victoria comes up to him.  Runs her fingers along the 
           pressed seams of his shirt.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        You look very handsome.

                                 PABLO
                        The rules say I have to wear a tie.

           She selects one of the ties.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        I like this one.  Let me see.

           He drapes it over his neck, and crosses one side over the 
           other.  Pauses.  Reverses the cross.  He whips it off.
                                 PABLO
                        Fuck their rules.

           EXT. PLAZA DE BOLIVAR - DAY

           Pablo heads up the steps of the Capitolio Nacional, the home 
           of the Colombian legislature.  He wears no tie.  The press 
           corps follows, microphones outstretched.

                                 REPORTER
                        Pablo, Pablo -- what will be your 
                        first act as congressman?

                                 PABLO
                        To clean up the government, as I 
                        promised.

           INT. CAPITOLIO NACIONAL ROTUNDA - DAY

           Pablo strides across the marble toward the Chamber floor.  
           The press continues to swarm around him.

           Before he can enter, however, a SECURITY GUARD stops him.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Excuse me, congressman.  But there 
                        is a dress code.

           The reporters fall silent, eager for a showdown.  Aware of 
           their presence, Pablo launches into platitudes.

                                 PABLO
                        The people elected me to fight for 
                        their basic rights as Colombians, 
                        not to wear a fascist necktie!

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                             (quietly)
                        You can have mine.

                                 SPEAKER GAVIRIA (V.O.)
                        The chair recognizes Minister of 
                        Justice Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

           INT. CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES - DAY

           RODRIGO LARA BONILLA (38) addresses the legislature.

                                 LARA BONILLA
                        Narco money has infiltrated every 
                        level of government.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARA BONILLA (CONT'D)
                        This “hot money” threatens to 
                        undermine democracy itself!

           In the middle of the assembly sits Congressman Escobar from 
           Medellín -- wearing the security guard’s tie.

                                 LARA BONILLA (CONT’D)
                        Members of this very chamber have 
                        accepted mafia contributions in 
                        exchange for no votes on 
                        extradition.

           Pablo leans forward into his microphone.

                                 PABLO
                        Mister Speaker.  This is a check 
                        for one million pesos made out to 
                        the campaign of Minister Lara by 
                        Envaristo Porras, a known drug 
                        trafficker.

           Pablo waves a photocopy of a check for all to see.  The place 
           comes alive.  Gaviria bangs his gavel.

                                 SPEAKER GAVIRIA
                        You are out of order, sir.

                                 LARA BONILLA
                        I will not have my reputation 
                        maligned by a mafioso!  We all know 
                        how you made your fortune, Mr. 
                        Escobar -- the cancer on this 
                        institution is you.

           Pablo smugly holds out the check for the cameras.

           INT. CAPITOLIO NACIONAL ROTUNDA - DAY

           Pablo, surrounded by the press, measures his words carefully.

                                 PABLO
                        I am a decent man who exports 
                        flowers.  My finances are an open 
                        book, which is more than I can say 
                        for the Minister of Justice.

           INT. PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Pablo sighs, confronted by an old mug shot on the front page 
           of El Tiempo.  The headline: Escobar’s 1974 trafficking 
           arrest surfaces.
                                 GONZÁLEZ (V.O.)
                        The damage has been done.  You’re 
                        radioactive.  The smart move would 
                        be to step down now.

           Pablo, anguished, looks at his pregnant wife and son as they 
           peer out the tiny windows at the countryside below.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - DAY

           Pablo climbs the stairs bearing gifts.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY

           Pablo, winded and glossy from the climb, knocks on the door.  
           The light behind the peephole flickers, and the door opens.  
           It’s Chopo.  He lets Pablo in.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pablo enters.  The place is oddly quiet.

                                 PABLO
                        Where is everybody?

                                 CHOPO
                        Sleeping.

           Pablo checks the clock.  It’s past two in the afternoon.

                                 PABLO
                             (calling out)
                        Hello?

           The place is a mess.  Clothes stacked in piles -- clean or 
           dirty, hard to say.  Empty cartons of food left out.  
           Curtains drawn.  Very little light getting in.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pablo enters his wife’s room, finding her curled up in bed, 
           pillow over her head.  He shakes her shoulder.

                                 PABLO
                        Tata.  Tata...

           She moves the pillow from her head and looks up at him 
           through bleary eyes.
           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, CHILDREN’S ROOM - DAY

           Maria Victoria enters the kids’ room to wake them up.  Pablo 
           watches from the doorway, still uneasy with the look of the 
           place and the people in it.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Honey, get up.  Your father’s here.

           Manuela rouses first.  She rubs her eyes, and brightens up 
           when she sees her father.  She climbs out of bed and gives 
           him a hug and a kiss.

                                 PABLO
                        Hi, honey.  I missed you so much.

                                 MANUELA
                        I missed you, too, papá.

           Pablo smooths her matted hair with one hand.

           Juan Pablo is harder to wake.  Maria Victoria really gives 
           him a jolt.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Juan Pablo.  Now.  Get up.

           Juan Pablo lifts his head and looks at his dad, unmoved.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

           The children play Nintendo in the next room with Chopo.  
           Maria Victoria throws together a lunch.  She lights a new 
           cigarette with the end of the old one.

           Pablo observes it all, with waning patience.  The gifts he 
           brought remain unopened on the table.

                                 PABLO
                        Why are you sleeping in the middle 
                        of the day?

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        What else are we supposed to do?  
                        We can’t go outside, they can’t go 
                        to school --

                                 PABLO
                        I never said that.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        That’s what we were told.
                                 PABLO
                        Of course you can go outside.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Thank you, Patrón, you are so kind.

           Tense silence between the two.  Pablo notices the pan on the 
           stove starting to smoke.

                                 PABLO
                        That’s burning.

           Maria Victoria doesn’t do anything about it.  Pablo gets up 
           himself and grabs the pan, burning himself on the handle.  He 
           drops it on the floor.

           Maria Victoria laughs at him.  He grabs her suddenly and 
           drags her out of the room.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Let go of me!

           Juan Pablo springs from his chair to stop his father.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Stop it!  Let go of her!

           Juan Pablo tries to pull his parents apart, but Pablo pushes 
           him backward.  The boy hits the ground.  Chopo steps in and 
           keeps him from interfering further.

           INT. NEW SAFE HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pablo drags his wife through the bedroom, into the bathroom.

                                 JUAN PABLO (O.S.)
                        Mamá!  Mamá!

           Pablo shoves Maria Victoria into the shower, clothes and all, 
           and cranks on the water.

           Nostrils flaring, he pins her in place.  Water streams over 
           her as she cries, helpless and exhausted.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Limón drives.  Pablo rides in back with his family, all 
           freshly showered and combed.  They do not speak.
           EXT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE - EVENING

           HERMILDA GAVIRIA (60s) answers the door with a gasp.  Her 
           rosy round face lights up, and her arms fly open.

                                 HERMILDA
                        Pablito!

                                 PABLO
                        Mamá!

           Pablo gives his mother a big hug.  She’s a short lady, curly 
           hair like Pablo, only more grey.

           Hermilda looks past him at her grandchildren, and squeals 
           with excitement.  She smothers them with grandmother kisses.

           EXT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Later.  Some of Pablo’s men pull guard duty, watching the 
           street closely.  All is quiet.

           INT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Pablo sneaks some sauce from the pot bubbling away on the 
           stove.  She slaps his hand away.

                                 HERMILDA
                        It’s not ready -- go, go!

           He kisses the top of her head.  She shoos him out.

           INT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The place is alive with music and chatter.  Gustavo chases 
           some of his nieces and nephews around.  Pablo’s SISTERS carry 
           on loudly with each other.

           Pablo passes from group to group, coming back to life 
           himself.  His walk becomes a little dance, a one-man tango.

           Roberto comes up to him, speaking quietly.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I need to talk to you.

                                 PABLO
                        This is a party, Roberto.  No 
                        business now.
           The children’s game of tag passes between them, and Pablo 
           jumps right in.  As he chases his nieces around the room, he 
           notices his son sitting outside, alone.

           EXT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Juan Pablo sits on the porch swing, listening to his Discman.  
           Pablo comes out and sits beside him.  He motions for his son 
           to take off the headphones.

                                 PABLO
                        Have you been getting my tapes?

           Juan Pablo nods.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Haven’t gotten any from you, did 
                        you make any?

           He shakes his head.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay.

           Pablo reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pager.  He 
           hands it to his son.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to give you this.  It’s a 
                        beeper.  When it goes off, there’ll 
                        be number on the screen -- dial it 
                        from any phone and I’ll pick up.  
                        And we can talk.  For a few 
                        minutes, anyway -- it’s not safe to 
                        stay on the phone too long.  And if 
                        there’s a star in front of the 
                        number, that means dial the number 
                        backwards.  You’ll get the hang of 
                        it.

           Juan Pablo turns it over a few times.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        And if you ever want to call me, 
                        just tell Chopo.

           Juan Pablo nods.  Uncomfortable silence.

           INT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The entire family passes food around the long table.  Pablo 
           sits at the head, opposite his mother.  
           He looks at his wife and children seated on one side, none of 
           them terribly happy to be there.

           Pablo clinks his water glass, and raises it.

                                 PABLO
                        To my mother, the best cook in the 
                        world, and my family, the best a 
                        man could hope for.  I wish we all 
                        could spend more nights like this.  
                        It’s been hard on me these past few 
                        years.  Harder than I hope you ever 
                        know.

                                 HERMILDA
                        Pablo, don’t dwell.

                                 PABLO
                        You’re right mama.  To family.  
                        Salúd.

           Everyone toasts.

           INT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Gustavo plays a serenade on the guitar.  The family sits 
           around him, enjoying the impromptu concert.  His voice and 
           playing are surprisingly smooth and soulful.

           INT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - SAME

           Pablo and Maria Victoria hear the music, but don’t pay 
           attention.  They sit at the now empty table, the air between 
           them heavy.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        You can’t keep dropping in and out 
                        of their lives.  It’s too hard for 
                        them.

                                 PABLO
                        I’m close, Tata.  It’ll be over 
                        soon.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        You’ve been saying that for years.
                        We’re not a family anymore.  I 
                        don’t know what we are.  Either 
                        stay with us, or let us go.

           In the next room, Gustavo finishes his canción, and the 
           family applauds.
           EXT. HERMILDA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Hermilda, tears streaming down her face, won’t let Pablo go.

                                 HERMILDA
                        It’s not fair, the lies they say 
                        about you!  You’re a good boy...

                                 PABLO
                        I know, mamá, I know...

           Pablo wrenches himself away.  She moves on to her grand kids.  
           Pablo hugs his sisters goodbye.  Not a dry eye among them.

           Pablo gets to his brother, who still looks concerned.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Everything all right?  You wanted 
                        to talk.

                                 ROBERTO
                        It can wait.

           Pablo gets his family in the car.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Pablo walks his family back to their temporary home.  Chopo 
           opens the door for them, and they go inside.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                             (to the children)
                        Wash up, get ready for bed.

           The kids head to their rooms.

           Pablo has not entered the apartment.  He stays in the hall.  
           Maria Victoria looks back at him, sadly.

           Ultimately, he can’t bring himself to say goodbye.  He just 
           turns and leaves.  Maria Victoria doesn’t go after him.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo compulsively brushes his teeth at the bathroom sink.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo dials a cellular, and waits for an answer.
                                 PABLO
                        I want visas for my wife and 
                        children.
                             (pause)
                        When I have the visas in my hand.  
                        Not a day before.

           He hangs up.

           [Note: the following flashback is intercut with present-day.]

           EXT. MINISTRY OF JUSTICE, 1984 - NIGHT

           Rodrigo Lara Bonilla comes out of the building with his 
           bodyguards, gets in the waiting car.

           EXT. STREET IN SOACHA, 1989 - NIGHT

           Popeye and two of his underlings follow the sounds of a 
           gathering crowd -- cheering, music, and someone talking over 
           a PA -- to a large town square.

           About ten thousand gather for the rally.  The bandstand is 
           decorated with red, yellow and blue bunting and a banner that 
           reads: Galán -- A PRESIDENT FOR THE PEOPLE!

           As the three men walk up, volunteers hand them miniature 
           Colombian flags to wave.

           INT. BONILLA’S CAR, 1984 - NIGHT

           Bonilla sits in back, going over work papers.  His 
           bulletproof vest sits on the seat beside him.

           EXT. BOGOTA STREET - NIGHT

           Two men on a motorcycle cut through the evening traffic, 
           their faces obscured by helmets.  

           EXT. SOACHA SQUARE, 1989 - NIGHT

           The atmosphere is jubilant and eager, like before a concert.  
           Popeye patiently makes his way to the bandstand.

           A group of DAS Agents pull a MAN aside and pat him down for 
           weapons.  The men with Popeye tense up at the sight.

           One of the DAS Agents makes direct eye contact with Popeye, 
           and gives him a subtle nod.
           Popeye and his men continue along.

           EXT. BOGOTA STREET, 1984 - NIGHT

           The motorcycle rides up alongside Lara’s car.  The sicario on 
           the back pulls his weapon and opens fire.

           INT. BONILLA’S CAR - SAME

           Lara Bonilla is hit.  Falls over.  The driver speeds off.  
           The bodyguards return fire.  Chaos.

           EXT. SOACHA SQUARE, 1989 - NIGHT

           Popeye and his men ready themselves a few yards away from the 
           bandstand.  The EMCEE works up the crowd.

                                 EMCEE
                        It is my honor and pleasure to 
                        introduce the next President of 
                        Colombia, Luís Carlos Galán!

           The crowd cheers, and breaks into a chant.

                                 CROWD
                        Ga-lán!  Ga-lán!  Ga-lán!

           Popeye draws an Uzi from his jacket.  Flicks off the safety.

           Galán takes the stage with one arm held up, waving to the 
           crowd.  Popeye draws the Uzi fires a few quick bursts.

           Galán falls.  His handlers drop on top of him.  Screams erupt 
           and the crowd scatters.

           EXT. BOGOTA STREET, 1984 - SAME

           The motorcycle chases Bonilla’s car through the streets, 
           jumping up on the sidewalk to get around the traffic.

           INT. BONILLA’S CAR - SAME

           Bonilla clings to life, struggling to get his vest on.

           EXT. BOGOTA STREET - SAME

           The car squeals as it makes a sharp turn.  The motorcycle 
           loses traction and skids out, sending the sicarios flying.
           We think Bonilla is safe until we see a second motorcycle 
           speed up and take off after him.

           EXT. SOACHA SQUARE, BANDSTAND, 1989 - NIGHT

           Galán’s people, some of them shot themselves, drag Galán  
           back into his car.  The night is full of screams and sirens.

           The thousands of people instantly break into a stampede.  
           Popeye and his men walk calmly, but with a purpose.

           EXT. WINDING ROAD, 1984 - NIGHT

           The car leaves the congestion of the city traffic and starts 
           up a winding residential road.

           The second motorcycle catches up, and the sicario shoots out 
           the tires.  The car skids, spins out and crashes.  [note: we 
           recognize the crash from the earlier news broadcast]

           The driver draws a gun and fires through the windshield.  The 
           sicarios do the same and take out the driver. 

           The back door opens, and Lara Bonilla crawls out.  The 
           sicario ends his life with a few rounds to the head.

           INT. GALÁN’S CAR, 1989 - NIGHT

           The car speeds through the city toward the hospital.  Galán 
           can hold on to life no more.  He dies.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           A black SUV pulls up to the curb.  Roberto steps out first, 
           followed by Maria Victoria and the children, and Chopo.  They 
           wear hats and glasses, and make their way inside quickly.

           The usual airport police patrol the loading area; they take 
           no special interest in the family.

           INT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, TICKET DESK - NIGHT

           Roberto hands the family’s passports and visas to the ticket 
           agent.  The others wait a few feet back.

                                 MANUELA
                        Where’s Miami?
                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        It’s in America.  It’s very nice, 
                        you’ll like it.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        It’s near Disney World.

           Manuela gets excited.  Juan Pablo looks around the airport, 
           scanning the crowds.  He sees more airport police, lazily 
           pacing the concourse, but that’s about all.

           CLOSE ON: The ticket-taker’s computer screen as she enters 
           the passenger’s last name.  ESCOBAR.  She hits enter.

           INT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GATE - NIGHT

           In the lounge, most everyone is gathered around the 
           televisions, watching breaking news of Galán’s assassination.  
           They are stunned with grief.

           From the gate, Roberto and Maria Victoria can see the 
           reports, but can’t hear them.  The video footage of the Galán 
           taking the stage and then falling is all they need to know.  

           Juan Pablo sits with Chopo and his sister a few feet away, 
           looking particularly disheartened.

                                 CHOPO
                        Hey.  I had a good time hanging out 
                        with you.  It was a real honor.
                        I owe my whole life to your dad.  
                        I’d fuckin’ die for any one of you.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Why?

                                 CHOPO
                        Why?  Kid, you got no idea what 
                        it’s like where I’m from.

           Juan Pablo looks off.  Across the concourse, he notices a 
           BUSINESSMAN clearly watching them.  The businessman looks 
           away.  Juan Pablo instantly feels uneasy.

           Just then, the airline ticket-taker gets on the PA.

                                 TICKET TAKER
                        Ladies and gentlemen, may I have 
                        your attention please.  Flight 451 
                        non-stop to Miami has been delayed.

           The departure monitor switches the flight from ON-TIME to 
           DELAYED.  Juan Pablo becomes anxious.
                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Something’s wrong.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           DAS sedans pull up, lights spinning.  Agents empty out, and 
           swarm the terminal.

           INT. MEDELLÍN AIRPORT, SERVICE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           Chopo leads the others as they run through the “backstage” 
           area of the airport, down a long, empty service tunnel.

           INT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GATE - NIGHT

           The uniformed agents coalesce around the gate for flight 451.  
           They search the passengers for the Escobars.

           A unit of agents proceed through a door marked “Authorized 
           Personnel Only”.

           INT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - NIGHT

           The family ducks under the serpentine conveyors routing 
           hundreds of bags.

           INT. MEDELLÍN AIRPORT, SERVICE CORRIDORS - NIGHT

           The DAS agents run down the service tunnel, in pursuit.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, HELIPAD - NIGHT

           A helicopter whirs to life: its props begin rotating; its 
           engines fire up.

           The family rushes out of the building across a patch of 
           tarmac, toward the helicopter, completely exposed.

           They get into the aircraft with little time to spare.  Within 
           seconds, its engine are roaring, and it becomes airborne.

           INT. MEDELLÍN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GATE - DAY

           Several DAS agents watch the small blinking lights of the 
           helicopter as it takes to the sky.  They know who’s on it.
           INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

           Not enough earphones to go around.  Chopo holds his hands 
           over his ears, breaking long enough to flip two birds at the 
           DAS agents on the ground.

           Juan Pablo looks at his mother, who’s near the breaking 
           point.  Tears run down her cheeks.  She looks hopeless, 
           clutching her daughter.

           Juan Pablo sits up a little straighter, and puts his arm 
           around his mother.  She leans her head into his shoulder, and 
           gives in -- she weeps like a child.  He comforts her.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - NIGHT

           The room has only a few radios and mobile phones.  The map on 
           the wall tracks a fraction of the shipments it once did.

           Pablo sits at the table, on the satellite phone.

                                 ROBERTO (PHONE FILTER)
                        Everyone’s fine.  We got lucky.  
                        Juan Pablo saw them first.  He 
                        saved us.

                                 PABLO
                        Get them far away, to one of the 
                        ranchos.  Tell no one where.  Then 
                        I want you with me.

           INT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT

           The country has come to a standstill.

           -- CANTINA: Business has come to a stop as everyone pauses to 
           watch the news of Galán’s death on television.

           -- BARBERSHOP: The old men watch the B&W footage of Galán 
           falling on stage; even they are speechless.

           -- PRIVATE HOMES: Families gather around their sets, somber 
           and reflective.

           -- GALÁN CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS: The sidewalk is coated with 
           bouquets, letters, and candles.  Many of Galán’s staffers cry 
           in each other’s arms.
           EXT. BOGOTA STREETS - DAY

           A dozen police motorcycles escort the hearse, followed by a 
           mile of slow-moving cars.  The streets are lined with Galán 
           supporters and admirers, quietly honoring the cortege.

           EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - DAY

           The stage is decorated with the late politician’s visage.  
           Galán’s teenage son, CARLOS GALÁN, stands at the microphone.  
           The crowd is subdued, but supportive.

                                 CARLOS GALÁN
                        My father knew this fight was 
                        bigger than any one man.  He 
                        dedicated and finally gave his life 
                        to it.  We believe there is only 
                        one man who can continue my 
                        father’s fight.  One man who can 
                        succeed him as the Liberal Party’s 
                        nominee for President.  That man is  
                        César Gaviria.  

           The crowd cheers for Gaviria (whom we saw as President of the 
           Congress in 1984).  He’s a bookish man, stoic, but earnest.

           As he waves to the crowd, another face on stage stands out: 
           Felix Gonzáles.  He claps politely, and wears a passive smile 
           of support.  But inside, he seethes.

           INT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE, PRESS ROOM - DAY

           The President’s PRESS SECRETARY addresses the media.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        In light of the recent tragedy, the 
                        Governor of Antioquia has 
                        instituted a ten PM curfew for the 
                        city of Medellín.  Anyone seen on 
                        the streets after that hour will be 
                        subject to search and arrest.

           INT. SEARCH BLOC JEEP - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: a wristwatch as it clicks over to ten PM.
                                 PRESS SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        The President is also announcing 
                        the creation of a special task 
                        force with the sole purpose of 
                        tracking down and capturing the 
                        leadership of the Medellín Cartel.

           The jeep pulls out with four officers of the SEARCH BLOC -- 
           black uniforms, no badges.  Armed to the hilt.  More military 
           than civil.  And ominous as hell.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           Some BODEGA BOYS shoot dice, getting drunk.  The Search Bloc 
           jeep rolls up, flashing its blue lights.  The boys scatter, 
           only to run headlong into more officers on foot.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           The Search Bloc officers lead the Bodega Boys down an alley, 
           and line them against a wall.

                                 PRESS SECRETARY
                        No longer can we stand by while the 
                        country is taken hostage by a 
                        criminal mafia.  The rule of law 
                        must be restored.

           One officer executes them all with a single spray of gunfire.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE, PABLO’S ROOM - DAY

           Pablo looks up suddenly from his typewriter.  Listens.  
           Silence.  Then:

           Thp-thp-thp-thp-thp -- the unmistakable sound of helicopters.

           INT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE - DAY

           Pablo runs downstairs to alert his men.  He grabs a pair of 
           binoculars.

                                 PABLO
                        The mosquitos are here.  Take 
                        whatever you can carry.

           EXT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE - DAY

           Thp-thp-thp-thp-thp... It’s getting louder.
           Through the binoculars, Pablo sees a convoy of vehicles 
           rolling over the terrain.  Many men are coming.

           Pablo actually grins.

           EXT. REMOTE FOOTHILL HOUSE - DAY

           The men flee into the woods, with weapons slung over their 
           shoulders and pockets stuffed with ammo.

           The helicopters thunder overhead.  Gustavo runs alongside 
           Pablo -- and sees him taking pleasure in the chase.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        What’s so funny?

                                 PABLO
                        I think we’re important again!

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Pablo runs through the woods, leading his ragtag gang of 
           brigands and thugs.  There is no mistaking the rush of 
           adrenaline behind his eyes.

           EXT. CHURCH, SABANETA - NIGHT

           Late.  A small village.  A modest church.  Pablo counts off a 
           few thousand, and hands it to the grateful priest.

           Behind them, Gustavo inspects a rusted old bus with “Our Lady 
           of Fatima” painted on the side.

           INT. RUSTED OLD CHURCH BUS - NIGHT

           Pablo drives the bus, sitting tall behind the wheel.  His 
           men, exhausted, try to catch some sleep in the seats.

           Pablo glances at them in the mirror every so often, like a 
           proud father might.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY

           The donkey chews some grass beside its cart.

                                 FARMER (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, I’m sorry...
           The peasant farmer stands at the river edge, soaking wet.

                                 FARMER (CONT’D)
                        The soldiers, they threatened my 
                        boy...  I didn’t...  I’m sorry...

           Pablo stands before him, strangely empathetic.  He looks back 
           at the FARMER’S SON (9) a few yards away -- Popeye holds the 
           kid in place.

           El Mugre takes out a box of wooden matches.  Beside him: a 
           five-gallon gas can -- the farmer isn’t wet with water.

                                 FARMER (CONT’D)
                        Please... No... Please...

           His hands and feet are bound; he cannot move.  El Mugre 
           strikes a match and tosses it; the farmer bursts into flames.

           The boy screams.  Popeye grips him tightly.

           El Mugre pushes the farmer backward into the river, 
           extinguishing him.  He drags him out.  The farmer is alive -- 
           skin blistered horribly, body quivering.

           Pablo goes to the boy.

                                 PABLO
                        When I was younger than you, the 
                        communist guerillas came through my 
                        village, and they took my father, 
                        and the other boys’ fathers, and 
                        brought them all to the plaza.  
                        They gave the men a choice, either 
                        join their army or die.  Our 
                        fathers looked out at us -- we were 
                        all very scared -- and each one of 
                        them joined the guerillas.  Every 
                        one, except my father.  My father 
                        chose death.  He wanted me and my 
                        brother to know that a life lived 
                        in fear is not worth living.  They 
                        set him on fire, and I watched him 
                        burn.  It was the greatest day of 
                        my life.  It was the day I became a 
                        man.  It was the day I stopped 
                        being afraid.

           He nods to El Mugre, who douses the farmer with more 
           gasoline, then lights him back on fire.  Again, the farmer 
           burns and screams.
                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                             (to the boy)
                        Open your eyes.  Watch him.  Watch!

           El Mugre pushes the farmer into the water, once again putting 
           out the fire.  He pulls him on shore.  The farmer is in 
           shock, unable to stand, barely able to breathe.

           Pablo has not taken his eyes off the boy.  He pulls out his 
           Sig Sauer and offers the butt end to the boy.

           The boy looks at Pablo, in just as much shock as his father.  
           Pablo urges the gun into the boy’s hand.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        He’s in pain.

           The boy takes the gun.  Pablo leads him to the farmer’s 
           blistered, steaming body.  His chest rises and falls in fits.  

           The boy, his cheeks red hot, lips quivering, raises the gun, 
           and aims it at his father.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        You never have to be afraid again.  
                        Not even of death.

           The boy pulls the trigger.

           EXT. DOWNSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD, MEDELLÍN - EVENING

           A row of sagging, chipped homes.  Music drifts through open 
           windows.  Overweight women fan themselves on milk crates.

           A Mercedes, too nice for the neighborhood, parks.  Roberto 
           gets out, and uneasily takes in the surroundings.

           INT. CITY HIDEOUT - EVENING

           Roberto enters to find Pablo’s men going through stockpiles 
           of weapons.  Not just machine guns, but grenades, explosives 
           and miles of detonation cord.

           The men hardly pause to acknowledge Roberto.  He makes his 
           way through the place, looking for his little brother.

           INT. CITY HIDEOUT - EVENING

           On TV: the EL MINUTO DE DIOS begins, with Father Herrero.  No 
           sound.  Pablo types out a letter at his desk, absently 
           smoking a joint.  A knock at his door.
                                 PABLO
                        Come in.

           Roberto enters.  Pablo rises, genuinely relieved to see him.  
           He gives his brother a hug.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        How are they?

                                 ROBERTO
                        Fine.  Safe.  I put them in the 
                        place outside --

                                 PABLO
                        Shh!

           Pablo stops him from continuing.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        They drive vans up and down the 
                        streets with satellite dishes on 
                        top.  The Americans are working 
                        with them.

                                 ROBERTO
                        What’s going on?  What is all that 
                        downstairs?

           Pablo goes back to his typewriter.

                                 PABLO
                        They’re about to find out what 
                        happens to people who break deals.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Pablo -- we can’t keep spending 
                        like this.  We don’t have enough 
                        coming in.

                                 PABLO
                        Empty the stashes then.

                                 ROBERTO
                        We already did.  Or they’ve been 
                        raided, or destroyed, or we can’t 
                        remember where they are because you 
                        didn’t want to write ‘em down.  The 
                        bank accounts are frozen.  The rest 
                        is tied up in land we can’t sell.

                                 PABLO
                        There’s always more money, Roberto, 
                        find it.
                                 ROBERTO
                        You’re not listening.

                                 PABLO
                        The money is your job -- keep track 
                        of the money -- simple -- do your 
                        fucking job!

           Pablo pulls himself together.  Puts his hands on his 
           brother’s shoulders.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           Pablo crosses into the bathroom to take a piss.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        I want live music for my birthday 
                        this year.  What do you think?

           Roberto sneaks a look the typewriter while he has the chance.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I think it’s risky to be seen.

           On the page, in all caps: WE DECLARE TOTAL WAR ON THIS 
           GOVERNMENT.

           From the bathroom, Pablo can see his brother’s reflection in 
           the mirror -- he sees him snooping, plain as day.

                                 PABLO
                        I’m glad you’re here, hermano.  I 
                        need people I can trust now.

           INT. CITY HIDEOUT, PABLO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo admires a photo of Manuela.  He speaks into his tape 
           recorder.

                                 PABLO
                        I won’t know what I’ll do when you 
                        grow up.  Promise me you won’t get 
                        any older.  Can you do that?  Can 
                        you stay little for me?

           He pauses.  Starts to sing.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Have yourself a merry little 
                        Christmas.  Let your heart be 
                        light.  From now on our troubles 
                        will be out of sight...
           [note: he continues to sing under the following:]

           EXT. SOCCER STADIUM, MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           A low flying propeller plane releases thousands of slips of 
           paper.  They flutter down through the night sky, and land  
           upon the packed Stadium Escobar.  The match comes to a halt.

           Curious fans grab at the flyers and read them.

           CLOSE ON the flyer:  ONE MILLION PESOS FOR EVERY DEAD POLICE 
           OFFICER.  --  THE EXTRADITABLES

           EXT. SEARCH BLOC HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           The Search Bloc jeeps take to the streets, locked and loaded.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           Pablo’s men distribute submachine guns from the bed of a 
           pickup to a clamoring crowd of impoverished young men.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN BARRIO STREET - NIGHT

           A Toyota full of eager young hoodlums pulls away, on the hunt 
           for policia.

           EXT. MEDELLÍN STREET - NIGHT

           Memebers of the Search Bloc shoot it out with street kids.  
           The kids, untrained and unprotected, fall quickly.

           EXT. ANOTHER MEDELLÍN STREET - NIGHT

           Another shootout -- this time the police suffer defeat.  Once 
           the last one has fallen, the barrio boys run up to loot him.  
           They take his gun, his badge, his shoes.

           One young man uses a machete to hack off the officer’s head.

           EXT. DAS HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

           General Maza gets out of his limousine and enters the eight 
           story cement building.
           INT. CITY BUS - SAME

           A YOUNG MAN drives a city bus through the congested Bogota 
           streets.  He lays on the horn and weaves through traffic.

           Behind him: the rows of seats have been replaced with crates 
           of TNT, all wired together into a single massive bomb.

           EXT. DAS HEADQUARTERS - SAME

           The bus barrels toward the building.  As it crosses through 
           the intersection, it T-bones a passing car and ends up 
           halfway up the curb.

           The young man leaps from the bus and sprints away.  DAS 
           agents pour from the building, firing after him.

           In a flash, the bus DETONATES.  The ground beneath it 
           evaporates.  The buildings across the street are reduced to 
           matchsticks.

           INT. CITY HIDEOUT - NIGHT

           Pablo’s men celebrate his birthday with him.  The atmosphere 
           is light and fun, even though no families are there.

           A small band of musicians plays a tango, and Pablo dances.  
           The musicians are all blind -- they have no idea who they’re 
           playing for.

           IN THE NEXT ROOM

           Roberto watches television, horrified.  ON TV: the fiery 
           carcass of an Avianca jetliner.  Emergency crews scour the 
           field outside Bogotá for survivors.

           A picture of Cesar Gaviria comes up.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        We have confirmed that Presidential 
                        candidate César Gaviria was not on 
                        the flight, due to a last-minute 
                        change in his schedule.

           Roberto -- aghast, terrified -- looks away from the set and 
           into the next room where Pablo furiously types.
           EXT. MEDELLÍN BARRIO - DAY

           By the light of morning, last night’s dead are stacked in a 
           pile like so much lumber.  Fifteen men -- boys, really -- 
           shot in the face so their mothers can’t recognize them.

           INT. FAMILY HOME - NIGHT

           Pablo, into the recorder, finishes the song:

                                 PABLO
                        ...And have yourself a merry little 
                        Christmas now.  Good night.  I love 
                        you.

           EXT. PLAZA DE BOLIVAR - DAY

           César Gaviria stands before thousands of dignitaries and 
           invited guests in the historic plaza.  The President of the 
           Congress swears him into office.

                                 GAVIRIA
                        ...to uphold the Constitution, and 
                        the laws of Colombia.

           The President of the Congress drapes a wide sash with the 
           national colors over Gaviria’s shoulders.  The audience 
           applauds the new President of Colombia.

           INT. GONZÁLES’ OFFICE - NIGHT

           Felix Gonzáles is drunk, and fixing to get drunker.  His 
           tuxedo shirt is open; his bow tie hangs drearily to one side.

           He pushes aside some papers on his desk to clear space for a 
           new bottle of whiskey.  As he does, a piece of mail stands 
           out to him.

           It bears his name, but no address, or stamps.  It didn’t go 
           through the mail; it was left there.

           He opens the envelope and takes out the letter.  A single 
           sentence, typed in all caps: YOU STILL WORK FOR ME.

           Gonzáles drops the letter, instantly sickened.
           EXT. OCHOA COMPOUND - DAY

           The expansive horse ranch boasts enough stables and pastures 
           for a dozen thoroughbreds.  One of Pablos’ cars makes its way 
           up the long driveway.

           EXT. OCHOA COMPOUND - DAY

           Pablo and Gustavo get out, followed by their top men: Popeye, 
           Limón, and El Mugre.  Pablo wears a full beard, and looks 
           heavier, unkempt.

           The three Ochoa brothers greet them at the gate.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA 
                        You’re looking well, Pablo.

           INT. OCHOA COMPOUND, FORMAL SITTING ROOM - DAY

           The Ochoas lead Pablo and the others in.  The room smells of 
           old leather and books.  Its walls are lined with portraits of 
           long-dead patriarchs.

           Already seated: Don Berna, along with his two grown sons, 
           EDUARDO and PEDRO (20s).  The three rise to meet Pablo.

                                 DON BERNA
                        Doctór.  You remember my boys, 
                        Eduardo and Pedro.

                                 PABLO
                        Not boys anymore, are they?

                                 DON BERNA
                        To me they’re always boys.  They 
                        got their own operations.  Doing a 
                        good business.

           Pablo nods at them, then sees Carlos Castaño, the former 
           jungle paramilitary, standing guard by the french doors.  
           Castaño watches him like a puma.

           Don Berna relishes the surprise in Pablo’s eyes.

                                 DON BERNA (CONT’D)
                        Carlos handles our security now.

           Pablo looks at Don Berna closely.

                                 PABLO
                        You must sleep well at night.
                                 DON BERNA
                        We do.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        Let’s all sit and get started.

                                 PABLO
                        Where’s the Mexican?

           An awkward pause.  The Ochoa brothers exchange looks.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        He’s dead.  The Search Bloc raided 
                        his home, killed him and his son.  
                        I assumed you knew.

           The news is a sledge hammer to the gut, but Pablo hides it.  
           Gustavo and the others follow Pablo’s lead.

                                 PABLO
                        When?

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        Two months ago.

                                 DON BERNA
                        You’ve been a hard man to reach, 
                        Doctór.

                                 PABLO
                        That’s unfortunate.  I wonder how 
                        they found him.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        They’re hunting all of us.

                                 PABLO
                             (noting the setting)
                        Some of us more than others.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        Sit.  Please.

           Pablo takes a seat, along with Gustavo.  Popeye and the other 
           men take places at the edges of the room.

           Every now and then, Pablo catches a glint off Castaño’s eyes.  
           The man watches his every move.

           INT. OCHOA COMPOUND, FORMAL SITTING ROOM - DAY

           Later.  The room has thickened with cigar smoke; empty hi-
           ball glasses dot the tables.  Pablo remains sober as a judge.
                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        What about the Caribbean?  We still 
                        have people in Florida.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        The DEA is all over Florida now.

                                 DON BERNA
                        The future is Mexico.

                                 JORGE LUÍS OCHOA
                        Those were José’s routes.  None of 
                        us have connections there.

                                 DON BERNA
                        But Cali does.  And if we partner 
                        with them --

                                 PABLO
                        No.

           Silence.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        I am fighting a war, at great 
                        personal expense, for all of you.  
                        The end of extradition benefits 
                        every one of us.  But I am the only 
                        one making sacrifices.  I want two 
                        million dollars a month, from each 
                        of you.

           More silence.

                                 JUAN DAVID OCHOA
                        Are you asking us to pay a tax?

                                 PABLO
                        Is your freedom not worth two 
                        million?

                                 FABIO OCHOA
                        You’re a dope runner, not Simón 
                        fucking Bolivar.  I haven’t seen my 
                        children in weeks!  My wife gets 
                        death threats!  They think we’re 
                        part of the Extraditables!

                                 PABLO
                        Don’t talk to me about children, 
                        Fabito.

           From the doorway, a gravely voice:
                                 FABIO SR. (O.S.)
                        Enough...

           Fabio Sr, an immense man in a white hat and suit, enters with 
           the aid of a cane.  Everyone, Pablo included, pays deference.

                                 FABIO SR. (CONT’D)
                        Sr. Escobar.  Walk with me.

           EXT. OCHOA RANCH - DAY

           Fabio Sr. walks with Pablo along a path between pastures.  
           Under a tree, a fantastic stallion lazes in the shade.

                                 FABIO SR.
                        That’s Aragón.  His father was 
                        Finnegan’s Wake, his mother was 
                        Pegretta.  Since we put him out to 
                        stud, he’s sired over a hundred 
                        foals.  Do you know what the most 
                        valuable commodity in the world is?

           Pablo defers.

                                 FABIO SR. (CONT’D)
                        Good breeding.  Money comes and 
                        goes.  In the end, all a man ever 
                        inherits is his pedigree.  He can 
                        either uphold it, or squander it.  
                        My sons, sadly, have squandered 
                        theirs.  Thanks to this coca, the 
                        Ochoa name will be associated with 
                        smuggling.  It will take many 
                        generations to correct.  I 
                        understand why this business is 
                        attractive to someone with your 
                        breeding, but I regret ever letting 
                        my sons get involved.

           Pablo holds his tongue.

                                 FABIO SR. (CONT’D)
                        You are right about one thing: this 
                        extradition is an insult, and it 
                        needs to end.  But my family cannot 
                        fight with you.  I have made a deal 
                        with this new President.  My sons 
                        are going to surrender, and serve 
                        at Iguatí.  I hope they learn their 
                        lesson.

           Pablo takes a moment to process the news, keeping calm.
                                 PABLO
                        I’ve made your sons wealthy, Don 
                        Fabio.  In fact, coca paid for 
                        Aragón.  Your eldest would even 
                        smuggle a few kilos up its ass 
                        every time they’d travel for a 
                        race.

           Fabio Sr. remains unruffled.

                                 FABIO SR.
                        My sons were wealthy before they 
                        met you, Sr. Escobar.  You made 
                        them weak.

           INT. CITY COMPOUND, PABLO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo watches the evening news.

           ON TV: Police escort the three Ochoa brothers in shackles 
           from the federal courthouse in Bogotá.

           Pablo switches off the television.  The screen goes dark, 
           leaving Pablo with his own reflection, staring back.

           INT. MERCEDES BENZ - DAY

           Two women, MARUJA PACHÓN and BEATRIZ VILLAMIZAR ride in a 
           sedan through Bogotá’s notoriously heavy rush hour traffic.

           Suddenly, a bullet through the window zips through the 
           DRIVER’S skull; he falls forward; the Mercedes rear-ends the 
           car in front of it.  They both scream.

           MASKED GUNMEN throw open the doors and pull the women out.

                                 MARUJA
                        Please -- just take me -- I’m the 
                        journalist -- please!

           The men quickly and brutally drag the women into vehicles on 
           either side of the Mercedes.

           OVER BLACK: 1991

           INT. HOSTAGE HOUSE - NIGHT

           ON A GRAINY B&W TV: The evening news.
                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        ...more than six months since the 
                        shocking series of kidnappings.  
                        And still, negotiations between 
                        President Gaviria and the 
                        Extraditables remain deadlocked.

           The windowless room has three beds and a small stand for the 
           television, nothing more.

           Maruja looks gaunt.  Her eyes are sullen and desperate.  Her 
           clothes don’t fit anymore.

           If it were possible, Beatriz looks even worse.  More pale.  
           She lies in bed, nagged by a wet cough.

           A third woman, older, and once quite elegant, shares the 
           cell: MARINA MONTOYA.  She looks no less haggard now.

           The GUARD, an older, more brutish Bodega Boy, enters to 
           retrieve the food trays.  Two have been emptied.  One -- 
           Beatriz’ -- is untouched.

           The guard pokes her with the tray.

                                 MARUJA
                        We told you, she’s sick.

           INT. CITY COMPOUND, PABLO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo types, lost in his own all-caps composition: ALL TEN 
           HOSTAGES WILL BE RELEASED WHEN EXTRADITION...

           Pablo stops.  Looks up at Limón in the doorway.

                                 LIMÓN
                        One of them needs a doctor.

           Pablo can’t seem to think.  

                                 PABLO
                        What time is it?

                                 LIMÓN
                        Six.

                                 PABLO
                        Morning?

                                 LIMÓN
                        Night.
           He crosses the room and takes out a joint from a drawer.  
           Lights it.  Gets straight.

                                 PABLO
                        I need to see Gustavo, where is he?

                                 LIMÓN
                        Went to see his kids.

           Pablo pauses, stirred.

                                 PABLO
                        Oh.  Right.

                                 LIMÓN
                        What about the sick woman?

                                 PABLO
                        Send a doctor, right away.

           Limón nods, and leaves.

           Pablo goes back to his small table and picks up the mobile 
           phone.  He dials a number.

           A few rings, and then three quick beeps.  Pablo types in the 
           return phone number.  He hangs up.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - SAME

           On a night stand, Juan Pablo’s pager lights up and beeps.  
           The little green screen displays the return number.

           Juan Pablo reaches down, and without checking the number, 
           turns the pager off.

           INT. CITY COMPOUND, PABLO’S ROOM - SAME

           Pablo waits by the phone.  He waits a very long time.

           INT. HOUSE IN MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           Gustavo checks his watch.  He sighs, his heart heavy.  His 
           wife ESME picks up on it, and corrals her children.

                                 ESME
                        Okay, niños time to say goodbye.

                                 GUSTAVO’S KIDS
                        No!
                                 ESME
                        Eh-eh-eh...

           Gustavo kisses his children goodbye.  Holds back the tears.  
           This is killing him.

                                 GUSTAVO
                        C’mere.  I need another hug.

           None of them want to let go.

           EXT. HOUSE IN MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           Gustavo comes out of the house, wiping the tears from his 
           eyes.  The fresh air does him good.

           He walks to his car.  As he does, he hears a shuffle down the 
           street.  He stops and turns.

           The street is quiet.  One streetlight flickers, the rest are 
           off.  By the flicker of that single light he catches the 
           glint off a gun barrel across the street.

           Gustavo draws the pistol from his belt.

           Dozens of unseen men open fire on him.

           Gustavo dives behind the car door, shooting blindly across 
           the street, into the darkness.

           Bullets scream into his legs, his side.  He pulls an 
           automatic rifle from under the seat and empties it.

           But he is no match.  He is shot in the head, the neck, the 
           chest.  He falls, dead.

           Silence, except for the muffled screams of Esme and the 
           children inside.

           Search Bloc officers emerging from the shadows, masks over 
           their faces.  Their guns are drawn.

           The first officer to reach him kicks the gun away from his 
           hand, then plugs three more rounds into his head for safety.

           Another comes up and fires another three shots into his 
           chest.  Yet another comes up and does the same.

           EXT. HOUSE IN MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Two cars pull up.  Pablo’s men get out of one and establish a 
           perimeter, turning every pedestrian and car back.
           Pablo gets out with Roberto.  They approach the spot where 
           their cousin fell.  The cement is stained.  The house bears 
           the scars of the shoot out.

           Pablo stares at the massive blood stain.  He kneels down and 
           touches the ground.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Driving back, no one says a word.  The potholes of Medellín 
           jostle them around.  Roberto speaks up.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I don’t want to die, Pablo.

           Pablo doesn’t respond.  Can’t.

           INT. HOSTAGE HOUSE - DAY

           The guard comes in and without a word, takes Marina by the 
           arm.  He leads her out.  The two others panic.

                                 MARUJA
                        What are you doing -- where are you 
                        taking her?

           Marina looks back desperately.  As soon as they’re in the 
           hall, a second guard shuts the door and padlocks it.

           INT. CITY COMPOUND, PABLO’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Pablo stands at the sink.  He mixes shaving lather in a small 
           porcelain bowl, then applies the lather to his beard.

           He takes up his straight razor.  Unfolds it.  Brings it to 
           his neck.

           He stares into the mirror, losing himself in his reflection.

           The razor clatters to the floor.  Pablo crumbles, covering 
           his face with both hands, smearing the shaving cream, 
           blending it with his tears.

           He forces himself to cry silently so no one -- no one -- can 
           hear him.
           EXT. EMPTY LOT, MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           Marina, hood over her head, is led from an idling car into an 
           empty lot.  One of the CAPTORS raises a gun and shoots her in 
           the back of the head.  Marina falls.

           He puts six more in.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. CITY COMPOUND, PABLO’S ROOM - EVENING

           ON TV: the GOD MINUTE titles come up, introducing Father 
           Rafael Garcia Herreros.  The normally beatific man looks 
           troubled today.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (ON TV)
                        O sea, O immense sea!  O solitary 
                        sea, which knows it all!  I want to 
                        ask you a few things, answer me.  
                        You who keep the secrets, I would 
                        like to build a grand institute for 
                        the rehabilitation of sicarios in 
                        Medellín.

           Pablo lies in bed, beard still thick and full, absently 
           watching TV.  He seems to have not showered or even moved 
           much in several days.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (ON TV) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        What do you think, O sea? Speak to 
                        me, you who keep secrets.  I would 
                        like to speak with Pablo Escobar.

           At the mention of his name, Pablo’s eyes spark.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (ON TV) 
                                 (CONT’D)
                        They have told me you want to hand 
                        yourself over.  They have told me 
                        you want to speak to me.  Tell me, 
                        O sea, will I be able to do it?  
                        Will they reject me if I do?  Will 
                        there be a gun battle when I go 
                        with them, will I die with them in 
                        this adventure?

           Pablo sits up, hanging on the priest’s every word.
           INT. JEEP - DAY

           The ride is rough; the dirt road through the country is 
           uneven and dusty.  In the back seat, Father Garcia holds on 
           with both hands.  His head is covered with a hood.

           INT. RUSTIC COTTAGE - DAY

           Father Garcia sits in a small, humble cabin, the hood still 
           over his head.

           Pablo reaches out and removes the hood.  Father Garcia, 
           disoriented, takes a moment to even recognize him.

                                 PABLO
                        Hello, father.  Forgive the 
                        precautions.  I hope your trip was 
                        pleasant.

           Pablo offers the priest a glass of water.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        Thank you.

           Father Garcia takes the water, and drinks.

           EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

           Pablo and Father Garcia walk the property.  Pristine country.  
           Not another house to be seen.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        You own all this?

                                 PABLO
                        It wouldn’t be my name on the deed, 
                        but yes.  My father used to say the 
                        best thing a man could do with his 
                        money is buy land.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        He sounds like a wise man.

           Pablo reserves comment.

                                 PABLO
                        Why did you give me that message?

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        I want to help you.  I’ve had 
                        contact with the families of the 
                        people you are holding --
                                 PABLO
                        I am holding no one.  The 
                        Extraditables have taken hostages.  
                        I am not The Extraditables.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        Nevertheless, they want the same 
                        thing as you: peace.

                                 PABLO
                        They didn’t want peace when men 
                        were dying by the hundreds every 
                        night in the slums.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        Sadly, man has never valued life 
                        equally.  That is why he needs God.  
                        Are you a practicing Catholic, 
                        Pablo?

                                 PABLO
                        I built my mother a church.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        You’ve been generous, I know.  But 
                        Christ calls on us to be humble, 
                        too.  When was your last 
                        confession?

           Pablo laughs at that one.  The priest sees no humor in it.

                                 PABLO
                        I like you, father.  I need you to 
                        deliver a message to President 
                        Gaviria, detailing the terms of my 
                        surrender.  Can you do that?

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        I will do whatever is needed to 
                        help my country.  But that’s not 
                        why I came here.

           Pablo pauses.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (CONT’D)
                        I came to help you.

                                 PABLO
                        You came because I brought you.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        You brought me because you wanted a 
                        priest.  Pray with me, son.
           The priest kneels down, and waits for Pablo to do the same.  
           He doesn’t.  Garcia gestures to the surrounding countryside.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (CONT’D)
                        It’s just you, me, and God.

           Pablo, despite himself, kneels down with the priest.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS (CONT’D)
                        Hail Mary, full of grace, our Lord 
                        is with thee.  Blessed art thou 
                        among women, and blessed is the 
                        fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

           Eventually, Pablo joins in.

                                 BOTH
                        Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for 
                        us sinners, now and at the hour of 
                        our death.  Amen.

           INT. CONGRESSMAN RIVERA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Felix Gonzáles sits on the sofa, enjoying a glass of scotch 
           with CONGRESSMAN RIVERA.  An ATTORNEY with a briefcase sits 
           quietly off to the side.

                                 CONGRESSMAN RIVERA
                        What’s the catch, Felix?  What do 
                        you want, an appropriation?  A city 
                        park or something?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        A yes on the extradition clause.

           Uncomfortable pause.  Rivera’s face sours.

                                 GONZÁLEZ (CONT’D)
                        Gaviria wants to make a deal -- he 
                        wants the hostages to be released, 
                        but he can’t -- the Americans have 
                        him in a corner.  But if we make 
                        extradition unconstitutional, we 
                        end this madness once and for all.

                                 CONGRESSMAN RIVERA
                        ...I can’t.  Escobar deserves more 
                        than a slap on the wrist.  If he 
                        ever walked free, I couldn’t 
                        forgive myself.

           Gonzáles nods, understanding.
                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Thank you for your time.  And for 
                        the Glen Morangie.

           They shake hands; Gonzáles leaves.  Rivera looks uneasily at 
           the attorney, who has remained.

           The attorney motions for him to close the door.

                                 CONGRESSMAN RIVERA
                        Excuse me, this is my office.

           The attorney opens his briefcase and removes an envelope 
           stuffed to the ripping point with cash.

           Rivera closes the door.

                                 CONGRESSMAN RIVERA (CONT’D)
                        Put that away, and leave.

           The attorney takes photos out of his briefcase, and lays out 
           them on the table, one by one, beside the cash.

           Rivera takes in the pictures: they’re all of Rivera with his 
           family.  His wife.  His children.  His mother.  His stomach 
           turns, his heart sinks.

           The choice is before him: money, or death.

           INT. CHAMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES - NIGHT 

           Representatives from each department, some wearing indigenous 
           garb, file to the front of the chamber to cast their votes.

           Rivera drops his folded slip of paper into the box, as a bank 
           of photographers and video cameras record the event.

           INT. CAPITOLIO NACIONAL ROTUNDA - NIGHT

           Gonzáles gives a statement to a gathering of reporters.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        This is an historic day for 
                        Colombia.  We have reclaimed our 
                        sovereignty, and have set ourselves 
                        on a path to a more transparent and 
                        representative government.  Every 
                        Colombian should be proud tonight.
                                 REPORTER
                             (calling out)
                        Congressman, are you planning 
                        another run for the Presidency?

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        I am willing to serve my country 
                        however she may need me.

           EXT. STREET IN BOGOTA - DAY

           A car pulls to a sudden stop in a residential neighborhood.  
           The back door opens, and Maruja, blindfolded, staggers out.

           The car peels away.  After a few moments, Maruja ventures to 
           remove her blindfold.

           INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

           Father Garcia makes a last second adjustment to his collar as 
           the titles to the God Minute play on the monitor.

           The red light atop the single camera goes on, and along with 
           it, Father Garcia’s peaceful smile.

                                 FATHER GARCIA HERREROS
                        Today, the Lord has brought peace 
                        unto our great nation.

           EXT. SOCCER PITCH - DAY

           Pablo stands in the middle of the field with Roberto and the 
           rest of the men, watching the approach of two helicopters.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I don’t know if I want to go to 
                        prison.  I haven’t broken any laws.

                                 PABLO
                        We’ll come up with something for 
                        you to confess.  You’ll be safer in 
                        there.  We’ll all be.

           The military helicopters land, scattering debris everywhere.  
           Roberto looks more nervous than ever.

                                 ROBERTO
                             (shouting over the noise)
                        I think it’s a trap!

           Pablo nods, grinning.
                                 PABLO
                        And they walked right into it!

           Pablo leads the march toward the helicopters.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - DAY

           The long, squat prison is nestled into the foothills above 
           Envigado.  It backs against the thick tree line.  A lone 
           barbed-wire fence marks the perimeter.

           ARMY SOLDIERS escort Pablo and his men from the helicopters 
           to the front gate where the WARDEN awaits them.

                                 WARDEN
                        Mr. Escobar, welcome to the 
                        Cathedral.

                                 PABLO
                        Warden.  I hereby surrender to the 
                        government of Colombia.

           Pablo removes the Sig Sauer from his waistband and hands it 
           over, almost ceremoniously, to the Warden.

           The PRISON GUARDS lead the prisoners into the yard.

           As the gang heads toward its new home, Pablo gives Popeye a 
           nudge.  Popeye hands over an extra pistol to his patrón.

           Pablo tucks it into his belt.  Ready for incarceration.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, DISCO - NIGHT

           A mirrored ball spins.  Tyson works the bar.  Lionel Richie’s 
           “Dancin’ on the Ceiling” booms from the jukebox.  Everyone 
           surrounds Popeye, clapping, as he dances a solo.

           The room is filled with women, too -- pageant queens from all 
           over Colombia, still wearing their sashes.

           Pablo stands against the wall, enjoying the music, but not 
           really participating.

           Popeye pulls MISS TOLIMA onto the dance floor.  She tosses 
           back her black hair, looking dead into his eyes.  Her tiara 
           sparkles in the disco lights.
           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, PRIVATE BUNGALOW - NIGHT

           Red silk covers the lights.  A leopard print bed.  A small 
           collection of dildos on night stand.  Miss Tolima goes down 
           on Popeye.  He wears her tiara.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - MORNING

           Popeye kisses Miss Tolima goodbye, then covers her and the 
           other beauty queens in the back of the pickup with a 
           weathered, army green tarp.

           He smacks the side of the truck, and it pulls away.

           Tyson and Mugre off-load a second supply truck with fresh 
           crates of booze, food, and other essentials.  Popeye lends a 
           hand carrying a particularly bulky TV into the prison.

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, COMMUNICATIONS ROOM - DAY

           Maps on the wall track shipments and cash up through Mexico 
           and the Caribbean -- even to Spain, France and Italy.

           Two men handle eleven different phone lines, several fax 
           machines, radios, and two computers.  Back in business.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - DAY

           Roberto tends to the garden.  They grow some vegetables, 
           flowers, and a good amount of marijuana.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - DAY

           Pablo’s cell is more like a penthouse.  The living room is 
           complete with art on the wall and a widescreen television.

           -- A bowl of fresh fruit adorns the kitchen counter.

           -- His bedroom features a large portrait of the Virgin Mary 
           hanging over his king sized bed.  There is a writing desk, 
           with pictures of his family all around.

           -- His private bathroom has a jacuzzi tub.

           And outside, a spacious veranda:
           EXT. PABLO’S CELL, VERANDA - DAY

           Pablo gazes through a telescope at the city below.  The 
           prison’s hillside perch affords a medieval view of Medellín, 
           with Pablo its king in exile.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - DAY

           Pablo strides toward the gate, where two guards pat down 
           Maria Victoria and the children.

                                 PABLO
                        Let them in.

           The pat down ends, and Pablo’s family is allowed entrance.

           Manuela has grown, Maria Victoria has aged.  But Juan Pablo, 
           now 14, looks most changed.  He’s shot up and put on solid 
           weight.  He looks more like his father than ever.

           Even Pablo is arrested by the sight of his son.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting so big.

           Pablo hugs his son.  Juan Pablo hugs him back, but only after 
           thinking it over.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - DAY

           Manuela plays with her dolls in the life-sized gingerbread 
           playhouse Pablo had built for her.

           Maria Victoria and Roberto stand nearby, one eye on the girl, 
           one on the soccer match playing out in the adjacent pitch.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Why aren’t you playing?

                                 ROBERTO
                        My knees.

           Maria Victoria reflects.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        We’re not kids anymore, are we?

                                 ROBERTO
                        No, we’re not.

           SOCCER PITCH
           Pablo’s gang versus the Colombian National team.

           Juan Pablo weaves through the defense, moving the ball well.  
           Pablo parallels him along the sideline, calling.

                                 PABLO
                        Here!  Here!

           Juan Pablo passes the ball, but it’s a little behind his 
           father, and a defender steals it.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Lead me -- lead me!

           Pablo chides his son, and then pursues the ball.  Juan 
           Pablo’s patience is thin, and physically he’s wearing out. 

           Another change of possession, and the ball gets to Pablo.

           He spots Juan Pablo for the cross, and sends it his way.

           Juan Pablo fields the ball, and takes his shot.

           Wide.  Well wide.

           Pablo throws out his hands in frustration.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

           The goalie, RENE “EL LOCO” HEGUITA (25), trots it out.  His 
           bush of long, tight black curls bounces with each step.  He 
           sails the ball to mid-field.

           Pablo wins a battle for the ball, and drives again.

           One man to beat.  He jukes left and goes right.  He has a 
           clean shot on goal, and takes it.

           Heguita dives -- the ball skips past his fingertips and finds 
           home.

           Pablo throws both fists up in celebration.  His teammates 
           clap his back and jump around him.

           Juan Pablo sits the celebration out.

           One of the GUARDS, serving as referee, checks his watch and 
           blows a whistle.  Match over.

           Pablo sees his son’s rather dour expression.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter -- we won!
                                 JUAN PABLO
                        He let you score.

           A few of the others, including Heguita, fall into 
           uncomfortable silence.

                                 PABLO
                        That’s René Heguita!  El Loco!

           Juan Pablo shrugs, not moved.  Pablo turns to Heguita.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Did you let me score?

                                 HEGUITA
                        No, way -- that was a great shot.

           Heguita’s expression withers a little under the attention.  
           By this point, everyone is silent.

                                 PABLO
                        We’re playing another period.

           Pablo claps.  The exhausted men hold their protests.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                             (to Heguita)
                        You don’t let me score, do you 
                        understand?  You block me.  
                        Whatever you have to do.  Do not 
                        let me score.

           Everyone trots back into position.  Juan Pablo shakes his 
           head and heads to midfield.

           Heguita stands back in the goal, and takes a deep -- almost 
           doomed -- breath.

           The Guard blows the whistle, and play resumes.

           The ball goes back and forth a few times, but Pablo’s heart 
           is the only one really in it.  Juan Pablo hangs off to the 
           side, making a show of keeping up.

           Eventually Pablo drives.  No real opposition this time.  
           Pablo is given an open shot yet again.

           Heguita crouches down, ready for the shot.

           Pablo shoots a bullet.  Heguita dives, and once again the 
           ball slips past and into the net.

           Silence.
           Heguita, on the ground, dare not look up at Pablo.

           Pablo waits until the ball comes to rest in the nylon 
           webbing, then looks at his son.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        There!  I told you!

           Pablo walks off the pitch.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        We win.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - NIGHT

           The family eats dinner together around a small table.  
           Spooning out the food, passing the plates.  No conversation.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - NIGHT

           The family sits in the living room, playing Monopoly.  But no 
           one has any fun; it’s all pro-forma.

           Roberto rolls and moves his piece.  He lands on one of 
           Pablo’s properties.  He dutifully pays rent.

           While Manuela takes her turn, Pablo swipes some money from 
           the bank and slips it between the sofa cushions.

           Pablo glances at Juan Pablo, who caught him again.  Pablo 
           winks, and tries to give him a bill under the table.

           But Juan Pablo doesn’t take it.  Pablo urges it on him.

           Juan Pablo snaps, and with a swipe of his hand, overturns the 
           board.  Houses, hotels and Chance cards go everywhere.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        What are you doing!?

           Juan Pablo storms out to the veranda.

           Pablo holds out his hands, tries to calm everyone down.  He 
           follows his boy oustide.

           EXT. PABLO’S CELL, VERANDA - NIGHT

           Juan Pablo stands at the rail, beside the telescope.  He 
           hears his father come out, but doesn’t turn.
           Pablo slides the glass door shut behind him, but leaves some 
           space between himself and his son.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I hate this place.  I want to 
                        leave.

                                 PABLO
                        You don’t hate it.  We have 
                        everything we could possibly want.

           Pablo goes to the telescope.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Let me show you something.

           Pablo trains it on the city, searching.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        There.  Look.  It’s your house.

           Pablo offers the eyepiece.  Juan Pablo looks at him, 
           confused.  Doesn’t take it.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        If you knew what I had to do to get 
                        us all here, you’d change your 
                        tune.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I know what you did.  I read the 
                        newspapers.

                                 PABLO
                        You read the newspapers.  You’re a 
                        man of the world now, ‘eh?  Have 
                        you read how the Americans are 
                        trying to kill me?  That the only 
                        thing standing between me and a 
                        bullet is that fence?  No you 
                        haven’t, because they only print 
                        what they want you to know.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I know enough.  I know I never want 
                        to be you.

                                 PABLO
                        And who am I, Juan Pablo?  Come on.  
                        Look at me.  What do you see?

           Juan Pablo squares himself opposite his father.  They are 
           practically eye-to-eye now.
                                 JUAN PABLO
                        I see... a selfish old man.

           Silence.  Pablo stays calm, easy.

                                 PABLO
                        One day, when you have children, 
                        you’ll understand the sacrifices 
                        I’ve made.

           Pablo goes back inside.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT

           Pablo sees his family off.  Pablo hugs his daughter tightly.  
           He kisses and hugs his wife.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                             (to Manuela)
                        Come on.

           Juan Pablo leads his sister to the gate while his mother 
           lingers behind, on the verge of tears.  

                                 PABLO
                        Don’t cry, Tata.  I’ll see you next 
                        week.

           She pulls away from him, and joins her children, leaving 
           Pablo alone with the night sky.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT

           A light cargo truck pulls up to the gate.  The guard makes a 
           cursory inspection.  The payload is filled with crates of 
           food, fresh produce.  He waves it through.

           OVERLAY: 1993

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, LOADING AREA - NIGHT

           Popeye unloads a few crates from a supply truck, revealing a 
           hidden compartment.  He unlatches the door and opens it.

           Eduardo and Pedro, Don Berna’s sons, climb out, sore and 
           cramped from the ride.

                                 POPEYE
                        Hard part’s over.
                                 EDUARDO BERNA
                        I hope the hospitality makes up for 
                        the ride.  I heard you have a hell 
                        of a setup here.

           Popey shrugs.

                                 POPEYE
                        It’s home.

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Popeye leads the two men through the building.

                                 PEDRO BERNA
                        I could use a drink.  Whattaya got?

                                 POPEYE
                        Whatever you want.

                                 EDUARDO BERNA
                        Hey -- is it true?  Did you fuck 
                        Miss Venezuela?

                                 POPEYE
                        Don’t believe everything you hear, 
                        bro.

           Popeye opens a door, revealing a staircase going down.

                                 POPEYE (CONT’D)
                        But yeah.  In the ass.

           The men share a jocular laugh.  Popeye politely allows the 
           tho gentlemen to go downstairs first.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - NIGHT

           A Sinatra record spins on the turntable: In the Wee Small 
           Hours.  The cover sits next to the record player, with a hand-
           written note:  “Pablo, thanks for the memories!  Frank.”

           Pablo sits at his desk, writing long hand.  Photos adorn the 
           wall.  In one, Pablo and his young son pose outside the White 
           House gate.  In another, they stand with Mickey Mouse.

           Another set is of Pablo the outlaw: one of him dressed as 
           Pancho Villa with criss-crossing bands of bullets; the other 
           of Gustavo and him dressed as Prohibition-era bootleggers.

           A knock.  Popeye enters.
                                 POPEYE
                        Doctór.  They’re ready.

           Pablo continues to write.

                                 PABLO
                        I’ll be down in a minute.

                                 POPEYE
                        What’s that, what are you writing?

                                 PABLO
                        A book.  About my life.  You should 
                        write one, too.  We all should.

                                 POPEYE
                        Nobody’d read a book about me.

                                 PABLO
                        They’ll read books, sing 
                        corridos...  Mothers will name 
                        their children after us.  We’re 
                        bigger than oil, hermano.  And if 
                        we don’t write down what happened, 
                        someone else will -- a gringo, 
                        probably.  They’ll turn us into 
                        monsters, or clowns, or both.  They 
                        won’t know what this was really 
                        like.

                                 POPEYE
                        Should I tell everyone to hang out?

           Pablo sets down his pencil, closes his notebook.

                                 PABLO
                        No, I’m ready.

           Pablo gets up and goes with Popeye.

                                 POPEYE
                        Hey, am I in your book?

                                 PABLO
                        You will be.

                                 POPEYE
                        Make me look cool, yeah?

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, DUNGEON - NIGHT

           The door at the top of the stairs opens, revealing Pablo with 
           Popeye.  Pablo patiently descends to the cold, damp floor.
           The room is about fifteen square, lit by a lone bare bulb at 
           the end of an extension cord on the ground.

           Dank sweat fills the air.  Tyson is out of breath.  He holds 
           a length of chain.  His bare chest is flecked with blood.

           Eduardo and Pedro dangle from the ceiling by their feet, 
           barely conscious.  Their bodies are caked in their own blood.

           Pablo approaches Eduardo first.

                                 PABLO
                        Two million a month.  That was the 
                        agreement.  I know how you’re 
                        making more than that.

                                 EDUARDO BERNA
                        ...No -- we’re not...

           Pablo grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls him away from the 
           wall.  Eduardo’s breath quickens.

           Pablo lets go, and Eduardo swings like a pendulum -- cracking 
           his skull against the concrete wall with a sickening crunch.

           Eduardo’s eyeballs go red with fresh hemorrhages.  He stares 
           madly into space.

           Pablo moves to Pedro.

                                 PABLO
                        I fought a war and went to prison 
                        so you and your father could run 
                        your business, live your life, and 
                        see your kids.  I died for your 
                        motherfucking sins, hermano.  Why 
                        have you forsaken me?

           Pedro smiles a bloody smile.

                                 PEDRO BERNA
                        Fuck you.

           Pablo takes a step back, and lets Tyson approach.  He has 
           exchanged the length of chain for a dull hatchet.

           He lets Pedro see it before he winds up for his first swing.

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, GUARD HOUSE - NIGHT

           The GUARD ON DUTY glances up as Tyson and Mugre push two a 
           wheel barrows loaded with trash bags and a shovel.
           The gate opens automatically for them.

           The guard, addled, averts his eyes out of fear.

           The gate closes on its own, and the men push their loads 
           toward the woods.

           The guard, a young, virtuous Catholic, checks if anyone is 
           watching: no one, save the Blessed Virgin on his prayer card.

           With a trembling hand, picks up the telephone.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - MORNING

           The rising sun starts burning off the thick fog that blankets 
           the hillside.  Two military transport vehicles emerge from 
           the mist, rumbling up the winding road to the prison.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - MORNING

           Roberto shakes his brother awake.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Pablo -- Pablo!  Something’s wrong.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - MORNING

           Pablo stands with his men in a loose semi-circle behind him.  
           They have no weapons.  Only Roberto seems nervous about what 
           is happening.

           The fog is still thick enough to obscure everything beyond 
           the gate.  Only the vaguest outlines of the military trucks 
           can be seen.

           A man in a suit enters the yard with a cadre of prison 
           guards.  Vice Minister MENDOZA (30s).  His muddied loafers 
           and flop sweat give him up as someone in over his head.

                                 MENDOZA
                        Mr. Escobar.  I’m Vice Minister of 
                        Justice Mendoza.

                                 PABLO
                        Good morning.

           Pablo offers his hand.  Mendoza, off-kilter, shakes it 
           politely.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        What can I do for you?
                                 MENDOZA
                        I’m here to inform you we are 
                        closing this facility and 
                        transferring you and your men to 
                        Bogotá.  Immediately.

                                 PABLO
                        That was not the arrangement.  If 
                        President Gaviria wants to change 
                        the terms of my surrender, he can 
                        come here himself.

           Mendoza swallows.

                                 MENDOZA
                        With all due respect, you are in 
                        our custody.

                                 PABLO
                        You will turn me over to the 
                        Americans.

                                 MENDOZA
                        That would be unconstitutional.  
                        You should know that.

           Pablo steps closer to him.  Mendoza stands firm.

                                 TYSON
                        Let’s kill these motherfuckers 
                        already, patrón!

           Pablo holds out a hand to keep his men quiet.  Mendoza tries 
           not to let on how nervous he is.

                                 PABLO
                        I cannot let armed men enter here.  
                        I don’t trust them.

                                 MENDOZA
                        Mr. Escobar, I will personally 
                        guarantee your safety.

           Pablo thinks it over for a moment, then nods.

                                 PABLO
                             (to his men)
                        Take him inside.

           Tyson and the others draw pistols and Uzis from under their 
           jackets and their waistbands.

           Mendoza instinctively turns to the prison guards -- whose 
           weapons are also trained on him.
           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, BATHROOM - DAY

           Popeye chains Mendoza to the sink.  Mendoza looks not only 
           terrified, but defeated.

           Popeye drops a cell phone in his lap.

                                 POPEYE
                        Call your boss.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - MORNING

           The soldiers have fanned out, and established a perimeter 
           around the fence.

           The ARMY CAPTAIN in command talks on his radio.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Understood, sir.

           He hands the radio back to his sergeant.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        They’ve got a hostage.  Orders are 
                        to wait.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - DAY

           Pablo overturns his mattress, revealing a stash of about two 
           million, neatly stacked.

                                 PABLO
                        Here.

           He tosses his brother a vest covered in zippered pockets, 
           each large enough to hold a few bundles.

                                 ROBERTO
                        What about negotiating?

                                 PABLO
                        They’re gonna kill us, hermano.

                                 ROBERTO
                        You said we’d be safe here.  You 
                        said we wouldn’t have to run 
                        anymore.

                                 PABLO
                        They’re the ones who broke the 
                        deal, not me!
                                 ROBERTO
                        I can’t do this again -- I can’t...

           Pablo takes his brother by the shoulders.

                                 PABLO
                        I’ve looked out for you since we 
                        were children.  I’ve never let you 
                        get hurt.  If we stay, we will die.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - DAY

           The soldiers watch the prison for any movement.  They scan 
           the windows, the terraces.  Nothing.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT

           The standoff continues past nightfall, and still no signs of 
           life in the prison.  The fog thickens as the night grows 
           cooler, and blows between the soldiers and the building.

           Suddenly, the prison loses power.  Every light inside and out 
           extinguishes, plunging the entire hillside into darkness.

           The CAPTAIN raises his hand.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Hold your positions!

           The soldiers hold still, awaiting certain attack.  They try 
           pointing flood lights at the building, but the fog scatters 
           the light, illuminating little.

           The silence is eternal.  With each passing second, the 
           soldiers become more tense.

           Then: a tiny CLICK.  The soldiers move their fingers over the 
           triggers.  Another CLICK.  The hammer of a gun?  CLICK.  The 
           fog obscures even the direction of the sound.

           ON THE CAPTAIN

           Radioing his men.

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        What do you see?

           His men radio back: Negative; nothing sir; etc.

           The clicks have stopped.  The prison is silent, and still.
           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           A tear gas cannister enters through the door and skitters 
           down the hall before releasing its noxious payload.

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT

           The soldiers storm through the gates.  They split into two 
           squadrons.  One searches the grounds, one enters the prison.

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT 

           The soldiers search room to room for the inmates, leading 
           with their rifles and flashlights.  Each room is empty.

           INT. PABLO’S CELL - NIGHT

           The soldiers bust into Pablo’s cell, and sweep each room.  
           Indeed, the looks on their faces give away just how 
           shockingly well Pablo has been living.

           But Pablo himself is nowhere to be found.

           INT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON, BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mendoza, haggard and miserable, holds out his hands in 
           desperation as two soldiers bear down on him.

                                 MENDOZA
                        Don’t shoot, don’t shoot!  I’m a 
                        hostage!

                                 SOLDIER
                        Where are they?

                                 MENDOZA
                        I don’t know!

           EXT. THE CATHEDRAL PRISON - NIGHT

           The soldiers come upon a flap clipped out of the chain-link 
           fence, large enough for a well-fed man to slip through.

           The flap is no more than thirty meters from where the 
           soldiers had taken their positions before the raid.
           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           Pablo and his men tromp through the woods, their clothes torn 
           in places, their feet covered in mud.  Their grimaces show 
           the difficulty of the terrain.

           But Pablo cannot help smiling.  He is an outlaw again.

           EXT. EL SALADO - MORNING

           The men make walk the dirt streets of El Salado, a 
           neighborhood on the outskirts of the city.

           The place is quiet -- most everyone is still asleep.  But a 
           few people have gotten an early start, and they eyeball the 
           traveling band of men cautiously.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           The men walk to a small but tasteful farmhouse on a few 
           acres.  Pablo walks up to the front door and knocks.

           After a few moments, PEREZ (60s) answers the door.  He’s 
           taken aback by the sight of the outlaws.

                                 PABLO
                        Good morning, señor.  Do you have a 
                        telephone?

           INT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Sra. Perez washes the mens’ garments in the basin.

           INT. MEMO’S HOUSE - DAY

           Perez hands out his own clothes to Pablo and the others.  
           They get dressed, truly grateful for the hospitality.

                                 PABLO
                        You’re truly kind, sir.

                                 PEREZ
                        You’re the kind one, Sr. Escobar.

           Pause.  Pablo hadn’t realized Perez recognized him.

                                 PEREZ (CONT’D)
                        You helped my cousin once, a long 
                        time ago.  You built a house for 
                        him, and many others here.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEREZ (CONT’D)
                        We all owe you so much.  Please, 
                        stay as long as you’d like.

           Pablo smiles in gratitude.

           Then, a loud knock on the door.  Pablo snaps his head to the 
           sound.  Popeye and the others draw their pistols.

                                 PABLO
                             (to Perez)
                        Go see who it is.

           Perez crosses to the front door, and cautiously opens it.  
           Waiting on the other side: a line of older women, mothers and 
           grandmothers, each carrying dishes of food.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY

           One at a time, the women set their food in front of Pablo.

                                 MADRE
                        Thank you, Don Pablo.

           They all want to give thanks, to lay hands on him, as one 
           might do with a living saint.

                                 ABUELITA
                        Our sons are watching the streets.  
                        They will not let the police come 
                        here.

                                 PABLO
                        Thank you, señora.

           She kisses his hand.  Another MADRE sets food down.

                                 MADRE 2
                        Don Pablo, my godson is sick.  His 
                        name is Ricardo González.  Can you 
                        please pray for him?

                                 PABLO
                        I will.  Of course.  Thank you.

                                 MADRE 2
                             (tears in her eyes)
                        Thank you, thank you.

           EXT. MEMO’S HOUSE, BACKYARD - DAY

           Roberto stands at the edge of the garden, hands in his 
           pockets, looking off.
           Pablo walks up, and take in the beautiful country.  They 
           stand in silence, for a moment.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I bought an apartment in the city a 
                        few years ago, quietly.

           Pablo takes it in.

                                 PABLO
                        If they find you, they’ll kill you.

                                 ROBERTO
                        I need to stay in one place, Pablo.  
                        I’m not like you.

           Pause.

                                 PABLO
                        We’ll get back on top, you know.  
                        We started with nothing.  And look 
                        what we did.

                                 ROBERTO
                        Yeah.  Look at it.

           Roberto goes back inside.  Pablo stays behind, left to turn 
           his brother’s words over in his mind, and heart.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - DAY

           Maria Victoria watches the television coverage of Pablo’s 
           apparent escape.

           Juan Pablo’s pager goes off.  He looks at the screen, and 
           doesn’t recognize the number.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Call it, now.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - INTERCUT

           The house phone rings.  Pablo picks it right up.  He looks at 
           his watch, paying attention to only the second hand.

                                 PABLO
                        Juan Pablo?

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        No, it’s me.  Where are you, what’s 
                        going on?
                                 PABLO
                        Put him on.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        He’s not here -- what’s happening?

                                 PABLO
                        Where is he?

           Juan Pablo stands only a few feet away, listening.  The 
           second hand on Pablo’s watch sweeps past the first minute.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        ...Playing with Manuela.  They said 
                        on the news you were shot!

                                 PABLO
                        Don’t believe the news.  Call a 
                        radio station, do you hear me?  
                        Tell them we have a tunnel under 
                        the prison, and enough food and 
                        water for a month.  Then get 
                        yourselves together.  I’m moving 
                        you again.

           Silence.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Why?

           Pablo watches the second hand as it approaches minute two.

                                 PABLO
                        That’s all.

           He hangs up before two minutes have elapsed.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY

           Pablo walks in on his men around the table, filling their 
           stomachs.  He stands at the head of the table.

                                 PABLO
                        We have to split up.  We’ve made 
                        our share of enemies, and they will 
                        all be looking for us.

           A few of the men trade nervous glances.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        We’ll be too easy to find all 
                        together.
           EXT. SEARCH BLOC HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           The Search Bloc jeeps roll out of the headquarters, each one 
           carrying a full compliment of officers, armed to the hilt.

           EXT. STREETS OF MEDELLÍN - NIGHT

           Paneled vans with satellite dishes on top creep along various 
           streets in the city.

                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        I’ll give you enough money to 
                        disappear, and get your families to 
                        safety.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

           El Poeta, desperate, drenched in sweat, runs down the alley 
           looking over his shoulder for his pursuers.  The Search Bloc 
           rounds the corner and opens fire.

           El Poeta falls, dead.

           INT. TYSON’S HIDEOUT - NIGHT

           The Search Bloc officers burst through the bedroom door.  
           Tyson leaps off his woman.  The officers spray the entire 
           room with shells, obliterating the loyal bodyguard.

                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        We will all see each other again.

           EXT. RODRIGUEZ OREJUELA RANCH - DAY

           Don Berna, black band around his arm, shakes hands with 
           Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.

                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        This government doesn’t want 
                        another war.  No one does.

           Carlos Castaño stands a few feet away from Don Berna, gladly 
           witnessing the deal.

           EXT. BODEGA - NIGHT

           The same Medellín corner bodega.  The same sort of punks out 
           front, shooting dice.
                                 PABLO (V.O.)
                        I will do everything I can to 
                        negotiate another surrender.

           The entire bodega explodes in a flash of fire and debris.

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

           Castaño, face blackened like a warrior, crosses the room with 
           a cross-cut saw hanging loosely from one hand.  He walks to 
           El Mugre, tied to a chair -- gagged, naked, spread eagle.

           EXT. CITY PARK, MEDELLÍN - MORNING

           Four corpses hang from a tree by their feet.  Their hands and 
           heads have been removed.

           EXT. STREET IN MEDELLÍN - DAY

           A corpse and its torn-off limbs litter the sidewalk.

           INT. FARMHOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY

           Pablo scans the trusting faces of his most loyal soldiers.

                                 PABLO
                        You’re all family to me.

           BLACK.

           INT. UNDISCLOSED LOCATION - DAY

           Felix Gonzáles sips his coffee.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Does your husband know I’m here?

           Maria Victoria shakes her head.

                        Even if I could get them... He 
                        wouldn’t be happy with me when he 
                        found out.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        When has he ever gotten mad with 
                        someone who’s protected us?

           Gonzáles isn’t convinced.
                                 JUAN PABLO
                        If you don’t get us the visas, I’ll 
                        tell him you told DAS where we are.

           Even Maria Victoria is taken aback by her son’s brazenness.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        The apple never falls far, does it.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Help us.

           EXT. BOGOTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Maria Victoria and her two children, their faces obscured by 
           hats and sunglasses, walk into the international terminal.

           INT. BOGOTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           The family passes through the metal detector.  Juan Pablo 
           constantly scans for anything or anyone suspicious.

           INT. BOGOTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, GATE - DAY

           The card above the entrance announces the flight to FRANKFURT 
           is now boarding.

           Juan Pablo hands over their tickets, and leads his mother and 
           sister down the jetway.

           INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY

           Maria Victoria gets Manuela buckled in.  Juan Pablo nervously 
           taps his arm rest and stares at the airplane door.

           The TICKET TAKER from the terminal hurries on board and flags 
           the first class cabin STEWARDESS.

           Juan Pablo’s entire body tenses as he watches the two talk.  
           They glance his way.  The ticket taker hands the stewardess 
           something, and the stewardess starts walking toward him.

           She passes Juan Pablo and addresses the man behind him.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Sir, you left this in the terminal.

           The man thanks her.  Juan Pablo practically hyperventilates.
           The stewardess seals the aircraft’s door.  Juan Pablo 
           breathes, at long last.  A tear rolls down one cheek.

           EXT. BOGOTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           The airliner carrying the Escobars lifts off Colombian soil 
           and takes to the sky.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - DAY

           Pablo talks on his satellite phone in a moving vehicle, 
           crouched down beneath the windows.

                                 PABLO
                        Where are they now?

           INT. GONZÁLES’ OFFICE - INTERCUT

           Gonzáles stands behind his desk, on the phone.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Bogotá.  The Germans wouldn’t honor 
                        their visas, and they were sent 
                        back on the next plane.

           EXT. BOGOTA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Juan Pablo, his mother and sister exit the airport, now 
           surrounded by federal agents.  The entrance to the airport 
           has been cordoned off and is clogged with police.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        Once they landed, they were put in 
                        protective custody.  They have them 
                        at the Hotel Tequendama.

           INT. RANGE ROVER - INTERCUT

           Pablo takes it all in.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        There’s nothing I can do.  Too many 
                        careers are on the line.  They’ll 
                        hold your family until they find 
                        you.

                                 PABLO
                        Or kill me.
           A pause.

                                 GONZÁLEZ
                        I can’t help you anymore.  Don’t 
                        contact me again.

           Gonzáles hangs up.  Pablo holds on to the receiver until the 
           dial tone returns.

           EXT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA - DAY

           An L-shaped brick and cement hotel, more institutional than 
           regal in design.  A cement awning bears the hotel’s name: 
           TEQUENDAMA.

           Uniformed DAS officers stand guard outside the entrance, 
           watching the street intently, scanning for threats.

           ON THE STREET

           Agents use mirrors to inspect the underside of every car 
           parked nearby.  Another agent patrols the sidewalk with a 
           German Shepard on a leash.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, HALLWAY - DAY

           At the far end, two DAS agents stand guard at the elevator.  
           The hall is empty, save Manuela, who lies on her stomach, 
           playing solitaire outside her family’s room.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (O.S.)
                        You can’t keep us here!

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE - DAY

           Maria Victoria argues with a DAS OFFICER.  Juan Pablo watches 
           the news, trying to block out his mother’s voice.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        I’m going to the God damned store 
                        to get food for my children!

                                 DAS OFFICER
                        Tell us what you need, and we’ll 
                        have it brought up.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        So we’re hostages now.  Is that it?

           She spits on the floor and storms away.  Juan Pablo looks at 
           the agent plainly.
                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Leave us alone.

           The DAS agent turns and leaves.  Once the door is shut, Juan 
           Pablo turns back to the TV news.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. RANGE ROVER - EVENING

           Pablo drives himself.  No one else in the car.  He flies 
           along the highway, away from Medellín.

           Ahead, he sees the sign for LA CEJA and takes the turn-off.

           EXT. LA CEJA, PLAZA - EVENING

           Pablo gets out, looks around.  La Ceja is a one-horse town in 
           farm country.  No paved roads.  The church bells ring, and 
           the whole town, it seems, files in for evening mass.

           EXT. LITTLE WHITE HOUSE, LA CEJA - EVENING

           Pablo walks up a dirt path away from the plaza to a small 
           white house.  In the background, the church bells toll.

           He walks to door, but can’t bring himself to knock right 
           away.  He takes a breath, summons the courage.  Knocks.

           A small man, old -- but by no means frail -- answers the 
           door.  Weathered, with failing eyesight.  ABEL de JESUS 
           ESCOBAR (late 60s).

                                 PABLO
                        Hello, papá.

           INT. ABEL’S HOME - NIGHT

           The clock ticks.  Abel pours some aguardiente in two dirty 
           glasses, and gives one to Pablo.  Pablo doesn’t touch it. 

                                 PABLO
                        I had a feeling you’d still be 
                        living here.  Was something wrong 
                        with the house I built for you?

                                 ABEL
                        It was very big.  And too far from 
                        church.
                                 PABLO
                        Have you talked to mamá lately?

                                 ABEL
                        No, no.

                                 PABLO
                        And you haven’t read the news?

                                 ABEL
                        The Bible is good enough for me.  
                        How’s your little boy?

                                 PABLO
                        He’s sixteen.  And I have a girl, 
                        too.  She’s nine.

                                 ABEL
                        A girl.  Girls are good.  Easy.  
                        Boys...  Boys are trouble.  You 
                        were trouble.

                                 PABLO
                        I know.

                                 ABEL
                        But smart.  Too smart.  You were 
                        never content.

           Silence.

                                 PABLO
                        Why didn’t you come for us, after 
                        she left you?  Why didn’t you bring 
                        us back here?

                                 ABEL
                        Why are you still thinking about 
                        that?  You were a little boy.

                                 PABLO
                        Please tell me.

                                 ABEL
                             (defiant)
                        I don’t remember.

           Impasse.  Pablo stands.

                                 PABLO
                        This was a mistake.
                                 ABEL
                        Go, go...  Back to the city...  
                        Back to your perfect life...  Just 
                        remember where you come from.

                                 PABLO
                        I come from shit.  You’re a small 
                        man, living a small life, and 
                        that’s all you’ll ever be!

           Abel scoffs, making a show of how little that affects him.  

           Pablo starts out, building steam all the way to the door.  
           Before he leaves, he pauses.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        You couldn’t even teach me how to 
                        tie a tie.

                                 ABEL
                        You survived.

           Pablo sighs, then leaves.

           EXT. LITTLE WHITE HOUSE, LA CEJA - NIGHT

           Pablo starts back toward town.  He takes one last look at his 
           father, through the window, where he left him, stubbornly 
           drinking his aguardiente.  Alone.

           Pablo walks away.

           EXT. LA CEJA - NIGHT

           As Pablo returns to the square, he is met by a church 
           procession.  A hundred faithful, clad in white, march 
           penitently behind a vaulted statue of the Blessed Virgin.  A 
           single drum beats slowly.  A hymn is sung.

           The golden statue bobbles on the shoulders of strong men.  
           Old ladies clutch their rosaries, praying softly.

           The children skip in and out of line, misbehaving.  Two boys 
           kick around a Coke bottle like a soccer ball.

           Pablo is present, but he is not among them.  He is a ghost.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE, BEDROOM - DAY

           Juan Pablo’s pager starts vibrating.  Juan Pablo enters from 
           the next room to pick it up.
           OVERLAY: December 2, 1993

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           An adjoining suite has been converted into a surveillance 
           room.  Half a dozen DAS officers monitor every inch of the 
           family’s suite.

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                        He’s picking up a page.

           They watch Juan pablo check the number, and then take out the 
           radiophone hidden in his luggage.

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        That’s got to be him.

           All hands on deck as they prepare to monitor and track the 
           communication next door.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE, BEDROOM - SAME

           Juan Pablo takes the radiophone out onto the balcony, and 
           slides the glass door shut behind him before dialing the 
           number on the pager.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           They have no cameras on the balcony, and no audio.

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                        He’s on the balcony.  He’s on the 
                        balcony.

           EXT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, BALCONY - SAME

           After a few rings, Pablo picks up the phone.  The reception 
           is terrible.

                                 PABLO (PHONE FILTER)
                        Juan Pablo?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Dad?  I can barely hear you.

                                 PABLO (PHONE FILTER)
                        Where are you?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        In Bogotá.  The Hotel Tequendama.
           ON the balcony directly below Juan Pablo, two DAS officers 
           eavesdrop on the conversation with a dish microphone.

                                 PABLO (PHONE FILTER)
                        What room?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        1302.  Where are you?

           The line goes dead.

                                 JUAN PABLO (CONT’D)
                        Dad?  Hello?

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           The surveillance officer gets on his own radio.

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICER
                        Commandante.  Positive contact.  
                        Escobar knows they’re here, and 
                        knows the room number.

           EXT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, ROOF - DAY

           DAS snipers take to the roof and set up at the ledges, where 
           each has a clear view of approaching traffic.

           EXT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA - DAY

           The DAS officers out front wave away all cars attempting to 
           pull up to the hotel.  Code red.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE - DAY

           Juan Pablo comes back into the main room.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                             (puzzled)
                        That was dad.

           Maria Victoria looks up.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        What did he say?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Nothing.
           The room phone rings.  They all look at each other, none of 
           them really knowing what to do.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, SURVEILLANCE ROOM - SAME

           The agents hear the phone, too, and are equally surprised.

                                 SURVEILLANCE OFFICER

           Maria Victoria crosses to answer the phone.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Hello?

           INT. APARTMENT IN MEDELLÍN - INTERCUT

           Pablo, in the bedroom of his latest safe house, leans against 
           the window.  His voice is calm.  He watches the second hand 
           on his Rolex.

                                 PABLO
                        Tata, it’s me.  How are you?  How 
                        are the children?

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        Fine, we’re fine.  We’re in Bogotá.

                                 PABLO
                        I know.  I know everything.  I’m so 
                        sorry for what you’ve had to go 
                        through.  I’m going to make it 
                        right, Tata.  I promise.  Is my 
                        angel there?  Can I speak to her?

                                 MARIA VICTORIA
                        ...Yes.  Here.

           Maria Victoria hands the phone to her daughter.

                                 MARIA VICTORIA (CONT’D)
                        Here, honey -- it’s papi.

                                 MANUELA
                        Hi, papi.  Where are you?

           The very sound of her voice brings tears to his eyes.
                                 PABLO
                        I’m far away, angel.  I miss you so 
                        much.  I think about you every day.

                                 MANUELA
                        I miss you, too.

                                 PABLO
                        I love you.

                                 MANUELA
                        I love you, too.  When are you 
                        coming home?

                                 PABLO
                        ...Soon, baby.  It’s so good to 
                        hear your voice.  Are you being a 
                        good girl?

           He watches the second hand sweep past one minute.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, SURVEILLANCE ROOM - INTERCUT

           The agents quickly work to trace the call.

                                 DAS AGENT
                        Definitely in Medellín -- it’s a

           Pablo stays on the phone.

                                 PABLO
                        I love you, sweetheart.  Put your 
                        brother on, okay?

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET, MEDELLÍN - SAME

           The satellite dish rotates on the top of the vans as they 
           drive up and down each street.

           INT. PANELED VAN - SAME

           The Search Bloc agents scan the airwaves, trying to maintain 
           a lock on the conversation.

           [note: their progress is intercut with the following]
           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE - SAME

           Manuela gives the phone to her brother.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Dad?

                                 PABLO
                        I have a new job for you, a very 
                        important one.  Are you ready?

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Yes.

           Pablo watches the second hand sweep past two minutes.

                                 PABLO
                        Whenever they ask you questions, 
                        tell them the truth.  Tell them you 
                        didn’t have anything to do with my 
                        business.  They’ll ask you if you 
                        know where money is hidden, you 
                        need to tell them no.  You need to 
                        tell them you’re innocent.

           PANELED VAN

           The conversation comes through loud and clear.  The van is 
           closing in on the signal.

           APARTMENT

           Pablo remains on the phone.

                                 PABLO (CONT’D)
                        They’ll ask you what kind of person 
                        your father was.  Don’t lie.  Tell 
                        them what you told me.

           Juan Pablo glances at the clock on the wall -- he is also 
           aware of the passing time.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Should we hang up?

                                 PABLO
                        No, not yet.

           PANELED VAN

           They locate the source of the signal.  The driver of the van 
           looks out the windshield and sees Pablo through the second-
           story bedroom window.
                                 DRIVER
                        Holy shit!

           APARTMENT

           Pablo sees the van parked there.  And he stays on the phone, 
           and stops looking at his watch.

                                 PABLO
                        People will tell you about me, and 
                        what kind of life I lived.  Believe 
                        as much as you want; none of them 
                        will get it right.  But none of 
                        them will be wrong, either.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Dad, don’t do this.

                                 PABLO
                        All I wanted to do was build 
                        something.

           EXT. STREET IN MEDELLÍN - DAY

           The Search Bloc moves swiftly up to the apartment building.  
           One officer swings a ram and busts the front door open.

           INT. APARTMENT IN MEDELLÍN - CONTINUOUS

           The first of the officers spot Limón at the top of the 
           stairs.  He pulls his gun, but is too late.  TAP-TAP-TAP -- 
           their bullets send him to the ground.

           INT. APARTMENT IN MEDELLÍN, BEDROOM - SAME

           Pablo hears the intruders.

                                 PABLO
                             (calmly)
                        Something’s going on downstairs.  
                        I’ll have to call you back.

           Pablo hangs up.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE - SAME

           Juan Pablo calls after his father.

                                 JUAN PABLO
                        Dad?  Dad?
           INT. APARTMENT IN MEDELLÍN - SAME

           The officers fan out stealthily, anticipating ambush.

           INT. APARTMENT IN MEDELLÍN, BEDROOM - SAME

           Pablo slides a clip into his Sig, his eyes torched with 
           mischief.

           He climbs out the window and shoots a few rounds back through 
           the bedroom.

           EXT. ROOFTOP IN MEDELLÍN - CONTINUOUS

           Pablo runs out onto the roof, slipping on some loose clay 
           tiles.  Gunfire pops inside.  Shots zip past his head.

           Pablo shoots wildly, giddy with the chase.

           Then, a round finds his side.  He winces.  Another in his 
           leg.  He drops.

           A final shot to his head, behind his ear.

           Pablo falls, face down, his belly hanging out of his shirt, 
           undignified, bleeding out on the tiles.

           The first calls of “HOLD YOUR FIRE” and “WE GOT HIM!” echo 
           across the rooftops.

           But for Pablo, all is still.  He is dead.

           INT. HOTEL TEQUENDAMA, FAMILY’S SUITE - DAY

           ON TV: A news image of the apartment, surrounded by police.  
           The caption: PABLO ESCOBAR DEAD.

           Maria Victoria turns off the television quickly.  She grabs 
           her daughter, and holds her, crying.

           Juan Pablo, in a daze, can’t look away.

           EXT. ROOFTOP IN MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Eight members of the Search Bloc, elated, pose with their 
           rifles over the corpse of Pablo Escobar like hunters over a 
           twelve-point buck.  A ninth snaps a picture.

           Overlay: Pablo Escobar was killed one day after his 44th 
           birthday.  He did not live to finish his autobiography.
           EXT. STREET IN MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Thousands watch Pablo’s funeral procession.  The poor, the 
           downtrodden, the honest folk.  Mothers weep below black veils 
           and hold their hands to heaven.

           Men converge on the casket, trying to touch him, trying to 
           glimpse him one last time.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Pablo’s tomb is marked with a polished-granite stone, ringed 
           with yellow flowers.  A steady stream of tourists and 
           admirers come to pay respects and take a few snapshots.

           OVERLAY:  His grave has since become one of the most popular 
           tourist destinations in South America.

           EXT. TARMAC - DAY

           US DEA agents assume custody of the shackled prisoners from 
           the Colombian authorities.  The men in the orange jumpsuits 
           are a somber Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela.

           OVERLAY:  In 1996, extradition was re-signed into law, and in 
           2006 the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers were extradited to the 
           US where they each received 30-year prison sentences.

           EXT. CITY PARK, MEDELLÍN - DAY

           Roberto, in his sixties, sits on a park bench overlooking a 
           small duck pond.  His eyes are sunken, and focus on nothing.

           OVERLAY:  Roberto Escobar surrendered and served the 
           remainder of his sentence in Colombia.  Soon after entering 
           prison, a letter bomb exploded in his cell, blinding him.  He 
           was released in 2004.  He lives in Medellín.

           EXT. BRIDGE TO BOLIVIA - DAY

           Juan Pablo, dressed in a native poncho, crosses the 100 yard 
           bridge linking Colombia and Bolivia.  His mother and sister 
           walk behind him.

           Only sixteen, he looks decades older.  And much like his 
           father.

           OVERLAY:  Pablo’s wife and children fled to Argentina and 
           changed their names.  
           Juan Pablo has since returned to make peace with the sons of 
           Rodrigo Lara Bonilla and Luís Carlos Galán.

           He is married, and works as an architect.

           EXT. NAPOLES, VARIOUS - DAY

           We tour the former glory of the Nápoles estate.  The hacienda 
           is a run-down shell of itself.

           The pool is empty and cracked, windows are broken.  The 
           vintage cars have all been looted, burned, or both.

           OVERLAY:  Billions of Pablo’s fortune are believed to be 
           hidden throughout Colombia to this day.

           Inside, entire rooms have been ripped apart: the walls 
           slashed open, the floors pulled up.  Giant holes have been 
           dug, fruitlessly searching for treasure.

           OVERLAY:  Despite the success of the largest manhunt in 
           modern history, Pablo’s death had no effect on the worldwide 
           price or supply of cocaine.

           EXT. NAPOLES, ROAD - DAY

           Pablo races over his estate on his motocross bike, hair 
           whipping behind him, with all the eagerness and joy of a 
           child.

           The day is perfect, and the world belongs to him.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           THE END
