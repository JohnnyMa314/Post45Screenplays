           FADE IN:

           An emerald sea of buffalo grass shimmering in the breeze...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           The scorched yellow brown of RAVAGED FARM LAND. 

           A lone junker of a car can be seen cutting along a dirt road 
           that splits seemingly endless fields of dry crusted earth. It 
           looks like hell with the fires out. Looming above it all, 
           DARK CLOUDS churn like burlap sacks full of snakes.

           The year is 1935. The great depression.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           EUGENE WOLPINKSY, 30 years old, rugged with a no nonsense 
           attitude, appears tired behind the wheel, having driven 
           through the night. Eugene is a young man who never got a 
           chance to be young -- having sacrificed his youth to look 
           after his kid brother. There’s a loneliness about him. If you 
           were to see him with a crowd of people you’d swear he was 
           alone.

           HENRY WOLPINSKY, 26 years old, romantic and boyish, sits in 
           the passenger seat, staring out the window at all the nothing 
           passing by. Like a radio dial dancing between stations, Henry 
           has the ability to bring good or bad times depending on where 
           he settles. 

           In the backseat, GRAHAM, 35 years old, slouches over, his 
           milky eyes squeezing out the pain in his guts.

                                 EUGENE
                             (to Henry)
                        How’s he doing?

           Henry tosses a glance back at Graham.

                                 HENRY
                        Maybe we oughta pull over.

                                 EUGENE
                        Is that what you want, Graham? You 
                        want to pull over?

           Graham cradles his stomach -- unable to respond.
           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The car pulls to the side of the road.

           Eugene and Henry get out, taking in their surroundings as 
           they cross the road, stretching their legs, having been 
           cooped up for god knows how long.

           They stand beside each other, their backs to the car as they 
           stare out at the yellow heat shimmering above the land.

                                 HENRY
                        I don’t think that doctor was any 
                        good. I think he’s worse off than 
                        before.

                                 EUGENE
                        And?

                                 HENRY
                        I can’t think what we ought to do 
                        about it.

                                 EUGENE
                        Lotta good that thinkin’ did ya.

           Henry takes the insult, digging at the dirt with the point of 
           his shoe as he looks back to the car -- GRAHAM IS GONE.

                                 HENRY
                        Gene...

           Frantic, Henry hurries over to the car, finding a pool of 
           BLOOD soaking into the backseat -- the back door OPEN. 

           His eyes following the trail of blood, Henry spots Graham 
           lugging a small SUITCASE in one hand and a PISTOL in the 
           other as he wanders out into the field. Aimless.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (calling out to him)
                        Graham!

           Wavering, Graham stops -- Henry looking to Eugene as if to 
           say “what do we do?”

           Graham takes an uneasy step forward and then takes it back. 
           Unable to go further, he collapses. 

           Henry runs to him, finding Graham sprawled out, his shirt 
           unbuttoned, a jagged line of crude stitches having burst 
           along his gut.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Awww, hell.

           Eugene arrives as Henry bends over, his hands on wobbly 
           knees.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead. 

           Eugene stares down at Graham, the wind whipping dirt across 
           his blood crusted belly.

           Gathering himself, Henry moves to retrieve the suitcase but 
           is forcefully knocked over by Eugene.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do that for!?!

                                 EUGENE
                             (calm)
                        That’s not ours.

                                 HENRY
                        Christ, Gene! It’s not gonna do him 
                        any good now!

                                 EUGENE
                        It’s not ours.

                                 HENRY
                        Like any of it is?

           Eugene cocks his head, gesturing for Henry to try and take 
           the suitcase again. Daring him. Henry looks from his brother 
           to the suitcase -- debating.

           After a moment, Eugene sets off back to the car. He’s one of 
           those rare men that walks with purpose. Like he’s had a 
           destination in mind all along. 

           Obeying his brother’s order, Henry gets to his feet, walking 
           back to the car when... BLAM! A pistol shot rings out. 

           Ducking in fear, Henry turns back to the body, realizing 
           Graham’s lifeless finger had twitched -- pulling the trigger.

           Managing a smile at the oddness of it all, Henry joins Eugene 
           in the car, which kicks up a cloud of dust as it pulls back 
           onto the road.
           As the brothers push on, Graham’s dead body lies lonesome in 
           the field, his lifeless fingers clutching the suitcase as if 
           expecting someone else to come along and carry him on up to 
           heaven.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MR. PARKER’S STUDY - ST. LOUIS - AFTERNOON

           Cigarette smoke swirls in ribbons of sunlight pouring in from 
           the lone window of the dark study.

                                 MR. PARKER
                        Times are tough. I don’t need to 
                        tell you that.

           MR. PARKER, mid 50’s, fidgets at his desk, eyes red rimmed 
           from liquor and lack of sleep. He wears his Sunday’s best, 
           the knot of a black necktie hanging limp from his throat like 
           a noose waiting to be tightened. 

           Across the desk, sits MR.GWYNNE, late 50’s, a fastidiously 
           dressed hulk of a man who lends a sympathetic ear.

           In the shadows, another man, DEACON, inspects the framed 
           family photographs on the wall, half lit by the shafts of 
           sunlight.

                                 MR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Times like these a man gets weighed 
                        - his principles. I wrestle with 
                        it. The right thing not always 
                        being the right thing - in times 
                        like these. My father taught me 
                        when your name’s out front, you 
                        best not run it through the mud. 
                        And I didn’t. And my son knew the 
                        same. Started him as a teller same 
                        as my father did me - learn the 
                        business, build some backbone for 
                        later on when I could hand the bank 
                        over to him. But these brothers, 
                        these Wolpinsky’s - they don’t know 
                        these things. If I had stock in the 
                        law teaching them the right sort of 
                        lesson, you wouldn’t be here. Not 
                        today of all days. It’s the times. 
                        I wrestle with them. 
                             (thinking it over)
                        I want you to find these boys, 
                        these Wolpinsky’s, and... 
           Mr. Parker looks to Mr. Gwynne, suddenly unsure of himself. 
           With the smallest of gestures, Mr. Gwynne urges him to 
           continue -- 

                                 MR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                             (collecting himself)
                        Doesn’t matter what the times are. 
                        My son is dead and those boys lost 
                        the right to go on living.

           Mr. Parker slides a photograph across the desk, Mr. Gwynne 
           studying it before handing it over his shoulder to Deacon, 
           who emerges from the shadows, revealing himself to be a lanky 
           boy of no more than eighteen years in age. His features are 
           delicate, almost feminine. An invisible scale of his own 
           personal brand of justice teetering behind fierce eyes. The 
           cold sight of him is enough to make a person shiver on a hot 
           summer day. 

           THE PHOTOGRAPH:

           Mr. Parker’s son, ADAM, a sturdy young man, smiling in front 
           of the family run BANK. His whole life ahead of him -- or at 
           least it used to be.

                                 MR. PARKER
                        You will be taking care of this 
                        personally, yes?

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        Me? No. My associate here will be 
                        the lead.

           Mr. Gwynne can see that Mr. Parker is somewhat deflated by 
           this.

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Parker, I’ve been at this for 
                        longer than I care to remember and 
                        I promise you - these boys will get 
                        what’s coming.

           Mr. Parker looks to Deacon who stares back with uncaring 
           eyes.

           INT. MR. PARKER’S LIVING ROOM - ST. LOUIS - CONTINUOUS

           Exiting the study, Mr. Gwynne and Deacon cross through the 
           living room where a WAKE is being held for Mr. Parker’s son. 
           Small clusters of MOURNERS conversing in hushed voices.
           Mr. Gwynne politely nods to MRS. PARKER, early 50’s, as he 
           and Deacon pass through the front door.

           Mrs. Parker turns to her husband standing in the doorway of 
           his study. Her strained eyes ask “what have you done?”

           Unwilling to answer, Mr. Parker retreats back into his study, 
           closing the door behind him.

           EXT. MR. PARKER’S HOUSE - ST. LOUIS - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Gwynne slips on a pair of driving gloves as he and Deacon 
           head for a parked car.

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        Have the photograph?

           Deacon pats his jacket pocket.

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        Good. 

           Mr. Gwynne climbs into the driver’s seat while Deacon remains 
           on the sidewalk. Starting the engine, Mr. Gwynne addresses 
           Deacon through his open window.

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        This is a second chance for you 
                        Deacon and that’s one more than 
                        those boys will get. Understand?

           Deacon nods.

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        Do it proper. By the book. You do 
                        that and you’ll find the next job 
                        waiting for you when you get back. 
                        And remember... no fireworks this 
                        time.

           Mr. Gwynne drives off, leaving Deacon on his own --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - DAY

           BOOM! The sound of an EXPLOSION causes Henry to jolt awake in 
           the passenger seat.

                                 HENRY
                        What’s going on?
                                 EUGENE
                        I don’t know.

           Up ahead, a CLUSTER OF FARMERS, their clothes faded from sun 
           and dust, can be seen standing on the side of the road.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The Wolpinsky’s car pulls off to the side of the road as 
           another EXPLOSION sounds.

           Getting out of the car, the brothers join the farmers.

           Eugene shields his eyes, spotting MONTY, mid 60’s, a lone 
           figure out in the plain, launching compact ROCKETS into the 
           sky.

           Henry leans over to an elderly white whiskered FARMER.

                                 HENRY
                        What’s he doing?

           Another farmer, STANLEY HEYSE, late 40’s, answers him.

                                 STANLEY
                        Says he can bust rain from the 
                        clouds.

           An EXPLOSION cries out from above.

           Eugene observes Monty loading yet another small rocket with 
           sticks of dynamite before launching it. 

           Another EXPLOSION high above.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Hell, he’s no better than an Indian 
                        snake charmer.

           ED, late 40’s, speaks up.

                                 ED
                        I remember him.

                                 STANLEY
                        Right?

                                 ED
                        Said the belly of a snake could 
                        send a message underground for 
                        water.
           The Elderly Farmer waves a dismissive hand as they return to 
           watching Monty with great skepticism.

                                 EUGENE
                        How far’s the next town?

                                 STANLEY
                        Twenty miles. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Thanks.

           Eugene and Henry walk back to their car as Stanley shoots 
           them a glance -- half wondering who they are.

           As the brothers drive off, Monty lights another fuse...

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Letting out a chuckle, Henry looks over his shoulder.

                                 HENRY
                        You believe that? Wonder what he’s 
                        charging.

           Henry looks forward at the flat horizon as they drive along 
           in silence.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Sure is a whole lot of nothing.

           An EXPLOSION can be heard behind them in the distance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SHOE STORE - ST. LOUIS - DAY

           Ignored by the busy foot traffic around him, Deacon studies 
           the CLOSED sign hanging from the door of the shoe store. 

           Moving to the window, he cups his hands, peering in at the 
           dark interior -- there is no one there.

           INT. TENEMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - ST. LOUIS - AFTERNOON

           Deacon walks along the hallway, sorting through a ring of 
           keys as he reaches his apartment door.
           Inserting a key in the lock, his ears perk up -- looking over 
           his shoulder he spots a LITTLE GIRL peaking out from behind 
           the door across the hall.

           Turning, Deacon moves to the cracked door, taking a knee as 
           he fishes around in his pocket -- producing a shiny wrapped 
           piece of CANDY for the Little Girl.

           Too scared to take it, she shuts the door in his face. Now 
           alone in the hall, Deacon unwraps the candy and plops it in 
           his mouth before entering his apartment.

           INT. DEACON’S APARTMENT - ST. LOUIS - LATER

           The room is starkly furnished -- only a lumpy bed, a desk, a 
           chair, and a handful of clothes to let anyone know someone 
           lives here.

           Hunched over his desk, Deacon meticulously cleans a PISTOL.

           The photograph of Mr. Parker’s son has been pinned to the 
           yellow cracked wall in front of him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POOL HALL DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

           Eugene and Henry sit in a booth, both of them sipping coffee 
           as pool balls CLINK on the nearby billiards table. 

           Distracted, Eugene looks out the window at the MOVIE THEATER 
           MARQUEE across the street advertising “PALOOKA”

                                 HENRY
                        How long ‘till we get there?

                                 EUGENE
                        Not long. A few days.

                                 HENRY
                        By the sixteenth?

                                 EUGENE
                        Providing.

                                 HENRY
                        Providing?

                                 EUGENE
                        Providing nothing happens along the 
                        way.
                                 HENRY
                        What could happen?

                                 EUGENE
                        You tell me.

           Henry knows what Eugene is digging at and shamefully looks 
           down at his coffee cup -- wishing it wasn’t empty.

                                 HENRY
                        We staying the night?

                                 EUGENE
                        Sounds right. Get some rest. Shove 
                        off in the morning.

           Henry glances out the window at the marquee across the 
           street.

                                 HENRY
                        I take it you already got plans for 
                        entertainment?

                                 EUGENE
                        Join me if you like.

                                 HENRY
                        Thanks, but no thanks.

           Eugene gets to his feet, fishing coins from his pocket to 
           cover the coffee.

                                 EUGENE
                        Suit yourself. But stay upstairs. 
                        Don’t go walking. 

                                 HENRY
                        Sounds like a scream.

                                 EUGENE
                        I’m serious. Get some rest. Right?

                                 HENRY
                        Right.

           Eugene exits, leaving Henry alone, watching as his brother 
           crosses the street in a hurry, entering the theater across 
           the street.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Cooped up, Henry paces, the floor letting out brief SQUEAKS 
           from his footsteps as he glances out the window -- nothing 
           doing. 

           Spotting something under the bed, he gets on hands and knees 
           to discover a forgotten woman’s STOCKING.

           He flops onto the mattress, dangling the stocking above his 
           face -- taking a breath.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - SAME

           Eugene sits in the near empty theater, the light from the 
           screen washing down over him. 

           The opening credits roll, each actor introduced alongside 
           their character name. None of them mean anything until --
           THELMA TODD is introduced. Eugene can’t help but smile. 
           There’s his girl.

           THE MOVIE SCREEN:

           “THELMA TODD as Trixie”

           Thelma, a beautiful blonde, wears a fur and holds a cigarette 
           as she offers up a smile.

           Reveal Eugene holding a wallet sized promo photograph of 
           THELMA TODD at his side, his thumb absently rubbing its 
           already worn surface.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DUSK

           Henry strolls along the sidewalk, eyeing up everyone and 
           everything to see who and what can hold his attention. It’s 
           the type of farm town where the clocks yawn away the hours 
           and nothing ever happens.

           Henry comes to a halt -- spotting an overweight POLICE 
           OFFICER headed his way on foot.

           Nervous, Henry ducks into a shop entrance --

           INT. WESTERN UNION OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Spying out the window, Henry watches the Police Officer mosey 
           on by outside.
                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Can I help you?

           Turning, Henry takes in where he is. 

                                 HENRY
                        Too late for a telegram?

                                 CLERK
                        Not if it’s fast.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Henry reads over what the Clerk typed, nodding to himself.

                                 HENRY
                        Looks good. How much?

           Henry hands back the telegram --

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - ST. LOUIS - NIGHT

           As if handed to him, Deacon retrieves the TELEGRAM from a 
           small shelf, reading it over.

           THE TELEGRAM:

           GONE TO LOS ANGELES. WAIT FOR ME. I’LL COME BACK FOR YOU 
           SOMEDAY. - HENRY

           Deacon turns to NANCY, early 20’s and her lover TIM, late 
           20’s, who lay naked in bed, clutching the sheets -- so much 
           for waiting.

                                 NANCY
                        I swear, that’s all I’ve heard.

           Deacon taps the telegram against his front two teeth. Giving 
           it a think.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Honest.

                                 TIM
                        She’s got no reason to lie.

           Deacon observes that the sheets have risen up, revealing 
           Tim’s CLUBBED FOOT. Suddenly aware of what he’s looking at, 
           Tim draws his foot back under the sheets, out of sight.
           With that, Deacon tips his hat to the lovers and heads for 
           the door -- but stops, his hand on the knob. Something isn’t 
           sitting right. He looks down at the telegram -- “wait for me”

           He reads the line again... and again. He might be on the way 
           to kill the man who wrote it, but he feels in his bones that 
           it’s only right that this last wish be honored.

           Deacon turns back to the lovers, his eyes a pair of icicles 
           striking fear into their hearts -- 

                                 NANCY
                             (tearing up)
                        Please, what do you want?

           Deacon removes a PISTOL from his jacket, calmly stalking 
           toward the bed -- his mind made up as to what needs to be 
           done. If she can’t remain faithful, then she can wait for 
           Henry on the other side.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Eugene continues to enjoy watching the movie but quickly 
           loses patience with a VAGRANT seated a few rows in front of 
           him who is drunkenly muttering and making himself an all 
           around nuisance.

           Glancing back at the only other patrons, a pair of WOMEN, 
           early 60’s, who also appear bothered, Eugene gets up from his 
           seat, pocketing the picture of Thelma as he approaches the 
           Vagrant -- leaning in to talk to him.

                                 EUGENE
                        Buddy...

           The Vagrant incoherently waves Eugene away, irritated that 
           he’s blocking his view.

           Eugene takes in a breath and then snorts out an exhale, 
           having gotten a hard whiff of piss and booze.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Behave yourself in here or pack it 
                        in.

                                 VAGRANT
                             (distant)
                        I paid... I paid...
           The Vagrant points a grimy finger at Eugene who violently 
           SLAPS it away, getting the Vagrant’s attention.

           Eugene thumbs back at the screen while putting his other hand 
           on the Vagrant’s shoulder.

                                 EUGENE
                        It’s not easy what she does up 
                        there. It’s hard work. Real hard. 
                        Respect it.

                                 VAGRANT
                             (loud)
                        Bitches! To hell with ‘em!

           Eugene makes good on his warning -- viciously PUNCHING the 
           Vagrant in the chest with three short snaps of his fist 
           before returning to his seat as if nothing had happened.

           The Vagrant begins to sob like a child, only able to muster a 
           choked “ow...ow...” as tears flood down into his gaping 
           mouth.

           Eugene attempts to ignore his cries and watch the movie -- 
           but it’s no use. He looks over his shoulder at the two Women 
           who make sure to keep their eyes glued to the screen, not 
           daring to look back at him.

           Facing forward again, Eugene shakes his head in 
           disappointment -- it’s ruined.

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Eugene steps out onto the sidewalk, looking up and down the 
           main drag -- strictly dullsville. If it wasn’t for the movie 
           theater a man in this town would only have his thoughts to 
           entertain him.

           THWAP! The letter “A” from the marquee above falls onto the 
           sidewalk beside Eugene. He looks from the letter back up to 
           the marquee -- that’s strange. He bends to pick up the letter 
           but the wind carries it away, tumbling over itself into the 
           street. 

           Giving chase, Eugene follows the letter, reaching out as a 
           pair of HEADLIGHTS appear in the haze of dust.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        WATCH IT!
           About to be struck by a fast approaching CAR, Eugene leaps to 
           the side, the car swerving around him before continuing on -- 
           that was a close shave.

           Getting to his feet, Eugene wipes the dust from his pant legs 
           -- the fallen letter nowhere to be found.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eugene opens the door to find Henry sharing a flask with 
           Monty, who sits on a small wooden crate of DYNAMITE.

                                 HENRY
                             (drunk)
                        Gene. You’re...this is my brother. 
                        Eugene.

                                 MONTY
                        Monty Nesbit. How do you do?

           Monty holds out the flask as an offering, which Eugene waves 
           off, shutting the door.

                                 HENRY
                        Monty’s who we -

                                 EUGENE
                             (pointing at the crate)
                        What’s that?

           Monty looks down between his legs at the CRATE and knocks on 
           it with his knuckles.

                                 MONTY
                        An opportunity, Eugene. An 
                        opportunity that came knocking and 
                        I answered.

                                 HENRY
                        I was saying - Monty’s who we saw 
                        back a ways. Remember? Cloud 
                        busting. Bursting. But he’s here 
                        now.

                                 EUGENE
                             (pointing to crate again)
                        Is that safe?

                                 HENRY
                        Sure, Gene, he...
                                 EUGENE
                        I asked him.

           Eugene looks from Henry to Monty, waiting for an answer. 
           Monty dramatically leans forward as if to bring Eugene into 
           his confidence.

                                 MONTY
                        That depends... you a cloud?

           Monty bursts out with a hearty LAUGH, shortly followed by 
           Henry.

                                 HENRY
                             (laughing)
                        A Cloud! Because of...yeah. That’s 
                        good.

           Seeing that Eugene isn’t laughing, Monty takes a swig from 
           his flask, clearing his throat.

                                 MONTY
                             (attempting to lighten the 
                              mood)
                        Eugene, you remind me of a sick owl 
                        - you just don’t give a hoot! 
                             (laugh)
                        Your brother tells me you’re on 
                        your way west. California. That you 
                        have a sweetheart there. Thelma, 
                        was it?

           Monty looks to Henry for confirmation -- but Henry looks down 
           at the floor, suddenly sober.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Suppose love is its own kind of 
                        dynamite.

           Monty makes a half attempt at a chuckle before getting to his 
           feet -- having the good sense of knowing when to leave.

                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        I ought to turn in. Waking up 
                        early. Clouds don’t stop moving 
                        just because a man does. Nice to 
                        make your acquaintance Henry. 
                             (shakes Henry’s hand)
                        Eugene.

           Eugene nods and opens the door as Monty picks up his crate 
           with a GRUNT.
                                 MONTY (CONT’D)
                        Much obliged.

           Monty exits, Eugene closing the door behind him.

           Silence.

                                 HENRY
                             (making light)
                        Real nice fella. Generous. Funny 
                        too.

           Eugene picks up the woman’s stocking from the bed, looking at 
           it as if it were a giant question mark.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Guess he got me talking. 
                             (softer)
                        More than I would of liked.

           Not wanting to listen, Eugene lowers the stocking back onto 
           the bed.

                                 EUGENE
                        What don’t we do?

                                 HENRY
                        Gene...

                                 EUGENE
                        We don’t talk about where we’re 
                        going and we sure as hell don’t 
                        mention where we been. 

                                 HENRY
                        He’s not gonna...

                                 EUGENE
                             (cutting him off)
                        I don’t care what he does. I care 
                        about what you do. While we’re on 
                        it, I know you got friends, but we 
                        can’t send word back home. It’s too 
                        risky. Right?

                                 HENRY
                        I wouldn’t do that. 
                             (seeing Eugene still needs 
                              convincing)
                        Honest.

           His blood flowing, Eugene exits to go walk off his nervous 
           energy.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (calling after him)
                        Gene?

           EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

           The glow from the lobby window splashes onto Eugene’s back as 
           he paces the sidewalk.

           The chill of night stabs at him as his thoughts begin to 
           drift...

           INT. SHOE STORE - ST. LOUIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Eugene, wearing a bow tie and clerk apron, flips the sign on 
           the front door to “CLOSED” as he shoots suspicious glances 
           out at the street.

           Meanwhile, Graham sorts through the shoes on the racks with 
           mild amusement.

           It is the same shoe store that Deacon had been peering into 
           in present day.

                                 GRAHAM
                        It’s plain enough you’re in a rut.

                                 EUGENE
                        Most people are.

                                 GRAHAM
                        My heart bleeds for them.

                                 EUGENE
                        Something’s bound to open up.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Yeah, a hole - and you’ll fall 
                        right in it. Come on, there’s 
                        nothing to it. All you gotta do is 
                        show up. Job practically pulls 
                        itself.

                                 EUGENE
                        What do I know about banks?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Nothing. And you don’t need to know 
                        because that happens to be my area 
                        of expertise. 
                                 EUGENE
                        I’m not saying I don’t need the 
                        money.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Then what are you saying?

                                 EUGENE
                        I’m just saying I don’t need it 
                        that bad.

                                 GRAHAM
                        And Henry?

                                 EUGENE
                        I speak for both of us.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I know a bunch of guys that would 
                        jump at something sweet like this.

                                 EUGENE
                        I’m sorry. We can’t.

           Graham lets out a disappointed sigh as he plops his hat on 
           his head and makes for the front door, turning back with one 
           foot on the sidewalk.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You change your mind... the door’s 
                        still open.

           Eugene nods in appreciation before walking over and closing 
           the door behind Graham.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene looks across the street where several MEN part ways 
           with heavy handshakes, all of them walking off in different 
           directions -- all of them headed home.

           With that, Eugene slumps back into the hotel.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DEACON’S APARTMENT - ST. LOUIS - LATE NIGHT

           The high pitch of a BABY CRYING and the low murmur of a 
           couple ARGUING can be heard through the wall while Deacon 
           sits at the desk -- scrutinizing Henry’s telegraph. 

           He eyes the name of the town which it was sent from, 
           searching for it on a map. Locating it, he circles it with a 
           pencil.

           LATER...

           Deacon packs the last of his clothes in a suitcase before 
           turning out the light and leaving his dark apartment behind.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - DAY

           Driving in silence on the same desolate road they’ve been 
           traveling along, Eugene and Henry listen to the faint 
           broadcast of a ball game on the radio.

           Outside, the wind picks up, dragging TUMBLEWEEDS across their 
           path.

           Eugene attempts to steer around them, but there’s too many. 
           CRUNCH...CRUNCH... the car tires begin to CHOMP through them. 

           The sound of the radio becomes garbled and then is swallowed 
           up, causing Henry to fiddle with the knob.

                                 HENRY
                        Come on, now. It was just gettin’ 
                        good.

           EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS

           Soil is swept from the ground, swirling into the sky above as 
           birds let out sharp CRIES of panic.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

                                 HENRY
                        Gene? You seeing this?

           The air outside CRACKLES with electricity, the world around 
           them plunging into darkness.
                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Twister?

                                 EUGENE
                        Can’t be.

                                 HENRY
                        Then what is it?

           Switching on the headlights, Eugene looks in the rear view to 
           see the terrifying sight of a TOWERING MOUNTAIN OF DUST AND 
           DIRT barreling towards them, gaining ground fast as it grows 
           bigger and bigger still.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                             (worried)
                        Gene?

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene jerks the wheel as massive waves of sand and dust wash 
           over the car, dragging it along like a toy.

           The engulfing clouds of dust HOWL and scratch as the car 
           FLIPS OVER, becoming lodged in a ditch, where it is covered 
           by wave upon wave of dust -- buried in the darkness.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - NIGHT

           TWO DOZEN FARMERS sit in the pews of the cramped wooden 
           church.

           At the podium stands MAXWELL BOGGS, early 50’s. A man whose 
           face has not ignored the passage of time, but rather recorded 
           it with deep etched lines of hardship.

                                 MAXWELL
                        This place aint much - but it’s 
                        ours. The softies say it’s too much 
                        because they don’t have the stomach 
                        for hard times. Well they’re gone 
                        and to every man here I say grab a 
                        root and growl.

           Nods of agreement from the Farmers.
                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        Sure, times are tough, the dust is 
                        terrible, the crops are gone. None 
                        of us here don’t know that. Most 
                        everyone is scratching like the 
                        third monkey on Noah’s gang plank 
                        to get by. But we know what we can 
                        do when we get half a chance. 
                             (a beat)
                        It will rain again. If not this 
                        year, then the next. Grab a root 
                        and growl. There’s no making it 
                        simpler. We stay. We beat it. 
                        That’s why I’m calling for this 
                        here group. This club. The Last Man 
                        Club. It’s a promise. A promise to 
                        your fellow man that you’re gonna 
                        stay and see it out. We can beat 
                        this. We can survive. Anyone can 
                        join, all they got to do is stay 
                        put. 
                             (a beat)
                        A man fails only when he packs up 
                        and says he’s had it.

           The Farmers think it over. Sitting among them is FRITZ 
           HASWELL, late 30’s, a German immigrant who planted himself 
           here with his wife after world war one with the belief that 
           he could achieve just about anything if given a fighting 
           chance. Thus far, he’s known nothing but hard times, still 
           waiting for that chance -- that one moment where he can land 
           a punch across the jaw of life before the bell rings.

           LATER...

           The gnarled hands of farmers signing membership cards “LAST 
           MAN NO.1” “LAST MAN NO.2” “LAST MAN NO.3” Etc...

           Maxwell approaches as Fritz slides his membership card into 
           his shirt pocket.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        Fritz. Can we talk?

           Fritz nods as he follows Maxwell to the corner of the church.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        I want to tell you I’m glad to see 
                        you on board. There’s strength in 
                        numbers but all that aside - the 
                        others look up to you. You’re a 
                        good man and I’m not the first to 
                        say it. 
                                 FRITZ
                             (politely ignoring the 
                              compliment)
                        It is a good idea. This club.

           Maxwell looks over at the other Farmers milling about.

                                 MAXWELL
                        We’ve got to make it here. You’re 
                        from Germany but this here is home, 
                        right? When a man decides where his 
                        home is - that’s where he’s got to 
                        leave his mark. For better or 
                        worse. 

           Fritz offers his hand.

                                 FRITZ
                        Agna is waiting.

                                 MAXWELL
                             (shaking hands)
                        Of course. Get on home to her. 
                        We’ll talk soon.

           Fritz exits, glancing back at his fellow Farmers before 
           venturing out into the night --

           INT. HASWELL’S FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

           Fritz enters, quickly shutting the door to keep the whistling 
           wind from sweeping dust inside.

           The cramped farmhouse consists of a common area with a 
           separate room that serves as a bedroom. There is no getting 
           around the bleakness of its appearance. Its occupants appear 
           to be far more resilient than its quaking roof and walls, 
           which provide little protection from the outside elements. 

           INT. HASWELL’S FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz appears in the doorway holding an oil lamp -- casting a 
           dim light onto his sleeping wife AGNA, mid 30’s. Agna is a 
           woman who like Fritz has never had it easy but has somehow 
           managed to not let it harden her. As a girl she had fallen 
           asleep to the bustling sounds of Berlin, and now must 
           collapse exhausted at the end of the day, drifting off to the 
           cackling wind of the plains.

           Glancing down at Agna’s pregnant belly, Fritz retreats back 
           into the living area, taking the glow of light with him.
           INT. HASWELL’S FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz sits at the table, his ‘Last Man Club’ membership card 
           before him... LAST MAN NO.5

           The dust scratches at the walls and roof as Fritz sits deep 
           in thought with the lamp light dimming.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           The road appears desolate in the glare of the morning sun.

           Sand and dirt begin to pour down a small HOLE in the ground 
           that seems to materialize from nowhere. 

           A moment later a hand reaches up out of the hole, feeling for 
           something to grab hold of.

           Bracing himself, Henry pulls himself up out of the hole, 
           which is now revealed to be the open window of the buried 
           car.

           Shielding his eyes, he takes in his surroundings as two 
           suitcases are tossed up from below, followed by Eugene, who 
           climbs out with a pained GRUNT.

           The brothers turn in a quick circle until spotting the hint 
           of a town several miles down the road.

           Nodding to one another, they take hold of their suitcases and 
           head off in the direction of town.

           EXT. TOWN - LATE MORNING

           Another one of those little farm towns where nothing happens 
           but morning, noon, and night.

           Sweaty and caked in dust, Eugene and Henry reach the main 
           drag. A car drives past, dragging a metal sheet, CRACKLING 
           with the sound of static electricity.

           The brothers spot a sign out front of the church -- 

           “LAST MAN CLUB”
           INT. CHURCH - LATE MORNING

           Inside, Eugene and Henry stop short, having walked in on a 
           gathering of WOMEN -- one of whom stands at a table set up in 
           the pulpit, demonstrating dried skim milk for the group. 

           The demonstration interrupted, all the Women turn to stare at 
           the strangers. These women will look old long before they 
           are. That is the sacrifice of living in this corner of the 
           world.

           After a moment, it dawns on Eugene and Henry that they are 
           less than presentable.

                                 EUGENE
                        Sorry to barge in like we have.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, sorry.

                                 EUGENE
                        But we ran into trouble with a 
                        storm outside of town, and well 
                        we’re looking for a place to get 
                        clean and maybe get something to 
                        eat.

                                 HENRY
                             (shaking his suitcase)
                        Our car got buried last night in 
                        the storm.

                                 EUGENE
                        It’s like my brother says, and 
                        well... any help would be 
                        appreciated.

           The women look to one another, among them is Agna Haswell, 
           who studies Henry with special consideration.

           INT. BANK - OFFICE - DAY

           Sitting behind his desk, the BANK MANAGER, late 20’s, waits 
           as Fritz reviews several papers.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        The figure you’re seeing there is 
                        what your land was appraised at.
                                 FRITZ
                             (not understanding)
                        It’s not for sale.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Well, yes, but everyone surrounding 
                        your property is.

                                 FRITZ
                        Is what?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Selling, Mister Haswell. Selling.

                                 FRITZ
                        No, you are. Selling the land out 
                        from under them.

           The Bank Manager shifts in his seat.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        We’re not here to discuss why 
                        they’re selling, but I assure you, 
                        they are.

           Fritz gets to his feet.

                                 BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Mister Haswell, I would consider 
                        what’s being offered here. You 
                        can’t make a living off that land.

           The Bank Manager averts his eyes, knowing he’s offended 
           Fritz, who stares back at him in anger.

                                 BANK MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Think about it. That’s all.

           EXT. BANK - DAY

           Fritz exits the bank, which sits snug in the middle of a 
           handful of rundown establishments. Fritz forcefully slaps his 
           cap onto his head -- who do they think they are in there? 
           What right do they have?

           With that, he tears up the papers in his hand.
           INT. CHURCH - HALLWAY - DAY

           Having been slouched over on a bench, Eugene and Henry snap 
           to attention as the women begin to file out the doors, 
           chatting with one another as they pass.

           Agna appears, spotting Fritz pulling up in his truck outside.

                                 AGNA
                             (to Henry)
                        Wait here.

           Henry nods as Agna exits, the brothers watching as she talks 
           something over with Fritz through the window of the truck.

           She returns, standing before the brothers.

                                 AGNA (CONT’D)
                        We’d be happy to have you.

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - DAY

           Huddled in the bed of Fritz’s truck, Eugene and Henry bury 
           their faces in their coats as the truck makes its way over 
           uncertain terrain to the broken down farmhouse ahead. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POOL HALL DINER - NIGHT

           Deacon sits at the counter in the same pool hall diner that 
           Eugene and Henry had stopped at -- he’s on the right track.

           Sipping from a cup of coffee, Deacon reads about Graham on 
           the front page of the local newspaper -- “BANK ROBBER FOUND 
           DEAD”

           Over in the corner, Stanley plays a lazy game of pool with 
           Ed, both of whom had been watching the rockets on the side of 
           the road.

                                 ED
                        He had sixty hogs that didn’t sell 
                        because they were too thin. So he 
                        spent fifty dollars of feed to bulk 
                        them up and took ‘em back. You know 
                        what he got for ‘em?

           Stanley shrugs.
                                 ED (CONT’D)
                             (a joke)
                        Fifty one dollars.

           A gritty HOWL of wind can be heard outside as two young 
           African American men, VINCENT and CHARLES, enter the diner, 
           blowing into their hands to keep warm.

           Missing his shot, Stanley tosses a blameful glance at Vincent 
           and Charles as they approach the counter.

           Vincent attempts to ask the OWNER, early 50’s, if there is 
           any work to be found in the area.

           Stanley readies himself for another shot but is distracted --

                                 STANLEY
                        You two just get off the train?

                                 VINCENT
                        Yes, sir.

                                 STANLEY
                        Looking for work?

           Vincent cautiously nods as Stanley returns his attention to 
           the billiard table -- CRACK! He takes a violent shot, sinking 
           a ball deep in the corner pocket.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        If I was you, I’d get back on that 
                        train.

           Vincent and Charles remain quiet, not wanting to add fuel to 
           the fire.

           Chalking his cue, Stanley walks around the table, approaching 
           Vincent.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’m being nice when I say that. 
                        Understand? There aint nothin’ here 
                        for you.

           Stanley blows the excess chalk from his cue onto Vincent’s 
           shoulder.

           ... CLINK.

           Over Vincent’s shoulder, Stanley can see Deacon has placed 
           his PISTOL on the counter without taking his eyes from the 
           newspaper article.
           Flashing a glance back at Ed, Stanley steps around Vincent to 
           address Deacon --

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        You want to tell me who that’s for, 
                        kid?

           Deacon continues to read the article, ignoring Stanley.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                             (snickering)
                        Look at it - thing’s bigger then he 
                        is.

           Taking a sip from his coffee, Deacon puts the cup down on the 
           saucer, the sound of which causes Stanley to FLINCH.

           Vincent looks to Charles, signalling for both of them to keep 
           quiet.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        You got spunk kid, I’ll give you 
                        that. Coffee’s on me.

           Stanley slaps a NICKEL on the counter and then turns his 
           back, only to hear the sound of Deacon pushing the nickel 
           onto the floor --

           It seems the whole place holds its breath as the nickel 
           WOBBLES on the floor, as loud as if it were a manhole cover, 
           before finally resting flat.

           Not turning around, Stanley heads for the billiard table, 
           attempting to make light of the situation with Ed --

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                             (to Ed)
                        Fifty one dollars, huh? That’s a 
                        good one.

           Deacon looks at the photo of GRAHAM in the newspaper as the 
           Owner, hesitant, fills his coffee cup.

           EXT. ALLEYWAY - LATER

           Having parked in the alleyway next to the diner, Deacon walks 
           to his car, his coat collar up high and the brim of his cap 
           pulled low.

           The quick SHUFFLE of FOOTSTEPS -- Deacon turns as a BRICK 
           smacks him in the forehead with a hollow CRACK.
           Deacon falls to his knees and then to the ground, his pistol 
           sliding out of his coat into the dirt.

           Dazed, he reaches for it, his fingers crawling along the 
           ground until the heel of a boot comes down like a hammer --
           violently CRUSHING the bone and flesh of Deacon’s hand.

           Letting out a swallowed YELP, Deacon is kicked in the ribs, 
           knocking the wind from him.

           Stanley reaches down and pockets the pistol as Deacon passes 
           out. Glancing up, Stanley spots Vincent and Charles standing 
           at the mouth of the alley -- wanting no part of it, they go 
           on their way in a hurry, leaving Stanley hunched over 
           Deacon’s body.

           ... the wind HOWLS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HASWELL’S BARN - NIGHT

           Thin blankets in hand, Eugene and Henry stand amidst unused 
           farm equipment while Fritz shifts his weight by the door.

                                 FRITZ
                        You can stay here the night and 
                        we’ll see about your car in the 
                        morning. Good. Yes?

                                 EUGENE
                        Sounds good.

           Henry points to an EMACIATED COW standing in the corner of 
           the barn.

                                 HENRY
                        That your cow?

           With the sliver of a polite smile, Eugene nods to Fritz, 
           implying he doesn’t have to answer.

           Fritz opens the barn door, dust and sand visibly whipping 
           about.

                                 FRITZ
                        Good night.

           Holding onto a rope that connects the barn to the house, 
           Fritz begins to inch his way into the night -- without the 
           rope a man would be walking blind and most likely would get 
           lost and suffocate in the dust.
           Taken by the image, Eugene watches Fritz until he is no 
           longer visible, and then forcefully shuts the barn door to 
           find Henry petting the emaciated cow.

                                 HENRY
                        Don’t think I’ve ever been this 
                        cold.

                                 EUGENE
                        It’ll be plenty hot come morning.

                                 HENRY
                        You think he’s a sport?

           Lowering himself to the ground, Eugene attempts to get 
           situated under his blanket.

                                 EUGENE
                        Fritz? Yeah, he’s a sport.

                                 HENRY
                        It was dumb to leave Graham like we 
                        did. They’ll find him like he is.

           Eugene realizes Henry is right, but finds no sense in 
           admitting it --

                                 EUGENE
                        How’s your head?

                                 HENRY
                        Fine, fine. There’s a lump. 
                             (to cow) 
                        How’re you fella? Don’t look too 
                        good.

           Eugene watches as Henry drapes his blanket over the cow. The 
           sight makes him think of something else -- something he’d 
           rather not think about. With that, he pulls the brim of his 
           cap down over his eyes, ready for sleep.

           INT. HASWELL’S FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - SAME

           Fritz enters from outside, shaking the dust from his hair.

           Taking a seat at the table, he spots a photograph poking out 
           from Agna’s worn copy of the BIBLE. He carefully removes it -- 
           THE PHOTOGRAPH:

           A portrait of Agna’s brother, DEDRIC, dressed in a German 
           uniform from World War One. He bares a striking resemblance 
           to Henry.

           Agna enters.

                                 AGNA
                        Are they good? 

           Fritz nods as he slides the photograph back into the bible 
           without Agna seeing.

                                 AGNA (CONT’D)
                        Should we let them stay here? It’s 
                        warmer.

           Fritz gestures as if to say there’s no room.

                                 AGNA (CONT’D)
                        The young one. Seems so innocent. 

           Fritz provides a nod of agreement -- understanding why Agna 
           felt the need to invite the brothers to stay with them.

           Getting to his feet, Fritz plants a tender kiss on her 
           forehead as he gently pats her pregnant belly.

           EXT. HASWELL’S FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Wave after wave of sand and dust wash over the house without 
           mercy...

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                                               FADE IN:

           PRELAP SFX: The GOBBLE of TURKEYS --

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Disoriented, Deacon awakens on a cot, struggling to sit up as 
           he takes in his surroundings -- a cramped farmhouse creaking 
           from loneliness.

           Deacon finds his left hand has been bandaged with a makeshift 
           SPLINT and is sore to the touch. 
           EDITH, mid 40’s, enters through the front door. Edith is a 
           woman who has chosen to play the crummy hand life dealt her 
           rather than fold.

                                 EDITH
                        It’s about time you got up.

           His mind now sharp, Deacon quickly gets to his feet, 
           snatching up his shoes from the floor before storming out the 
           door --

           EXT. EDITH’S TURKEY FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Shielding his eyes from the glare of morning and unable to 
           locate his car, Deacon puts his shoes on and begins to march 
           on foot away from the farm.

           After a ways, Deacon stops in his tracks, looking ahead --
           nothing all the way to the horizon.

           He turns around -- Edith’s turkey farm, a good half mile back 
           down the road. It’s the only destination in sight. It looks 
           like for the moment he’s stuck here.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Deacon appears in the doorway as Edith finishes swatting dust 
           from the cot where he was sleeping.

                                 EDITH
                        You were kicked around good. 
                        Stanley brought you here because 
                        I’m a nurse.

           Edith stands, eyeing her handiwork with the cot.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        At least I used to be.

           Realizing he’s not going anywhere anytime soon, Deacon 
           crosses over to the kitchen area, taking a seat.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        When you start to feel better you 
                        can give me a hand around here. 
                        This isn’t a hotel and there’s 
                        always something doing.

           Deacon raises his bandaged hand -- it’s useless.
                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        You got two, don’t you?

           Having taken hold of a rusted bucket, Edith exits, Deacon 
           watching her through the dust frosted window as she heads for 
           a nearby shed under the blazing sun.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           The tires of Fritz’s truck spin wildly in place as he 
           attempts to tow the Wolpinsky’s car out from where it was 
           buried.

           Clutching shovels, Eugene and Henry dig the wheels of their 
           car out from the sand. With a final rev of the engine, the 
           buried car jerks from its resting place.

           Henry lets out a celebratory HOOT as Fritz gets out to 
           observe the extent of the damage.

           At this, a TRUCK with its bed packed skyward with cheap 
           possessions and a FAMILY packed like sardines in its cab, 
           wheezes by on tired wheels.

           Fritz’s smile from a job well done all but vanishes as he 
           locks eyes with the passing family, who disappear down the 
           road as quickly as they had arrived. Another family that 
           reached its breaking point. Heading west in hope of a better 
           life while Fritz remains.

           For a moment, Fritz, Henry and Eugene stand in brooding 
           silence before getting back to work.

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - DAY

           Henry helps Agna dry wash dishes, handing her a clean one as 
           she nods in thanks, enjoying his company. A few feet away, 
           Eugene sits at the kitchen table with Fritz.

                                 EUGENE
                        I’ve seen storms but nothing like 
                        the other night. Is it always like 
                        this?

                                 FRITZ
                        Now, yes. 
                                 EUGENE
                        It’s got to be tough. Making a go 
                        of it.

                                 FRITZ
                        It was not always this way. There 
                        used to be green. When we first 
                        came here. Not all this... dust.

                                 HENRY
                        What happened?

           Not wishing to discuss it any further, Fritz changes the 
           subject --

                                 FRITZ
                        Where is it you are going?

                                 EUGENE
                        California. Los Angeles.

           Henry shoots Eugene a glance that Eugene catches but pretends 
           not to -- he knows he’s breaking his own rules.

                                 FRITZ
                        Work?

                                 EUGENE
                        Something like that. We got an 
                        uncle out there.

                                 FRITZ
                        Many families have gone west. I 
                        hear it’s very hard. Too many 
                        people. Not enough work.

                                 EUGENE
                        That goes for just about anywhere 
                        these days.

           Even though the comment touches on a sore spot, Fritz allows 
           himself a smile.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        How long do you think your man will 
                        need with our car?

                                 FRITZ
                        A week. Maybe more.

                                 HENRY
                        A week!?!
                                 FRITZ
                        I don’t know. 

                                 HENRY
                        Then why’d you say a week?

           Fritz looks to Henry, who understands that he’s crossed a 
           line.

                                 EUGENE
                        We’re just in a hurry is all. We 
                        need to get there by the sixteenth.

                                 FRITZ
                        The sixteenth?

                                 EUGENE
                             (serious)
                        At the latest.

                                 FRITZ
                        That does not leave much time.

           Eugene nods, suddenly aware that there might be a chance that 
           he won’t make it to California in time. He shakes the notion 
           from his thoughts.

           At this, a TRUCK is heard pulling up in front of the house. 
           Fritz gets to his feet, followed by Eugene, who is anxious as 
           to who the unannounced visitor is --

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz exits the front door, greeting Maxwell as he walks 
           towards him, struggling to keep his hat on in the wind.

                                 MAXWELL
                             (calling out)
                        Good meeting the other night.

           Fritz nods in agreement as they shake hands.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        How are you and Agna making out?

                                 FRITZ
                        Day by day.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Best way I’ve heard it put yet. 
                        When does the baby arrive?
                                 FRITZ
                        Soon.

           Maxwell glances down at the dirt not sure how to address the 
           matter he came to discuss.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        Fritz, well, I came on out here 
                        because I saw you coming from the 
                        bank yesterday.

           Fritz gives Maxwell a look as if to say “tread lightly”.

                                 MAXWELL
                        I just want you to know the Last 
                        Man Club is nothing if we don’t 
                        look out for each other. If they’re 
                        laying it on strong down there let 
                        me know and we can see...

           Maxwell spots Eugene standing in the doorway. At this, Eugene 
           joins them.

                                 EUGENE
                        Morning.

                                 MAXWELL
                             (shaking his hand)
                        Morning.

                                 FRITZ
                        Max, Eugene.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Passing through?

                                 FRITZ
                        They were caught in the storm. 

                                 MAXWELL
                        They?

                                 EUGENE
                        Me and my brother.

                                 FRITZ
                        Their car, it...

           Fritz gestures by waving a dismissive hand in the air.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Anyone hurt?
                                 EUGENE
                        No.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Good. Good. Well, Fritz... I’m on 
                        my way to Alvin’s. Do you mind 
                        riding along?

           Fritz shoots a glance over at Eugene, as if to voice concern 
           about leaving Agna alone with the visitors.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                             (to Eugene)
                        You boys can follow.

           EXT. ROAD / INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - DAY

           Fritz, Eugene, and Henry ride in Fritz’s truck, following 
           Maxwell down the road.

           Henry absently looks out the window at WINDMILLS -- dotted 
           specks on the horizon, each a grave marker for some man’s 
           ambition.

           EXT. ALVIN’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Both trucks park at the sunken boarded up house, which is 
           half buried in sand. 

           The men get out, standing a short distance from the house.

                                 MAXWELL
                             (calling out)
                        Alvin?

           No one appears to be home. At this, the gurgling COUGH of a 
           truck can be heard nearby.

           The men see a truck burdened with the weight of a family’s 
           possessions driving off away from them --

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        SON OF A BITCH!

           Maxwell runs several paces in the direction of the truck and 
           then kicks at the sand, bringing up a plume of dust.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                             (yelling after the truck)
                        GOD DAMN YOU! YOU SIGNED AN OATH! 
           Eugene and Henry stand quietly by the car as Fritz approaches 
           Maxwell, watching as the truck disappears from view, headed 
           west.

                                 FRITZ
                        Let him go.

                                 MAXWELL
                        The shoe pinches us in the same 
                        place it pinches him - but we stay! 
                        We endure.

           Fritz nods more in acknowledgement than agreement as Maxwell 
           reaches down at his feet to pick up a rock -- pointlessly 
           hurling it in the direction the truck had gone.

           Fritz turns and heads for the house, opening the front door 
           with a jerk of strength.

                                 HENRY
                             (to Eugene)
                        Why’s he miffed? Looks like the guy 
                        got out while the getting was good.

           Eugene gestures for Henry to keep quiet as Henry observes 
           both Fritz and Maxwell have their backs to them -- and their 
           trucks.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Gene...

           Henry thumbs in the direction of the trucks, keeping his 
           voice low.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        Guy might of had the right idea. We 
                        can get out while the getting’s 
                        good.

           Eugene considers what Henry is suggesting as he looks to 
           Fritz and Maxwell. It would be so easy. Him and Henry could 
           be back on the road in a flash.

                                 EUGENE
                        No. It’s no good.

                                 HENRY
                        What do you mean? 

                                 EUGENE
                        These people can’t afford to lose a 
                        truck. We weren’t taken in to make 
                        things harder for them.
                                 HENRY
                        What about Thelma?

           Eugene considers this.

                                 EUGENE
                        We still have time. Besides, the 
                        money’s back at the barn.

                                 HENRY
                        Right. Hadn’t thought of that.

           Standing between the two parked trucks, Eugene and Henry wait 
           in silence, fighting temptation.

           Fritz enters the dark dust covered home, eyeing the few 
           possessions that have been left behind, including a homemade 
           wooden CRIB.

           His gaze wanders up to where Alvin’s LAST MAN CLUB MEMBERSHIP 
           CARD has been nailed to the wall. 

           Next to it, a scrawled message... 

           I’m Sorry.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - DAY

           Agna sits at the table, writing in her diary...

                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        Dust again. 

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - DAY

           Dust piling up, burying machinery, drifting around sun 
           bleached corners...

                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        I try to remember a time before 
                        this and with each year the future 
                        seems to promise less of the life 
                        we thought possible. 
           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - DAY

           Dust already gathering on the recently cleaned dishes...

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Agna removes dust covered sheets from the window, replacing 
           them with clean ones...

                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        The fruits of our labor nowhere to 
                        be found and yet we no longer say 
                        “if we stay”. 

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - DAY

           Big brown CRICKETS digging underground shelters...

           Dripping with sweat, Fritz and Eugene attempt to untangle 
           tumble weeds from the fence that borders the property. 

           Henry can be seen strolling along in the distance, 
           approaching an inactive WINDMILL.

                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        We are here and we will see our 
                        responsibility through, even if we 
                        are destined to fail. 

           Henry approaches the towering windmill, shielding his eyes as 
           rays of sunlight slice through the silhouetted turbine. After 
           a moment, he spots something in the dirt. Dusting it off, he 
           finds it be a stone ARROWHEAD.

           Smiling at his treasure, Henry suddenly rubs his forehead, 
           having been struck with a searing HEADACHE.

           EXT. EDITH’S TURKEY FARM / INT. TURKEY COOP - DUSK

           Edith runs back and forth, shepherding a cluster of TURKEYS 
           into a coop. Deacon making a half hearted attempt to help.

           Once the turkeys are inside, Edith spills out a bucket of 
           CENTIPEDES for them to eat.
                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        Last night I had a dream that it 
                        was raining and when I awoke I 
                        thought I could still hear that 
                        wonderful sound. But it was only 
                        the dust.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Deacon, awake on his cot, unable to sleep as a strange 
           CLAWING emits from the walls.

           He rolls over on his side, holding the pillow against his ear 
           to quiet the noise.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - DUSK

           FLIES dance in a frenzy around the eyes of the SICKLY COW.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - DUSK

           The COW’S EYE dissolves into Agna’s PREGNANT BELLY as she 
           gently rocks in a rocking chair next to the crib from Alvin’s 
           house that Fritz had brought home with him.

                                 AGNA (V.O.)
                        Dust sweeps away everything... even 
                        dreams.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. MR. PARKER’S STUDY - ST. LOUIS - DAY

           Once again, Mr. Parker is found fidgeting behind his desk 
           while Mr. Gwynne sits calmly before him.

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        What is it that you want, Mr. 
                        Parker?

                                 MR. PARKER
                             (frustrated)
                        I want to know what’s taking so 
                        damn long. 

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        Quite, frankly?
                                 MR. PARKER
                        Yes?

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        It hasn’t been long at all.

                                 MR. PARKER
                        So, you say. But it’s my money and 
                        I deserve an update.

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        Your money is still yours. Payment 
                        is expected upon delivery. Payment 
                        of a lump sum that was agreed upon 
                        in this very room.

                                 MR. PARKER
                             (impatient)
                        I know that.

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                             (calm)
                        Then what’s all this talk of money? 
                        If my man takes a day or a week it 
                        costs you the same. 

           Mr. Parker sits back in his chair, eyeing a framed photograph 
           of his dead son. He knows Mr. Gwynne is right but that 
           doesn’t mean he has to like it.

                                 MR. PARKER
                        Your man, Deacon was it? Seemed 
                        more like a boy than a man when he 
                        was here. 

           Pausing, Mr. Parker waits for a reaction.

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        And?

                                 MR. PARKER
                        And I’ve got to say I’ve little 
                        faith he can follow through on what 
                        you’ve promised. 

           Mr. Gwynne finds it necessary to address this challenge of 
           his judgement in order to ease Mr. Parker’s concerns --

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        One night. This was years ago. When 
                        you could say Deacon was indeed 
                        still a boy. He woke to hear his 
                        mother come home with a man. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        This wasn’t out of the ordinary 
                        mind you. She had a reputation and 
                        it wasn’t as a nun.
                             (a beat)
                        Like I said. This night was no 
                        different than so many others. Yet 
                        it was. Listening to them, Deacon 
                        slipped out of bed. Got himself a 
                        knife... 
                             (remembering)
                        His mother had had her share to 
                        drink and so she didn’t think much 
                        of it when the man fell at her 
                        side. That’s what they did anyway 
                        when they were finished. Fall to 
                        her side and nod off. But this man 
                        wasn’t ever going to wake up. And 
                        neither was she.

           Having hung on to every word, Mr. Parker is suddenly 
           horrified at the suggested turn in the story -- 

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        Rather than use the knife, Deacon 
                        wrapped his hands, the hands of a 
                        boy, around his mother’s throat. 

           Mr. Gwynne holds up his own wrinkled and veiny hands to 
           illustrate.

                                 MR. GWYNNE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know the will it takes to 
                        strangle a person, Mr. Parker? Very 
                        few men can stomach it. Let alone a 
                        boy. It’s not quick. Not by a long 
                        shot.
                             (a beat)
                        The next morning I found the man 
                        bled out on the floor. And there, 
                        on the bed, Deacon, asleep beside 
                        his mother’s body. It had taken 
                        everything in him to finish the 
                        task. His hands, bruised and near 
                        useless from having held on for so 
                        long. A boy his age? Who knows how 
                        long it took. Hours. But he’d 
                        finished what he set out to do.
                             (a beat)
                        Since that night, wherever Deacon 
                        goes - death follows. These 
                        brothers that killed your son? 
                        Eugene. Henry. They’re on borrowed 
                        time, Mr. Parker. And I assure you, 
                        the clock is ticking.
           Getting to his feet, Mr. Gwynne takes hold of his hat and 
           jacket before heading for the door.

           Meanwhile, Mr. Parker lingers on a detail from the story. A 
           pebble in the shoe of his thoughts --

                                 MR. PARKER
                        You said you found him?

           Mr. Gwynne nods.

                                 MR. PARKER (CONT’D)
                        Why were you there?

                                 MR. GWYNNE
                        Deacon’s mother.
                             (a beat)
                        She was my sister.

           Dumbstruck, Mr. Parker stares up at Mr. Gwynne who towers 
           over him. 

           Tipping his hat, Mr. Gwynne exits, leaving Mr. Parker to 
           wrestle with his conscience -- what devils have I turned 
           loose upon the world?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Having finished dinner, Edith and Deacon sit at the table.

                                 EDITH
                        If the price for Turkeys wasn’t 
                        what it was, they wouldn’t be worth 
                        the work. Dumbest creatures I’ve 
                        ever known. Always killing 
                        themselves in some stupid way or 
                        another. You got to get them out in 
                        the morning after the coyotes go 
                        away and then get ‘em back in at 
                        night before they come back. I 
                        didn’t always do this though. Used 
                        to live in Chicago but I’ve got 
                        asthma and a doctor told me the 
                        open air would do me good - ha!

           Seeing that her joke has gone unnoticed, Edith gets to her 
           feet, taking hold of the plates.
                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor and see if the cake 
                        is done.

           Deacon stands, first attempting to open the oven with his 
           bandaged hand and then with his good one, unsure of what to 
           do next.

           Edith begins to dry scrub the plates, throwing directions 
           over her shoulder.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        The knife there - stick it in the 
                        middle and see if it comes out 
                        clean.

           Deacon spots a KNIFE sticking out from a wooden brick. Taking 
           hold of it he finds the blade to be quite sharp. Deadly.

           Deacon turns to see Edith has her back to him. He could kill 
           her right here and now and be the only one alive for miles. 
           He’s just a swing of the knife away from being alone with his 
           thoughts. But why kill her? She hasn’t done anything -- not 
           yet anyway.

           With that, Deacon slides the knife into the cake, slowly 
           drawing it out.

           Edith turns -- seeing the knife is clean.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Looks done to me.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - LATER

           Deacon sits on the edge of his cot, Edith inspecting his 
           splint -- tracing the deep purple and green bruises that run 
           along the skin.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Not great, but better. Next time 
                        you pass a hospital you can stop to 
                        get a proper splint.

           Deacon eyes the walls, a SCRATCHING noise sounding from 
           behind them.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Centipedes.

           Deacon looks to her for clarification.
                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                             (readjusting the splint)
                        Centipedes. Spiders. Whatever else. 
                        The dust gets them in the walls. 
                        You get used to it. I steam them 
                        out with the iron and use them for 
                        feed. So they’ve got their purpose, 
                        like everything else. How’s that?

           Deacon lifts his hand, turns it in the air and then nods.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Can I be honest with you, kid?

           Deacon looks at Edith, unsure.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna drive me nuts if you 
                        don’t stop talking.

           Deacon allows himself a faint smile.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HASWELL BARN - DUSK

           Eugene and Henry lay on opposite sides of the barn, wrapped 
           in their thin blankets, a lantern between them.

                                 HENRY
                        How’d you say you’d pay for the 
                        car?

                                 EUGENE
                        I told him it’s what we saved for 
                        California.

                                 HENRY
                        Good thinking. 
                             (a beat)
                        Gene? 

                                 EUGENE
                        Hmmm?

                                 HENRY
                        What do you think Thelma is gonna 
                        say when we get there?

                                 EUGENE
                        What’s she going to say? 
                                 HENRY
                        When we get there.

                                 EUGENE
                             (thinking it over)
                        Guess we’ll see.

                                 HENRY
                        I didn’t ask before because I know 
                        how you get - but, why you so sure 
                        something bad is gonna happen to 
                        her? She’s a movie star. She’s got 
                        it made.

           Suddenly serious, Eugene is reminded of his mission --

                                 EUGENE
                        I just know.

                                 HENRY
                        But how?

                                 EUGENE
                        I just do, all right?

                                 HENRY
                        I was only asking.

                                 EUGENE
                        Awwww, Christ!

           Eugene gets to his feet, starting to pace.

                                 HENRY
                        Gene?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, what is it?

                                 HENRY
                        You mad at me?

                                 EUGENE
                        No, I aint mad at ya.

                                 HENRY
                        I know this aint how you planned 
                        it. How you wanted it to go...
                             (a beat)
                        Back at the bank. I...

                                 EUGENE
                        Don’t think about it. 
                                 HENRY
                        I can’t help it.

                                 EUGENE
                        We get to California and you forget 
                        all about it. We’ll be sitting on a 
                        mountain of vanilla ice cream 
                        before you know it.

                                 HENRY
                        You might - but what about me? What 
                        am I supposed to do out there?

           Eugene stops pacing. Surprised at the question --

                                 EUGENE
                        What do you mean what are you 
                        supposed to do?

                                 HENRY
                        You’ll have Thelma. What will I 
                        have? Nancy’s back home.

                                 EUGENE
                        Nancy?

                                 HENRY
                        I miss her.

                                 EUGENE
                        Believe me, I wouldn’t worry about 
                        her bed getting cold without you.

                                 HENRY
                        Take it back.

                                 EUGENE
                        You can’t go home brother. Not 
                        ever.

                                 HENRY
                             (getting to his feet)
                        Take it back.

           Eugene can see Henry’s anger rising to the surface.

                                 EUGENE
                        We get to California and you can 
                        throw a rock and hit another Nancy. 
                        Ten of her.

           Henry rushes forward, SLAMMING Eugene against the wall, his 
           arm pressed against Eugene’s throat.
                                 HENRY
                             (furious)
                        TAKE IT BACK!

           As Henry’s arms cuts off his air, Eugene can see Henry’s eyes 
           are filled with murderous rage -- purple red veins throbbing 
           along his forehead. 

           The two brothers struggle within the violent embrace until 
           Henry releases Eugene, backing away dizzy, his hand massaging 
           his forehead.

                                 EUGENE
                             (catching his breath)
                        You all right?

                                 HENRY
                        My head. It got banged in the car. 
                        Hasn’t been feeling too good.

           Henry’s headache passes, but he keeps his eyes closed.

                                 EUGENE
                        I’m sorry for what I said.

           Silence.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        I liked Thelma in that one... 
                        Duck... what was it?

                                 EUGENE
                        Soup. Duck Soup.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, that’s the one. She was aces 
                        in that, Gene.

                                 EUGENE
                        She was, wasn’t she?

                                 HENRY
                        She sure was. 
                             (still dizzy)
                        I’m tired.

           Eugene helps Henry to the floor, covering him with a blanket.
                                 EUGENE
                        Everything is going to be fine once 
                        we get to California.

                                 HENRY
                             (half asleep)
                        I know.

                                 EUGENE
                        We’ll start over. You’ll see.

           Henry nods.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Get some sleep.

           Eugene plants a brotherly kiss in Henry’s hair before 
           returning to his side of the barn, lowering himself back down 
           to the ground.

           His hand moves up to his throat, feeling it already bruising. 

           Eugene studies Henry -- peaceful in his sleep despite having 
           been crazed a moment before. 

           With that, Eugene extinguishes the lamp.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EDITH’S TURKEY FARM - DUSK

           Having chased the last of the turkeys into the coop, Deacon 
           closes the door, bringing down the latch.

           Peering in, Deacon observes the turkeys as they make putting 
           sounds and ruffle their feathers -- something has them 
           spooked.

           Turning, Deacon spots a lone COYOTE, about ten paces off, its 
           yellow eyes trained on him.

           Deacon stares back at the ill fed coyote, its ribs visible 
           beneath patches of thin fur. If it doesn’t get food soon, it 
           will most likely succumb to the elements.

           The putting sounds of the Turkeys becomes louder and more 
           frantic - PUTT PUTT! PUTT PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! 

           Neither Deacon nor the coyote avert their gaze as they 
           silently wait for what comes next -- the wind kicking up dust 
           as night descends upon them.
           The Coyote looks from Deacon to the turkey coop and then back 
           to Deacon, its dry tongue slinking out from starvation. 

           PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT! PUTT!

           Deacon breaks the tension by taking a small step forward, at 
           which point the Coyote turns and retreats into the night. 

           No longer sensing danger, the Turkeys quiet down as Deacon 
           reaches out and jiggles the latch, making sure it’s secure 
           before making his way back to the house.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Deacon on his cot awake, listening to Edith having a COUGHING 
           FIT in her bedroom due to asthma. Expressionless, Deacon 
           stares up at the ceiling as the COUGHING becomes louder and 
           more violent.

           Getting out of bed, he enters the kitchen area, his eyes 
           drawn to the knife resting in its wooded block.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Her chest raw from coughing, Edith spots the shadow of Deacon 
           standing in the doorway. She can see that he is holding 
           something in his hand -- but what is it?

                                 EDITH
                        What do you want? 
                             (cough)
                        Get out.

           Deacon takes a heavy step into the room.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                             (concerned)
                        Leave.

           In silhouette, Deacon approaches her bedside, his hand coming 
           into view. He’s gripping -- a TIN CUP OF WATER.

           Still coughing, Edith looks from the cup to Deacon’s face, 
           hidden in darkness. She nods in thanks before taking the cup 
           and managing a sip.

           Edith doesn’t know if it was an act of kindness on Deacon’s 
           part or an effort to quiet her down. Either way it doesn’t 
           matter. She’s grateful. 
           A lonesome coyote can be heard CRYING OUT somewhere far off 
           in the night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHURCH - MORNING

           A sign posted outside the church reads as follows:

           “RABBIT ROUND UP- DUE TO THE RISE IN RABBIT POPULATION THERE 
           WILL BE A ROUND UP THIS SATURDAY ON MAXWELL BOGGS’ PROPERTY 
           (WEATHER PERMITTING)”

           EXT. FIELD - MORNING

           A temporary fence has been erected, creating a large 
           enclosure where hundreds upon hundreds of RABBITS sit 
           patiently.

           Maxwell glad hands MEN as they arrive in their trucks.

           CHILDREN squeal in delight as they chase one another, some 
           standing on tip toe to look over the fence to see the 
           rabbits. The men, including Fritz, Eugene and Henry, gather 
           together while WOODEN CLUBS are handed out.

           As the men enter the fenced in area, the rabbits gather in 
           fear, backing themselves into the far corner of the 
           enclosure.

           There is neither joy nor sadness in the faces of the men -- 
           it is merely a task that needs doing.

           The tightly gripped clubs begin to STRIKE the heads of 
           rabbits, as yet more rabbits dart every which way, frantic 
           for a way out.

           Henry raises his club but is unable to bring it down on the 
           rabbit before him -- its whiskers. Its soft fur.

           He looks to the men around him who go about their business, 
           their clubs rising and falling.

           A CHILD that was previously seen laughing, now climbs into 
           his mother’s arms, crying, clutching his ears so as not to 
           hear the rabbits SCREAM.
           Wiping the sweat from his brow, Eugene looks to Henry, who 
           appears lost. Spotting his brother, Henry offers up an 
           unconvincing smile...

                                                          FLASH CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - ST. LOUIS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           Breathing heavily, Henry grins, plaster from the ceiling 
           snowing down on him.

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Shaking the vision of his brother, Eugene averts his gaze, 
           returning to his task.

           Cornering a rabbit, Fritz brings down his club with a loud 
           THUMP.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. FIELD - AFTERNOON

           As the sun sets and the wind picks up, men head for their 
           trucks on tired legs.

           Maxwell approaches Fritz, who is standing beside his truck.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Good turn out.

           Fritz nods as they both watch the fence be taken down.

                                 MAXWELL (CONT’D)
                        We needed this. Every man here will 
                        go home knowing he did something. 
                        It’s important. Keeps ‘em from 
                        running off like Alvin.

           A POLICE CAR pulls up. An UNIFORMED OFFICER, late 30’s, gets 
           out with a grunt and walks over to Maxwell and Fritz.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Missed the show.

                                 OFFICER
                        Another time. Fritz.
           The Officer shakes hands with both Fritz and Maxwell.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Putting the word out about a pair 
                        of bank robbers.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Last I checked it was the banks 
                        doing the robbing.

                                 OFFICER
                             (ignoring the comment)
                        You seen anyone come through these 
                        parts? Brothers?

           From a distance, Eugene spots Fritz and Maxwell talking with 
           the man -- recognizing him for what he is -- A POLICE 
           OFFICER. After a last exchange, the Officer tips his hat and 
           returns to his car, driving off as Fritz spots Eugene and 
           Henry walking towards him.

           Maxwell eyes the brothers, putting it together for himself as 
           he turns to Fritz.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Let me know if you need anything.

           Fritz and Maxwell shake hands, neither sure they understand 
           each other as Maxwell walks away.

           Eugene and Henry arrive --

                                 FRITZ
                        Ready?

           Eugene nods, glancing off at the trail of dust following the 
           police car -- what did Fritz tell him?

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

           Fritz sits at the kitchen table across from Eugene, who 
           absently flips through the worn BIBLE.

           Agna sits in the rocking chair, busy knitting a pair of 
           SOCKS.

           Like a boy, Henry sits on the floor, fiddling with the knobs 
           of the RADIO, unable to get anything but static.
                                 FRITZ
                        It doesn’t work most the time.
                             (gesturing to the air)
                        The static.

                                 HENRY
                        You must get bored stiff out here 
                        without radio.

                                 AGNA
                        My brother loved radio. Always 
                        listening.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh yeah? Where’s he now?

                                 FRITZ
                        Dead.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh.

                                 AGNA
                        The war.

                                 FRITZ
                        But we start new here.

                                 AGNA
                        Yes, we make rule that we don’t 
                        speak German so the little one 
                        grows up American. Yes?

           Fritz nods.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s something. Family’s 
                        important. I don’t know what I’d do 
                        without Gene here. We’re all we’ve 
                        got since our folks passed. Ain’t 
                        that right, Gene?

           Eugene allows enough of a smile to qualify as a response.

                                 FRITZ
                        No family?

                                 HENRY
                        Nope.

                                 FRITZ
                        What about your uncle?
                                 HENRY
                        Uncle?

                                 FRITZ
                        In California?

           Unsure of what to say, Henry looks to Eugene, who pipes in 
           without looking up from the bible.

                                 EUGENE
                        Uncle Frank. He’s not really an 
                        uncle - but that’s what we called 
                        him as kids.

                                 HENRY
                        Right, uncle Frank.

                                 FRITZ
                             (almost disappointed)
                        I see.

           Eugene’s eyes drift up to Fritz.

                                 EUGENE
                        Something on your mind, Fritz?

                                 FRITZ
                             (covering his tracks)
                        No, just making talk.

                                 HENRY
                        We appreciate you putting us up 
                        like this. Hope we haven’t been any 
                        trouble.

                                 AGNA
                        No, no trouble. 
                             (to Fritz) 
                        Yes?

           Fritz nods in agreement, something passing unspoken between 
           him and Eugene -- an understanding.

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes. No trouble.

           Eugene resumes thumbing through the bible.

           INT. MAXWELL BOGGS’ FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT

           Similar in layout to the Haswell farmhouse, BETH, 50’s, goes 
           about skinning a RABBIT from the roundup earlier that day.
           Maxwell, mulling over what he should do, stands at the 
           window, his back to Beth as he stares out at the night. 

                                 MAXWELL
                        Did Fritz seem off to you?

                                 BETH
                        Off?

           Having scooped out the guts of the rabbit, Beth now reaches 
           into the carcass, plucking out the HEART.

                                 MAXWELL
                        Different. Did he seem nervous?

                                 BETH
                        He’s always been quiet.

           Maxwell produces a GRUNT of agreement but it still nags at 
           him. Was Fritz trying to signal him? No. He didn’t seem like 
           he was in danger -- but who knows?

                                 BETH (CONT’D)
                        Who were those boys with him today?

           Deciding that Fritz must know what he’s doing --

                                 MAXWELL
                        ... no one.

           Getting a firm grip on the rabbit’s dust clumped fur, Beth 
           tugs it loose from the carcass, revealing the tender grey 
           pink flesh beneath.

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Fritz awake in bed beside Agna, mulling it all over in his 
           head...

           INT. HASWELL BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene awake on the ground mulling it all over in his head...

           He tosses a glance over at Henry who is sound asleep.

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz exits the house, taking hold of the length of rope that 
           leads to the barn, inching his way into the dust filled 
           darkness.
           Meanwhile, at the barn, Eugene cracks open the door, slipping 
           into the night, inching forward at the opposite end of the 
           rope.

           Both men blindly inch towards one another, the dust filled 
           wind whipping around them.

           Closer and closer still....

           ... until finally, both men reach out, surprised to grab hold 
           of each other’s arms instead of the rope.

           Unable to see in the thickness of the dust storm, they push 
           wildly, fighting an invisible opponent until they let go of 
           the rope, both of them rolling off, no longer anchored --

           Shielding his eyes from the skin biting dust, Eugene 
           struggles to get his bearings.

                                 EUGENE
                             (shouting above the wind)
                        Fritz!?!

           Fritz crawls along the ground, not having heard Eugene above 
           the HOWL of the wind as he desperately reaches out, trying to 
           find the rope.

           Eugene wanders forward, waving his arms through the air, 
           frantic.

                                 EUGENE
                        Fritz!?!

                                 FRITZ
                        Eugene!?!

                                 EUGENE
                        Where are you!?!

           Fritz continues to crawl in what he hopes is the right 
           direction as Eugene spits out dust that has begun to collect 
           in his mouth.

                                 FRITZ
                        Eugene!?!

                                 EUGENE
                        I can’t see you!

           Fritz gets to his knees, shuffling forward with his arm 
           outstretched until blindly locating the rope -- clinging to 
           it for dear life.
                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Fritz!?!

           Wrapping the rope around his arm, Fritz hesitates to answer. 
           By remaining silent he could let Eugene wander off and die.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Where are you!?!

           Eugene’s life in his hands, Fritz continues to think it over 
           before deciding --

                                 FRITZ
                        HERE!!!

                                 EUGENE
                             (relieved)
                        Where!?!

                                 FRITZ
                        Here! Here! Here!

           Unsure of what more to say, Fritz begins to talk sing an old 
           German folk song.

           Eugene stumbles through the dark attempting to follow the 
           singing, barely audible above the wind.

                                 EUGENE
                        Fritz!?!

           His voice strained, Fritz reaches out as Eugene arrives, 
           guiding his hand to the rope.

                                 FRITZ
                        I got you! I got you!

                                 EUGENE
                        Fritz!?!

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes!?!

                                 EUGENE
                        You can’t sing worth a lick!

           Both men let out a hearty LAUGH as they cling to the rope in 
           darkness.
           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - LATER

           Laughing, Fritz and Eugene sit at the kitchen table, a lit 
           lantern between them.

           Both men clear their throats, neither wanting to be the first 
           to address the reason they ventured out in the middle of the 
           night.

                                 FRITZ
                        What did you do Eugene? Back home.

                                 EUGENE
                        As a job?

           Fritz nods.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        I sold shoes.

                                 FRITZ
                        Shoes?

                                 EUGENE
                        People always need shoes. Good 
                        times and bad.

                                 FRITZ
                        A salesman.

                                 EUGENE
                        Until a week ago.

           Silence.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Today, was that bull looking for 
                        us? Me and my brother?

           Reluctant, Fritz nods.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        He tell you why?

           Fritz nods as Eugene lets out a long exhale.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to tell you something, 
                        Fritz. Because it’s eating me up 
                        that no one knows the full reasons 
                        why - not even my brother.
           Fritz urges him to continue as Eugene thinks of where to 
           begin...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TIVOLI MOVIE THEATER - ST. LOUIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Shuffling forward, Eugene, his small promo photograph of 
           Thelma in hand, stands in line to buy a ticket for the show -- 
           the marquee advertizing PALOOKA.

           INT. TIVOLI MOVIE THEATER - ST. LOUIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Settled in his seat amidst the crowd, Eugene watches the 
           screen as THELMA TODD is introduced in the opening sequence.

           A MAN, early 30’s, BURSTS through the doors in the rear of 
           the theater, screaming bloody murder as he runs down the 
           aisle -- his PURSUER hot on his heels, wielding a PISTOL.

           Lunging for the exit beside the screen, the Man is SHOT in 
           the back, causing him to stumble over to the screen, his 
           hands awkwardly grasping at his back as BLOOD spills from the 
           bullet hole in his jacket.

           The theater turns into a FRENZY of frightened patrons as the 
           pursuer takes aim again, looking to finish the job...

           ON THE THEATER SCREEN:

           Palooka, a heavyweight fighter at a night club, throws a joke 
           punch at Thelma Todd, who pretends to be hit, throwing her 
           head back, causing the others at the table to LAUGH.

                                 PALOOKA
                             (comical)
                        Oh, geeze babe - did I hurt ya?

                                 THELMA TODD
                        oh no, do it again... I love it!

           BLAM! A crimson smear of blood and hair splatters across 
           Thelma’s black & white face on the screen as she leans in to 
           kiss Palooka.

           Not having moved from his seat, Eugene watches as the dead 
           Man’s body slinks to the floor. His eyes drift down to the 
           armrest of his chair -- the aisle number reading 16. The 
           number sears itself into his brain. He’s confident that it 
           has a meaning.
           A police WHISTLE sounds.

           Eugene’s eyes...

                           ...Thelma’s eyes veiled with blood.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz leans back in his chair, having been handed the photo 
           of Thelma Todd during Eugene’s story.

                                 FRITZ
                        This woman...

                                 EUGENE
                        Thelma.

                                 FRITZ
                        This Thelma, she’s?

                                 EUGENE
                        Something awful is going to happen. 
                        What I saw... that sort of thing 
                        doesn’t happen but for a reason. 
                        She’s in danger.

                                 FRITZ
                        You believe...

           Fritz answers his own question.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        I see.

                                 EUGENE
                        Something’s going to happen to her 
                        on the sixteenth. 

                                 FRITZ
                        Why that day?

                                 EUGENE
                             (knowing how it sounds)
                        I was sitting in the sixteenth row. 
                             (sensing Fritz’s 
                              skepticism)
                        It had meaning. If you were there 
                        you’d know the same.
                                 FRITZ
                        And this bank?

                                 EUGENE
                        We weren’t going to get to 
                        California selling shoes.

           Fritz itches his ear as he thinks it over.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        My brother and I don’t mean you any 
                        harm. I’ve never hurt a person in 
                        my life, that’s the truth, and I’ve 
                        no reason to start. 
                             (a beat)
                        It’s a hard thing being a good man. 
                        I know you know what I mean when I 
                        say that. The world, the way it is, 
                        just about begs us to be anything 
                        else... but we try. Try to be 
                        noble. To be righteous. To be good.

           These words hit home for Fritz as Eugene continues to speak 
           from his heart --

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        when a man lights a match he is 
                        never more aware of the darkness 
                        that surrounds him.
                             (a beat)
                        And to be a good man, to stay out 
                        of the darkness, he can’t let that 
                        light, that goodness, burn out. If 
                        he does, he’s lost, like I was out 
                        there tonight. That’s why I’ve done 
                        everything I’ve done... Because, 
                        Thelma...
                             (a beat)
                        ... She’s my light. 

           Glancing back down at the photo of Thelma with new found 
           appreciation, Fritz hands it back to Eugene. 

           Nothing left to say, Eugene rises sluggishly to his feet, 
           walking to the front door -- leaving Fritz to decide his 
           fate.

                                 FRITZ
                        The police. They don’t know you’re 
                        here. 

           Eugene turns.
                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        Tomorrow I take you to town. Get 
                        your car. Be on your way so you can 
                        still make it in time.

           Eugene nods in thanks before exiting out into the night.

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Fritz climbs into bed with a metal spring SQUEAL as Agna 
           speaks up with the clarity of someone who has not been 
           asleep.

                                 AGNA
                        Love?

                                 FRITZ
                        Yes?

                                 AGNA
                        He’s crazy, isn’t he?

           He remains silent. So much of what Eugene said hitting home 
           for him. If Eugene is crazy, Fritz can’t help but wonder what 
           that makes him.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - LATE NIGHT

           Eugene slips back into the barn, shaking the dust from his 
           arms and shoulders as he tosses a glance over at Henry, who 
           has remained asleep.

           Growing tired, Eugene slides down the wall to the ground 
           where he hugs his knees to his chest to stay warm. 

           He stares at Henry. His brother. His responsibility...

                                 EUGENE (O.S.)
                        Run it by me again...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - ST. LOUIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Eugene and Henry’s shared cramped apartment. It’s close 
           corners by anyone’s standards. Out the window, a nearby 
           industrial smokestack belches short bursts of FIRE into the 
           charcoal navy sky.
           Eugene and Graham stand at the table, studying a drawn layout 
           of a bank while Henry fiddles with a PISTOL on the bed.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (gesturing to the map)
                        This is the entrance here. Two 
                        tellers. Here and here.

                                 EUGENE
                        Any other way in?

                                 GRAHAM
                             (gesturing to the map)
                        Here. Door leads to the alley. But 
                        it’s locked.

                                 EUGENE
                        Locked sometimes or locked always?

           Graham smirks, amused by Eugene’s attention to detail.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Well, which is it?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Locked always.

           Eugene looks to Henry, realizing he hasn’t been listening --

                                 EUGENE
                        Henry. Get over here. You’ve got to 
                        know what we’re saying.

           Reluctant, Henry plops the pistol onto the bed and moves to 
           the table, looking down at the map, disinterested.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                             (to Graham)
                        Show him like you showed me.

                                 GRAHAM
                        It’s simpler than you’re making it. 
                        Complicate things and things are 
                        bound to get confusing. 

                                 EUGENE
                        Show him.

           Sighing, Graham points a stubby finger down at the map --
                                 GRAHAM
                             (pointing at the map)
                        This is where we enter. Leave the 
                        car running around the corner here. 
                        Henry, you’ll be standing right 
                        here. Think you can handle that?

           As if he hasn’t heard, Henry continues to study the map.

                                 EUGENE
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                             (irritated)
                        I can handle it.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Easy, right?

                                 HENRY
                        Easy.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (pointing back to the map)
                        Now, I’ll set up shop here and Gene 
                        you’ll be here, keeping an eye on 
                        the customers. Of which there 
                        shouldn’t be many on account of the 
                        time of day.

                                 EUGENE
                        Then what?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Then we get what we’re there for 
                        and be on our way.

           Eugene mulls it over -- sounds simple enough.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s it?

                                 GRAHAM
                        That’s it.

           Graham moves to the bed and scoops up the pistol.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Gotta say I’m happy to have you 
                        boys along. But I’ve got to ask - 
                        what changed your mind?
           Henry looks to Eugene, not wanting to speak out of turn.

                                 EUGENE
                             (stern)
                        We’ll see you tomorrow.

           Knowing Eugene plays it close to the vest, Graham doesn’t 
           push the matter.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Like I said - glad to have you boys 
                        along.

           Pocketing the pistol, Graham makes for the door --

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                             (optimistic)
                        Enjoy your last night in this 
                        shoebox. You’ve got better times 
                        coming your way. We all do.

           With that, Graham exits, Eugene shutting the door behind him. 

           Turning, Eugene finds his brother has moved to the window -- 
           staring out at the smokestack spitting fire across the way.

                                 HENRY
                             (eyes on the smokestack)
                        How come you didn’t tell him? About 
                        Thelma.

                                 EUGENE
                        That’s not something he needs to 
                        know.

           Eugene joins Henry at the window.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        You all set? Any questions?

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not a dummy.

                                 EUGENE
                        No one said you were.

                                 HENRY
                        Yeah, well sometimes you treat me 
                        like I am.

                                 EUGENE
                        Hey... Look at me.
           Henry turns to his brother. Sheepish.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        You’re my brother. And I’m 
                        responsible. Whatever happens.

           Eugene rustles his hand through Henry’s hair.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Get some sleep...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HASWELL BARN - LATE NIGHT

           Seated with his knees against his chest, Eugene continues to 
           watch his brother sleep. Eugene’s eyes begin to grow heavy as 
           he drifts off himself.

                                 EUGENE (O.S.)
                        We got a big day ahead of us.

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - LATE NIGHT

           In the night sky, the pumpkin colored moon is swallowed by a 
           heavy curtain of dust.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. EDITH’S TURKEY FARM - MORNING

           Edith and Deacon walk to the top of a small hill near the 
           farm.

                                 EDITH
                        See there?

           Edith points to a TWO LANE HIGHWAY in the distance where a 
           CAR can be seen inching along.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        If you told me in Chicago that it’d 
                        make my day to see a car go by, 
                        well... That’s why I try and come 
                        out when I can. See, there’s 
                        another one.

           They watch a TRUCK move along on wobbly wheels.
                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I like to think about who they are. 
                        Where they’re going. Who’ll be 
                        there when they...

           Disinterested, Deacon adjusts his splint.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        I know what happened the other 
                        night between you and Stanley and 
                        I’m not going to say it’s right 
                        what he did - because it’s not. 
                             (a beat)
                        I’m not your mother but a boy your 
                        age, alone, with a gun? Makes me 
                        think you don’t have anybody and 
                        worse yet, don’t care. Maybe you 
                        don’t see it that way, and maybe 
                        it’s not my place. But people 
                        matter. Good or bad. They matter. 
                        Sometimes that’s a hard thing to 
                        remember... but being out here. 
                        Alone. You start to wonder what it 
                        all adds up to...

           Deacon looks off at the highway, finding it desolate -- not a 
           car in sight. 

           Turning, he finds that Edith has begun to walk back to the 
           farm.

           Startled to have been left alone, he sets out to join her.

           EXT. EDITH’S TURKEY FARM - MORNING

           Approaching the house, Edith and Deacon find Stanley standing 
           in front of his parked truck. Tense.

                                 STANLEY
                        How you feeling, Kid?

                                 EDITH
                        Better, no thanks to you.

                                 STANLEY
                        That true, Kid? You feeling better?

           Deacon remains unresponsive as Stanley approaches.

                                 STANLEY
                             (to Deacon)
                        You ready to go back?
                                 EDITH
                        I’ll pack what’s left of the cake 
                        for the road. 
                             (to Stanley)
                        Would Ruth want any?

                                 STANLEY
                        She would.

           Edith heads into the house leaving Deacon and Stanley 
           awkwardly standing beside each other, both of them eyeing the 
           truck, knowing full well that they’ll have to be even closer 
           to one another during the drive.

           Returning from the house, Edith hands a small box to Deacon.

                                 EDITH
                        I couldn’t find the knife to cut 
                        slices.

                                 STANLEY
                        Next time. 

           Stanley gestures for him and Deacon to get in the truck, 
           which they do, Stanley starting up the engine.

           Edith walks over to Deacon’s open passenger window --

                                 EDITH
                        You take care, now.

           Deacon lifts the box with his injured hand, nodding in 
           appreciation for either nursing him back to health or the 
           cake, or both.

           Stanley and Deacon drive off, Deacon looking back at Edith, a 
           lonely figure standing in front of her house waving goodbye.

           INT. EDITH’S FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Edith enters the kitchen, holding up the wooden brick, 
           wondering where the knife could be --

           INT. STANLEY’S TRUCK - MORNING

           Deacon’s right hand grips the handle of the knife, the blade 
           remaining hidden in his jacket pocket.

           Riding in silence, Stanley and Deacon stare forward at the 
           unfolding road, the air thick with the threat of violence.
           EXT. ALLEYWAY - MORNING

           Stanley’s truck pulls up to the shadowed mouth of the 
           alleyway, revealing Deacon’s car parked where it was last 
           seen.

           INT. STANLEY’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Stanley cuts the engine. Silence.

           Deacon slowly begins to slide the knife from his pocket, 
           keeping the action hidden.

                                 STANLEY
                        The bank’s taking the farm... and I 
                        haven’t told my wife.

           Deacon looks to Stanley, keeping the knife half drawn at his 
           side.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        They’re coming for the truck 
                        tomorrow.

           Stanley leans forward, fishing at his feet for something.

           Deacon eyes Stanley’s neck, his vision narrowing on where he 
           will plunge the knife --

           Sitting up, Stanley reveals Deacon’s PISTOL, causing Deacon 
           to loosen his grip on the knife, suddenly out matched in the 
           weapons department.

                                 STANLEY (CONT’D)
                             (considering the pistol)
                        This Godforsaken life... there’s 
                        only so much of it you can take.

           Stanley holds the pistol out for Deacon --

           For the first time since their paths crossed, they look each 
           other square in the eyes, Stanley silently asking Deacon to 
           do something his pride would never let him put into words.

           Taking hold of the pistol, pregnant with bullets, Deacon 
           continues to look at Stanley with detached eyes.

           The wind can be heard WHISTLING outside the car as Deacon 
           presses the pistol against Stanley’s forehead -- 
           His finger curls around the trigger. The intimacy of 
           impending death -- 

           The whistling wind... a peaceful silence...

           BLAM!

           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           Alone, Deacon’s car races along the desolate stretch of road, 
           it’s engine ROARING, announcing itself to nothing and no one.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - DAY

           Heat waves shimmer as the sun sits scorching in the sky.

           Glistening with sweat and dust, Fritz grips the long handle 
           of his hoe, raising it in the air before bringing it down 
           violently against the earth -- leaving no mark in the 
           hardened soil.

           He raises the hoe again above his head, bringing it down with 
           greater force than before, only to find he still has not 
           dented the soil at his feet. He wipes the sweat from the deep 
           cracks of his neck.

           LATER...

           Having run his horse drawn plow over a stretch of land, Fritz 
           moves along on foot, doing his best to plant seeds.

           Dark STORM CLOUDS roll in, swallowing the sun with a double 
           note of THUNDER.

           Fearful, Fritz looks up from his work to see the clouds 
           threatening to rain --

                                 FRITZ
                        No, no, no, no....

           Sobbing from rage, he holds his hands in the air, frantically 
           waving the clouds off as bolts of LIGHTNING strike all around 
           him.

                                 FRITZ (CONT’D)
                        PLEASE, NO!
           The purple storm clouds burst, unleashing endless sheets of 
           rain, washing Fritz away as if he were a pillar of dust --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Fritz awakens from his dream, dragging his legs over the side 
           of the bed.

           He lets out a tired sigh -- when will this end? Will this 
           life always be so hard?

           A CAR is heard pulling up outside the house.

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           GEORGE, late 30’s, and PERRY late 40’s, GOVERNMENT men 
           dressed in suits, get out of their car, sizing up the place 
           as Fritz appears in the doorway.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fritz Haswell?

           Fritz nods as George and Perry approach.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        I’m George Henderson. This is my 
                        partner Perry Smith. 

           Silence.

                                 GEORGE (CONT’D)
                        We’re federal acquisition agents.

           Feeling Agna’s presence behind him, Fritz gestures for her to 
           go away.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Watching from the cracked door, Eugene eyes Fritz talking to 
           George and Perry -- are they police? What are they talking 
           about? What is Fritz telling them?

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz makes his position known --
                                 FRITZ
                        This land is not mortgaged. I told 
                        the bank. I am not selling.

                                 PERRY
                        Everything’s for sale.

           Fritz steps out onto the porch, George and Perry holding 
           their ground.

                                 GEORGE
                        You’re not thinking of the big 
                        picture here, Mister Haswell.

                                 FRITZ
                        I’m thinking of my family. That is 
                        big enough picture for me.

           Perry and George move as if to walk past Fritz, but he gets 
           in their way. 

                                 PERRY
                        We came to survey the land and 
                        that’s what we intend to do.

                                 FRITZ
                             (attempting to stop them)
                        You have no right.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene sees that Fritz is outmanned and being bullied -- but 
           what about? He wants to help but there’s the strong chance 
           they have come for him and Henry.

           He needs to make a decision --

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz continues his attempts to fend off Perry and George, 
           who are insistent on completing their task.

                                 FRITZ
                        Go. This is no good. You have no 
                        right.

                                 PERRY
                        The government will make it a 
                        wildlife refuge. Take the money. 
                        You need it.
                                 FRITZ
                        There is something I need more than 
                        money.

                                 GEORGE
                        What’s that?

                                 FRITZ
                        Something you do not have.

           George and Perry exchange a look -- Perry headed back to the 
           car, opening the trunk to get something.

           At this, Fritz finds Eugene approaching from the barn, breath 
           held and gripping a pitchfork.

           He stands beside Fritz, everyone eyeballing each other --

                                 EUGENE
                        You already been asked to leave. 

           Eugene stares at Perry, who is hesitant to remove what he was 
           retrieving from the trunk.

                                 EUGENE
                             (his grip tightening on 
                              the pitchfork)
                        Now, I’m tellin’ ya. 

           Perry and George exchange looks -- it’s not worth pressing 
           the matter. At least not today. Perry shuts the trunk, 
           leaving whatever tool of intimidation he had inside.

                                 GEORGE
                        Give it some thought Mister Haswell 
                        and we’ll come back next week. 

                                 PERRY
                        With something to sign.

           Fritz takes a violent step forward, causing George and Perry 
           to step to it -- getting in their car and driving off.

           The standoff over, Eugene lowers the pitchfork as Fritz 
           watches with angry heaving breaths the government car 
           disappear down the road.

           Agna appears again in the doorway, worried for her husband.

                                 EUGENE
                        ... Fritz?
           Eugene reaches out to put his hand on Fritz’s shoulder but 
           Fritz slaps it away, hurrying over to his truck and getting 
           in --

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Fritz? Where you going? You’ve got 
                        to take us to town! Fritz?

           Without responding, Fritz drives off, mad as hell --

           Eugene looks to Agna, who stares back at him with worried 
           eyes before venturing back into the house, closing the door 
           behind her.

           Eugene kicks at the dirt -- he can’t afford to lose anymore 
           time on this farm. He needs to get back on the road. He needs 
           to get to Los Angeles today -- or else.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz’s truck speeds along, kicking up angry clouds of dust.

           EXT. BANK MANANGER’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Fritz pulls up outside the modest sized home and stomps up 
           the front steps, entering the front door --

           INT. BANK MANANGER’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Bank Manager sits at the table eating breakfast with his 
           WIFE, late 20’s, and his twin DAUGHTERS, both 7 years old.

           Storming into the kitchen, Fritz grabs the Bank Manager by 
           his collar, dragging him down off his chair --

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Mister Haswell! Please!

           Fritz brings back his shaking fist, loaded with all his 
           frustration and anger -- ready to bury it in the Bank 
           Manager’s face.

           After a moment, Fritz looks over at the family sitting in 
           shock and then down at the Bank Manager... he is suddenly 
           ashamed of himself.

           Letting go of his collar, Fritz turns and exits, leaving the 
           Bank Manager crumpled on the floor.
           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - MORNING

           Henry knocks and enters to find Agna sweeping the dust from 
           the floor -- attempting to keep her mind off Fritz. Hoping he 
           isn’t doing anything he’ll regret.

                                 HENRY
                        Morning.

           Agna glances up as Henry closes the door behind him.

                                 AGNA
                        Sleep well?

           Henry nods as he watches Agna gather sand and dust into a 
           pile.

                                 HENRY
                        Never ends does it?

           Agna stops sweeping, looking to Henry.

                                 AGNA
                             (sad smile)
                        No, it does not.

                                 HENRY
                        I thought maybe I’d try the radio 
                        again.

                                 AGNA
                        It is not working.

                                 HENRY
                        Oh. Oh, well...

           Agna manages a polite smile as Henry turns for the door.

                                 AGNA
                        Henry?

                                 HENRY
                        Hmmm?

                                 AGNA
                        I know why you go to California.

                                 HENRY
                        You do, huh?
                                 AGNA
                        I heard your brother. The other 
                        night.

                                 HENRY
                        So he told?

           Agna nods.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        What you need to understand is Gene 
                        has purpose. More than most people. 
                        More than I ever will.

                                 AGNA
                        That’s not true. You’re like my 
                        brother - a good boy. You shouldn’t 
                        be going. You should be at home.

                                 HENRY
                        That’s awful nice of you.

                                 AGNA
                        Stay.

                                 HENRY
                        Here? 

                                 AGNA
                        You don’t need to go.

           Henry gives it some thought before shaking his head with a 
           smile.

                                 HENRY
                        Nah, I like radio too much.

                                 AGNA
                        So much like Dedric.

                                 HENRY
                        Dedric? That your brother?

           Agna nods, remembering.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        It would have been good to die in a 
                        war - for something. 
                             (laughs)
                        even if it meant being on the wrong 
                        side of things.
                                 AGNA
                             (irked)
                        Dedric died a good boy.

                                 HENRY
                        I was just running my mouth. I 
                        didn’t mean anything by it.

           Agna walks over to the table and removes Dedric’s photograph 
           from the bible -- handing it to Henry.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I see what you mean. He’s a good 
                        looker all right.

                                 AGNA
                             (maternal)
                        We can find you work here. 
                        Something. You don’t need go. Your 
                        brother. Let him go.

           Henry looks back at the photograph -- considering.

                                 HENRY
                        Like I said, it’s a real nice 
                        offer...

           Something shifting within him, Henry suddenly RIPS UP the 
           photograph into small pieces.

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        But I’m not your brother.

           Without thinking, Agna viciously slaps Henry across the face, 
           bringing tears to his eyes.

           At this, Agna drops to her knees, frantically picking up the 
           torn photograph pieces.

           Henry attempts to help but she angrily waves him away.  

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        I wish I was good like you said.
                             (a beat)
                        I really do.

           Henry heads for the door and exits -- the wind from outside 
           scattering the uncollected pieces of photograph.

           Agna sits alone in the sand and dust, shaking from anger.
           EXT. ROAD / ALVIN’S FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Fritz drives along, adrenaline still pumping as he pulls off 
           the road -- coming to a halt at Alvin’s farmhouse without 
           realizing that’s where he was headed. 

           Fritz looks to the half buried house -- his breathing 
           slowing. His composure returning. Peering out through the 
           windshield he observes how the elements have won, beating the 
           house into submission.

           INT. ALVIN’S FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sand rains down in shafts from the ceiling. The whole place 
           CREAKS under the weight of dust and sand. It seems as if 
           nature itself is digesting the house, breaking it down into 
           splinters -- and then one day soon, it will be gone. There 
           will be nothing. It will be as if the family that toiled and 
           worked themselves to the bone to scratch out a living never 
           existed. Their hardship will have been for nothing.

           Fritz enters, taking a seat at the wooden table, which is 
           covered with several inches of sand. In the near dark, he 
           removes his LAST MAN CLUB CARD and thumbs its corners.

           The roof above lets out a painful GROAN as the shafts of sand 
           multiply, pouring faster --

           The wind SCREECHES through the walls as Fritz sits in 
           silence, brooding, while Alvin’s membership card and scrawled 
           “I’m Sorry” can be seen on the wall behind him. Suddenly, 
           Fritz slams his fist against the table in anger --

           Sand and dust. Sand and dust. There is nothing else.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - MORNING

           Eugene sits with his back against the wall as he undoes the 
           buckles of his suitcase -- timidly reaching in to remove a 
           stack of MONEY.

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - SAME

           Henry paces in the open field, muttering to himself as a 
           headache rakes across his brain --

           Upset, he drops to his knees, attempting to dig a small hole 
           with his fingernails, but the ground resists him.
           Frustrated, he removes the stone ARROWHEAD from his pocket 
           and begins to violently scratch at the dirt as if opening a 
           wound.

           INT. HASWELL BARN - SAME

           Placing the stack of money at his side, Eugene reaches back 
           into the suitcase, removing another stack.

           Eugene eyes the money, which has been soaked red with BLOOD. 

           He absently attempts to rub the blood away with his thumb as 
           his thoughts drift back to the bank...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BANK - ST. LOUIS - MORNING (FLASHBACK)

           A gloved hand cocks a PISTOL, causing ADAM, the teller and 
           Mr. Parker’s son, to look up from placing stacks of money in 
           a burlap sack.

           The gloved hand belongs to Henry, who wears a handkerchief 
           across his mouth to mask his identity.

           Graham, also wearing a handkerchief, stands several feet away 
           with his pistol trained on a FEMALE TELLER, early 20’s.

           Eugene holds his pistol at his side as he keeps watch over 
           the customers spread out on the floor. Having heard the 
           pistol cock, he takes a step backwards, whispering to Henry --

                                 EUGENE
                             (whispering)
                        Keep your head.

           Henry nods as Eugene returns to his post.

           A bead of sweat forms on Adam’s forehead as he stares at 
           Henry in fear. 

           The Female Teller continues to fill a sack with money.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (to Adam)
                        Come on! Get on with it!

           Adam doesn’t seem to have heard as he and Henry continue to 
           stare at one another. Tension rising. 
           The Female Teller glances at Henry and begins to SCREAM 
           hysterically -- pointing to Henry, she somehow senses a 
           terrible future act of violence that no one else is aware of 
           yet.

           While the Female Teller continues to SCREAM, Henry’s gaze 
           narrows from Adam’s eyes to the bead of sweat on his 
           forehead. He watches it as it snakes down along Adam’s cheek, 
           gathering itself on his chin, where it dangles, fattening up 
           before its weight causes it to...

           BLAM!

           Henry fires a bullet directly into Adam’s mouth, blood 
           spraying over a plaque on the wall, which reads: FAMILY RUN 
           SINCE 1886.

           The Female Teller begins to SCREAM even louder as Henry turns 
           and FIRES a bullet that rips through her throat.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (furious)
                        WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?!

           Graham rushes forward only to have Henry SHOOT HIM in the 
           gut, causing him to crumple onto the floor.

           An alarm SOUNDS.

                                 EUGENE
                        HENRY!

           Henry turns, his pistol aimed at Eugene, his eyes wild --

           He lowers the handkerchief from his face, revealing a puzzled 
           grin. Shaking from excitement, he points his pistol at the 
           ceiling, firing a bullet that causes plaster to drizzle down 
           upon him.

           Both the tellers lay dead behind the counter as Henry and 
           Eugene storm out the front doors holding up Graham between 
           them while clinging to the sacks of money.

           Blinding sunlight swallowing them whole...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HASWELL BARN - MORNING

           Eugene shields his eyes as Fritz slides open the barn door, 
           letting in violent rays of sunlight.
           Fritz spots the blood soaked stack of money and then looks to 
           Eugene --

                                 FRITZ
                        It’s time.

           Eugene nods in agreement as he drops the red stack back in 
           the suitcase. Out of sight, out of mind.

           EXT. HASWELL FARM - SAME

           Tears in his eyes, Henry drops the arrowhead in the small 
           hole he has dug, covering it with loose soil. Out of sight, 
           out of mind.

           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           Fritz, Eugene and Henry sit squeezed in the cab of Fritz’s 
           truck. As they drive, an ominous car appears on the horizon -- 
           it’s a POLICE CAR.

           They remain silent as the police car fast approaches, getting 
           closer and closer still, until it passes, the OFFICER waving 
           “hello” from his window.

           EXT. TOWN - MORNING

           A thick soup of dust hangs in the air as Fritz’s truck drives 
           up the main drag, coming to a stop outside a GARAGE.

           Nearby a makeshift stage and podium has been erected where 
           the Bank Manager auctions off repossessed land and farming 
           equipment. A POLICE OFFICER stands at his side, making sure 
           the crowd doesn’t get out of hand.

           Holding handkerchiefs to their faces to block the dust, a 
           cluster of disheartened FARMERS, including Maxwell, listen to 
           the Bank Manager spout off figures.

           Climbing down from his truck, Fritz gestures that he’ll catch 
           up with Eugene and Henry as they head for the open entrance 
           of the garage with their suitcases.

           Fritz meanders over to the cluster of farmers, holding a 
           handkerchief to his nose and mouth as he absently listens to 
           the Bank Manager, hoping he doesn’t look his way.
           Glancing down he sees the FARMER next to him has a NEWSPAPER 
           tucked under his arm, the printed word “THELMA” catching his 
           eye. Fritz gestures that he’d like to see it as the Farmer 
           hands it over.

           Fritz unfolds the paper to read the full article title at the 
           bottom of the page...

           “THELMA TODD FOUND DEAD - INVESTIGATING POSSIBLE MURDER”

           Fritz’s eyes dart over the article -- Eugene was right.

           Fritz turns to see Eugene and Henry driving their car out of 
           the garage and discreetly moves away from the group, walking 
           over to them, gripping the newspaper.

                                 FRITZ
                        All set?

                                 EUGENE
                        She’s not going to win any beauty 
                        pageants but she’ll do.

                                 FRITZ
                        That is that, then.

           Fritz spots Maxwell who looks to him and then over to the 
           Police Officer on the stage and then back to Fritz -- waiting 
           for a signal. Anything.

           Fritz must make a decision, the fate of the brothers resting 
           in his....

                                 EUGENE
                             (suspicious)
                        Fritz?

           Fritz looks away from Maxwell, back to Eugene.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Everything all right?

           After a moment, Fritz folds the newspaper, bringing it down 
           to his side. He can’t bring himself to put out the light in 
           Eugene’s life --

                                 FRITZ
                        I hope you get where you are going.

           Satisfied Fritz is being straight with him, Eugene nods --

                                 EUGENE
                        Thanks... for everything.
           Fritz nods and then begins to walk off, Maxwell still waiting 
           for a signal to warn the Police Officer who appears somewhat 
           bored on the stage.

                                 EUGENE
                             (calling after him)
                        Fritz.

           Fritz tentatively turns back to the car --

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Keep working on that singing voice.

           With that, the brothers speed off, Fritz glancing back down 
           at the newspaper before looking over to Maxwell, who turns 
           away, rejoining the group of farmers, unsure as to why Fritz 
           let the brothers escape.

           The Bank Manager loudly brings down a gavel on his makeshift 
           podium -- BANG.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Sweat gathers on Henry’s forehead, his face drained of color.

                                 HENRY
                        We should of given him some dough.

                                 EUGENE
                        He wouldn’t of taken it.

           Speeding faster and faster, Eugene attempts to make up for 
           lost time.

                                 HENRY
                        Can we still make it in time?

           Eugene makes a mental calculation --

                                 EUGENE
                        ... we have to.

           They race forward, headed west with no time to spare.

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Fritz pulls up in front of the house and lumbers out, making 
           his way for the front door.
           INT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - LIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           Entering, Fritz finds Agna sitting at the kitchen table 
           breathing heavily -- she has GONE INTO LABOR.

           EXT. HASWELL FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz attempts to help Agna walk to the truck as she bats him 
           away with her hand.

           After she climbs in, he shuts her door and races around the 
           other side, getting in behind the wheel, driving off --

           INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Driving, Fritz squeezes Agna’s hand in his.

                                 FRITZ
                        You will be good. We will be at 
                        hospital soon.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Racing along the desolate road, Fritz’s front right wheel 
           blows out with a loud POP.

           The truck swerves. Fritz attempting to control it as it jerks 
           back and forth -- finally landing in a ditch, the driver’s 
           side still on the road while the passenger side rests a few 
           feet below.

           First checking to see Agna is fine, Fritz leaps from the 
           truck, inspecting the situation -- they’re stuck.

           He looks up and down the road. There are no cars in sight. 

           What can he do?

           INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Climbing back in the truck, Fritz turns to Agna who while 
           breathing heavily, remains calm.

           A decision needs to be made, not later, but right now --

           He takes Agna’s face in his hands, looking her in the eyes.
                                 FRITZ
                             (intense, lovingly)
                         Ich werde dir nicht versagen.

           Agna nods with what smile she can muster before Fritz climbs 
           back out of the truck, closing the door so as not to let the 
           dust in.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Holding a handkerchief to his mouth and nose, Fritz sets off 
           running down the road, the soles of his boots landing with 
           quick heavy THUDS.

           INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Attempting to control her breathing, Agna reaches into her 
           pocket, removing the torn pieces of her brother’s photograph 
           and holds them tightly as a source of strength.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz shuffles forward, the sun and wind beating down on him 
           as he spits out the dirt gathering in his mouth.

           From behind him, the SOUND OF A CAR --

           INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Agna watches a car speed by on the road without slowing.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Excited at having spotted the car, Fritz waves his arms in 
           the air.

           The car shows no signs of slowing, causing Fritz to wave his 
           arms frantically.

                                 FRITZ
                        Please! Please! Stop! STOP!

           The car fast approaches and then races by -- it was Deacon.

           Fritz kicks at the ground, cursing Deacon before falling into 
           a coughing fit.
           With that, he places the handkerchief back over his face and 
           pushes on down the road.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - DAY

           His forehead leaning against the window, Henry stares out at 
           the dust rolling over the land in yellow waves.

           Suddenly, he spots GRAHAM standing idly on the side of the 
           road, his shirt open, revealing his BLOODIED GUTS. 

           As they pass, Graham and Henry lock eyes before Graham 
           vanishes in the trail of dust. A figment of his imagination.

                                 HENRY
                             (flat)
                        Gene?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah?

                                 HENRY
                        Where are we?

                                 EUGENE
                        On the road.

                                 HENRY
                        But where?

                                 EUGENE
                        Where do you think we are?

                                 HENRY
                        I’d rather not say.

           Eugene gives Henry a look as if to say “you feeling all 
           right?”

                                 HENRY (CONT’D)
                        You ever wonder where we go? When 
                        we die?

                                 EUGENE
                        No. It’s hard enough just trying 
                        not to go there.

           His eyes growing heavy, Henry’s head slinks down.
                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Henry?

           Henry makes a feeble attempt to nod before the weight of his 
           head shifts, SMACKING against the window -- several 
           splintered cracks appearing along the glass as he passes out. 

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Henry?

           Eugene slows down, bringing the car to a skidded halt before 
           taking Henry’s head in his hands -- a thin trickle of blood 
           running down Henry’s forehead from where he smacked it 
           against the window.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                             (panicked)
                        Come on, boy. Henry? Come on, now.

                                 HENRY
                             (tired)
                        Gene? 

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah?

                                 HENRY
                             (child like)
                        I don’t feel so good.

           Eugene cradles his brother’s head as he looks out at the 
           unfolding road -- what can he do? Henry needs a doctor right 
           now but they can’t afford to lose anymore time.

           Eugene is faced with the fact that he could lose both Thelma 
           and Henry if he doesn’t take action -- fast.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Fritz COUGHS beneath his handkerchief as he stumbles along, 
           exhausted. 

           On the verge of collapsing, he musters a burst of strength, 
           continuing on. However, after several more steps, he falls to 
           the ground defeated, taunted by the dust HOWLING around him, 
           stabbing at his skin.

           ... He has failed.

           But then -- something in the distance...

           Shielding his dust clogged eyes, Fritz makes out a CAR.
           He struggles to get to his feet and staggers out to the 
           middle of the road, lifting his tired arms.

                                 FRITZ
                             (barely audible)
                        Please... Please...

           The car approaches, not slowing down --

                                 FRITZ
                             (desperate)
                        ... please.

           This is it. If this car doesn’t stop, there is nothing more 
           Fritz can do. Him and Agna will be doomed. After a lifetime 
           of never getting a break -- he needs one now. He needs...

           The car arrives, coming to a halt, the Bank Manager leaping 
           out from the driver’s side.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Mister Haswell?

           The Bank Manager hurries over as Fritz’s legs give out.

           INT. FRITZ’S TRUCK - DAY

           The windshield and windows have been covered in a film of 
           dust.

           Agna, face streaked with sweat, struggles to keep her eyes 
           open. 

           Her ears perk up as an unseen car is heard beneath the wind 
           coming to a stop nearby. The whisper of HURRIED FOOTSTEPS.

           The driver’s side door opens, revealing Fritz, looking in 
           with concern at Agna, who smiles in relief, still clutching 
           the torn photograph. Fritz looks like a mess but he did not 
           fail her.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           Having been anxiously pacing in the waiting area, Eugene 
           walks up to the NURSE, 30’s, standing behind the reception 
           counter.

                                 EUGENE
                        When can I see my brother?
                                 NURSE
                        Your name?

                                 EUGENE
                        I gave it an hour ago.

           The Nurse stares forward with a blank expression.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Wolpinsky. My brother is Henry.

           Running her finger along the PATIENT LIST, the Nurse locates 
           Henry.

                                 NURSE
                        Wolpinsky, Henry.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yes.

                                 NURSE
                        He’s in room sixteen. 
                             (reading the status)
                        The doctor is finishing tests now 
                        but you can wait for him there. 

           The significance of the room number isn’t lost on Eugene.

                                 EUGENE
                        Sixteen?

                                 NURSE
                        Down the hall. To the left.

           Eugene nods in thanks as he walks off, REVEALING Deacon 
           stepping up to the counter.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

           Deacon holds up his hand, making her aware of his makeshift 
           splint.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        One moment.

           The Nurse disappears into the back room as Deacon eyeballs 
           his surroundings, his attention landing at the patient list 
           on the counter --

           Tilting his head, he singles out HENRY WOLPINSKY as if the 
           name were written in a different color than the others.
           ... He’s found his man, or at least one of them.

           The Nurse, holding a clipboard, returns with a younger NURSE 
           from the back room.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        Fill these out and...

           Deacon is GONE.

           Fritz bursts through the front doors, helping Agna along as 
           The Bank Manager shyly walks in behind them.

                                 FRITZ
                        Nurse, please. My wife is having a 
                        child.

           INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM NO.16 - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene enters the vacant room, running his fingers through 
           his hair as he nervously peers out the window, waiting for 
           Henry to return. He never intended for any of this to happen. 

           After a moment he spots a RADIO beside the bed and switches 
           it on, locating a channel with decent reception before 
           returning to the window.

           An ad on the radio comes to an end, giving way to a news 
           broadcast --

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                             (on the radio)
                        No further information has been 
                        given as to the circumstances 
                        surrounding the untimely death of 
                        film star Thelma Todd who appeared 
                        in such movies as Monkey Business 
                        Horse Feathers, and Duck Soup...

           Eugene stands motionless at the window, listening. Stunned.

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                             (on the radio)
                        Her body was found in her car 
                        yesterday, inside the garage of -

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Deacon stalks along the hallway, counting off room numbers in 
           his head, nearing room 16...
           INT. HOSPITAL -  ROOM NO.16 - CONTINUOUS

                                 RADIO ANNOUNCER (CONT’D)
                             (on the radio)
                        The district attorney has not 
                        issued a statement as to whether 
                        there was any foul play. 

           The Announcer moves on to the next news item, having treated 
           Thelma’s death as if it were a minor story.

           Eugene walks to the radio, unplugging it from the wall, and 
           then after a moment yanks the other end of the cord from the 
           radio itself as if it had betrayed him.

                                                          FLASH CUT TO:

           THELMA’S EYES FADING TO WHITE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN...

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM NO.16 - CONTINUOUS

           Wrapping the radio cord around his shaking fist, Eugene 
           struggles to keep his composure.

           Deacon appears in the doorway, cocking his PISTOL.

           His ears perking up at the sound, Eugene turns, recognizing 
           Deacon...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TIVOLI MOVIE THEATER - ST. LOUIS - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

           Amidst the panic of the frenzied crowd, Eugene’s gaze turns 
           from the Man who has been shot to his pursuer -- who now is 
           revealed to have been DEACON. 

           Deacon coldly looks to Eugene before exiting through the door 
           at the front of the theater, disappearing into the alley.

           Both of them unaware that their paths will cross once more --

                                                               BACK TO:
           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry, feeling somewhat better, walks sluggishly alongside 
           the DOCTOR, mid 40’s, as they head for his room.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I want you to stay overnight. 
                        There’s a few more tests for the 
                        morning, and you need the rest. I 
                        can tell your brother...

           BLAM!

           A GUNSHOT rings out over the hospital.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY ON 2ND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz turns his head he hears the gunshot -- what was that?

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and the Doctor stand in silence, as does the Nurse at 
           the reception area who cranes her neck to look down the 
           hallway.

           Curious PATIENTS can be seen in doorways, all of them wanting 
           to know what has happened.

                                 DOCTOR
                             (calling over his 
                              shoulder)
                        Nurse...

                                 HENRY
                        Where’s my brother? Where’s Gene?

           Henry gets his answer as a stream of BLOOD begins to inch out 
           into the hall from ROOM 16.

           The CLACK of footsteps ring out from within ROOM 16, Henry 
           waiting with bated breath until Deacon, clutching his pistol, 
           appears in the hallway. Silence.

           Deacon locks eyes with Henry as blood continues to pool at 
           Deacon’s feet, creating a makeshift boundary line of sorts.

           The calm before the storm. The tension of their standoff 
           fills the air. What will happen once Deacon steps over the 
           line of blood?
           Not wanting to wait and find out, Henry bolts for the front 
           door, Deacon giving chase --

           EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           Henry leaps down the front steps, bumping into the Bank 
           Manager.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                             (angry)
                        Hey...

           Spotting his car, Henry hurries over and gets in, finding the 
           keys still in the ignition.

           Deacon, a force of nature, bursts out the front doors of the 
           hospital and FIRES a bullet at Henry’s car, SHATTERING the 
           back window.

           Wasting no time, Henry starts the engine and speeds off --

           The Bank Manager leaps out of the way as Deacon rushes over 
           to his own car, his wheels spitting up clouds of dust as he 
           takes off after Henry --

           EXT. ROAD - OPEN COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Despite having just been at a hospital, the scenery has 
           dropped off into its rural surroundings as Henry drives for 
           his life, Deacon hot on his trail.

           INT. DEACON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Deacon attempts to handle his pistol with his bad hand, 
           thinking he can shoot out the window, but he fumbles it, 
           unable to maintain his grip.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Henry jerks the wheel to the left, veering off the road, 
           driving into the vast nothing of the plains.

           The jolt of driving off the road causes the two suitcases in 
           the backseat to spill over and open --
           INT. DEACON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Narrowing his eyes, Deacon watches a trail of MONEY begin to 
           fly out from Henry’s shattered window.

           Pressing down harder on the gas, Deacon continues to gain 
           ground as a cloud of money flutters in Henry’s wake.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           While steering, Henry makes frantic blind grabs into the 
           backseat as he attempts to gather money before it all flies 
           out the window --

           Unaware of it himself, his nose begins to bleed...

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Both cars kick up trails of dust as they plow along, Deacon 
           gaining, pulling up alongside Henry, neck and neck.

           INT. DEACON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Taking hold of his pistol with his good hand, Deacon BLASTS 
           through his own passenger window, SHATTERING it.

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry jerks the steering wheel to the right, trying to pull 
           away as Deacon struggles to steer with his injured hand --

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           BLOOD trickles from Henry’s nose as his eyes grow heavy with 
           sleep. He’s in bad shape and getting worse...

           INT. DEACON’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Deacon takes aim and FIRES a bullet at Henry, but misses, 
           hitting the car with a hollow THUD of metal.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Henry can barely keep his eyes open as he becomes 
           increasingly dizzy --
           HENRY’S POV:

           Through the windshield, the unfolding plains lose focus, a 
           blur of golden browns that sink away into black...

           Beneath the complete darkness the sound of the cars can still 
           be heard. The muddled BANG of Deacon FIRING another shot. The 
           sharp FLAPPING of money being sucked out the window. A 
           jarring BUB BUMP --

           Shaken awake by the car hitting a bump, Henry gets his 
           bearings, finding himself still in the midst of being chased 
           by Deacon.

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry changes course, now headed back in the direction of the 
           road -- Deacon right there alongside him.

           INT. WOLPINSKY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Henry and Deacon look to one another, both driving at top 
           speed --

           The sound from the cars kicking up dirt fades away, replaced 
           by nothing as Henry and Deacon stare at one another, driving 
           blind.

           The sound of their cars abruptly comes back in... CRUNCH!

           Henry watches through his passenger window as Deacon’s car 
           crashes head on into a half dust buried TRACTOR, Deacon, a 
           rag doll, LAUNCHING out through the windshield.

           Pumping the brakes, Henry brings the car to a halt as he 
           looks out the back windshield to see Deacon’s crumpled body 
           laying on the ground a good fifty yards back and the wrecked 
           car a good fifty yards past that.

           Woozy, Henry gets out, taking several steps to get his 
           balance --

           EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - CONTINUOUS

           Henry breathes heavily as he approaches Deacon’s body, 
           finding it to be a heap of broken twisted out of shape limbs. 
           A stack of kindling that used to be a man.

           The money that was in the suitcases continues to flutter in 
           the wind all around.
           Henry spots a POLICE CAR approaching on the road -- it’s the 
           end of the line. The police car gets closer and closer until 
           stopping abruptly about a quarter mile away.

           Confused, Henry watches as the police car turns around in a 
           hurry, speeding back off the way it came -- why?

           The skies darken, the wind violently picking up...

           Henry slowly turns to see a TOWERING DUST STORM of epic 
           proportions fast approaching -- a monster of nature on a 
           rampage, the body of which spans across the horizon, 
           swallowing up anything and everything in its path. 

           All alone in the world, Henry stands over the body of a dead 
           boy who when alive had every intention of killing him. 

           With this, or rather without anything, Henry stares in awe at 
           his own end barreling towards him in the shape of a biblical 
           sized dust cloud -- seemingly created from the vengeful 
           breath of God himself.

           ... Henry vanishes, swallowed by dust.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY ON 2ND FLOOR - SAME

           Fritz stands with his back against the wall, too nervous to 
           sit.

           Glancing down at the end of the hallway, he spots the Bank 
           Manager being interviewed by two POLICE OFFICERS.

           The Bank Manager looks up to see Fritz, who, after a moment, 
           raises his hand in thanks. 

           The Bank Manager returns the gesture, both men knowing that 
           in the morning their livelihoods will once again put them at 
           odds with each other.

                                 NURSE
                             (approaching)
                        Mister Haswill?

           Fritz turns to face the Nurse.

                                 FRITZ
                        Haswell.

                                 NURSE
                        Yes.
                                 FRITZ
                        My wife, she...

                                 NURSE
                        She’s resting and so is the baby.

                                 FRITZ
                        Good...oh good. May I?

                                 NURSE
                        Right this way.

           Fritz begins to follow, the Nurse pointing back to where he 
           was standing.

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        You dropped something.

           Fritz finds his LAST MAN CLUB membership card on the floor.

           He stares down at it, thinking of all that has happened, all 
           of his hardships and struggles -- then with aching knees, he 
           bends down to retrieve the card, sliding it into his shirt 
           pocket where it will be safe.

           INT. HOSPITAL - RECOVERY WARD - CONTINUOUS

           Fritz gingerly approaches the bed in which Agna holds a 
           bundled INFANT. Absently combing his hair with his fingers, 
           Fritz all of a sudden doesn’t feel spritzed up enough to meet 
           his child.

                                 AGNA
                        She’s tired.

                                 FRITZ
                        She?

           Agna nods, holding the infant up for Fritz to see --

                                 AGNA
                        Ilma. Say hello to papa.

                                 FRITZ
                        Ilma. Hello, Ilma.

           With his rough work worn hands, Fritz holds the small 
           untouched by life hand of Ilma. 

           The light in the room begins to flicker, a deep RUMBLING 
           sounding from somewhere outside.
           Not seeming to notice the RUMBLING, Agna and Fritz look to 
           one another lovingly, having grown something beautiful in a 
           place where that no longer seemed possible. 

           The rumbling becomes louder, building to a violent pitch, the 
           light in the room burning out with an electric WHINE.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

           The enormous dust storm SWALLOWS up the hospital as it washes 
           over civilization, pushing onwards, forever gaining strength 
           and speed...

           INT. MR. GWYNNE’S BATHROOM - ST. LOUIS - MORNING

           His face lathered in shaving cream, Mr. Gwynne scrapes a 
           straight razor along his cheek as steam rises from the sink.

           A deep RUMBLE causes him to look to the ceiling as daylight 
           blackens outside the frosted window at his side.

           PRELAP SFX: A clock TICKS away haunted seconds...

           INT. MR. PARKER’S STUDY - ST. LOUIS - MORNING

           Dressed in a bathrobe, Mr. Parker fixes himself a stiff 
           drink, swishing his glass as he shuffles past the framed 
           photo of him and his son Adam.

           Approaching the window, Mr. Parker takes a sip from his 
           drink, looking out at the backyard -- finding his wife’s 
           flower bed covered with a fine layer of DUST.

           His sleepless eyes become puzzled as the delicate flowers 
           that once stood tall in bloom now wilt and collapse under the 
           weight of gathering dust.

           Seeking an answer, Mr. Parker’s gaze rises to the heavens 
           above. There, he finds the APOCALYPTIC DUST STORM, a wall of 
           judgement barreling forward -- coming for him.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
