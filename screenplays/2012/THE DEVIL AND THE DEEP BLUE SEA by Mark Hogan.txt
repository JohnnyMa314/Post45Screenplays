                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. SKY ABOVE FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE, BURTONSVILLE, MD - DAY

           SUPER: “Burtonsville, Maryland.  February 18, 1943.”

           SILENCE and WHITE high above a frozen lake stretching for 
           miles on the edge of a forest.  Gentle, swirling snow 
           disappears as it hits the ice.  An unidentifiable BLACK 
           FIGURE on the ice below near the edge of the woods.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Two cops in black overcoats and fedoras forge through dense 
           snowy woods.  DEPUTY ROY QUINN (40), tall, dark and a crooked 
           nose short of handsome, walks ahead of the other short, burly 
           one, EDDIE RASLO (30), who holds a clunky LEICA camera. 

                                 QUINN
                        Sixty days of goddamn snow since 
                        December and now this.

                                 EDDIE
                        Sure this is where the old man 
                        said?

           Quinn suddenly stops in his tracks, bends down to study 
           something -- blood in the snow at the base of an oak tree.  

                                 QUINN
                        Now I am.

           A small patch of cloth visible beneath a layer of snow.  
           Quinn brushes aside the snow with a gloved hand and lifts up 
           a brown, wool NEWSBOY HAT stained with blood.  He bats the 
           hat, shaking off snow, and examines the tag in the lining.

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        A boy’s hat.

           Quinn and Eddie follow a trail of blood in the snow to the 
           edge of the woods.  

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        He must have been dragged through 
                        here.  Toward the lake...

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY 

           Quinn and Eddie emerge from the woods, walking toward the 
           frozen lake.  They step onto the ice and Quinn takes off his 
           fedora in reverence for the horror before them.
                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        ...Where someone went fishing.

                                 EDDIE
                        Mary mother of God.

           He bends down to ice level and SNAPS a photograph with a 
           shaky hand.

           Quinn blows on the inside of his thick, horn-rimmed GLASSES, 
           polishes them with his shirt sleeve.

           QUINN’S POV -- a BLURRY, OUT-OF-FOCUS image.  He raises the 
           glasses to his face and a grotesque, unnatural sight comes 
           INTO FOCUS -- the body of a boy (15).  

           The boy’s head and shoulders are wedged into a fishing hole 
           on the ice.  His torso and legs stick straight up in the air.

           Eddie BLOWS his nose with a hanky.  He pockets the hanky and 
           kneels closer to the body.  Snaps another photo.

                                 QUINN
                        I guess we need to pry ‘im out.  
                        Get him to the coroner and identify 
                        him before they go home for the 
                        day.

                                 EDDIE
                        I hope the fish weren’t biting.  

           A mile across the frozen lake, the gray stone facade of a New 
           England estate barely visible through the falling snow.

           INT. SMALL ROOM - NIGHT

           SUPERIMPOSED: “December 10, 1942.”

           A small, windowless room.  A seemingly normal family of three 
           eating dinner, ignoring the harsh yellow lighting and a 
           strange intermittent CREAK and GROAN.

           The MAN (50) passes the salt to a BOY (15), whose back and 
           blonde hair is visible.  

           Suddenly, the room SHAKES.  Another CREAK and GROAN.  The 
           lights FLICKER and BUZZ.  The WOMAN (50) smiles at the boy.

                                 WOMAN
                        Tell us about where you grew up.
                                 BOY
                             (British accent)
                        In Rotherham, ma’am, that’s the 
                        south part of Yorkshire.

                                 MAN
                        What was it like there?

                                 BOY
                        I grew up in a cottage by the River 
                        Don.  My father was an iron welder, 
                        that’s the main work there.

                                 WOMAN
                        Would you care for bread, Carl?

                                 BOY
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 MAN
                        What kind of bread?

                                 BOY
                        Well, I...

           The man sits forward, his hand on the cloth-covered bowl.

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand. 

           Suddenly, two OFFICERS in black SS uniforms storm into the 
           room, arguing with the blonde, blue-eyed boy, CARL DEMER(15). 

                                 OFFICER
                             (in German with subtitles)
                        You must not hesitate!  

                                 CARL
                        I wasn’t sure what to say!  I 
                        didn’t have a choice at home.   

                                 OFFICER
                        Anyone from England would know!

           DOLLY OUT of the windowless room to reveal that it is a STAGE 
           inside the steel hull of a submarine. 

           INT. U-BOAT - NIGHT

           German officers in Kriegsmarine uniforms busy at work.  DOLLY 
           OUT beyond the interior corridor to... 
           EXT. U-BOAT - NIGHT

           The dull gray exterior of a fully submerged German type XB U-
           boat, its monstrous girth visible in the ocean water.  The 
           Nazi swastika emblazoned on the steel pane over the rear, 
           diesel-powered propellers.  

           The U-boat recedes into the BLACK of the sea.

           EXT. CEMETERY, BERLIN GERMANY 1939 - DAY

           SUPER: “Berlin, Germany.  September 20, 1939.”

           A beautiful fall day in Berlin at a cemetery.  

           YOUNG CARL DEMER (11), a younger version of the boy on the U-
           boat, wears a black suit, holds a MODEL PLANE and stands 
           before a coffin wrapped in a NAZI FLAG.  Carl’s mother HILDA 
           DEMER (35), a beautiful blonde, hands Carl a party WREATH.

           A few friends and family in black and a row of German 
           soldiers in luftwaffe uniforms in attendance, their arms 
           extended in a Nazi salute toward the coffin.

           CLOSE ON EPITAPH ON GRAVESTONE (in German with subtitles):

           “In loving memory of Hanz Demer (1905-1939), luftwaffe pilot 
           shot down over Poland.  With courage and honor, he gave his 
           life for God, fuhrer and fatherland.”

           WAGNER’S “ACT 1 OVERTURE TO PARSIFAL” plays while Young Carl 
           places the wreath by the coffin.  He glances at his mother, 
           tears in his eyes.  She motions for Carl to come to her side.  
           Carl looks at the model plane in hand, debating its fate, and 
           places it inside the EMPTY coffin.

           INT. DEMER APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON GRAMOPHONE -- continuing to play WAGNER’S PARSIFAL.

           PAN across the living room of a modest, middle class 
           apartment.  A portrait of ADOLF HITLER over the worn sofa. 

           Young Carl, his hair neatly combed and fixed in place by 
           brillcream, sits on the oriental rug in front of the sofa, 
           playing with a Märklin electric toy train set.   

           CLOSE ON ENGINE CAR as the train glides along the track.  We 
           leave the train in motion and continue into...
           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           ...ANGLE ON POLISHED DRESS SHOES beneath the table. 

                                 HILDA (O.S.)
                             (in German with subtitles)
                        This is a pleasant surprise, Herr 
                        Burmann.

           HERR BURMANN(40’s), a oddly limber, hunched-over giant of a 
           man wearing a brown suit, bow tie and pleasant smile, sets 
           his fedora on the table and hangs his coat over the dining 
           chair.  He hands Hilda a bottle of wine. 

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Cotes du Rhone.  A good vintage I’m 
                        told.  

                                 HILDA
                        A delight, Herr Burmann.

           Hilda retrieves a bottle opener from a kitchen drawer and 
           uncorks the wine.

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        It’s my understanding that you grew 
                        up in England, Frau Demer.

           Hilda hands Burmann a glass of wine.

                                 HILDA
                        I merely spent my childhood there.  
                             (defensive)
                        I’ve been a party member since 1930 
                        when my father moved the family to 
                        Germany on business... 

           Hilda sits down across from Burmann.  He lights a cigarette.    

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        We are quite aware of your devotion 
                        to the fatherland.  And your late 
                        husband’s service.  Please accept 
                        my deepest condolences on behalf of 
                        the Reich Security office. 

                                 HILDA
                        Thank you, Herr Burmann.

           Burmann swirls the wine around in his glass...

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        I understand you taught your son 
                        Carl to speak English in the home.
                                 HILDA
                        That was before the war.  I only 
                        meant it to benefit the boy, if...

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Please, Frau Demer.  No need to be 
                        defensive.  Just answer the 
                        question. 

                                 HILDA
                        Yes, he can speak English fluently.  
                        He’s very bright.  Headmaster 
                        Schultz says he has outperformed 
                        his peers, that he may be able to 
                        advance in school.

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Yes, I’ve spoken to the headmaster.

                                 HILDA
                        Is this about Carl?

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Frau Demer, your son has been 
                        selected for the highest of Hitler 
                        Youth honors, to train with Reich 
                        Security to serve the fatherland.  

           Hilda’s eyes well with tears.  She sets her wine glass down 
           with a shaky hand.

                                 HERR BURMANN (CONT’D)
                        It’s an elite program created by 
                        the fuhrer himself. 

           Tears stream down Hilda’s face and she wipes her eyes.

                                 HILDA
                        Excuse me.

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Frau Demer, please.  This is not 
                        something to be distraught over.

           Herr Burmann takes her hand across the table.

                                 HILDA
                        Oh, they are tears of joy, Herr 
                        Burmann.  Tears of joy.
                             (composes herself)
                        Carl!  Carl, come to your mother 
                        right away!
           Carl enters the dining room.  He stands straight and tall and 
           smiles pleasantly, his arms rigid by his side in obedience.   

                                 HILDA (CONT’D)
                             (switches to English)
                        Speak to me in English, Carl.

                                 YOUNG CARL
                             (English accent)
                        Yes, mother.

                                 HILDA
                        This is Herr Burmann.  

           Herr Burmann gets up, approaches Carl with a smile, offers 
           his giant hand.  Carl shakes his hand, looks up at his bone-
           white face and sunken eyes.  

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        You have been chosen for a great 
                        honor, Carl.  The highest honor 
                        given to a boy in all of Germany.

           Carl smiles.

                                 HILDA
                        You will need to pack your things 
                        to go live with Herr Burmann.

           Carl appears confused.  Hilda gets up from the table and 
           approaches Carl.  She smiles, genuinely overjoyed.

                                 HILDA (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand, Carl?  You will 
                        be going with Herr Burmann to serve 
                        the fuhrer.

           Fear in Carl’s eyes.  His composure crumbling.  

                                 YOUNG CARL
                        But I can serve the fuhrer here 
                        with you, mother.  Right?

                                 HILDA
                        No.  You must go with Herr Burmann.  

                                 YOUNG CARL
                        I don’t want to go.

           Carl breaks down, CRYING, hugging her tightly, his head on 
           her SILVER NECKLACE.  She ushers him into the living room...
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl’s mother kneels, brushes his hair with her hand.  Carl 
           SNIFFLES and wipes his tears. 

                                 HILDA
                        Hush meine liebling.  Do not cry.  
                        You musn’t look foolish before Herr 
                        Burmann.  

                                 YOUNG CARL
                        I don’t want to go away from you, 
                        mother.

                                 HILDA
                        If you love me, Carl, you will go 
                        and become a hero for the 
                        fatherland and make me very proud.

           Carl looks up at her with sad blue eyes.

           ...In the b.g., his electric train circles the track. 

           INT. SEDAN - DAY

           Carl sits in the back seat of a Mercedes sedan with Herr 
           Burmann.  He glances out the window -- the receding image of 
           his mother framed in the doorway of their Berlin apartment.   

           INT. SEDAN - DAY

           Carl looks out the car window -- dense forest all around.

           The sedan rounds a bend and pulls up to a gate manned by six 
           Waffen SS soldiers.  Sandbags and barbed wire line either 
           side of the gate.  

           An SS Obersturmfuhrer approaches the car.  Herr Burmann rolls 
           down the window and hands the officer a packet of papers.

                                 HERR BURMANN
                        Heil Hitler.

           EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY

           The SS officer hands the papers back to Herr Burmann and 
           motions for them to pass.  The gate opens and the Mercedes 
           drives into the compound.
           INT. SEDAN - DAY

           Carl looks ahead -- a castle bunker (like Wolfsschanze) looms 
           in the near distance, Nazi flags draped over the stone walls. 

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS (V.O.)
                        Adolf Hitler, you are our great 
                        Führer.  Thy name makes the enemy 
                        tremble.  Thy Third Reich comes, 
                        thy will alone is law upon the 
                        earth... 

           Carl nervously looks at Herr Burman, who smiles reassuringly.

           INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

           Carl and a few other boys in “brown shirt” uniforms hold HJ 
           knives and face creepy military training dummies, their tan 
           leather torsos peeled back, revealing wooden ribs.

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS (V.O.)
                        ...Let us hear daily thy voice and 
                        order us by thy leadership, for we 
                        will obey to the end and even with 
                        our lives.  We praise thee!  Heil 
                        Hitler!...

           Carl hesitates, watching the other boys stab their dummies.  
           An SS CAPTAIN (40’s) screams at Carl, striking him in the 
           face.  Carl sinks his blade into the chest of the dummy.

           EXT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

           Carl stands before his training dummy.  He slashes it 
           expertly, and the captain nods in approval.

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS (V.O.)
                        ...Führer, my Führer, give me by 
                        God. Protect and preserve my life 
                        for long... 

           EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY

           SUPER: “Three Years Later.”

           A martial arts training session.  Five boys (now age 15) 
           fight in hand-to-hand combat with grown men. 

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You saved Germany in time of 
                        need. I thank you for my daily 
                        bread... 
           The captain watches as CARL (now 15) expertly blocks and 
           disarms a knife-wielding soldier.

           EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - NIGHT

           An eerie, torchlight ceremony in the courtyard.  The boys, in 
           black SS uniforms, recite the pledge heard over these scenes, 
           arms raised in the Nazi salute.

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS (V.O.)
                        ...Be with me for a long time, do 
                        not leave me, Führer, my Führer, my 
                        faith, my light, Hail to my Führer!

           The captain hands each boy a ceremonial dagger.  At the end 
           of the line, Carl accepts his dagger, jaw clenched. 

           INSERT DAGGER INSCRIPTION: -- Meine Ehre Heisst Treue (My 
           Honour is Loyalty in subtitles)

           INT. U-BOAT - NIGHT

           Carl stands in line with five other boys at the base of the 
           iron steps to the deck.  The boys wear black, full-body 
           wetsuits, waterproof bags over their shoulders. 

           Kriegsmarine officers rush by in preparation for ascent.  

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                             (in German with subtitles)
                        Speed two knots.  Ten meters to 
                        surface.  
                             (a beat)
                        Five meters...

           The SS CAPTAIN from the castle addresses the line of boys. 

                                 CAPTAIN
                        You must not fail to rendezvous 
                        with the agency contact in London 
                        by ten hundred hours.  

           Carl checks his mariner watch and compass.  The surfacing 
           light bathes Carl’s face intermittently in RED. 

           The boy next to Carl vomits on the submarine floor.

                                 OFFICER
                        Now surfacing.

           One after another, the boys climb the iron steps to the deck.
           EXT. NORTH SEA - NIGHT

           The black stormy waters of the North Sea.  The wind HOWLS.

           The U-boat BREAKS the surface of the ocean, the deck and 
           upper hull rising.  Waves CRASH against the hull of the sub.     

           The hatch opens and the boys climb onto the deck.

           EXT. U-BOAT DECK - NIGHT

           Waves CRASH over the deck.  Water smashes against Carl’s body 
           as he passes a black, inflatable dinghy and oars forward to 
           the next GERMAN BOY in line.

                                 GERMAN BOY
                        All forward!

           The English coast is visible by moonlight only a few hundred 
           yards away.

           The first boy INFLATES the dinghy and throws it into the sea.  
           A rope tethers the dinghy to the side of the U-boat.  

                                 GERMAN BOY (CONT’D)
                        All in!

           The boys quickly climb into the dinghy.  Carl last to join...

           INT. DINGY, NORTH SEA - NIGHT

           ...Carl sits down at the rear of the dinghy, removes his 
           knife and CUTS the rope that tethers the dinghy to the sub.  

           Two of the boys grab the oars and paddle toward the English 
           shoreline.  

           Carl glances behind him -- the submarine descends, and the 
           sea swallows it.

           Carl faces forward as a massive wave ROCKS the dinghy.  Carl 
           flies off the boat and hits the icy water with a SPLASH...

           EXT. NORTH SEA (UNDER WATER) - NIGHT

           Carl submerged.  A disorienting swirl of water.  A flurry of 
           air bubbles.  Limbs thrashing...  
           EXT. NORTH SEA (SURFACE) - NIGHT

           Carl surfaces, GASPING for air.

                                 CARL
                        Overboard!  Wait!  Wait!  

           The wind SCREAMS, drowning out Carl’s voice.

           CARL’S POV -- the dinghy rises into view on the surging black 
           billows.  All of the boys face forward, their backs to Carl, 
           unaware of his plight.  The dinghy goes on without him.

           A wave rolls over Carl’s head and the dinghy disappears.

           Carl swims freestyle toward the shore, powerful strokes 
           against the violent sea.  

           He stops and catches his breath, the dinghy a hundred yards 
           ahead of him.  Carl swims on toward the shore...

           EXT. BEACH, EAST OF HERNE BAY, ENGLAND - NIGHT

           A wave CRASHES onto the beach and Carl collapses with it onto 
           the sand.  He struggles to his feet, exhausted and GASPING 
           for breath. 

           Carl stumbles forward, farther up the beach onto dry land.  

           He glances at his mariner watch and compass.  He takes off 
           his bag, unzips it and removes a pair of cargo pants, a 
           shirt, jacket and a military knife in case.  

           He unzips his wetsuit, shivering with cold, teeth CHATTERING.  

           EXT. RECULVER BEACH, ENGLAND - DAWN

           Carl jogs along a grassy knoll above Reculver Beach.  

           The dawn light pierces the medieval church ruins of RECULVER 
           TOWERS.  A breathtaking sight.

           EXT. STATE ROAD, KENT ENGLAND - DAY

           CLOSE ON ROAD SIGN: A299, London 45 KM

           Carl walks along the side of a state road in the thick 
           morning FOG in Kent, England.  The sound of a CAR ENGINE.  

           Carl gives the hitchhiker’s sign, but the car passes.  
           He checks his watch -- 8:30AM.  He treks on... 

           EXT. STATE ROAD, KENT ENGLAND - DAY

           A low RUMBLE.  Carl sticks his thumb out again.  A faded-
           black, ‘39 Morris 8 coupe rounds the bend.  It slows to a 
           stop beside Carl. 

           TORI (40’s), a pudgy woman suffering an inch of make-up, 
           rolls down the window. 

                                 TORI
                        Ya need a lift!?

                                 CARL
                        I’m on my way to London, ma’am.

                                 TORI
                        So are we!  Get in, dear!

           She gets out of the car and lowers her seat, allowing Carl to 
           climb in the back.  Carl nods gratefully at HAROLD (40’s), a 
           stocky man with a mustache, who sits behind the wheel.

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, sir.

           Harold ignores Carl, SHOVES the Morris into gear... 

           INT. MORRIS COUPE - DAY

           Carl slides across the seat, taking the seat behind Harold. 
           He looks out the window at a road sign: A299, London 10km.  
           His watch:  9:20AM

           Out the window, barren trees like skeletons in the thick fog. 

                                 TORI (O.S.)
                        You look so much like our son, 
                        Henry.  Just look at him, Harold.  

           Tori swats her husband with a beefy arm.  He ignores her, 
           eyes peeled to the foggy road.

                                 HAROLD
                        It’s thick as pea soup out. 

           He turns on the windshield wipers, a feeble attempt to repel 
           the fog.
                                 TORI
                             (turns to Carl)
                        Our boy’s a bit younger, he’ll be 
                        twelve on Christmas day this 
                        December.  All he wants for his 
                        Christmas is one of them black 
                        Raleigh bicycles like some of the 
                        servicemen ride around town.  
                        Harold’s bought one for him, though 
                        not new.  I’m not sure we could 
                        afford it.  I’m just sad it’s the 
                        first year he doesn’t believe in 
                        Father Christmas no more.  Doesn’t 
                        he look just like our Henry?

           Harold ignores her and turns on the radio.

                        Now look, you missed the turn into 
                        town.  Harold?

                                 HAROLD
                        I think we’ll stop by the police 
                        station and sort this out.
           Carl pulls his pant leg up, revealing his military KNIFE in a 
           case strapped to his calf.

                                 CARL
                        I’m not feeling so good, ma’am.  
                        Would you mind pulling over?

           Carl slowly removes the knife.

                                 HAROLD (O.S.)
                        Well, that’s bloody convenient!

           Carl GROANS and pretends to be WOOZY as he cuts through the 
           vinyl on the back of Harold’s seat.

                                 TORI
                        Harold, pull over.  You’ve upset 
                        the boy.

                                 CARL
                        I think I’m going to throw up.

                                 TORI
                        Not in the car!  Christ, Harold!  
                        Pull over now!

           Harold breaks at a four-way stop.  He turns off the radio and  
           Run Rabbit Run ends.  Harold shakes his head, livid.

                                 HAROLD
                        I’m not pulling over!  I’m takin’ 
                        him in!  It’s rubbish, love!  He’s 
                        a lying bastard and he’s...

           Harold stops speaking mid-sentence.  His back suddenly 
           straightens, rigid against his seat, and he emits a hoarse, 
           guttural SCREAM.  

                                 TORI
                        Harold?  What’s wrong?

           Harold’s lips move.  Nothing but a dry GURGLING sound.

           Carl plunges the knife farther into the seat back and TWISTS.  

           Another muted CRY.  Harold’s arms shake violently.  Blood 
           trickles down the side of his mouth.

                                 TORI (CONT’D)
                        Oh God, he’s having another stroke!

           Harold’s foot slips off the break onto the gas and the Morris 
           lurches forward across the intersection...
           EXT. ROADWAY, LONDON - DAY

           The Morris picks up speed, veering in the lane...

           INT. MORRIS COUPE - DAY

           Tori SCREAMS, grabbing frantically at the steering wheel as 
           the Morris careens off the road into a ditch.

           The impact SLAMS Carl’s head against the rear window.

           EXT. DITCH - DAY

           The smashed Morris comes to a violent halt, hissing STEAM 
           from the engine block blending with the fog.

           INT. MORRIS COUPE - DAY

           Carl sits up GROANING, touches a small cut over his eye.  

           In the front, Tori, woozy and bleeding, reaches for Harold...  

                                 TORI
                        Oh, God, I...Harold?

           Suddenly, Harold’s dead body slumps forward, SLAMMING against 
           the steering wheel.  The car HORN sounds!  

           Tori sees the blood stain on Harold’s back and the bloody 
           knife sticking through the seat.  The blade retracts...  

                                 TORI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Christ Almighty!  

           Tori glances back at Carl in time to see the KNIFE flying 
           toward her head.  Her blood-chilling SCREAM ends abruptly.

           Short nervous BREATHS from Carl.  He wipes his blood-speckled 
           face and slides the knife back in his shin case, pushes 
           Tori’s body aside and climbs over the seat.  

           He tries the door handle -- the door won’t open against the 
           incline of the ditch.  He leans back against Tori’s dead body 
           and kicks the window with his boots, SMASHING the glass...

           EXT. DITCH, LONDON - DAY

           Carl climbs out of the ditch, a cold resolute expression on 
           his face.  On the other side of the road, HEADLIGHTS engulfed 
           by FOG.  The shadowy figure of a MAN walks toward him...
                                 MAN
                             (british accent)
                        Hello there!  Are you ok?!  I saw 
                        the car go off the road!

           Carl takes off running down the side of the road.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey!

           EXT. STREET, LONDON - DAY

           Carl, breathing heavily, walks briskly down a sidewalk in 
           London.  Quaint brick boutique store fronts shrouded in FOG.  
           A modicum of morning traffic and passersby.  

           Carl checks his watch -- 9:55AM.  BLOOD on his white sleeve.

           Suddenly, a door to a bakery opens and a Scotland Yard 
           POLICEMAN with a mustache and billy club SLAMS into Carl... 

                                 CARL
                        Excuse me, sir.

           Carl covers the BLOODY sleeve with his hand, hurries on...

                                 POLICEMAN
                        You’re lucky I will this time, ya 
                        bloody urchin!

           Carl picks up his pace.  He glances up at the storefront sign 
           on one of the brick buildings: “GODWIN AGENCY FOR ORPHANS.”

           Carl turns down a dark, cobblestone alley.

           IN THE ALLEY

           Carl stops before a service entrance to the building.  He 
           KNOCKS -- a two-three-two PATTERN on the black iron door.  A 
           security panel slides to the side, revealing EYES.  

           The door opens and Carl slips inside...

           INT. WAREHOUSE, LONDON - DAY

           A dimly lit brick warehouse with blacked out windows and 
           sparse studio lights.  

           A couple men in suits mount a camera with large flash bulb on 
           a tripod opposite a shipping crate, a makeshift studio.  Next 
           to the crate, folding tables with piles of clothing and a row 
           of suitcases.  
           Carl sits next to a group of other boys on the floor, their 
           backs against the exposed brick.  A gaunt man in a gray suit, 
           LUTHER (30’s) addresses the boys.

                                 LUTHER
                        The fuhrer has great faith in his 
                        youth.  You are here today because 
                        of your training, unique abilities, 
                        and steadfast loyalty to the 
                        fatherland.  And you have been 
                        chosen to serve on a mission of the 
                        highest secrecy and importance.  
                        Three years ago, men loyal to the 
                        fuhrer infiltrated this agency with 
                        the goal of someday placing each of 
                        you into the homes of wealthy and 
                        politically-connected families here 
                        and in America.  That day is now 
                        upon us.  You are all active 
                        members of Operation Kriegwaise.

           MONTAGE:

           - CLOSE ON CARL as he sits on the shipping crate.  The 
           blinding FLASH of a camera captures Carl’s stolid expression.  

                                 LUTHER  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        You will each receive a British 
                        passport...

           - Small photographs drip-dry in a dark room.  RED lighting.  

           - CLOSE-UP of the meticulous creation of a FORGED BRITISH 
           PASSPORT.  A photograph of Carl glued in place with tweezers.

           - The boys pick through a loose bundle of clothing lying on 
           top of a crate.

                                 LUTHER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...British-made clothing... 

           - Carl and the other boys try on pants, dress shirts and wool 
           overcoats for size.

           - Luther demonstrates how to detach a false bottom from a 
           large, durable suitcase.

                                 LUTHER  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...a suitcase with detachable 
                        panel... 

           - The boys take bundles of US twenty dollar bills from a 
           table and remove the SLIPS labeled DEUTSCHE REICHSBANK.
                                 LUTHER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...Emergency currency in dollars...

           - On the table, a pile of thin black necklaces with copper 
           pendants.  Each boy takes a necklace.

                                 LUTHER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...and a cyanide capsule which you 
                        must have with you at all times.

           - Carl puts on his necklace with the small pendant CYANIDE 
           CAPSULE.  He tucks the necklace under his shirt collar.

           END MONTAGE.

                                 LUTHER (CONT’D)
                        Read the file about your host 
                        families.  They have already 
                        received your information from the 
                        agency and eagerly await your 
                        arrival in a week’s time.  We leave 
                        within the hour.

           Luther disburses files to the boys.  Carl opens his file...

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE, MARYLAND - DAY

           The woods at the edge of frozen Lake Ambrose, the stone New 
           England estate in the distance (MATCHCUT from the first 
           scene).  

           MOVING ACROSS the frozen lake toward the estate...

           INT. DENT ESTATE, CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           A girl’s bedroom in Victorian style.  Ebony wood floors, 
           white ruffled bed spread and lace curtains on the window.    

           CATHERINE DENT (16), a beautiful brunette whose mauve dress 
           shows off the burgeoning figure of a young woman, lies on her 
           bed knitting a SCARF with RED and WHITE wool.  

           She gets up from the bed and approaches her ornate dresser.  
           With the turn of a KEY, she opens a jewelry box and stashes 
           her knitting.  She closes the box and locks it.

           She runs out of the room...

           ...and bounces down one side of the twin staircases curving 
           down to the black and white checkered marble entry.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 

           Catherine enters the grand living room.  The sound of FEMALE 
           CHATTER from the kitchen.  

           She quietly approaches closed double oak doors and KNOCKS.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Don’t interrupt your father, 
                        Catherine!

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        It’s alright, come in Cat!

           Catherine opens the door and enters...

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDY - DAY

           A capacious, richly furnished study.  Mahogany shelves lined 
           with law books, framed letters and photographs, a “RE-ELECT 
           SENATOR DENT” poster, an American flag and a WWI rifle.  

           Behind the desk sits SENATOR RICHARD DENT (55), a fit, 
           handsome man with salt and pepper hair.  He slices open an 
           envelope with a LETTER OPENER.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Can I see the file on the orphan 
                        again?  

           Richard sets the LETTER OPENER on the desk and takes a KEY 
           from a ring in his pocket and unlocks a desk drawer.  He 
           retrieves a manila folder from inside and hands it over.

                                 RICHARD
                             (smiles)
                        Just bring it back, Cat.

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Catherine rushes into her room and shuts the door.  She plops 
           down on her bed, smiles nervously and opens the manila folder 
           labelled: “GODWIN AGENCY FOR ORPHANS.”

           CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPH -- a glossy black and white school photo 
           of a stoic Carl Demer in dress shirt and tie.

           EXT. CUNARD CRUISE LINER - DAY

           SUPER: “Christmas Eve Day, 1942.”
           A booming FOG HORN.  Billows of BLACK SMOKE rise from the 
           smokestack of a Cunard cruise liner.

           EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY

           Luther stands huddled next to Carl and the other boys on deck 
           away from other passengers.  Carl pops the collar on his 
           overcoat and holds his suitcase.

           Luther smokes a cigarette.  He offers one to Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Smoking is impure, it is forbidden.

           Twenty yards away, two little boys play with TOY ARMY MEN 
           next to their mother, adding SOUND EFFECTS to their mock 
           battle.  BOOM!  BANG!  POW!

                                 LUTHER
                        We received the senator’s request 
                        for a war orphan a year ago.  I 
                        hope you appreciate the uniqueness 
                        of your position, its value to the 
                        Reich.

                                 CARL
                        I will not fail the fatherland.

           Suddenly, the ROARING THUNDER of ENGINES.  Carl looks up -- 
           TWO B-17 FLYING FORTRESS BOMBERS fly by overhead.

           Passengers on the deck CHEER and APPLAUD.

                                 LUTHER
                        Remember, your job is to ingratiate 
                        yourself with your host family, 
                        blend in with the American way of 
                        doing things.  Don’t stand so tall 
                        and rigid.  Slump your shoulders 
                        like an American.

           Carl slumps his shoulders.

                                 CARL
                        Who is my contact?

                                 LUTHER
                        They call him the Brummbär.

                                 CARL
                        Grumble bear?
                                 LUTHER
                        They say he was one of Hitler’s 
                        bodyguards in the early twenties, 
                        before the Beer Hall Putsch.  He’s 
                        been in America for years.  That’s 
                        all I know.  

                                 CARL
                        How will I find him?

                                 LUTHER
                        He will find you.

           The HORN sounds again.  Carl’s breath like bursts of FOG as 
           he stares in wonder at the sight beyond the railing.

           CARL’S POV -- Snow blankets liberty island beneath the STATUE 
           OF LIBERTY.  In the background, the grand MANHATTAN SKYLINE.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY HARBOR, DOCK - DAY

           Carl waits in a crowded line at customs.  A last furtive look 
           to either side -- other boys have disbursed into different 
           lines, waiting with their suitcases in hand to enter America.

           Carl stands before a US CUSTOMS AGENT.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Passport please.

           Carl hands the man his forged British passport.  

           The customs agent opens it, glances at the picture inside.

           He takes a closer look at Carl...then STAMPS the passport.

                        Merry Christmas.  Next.

           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR DOCK - DAY

           A mass of people around Carl in exodus toward New York.  

           Beneath a snow-dusted tarp, a little old man shines shoes.

           A man in SANTA CLAUS garb JINGLES bells and calls out for 
           donations. 

                                 SANTA CLAUS
                        Ho Ho Ho!  Merry Christmas!  Help 
                        the war effort!  God blesses those 
                        who give!  God bless America!
           Another VENDOR (50) sells newspapers and souvenirs.  Carl 
           looks at small plastic miniatures of the STATUE OF LIBERTY.

                                 CARL
                        I’d like to buy one of those.

                                 VENDOR
                        Sure, kid.  That’ll be a nickel.

           Carl digs into his pants pocket and gives the man a nickel.  
           He walks on, glancing at the inscription on the statue.

           INSERT INSCRIPTION:

              “Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses.”

           Carl’s face cold, expressionless as he drops it and the 
           statue is trampled by the crowd.  

           EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

           Carl walks toward a line of vehicles, their engines PURRING.  

           A black CHAUFFEUR in a suit and driver’s cap in front of a 
           sedan holds up a sign with “CARL DEMER.”  

           Carl approaches the driver with his suitcase in tow. 

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DUSK

           The Dent estate.  The GRAY HOUR between day and night.  No 
           trace of the sun.

           INT. DENT ESTATE, LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           A RECORD PLAYER plays BING CROSBY’S WHITE CHRISTMAS. 

           In the living room, a CRACKLING FIRE in the fireplace gives 
           off a warm glow.  A Christmas tree with lights.  Presents 
           under the tree.  Senator Dent relaxes on the sofa, smoking a 
           pipe and reading a newspaper.  A Norman Rockwell moment. 

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - DUSK

           Catherine stands before the full-length mirror in her bedroom 
           wearing a white dress, gloves and a fur shawl.  She holds an 
           issue of FILM LOVE magazine with RITA HAYWORTH on the cover.     

           Catherine pushes up her hair, glances at the magazine again, 
           then back to the mirror -- a young, lovely Rita.
           Catherine nervously bites her lip.  She tosses the magazine 
           on her bed and runs into her closet, undressing...

           She drops her dress on the floor and combs through racks of 
           clothing.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother!  What time is it!?

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Just after six!

                                 CATHERINE
                        You said he would already be here 
                        by six!

           She wiggles into a red skirt.  

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Yes, six o’clock!

                                 CATHERINE
                        That’s what I...nevermind!  You’re 
                        impossible!

           Catherine buttons up a cream-colored blouse.  She runs to the 
           mirror.  Throws the mink shawl over her blouse.  

           IN THE HALLWAY

           EMMA DENT (40), a tall, prim brunette in evening dress, hair 
           pulled in a tight bun, argues with the maid, JOANNA HANOW 
           (30), a GERMAN immigrant built like an ox.

           The family dog, a giant, impeccably-groomed GERMAN SHEPHERD 
           sits patiently at Emma’s heels.

                                 JOANNA
                        I’m very sorry.  When you said to 
                        put the boy in here, I assumed that 
                        you would want the crib moved out. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s alright, Joanna.  Just leave 
                        it in there for now, and check on 
                        the lamb roast.  

                                 JOANNA
                        Yes, ma’am.
           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - DUSK

           Catherine looks out her bedroom window -- headlights in the 
           distance as the black sedan approaches the gate to the long, 
           snow-shoveled drive leading to the Dent mansion.

                                 CATHERINE
                        He’s here!

           INT. SEDAN - DUSK

           The CRUNCH of gravel and SLUSH beneath the tires.  

           Carl watches through the windshield as the sedan passes 
           through the wrought iron gate with “DENT” welded into the 
           archway. 

           The sedan enters a circular drive around a stone fountain, 
           and stops before the imposing New England mansion.

           The chauffeur puts the gear into park with a gloved hand.

           INT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           The DOORBELL CHIME sounds.   

           The Senator gets up from the sofa and walks toward the foyer.

           Joanna opens the front door -- a gust of cold air.   Snow 
           blows inside onto the marble floor.  

           Carl stands on the porch holding his suitcase, a thin smile 
           on his face.

                                 JOANNA
                             (German accent)
                        You must be Carl, please come in. 

           Carl steps inside and Joanna shuts the door behind him.

                                 CARL
                             (caught off guard)
                        You’re German?

                                 JOANNA
                             (puzzled)
                        Yes.

           The senator extends a hand, interrupting...
                                 RICHARD
                        Carl.  Richard Dent.  Welcome to 
                        America and welcome to our home!  I 
                        trust you had a comfortable trip.  

                                 CARL
                        Pleased to meet you, sir.

                                 RICHARD
                        Joanna, take Carl’s coat and his 
                        suitcase upstairs to his room.

                                 JOANNA
                        Yes, sir.

           Carl takes off his overcoat.  Joanna takes his suitcase and 
           coat upstairs.  Emma steps off the stairs toward Carl, the 
           dog at her heels.

                                 RICHARD
                        This is my wife, Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Welcome, Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, ma’am.  You have a very 
                        fine home.

           Catherine descends the other side of the twin staircase.  
           Carl sees her for the first time -- a beautiful girl his age.

                                 RICHARD
                        And my daughter, Cat.  Excuse me, 
                        Catherine.  She’s been counting the 
                        days to Christmas.

           Catherine smiles and offers her hand for a shake.

                                 CARL
                        Hello.

                                 CATHERINE
                        And this is Sarge.  He looks just 
                        like Rin Tin Tin, doesn’t he?

           Carl steps toward the dog and extends a hand to pet him.  A 
           LOW GROWL from Sarge.  Carl steps back...

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Sarge!  No!  Down boy!

                                 EMMA
                        Down, Sarge.
           The dog responds immediately to Emma’s command and sits.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry Carl, he never behaves 
                        this way.
                             (to Catherine)
                        Show Carl to his room and let him 
                        freshen up.  Joanna will be serving 
                        dinner in a few minutes.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on!  This way!

           Catherine leads Carl up the stairs to the second floor...

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl follows Catherine into his new room -- an infant boy’s 
           room with a baby blue angel border and a WHITE CRIB in the 
           corner.  On the other side, Carl’s suitcase at the foot of a 
           single bed.  His overcoat hangs on a coat stand.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        You have your own bathroom in 
                        there.

           She points to an adjacent room.

                                 CARL
                        Do you have a brother?

                                 CATHERINE
                        No.  Mother just left it this way.  
                        She had my baby brother William 
                        over a year ago, but he died in his 
                        sleep.  I think she’s too old now 
                        to try again.

                                 CARL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re taller than your picture.  
                        Well, it seems like it anyway.  

           Carl faces his bed, slumps his shoulders self consciously.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I like your accent.

           Carl turns around, facing Catherine.
                                 CARL
                             (disturbed)
                        What about it?

                                 CATHERINE
                        I just think it’s swell.  Like a 
                        sophisticated English gentleman.

           She laughs.  Carl stares at her, expressionless.  

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Well, hurry down to dinner!  We 
                        open presents after!

           Catherine closes Carl’s door on her way out.

           SILENCE.  Carl takes a deep breath.

           He walks to the window and looks out at the falling snow.

           He looks around the room.  Approaches the CRIB in the corner.   
           He examines the tiny airplanes on the mobile.  He looks 
           inside -- an empty coffin like his father’s.  

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Father God, we thank you for your 
                        bountiful mercies this Christmas, 
                        for the men in service fighting for 
                        our freedom...

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl sits to Christmas dinner with the family, their heads 
           bowed in prayer.  

           Carl’s eyes OPEN -- the dog sits at his feet, watching him.

                                 RICHARD
                        ...And tonight we especially thank 
                        you for Carl.  For his secure 
                        voyage.  And for bringing him 
                        safely to our family.  Amen.

           The CLINKING of silverware as everyone eats.  Carl cuts into 
           the roast lamb with his knife.

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve been to England once, Carl.  
                        It was years ago, before we had 
                        Catherine.  I understand you’re 
                        from the Yorkshire area.
                                 CARL
                        Yes ma’am.  Rotherham, the south 
                        part.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, I forgot to mention, if there’s 
                        anything you need in your room, 
                        Joanna put fresh towels in the 
                        bathroom.  Or you call it the loo.

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, ma’am.  It’s quite 
                        comfortable.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Are you coming to Christmas Eve 
                        service after supper?

                                 RICHARD
                        Let him have a bite of dinner, Cat. 

                                 EMMA
                        What kind of bread would you like, 
                        Carl?

           The dog WHINES, begging for food.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hush, Sarge.

                                 CARL
                             (smiles)
                        Wheat, please.  Thank you.

           Emma passes a bowl of bread across the table to Carl.  

           The dog turns away and heads toward the kitchen. 

           MOVING WITH THE DOG

           The dog BARRELS through the SWINGING DOORS to the kitchen...

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Joanna carries silverware and a plate of lamb to her 
           segregated seat at the kitchen counter and sits down on a bar 
           stool.  A hand-written letter next to her plate.  

           She glances through the revolving kitchen door -- a glimpse 
           of Carl and the family eating and the MURMUR of voices.

           Joanna cuts a thin slice of lamb and feeds it to Sarge.  She 
           cuts a bite for herself, about to eat it.
                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Joanna!  More water please!

           Joanna sets her fork down and gets up.  

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joanna enters with a pitcher of water and refills Emma’s 
           glass.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to Joanna)
                        Did you get the letter from your 
                        sister?

                                 JOANNA
                        Yes, sir.  Thank you.

                                 EMMA
                        You’ve met our Joanna?

                                 CARL
                        Yes, ma’am.

                                 RICHARD
                        Her sister is still in Marseille, 
                        trying to get to Lisbon, then to 
                        America.

                                 EMMA
                        We took her in and gave her work 
                        after she immigrated here from 
                        Germany before the war.

           Joanna refills Richard’s glass.

                                 CATHERINE
                        No thanks, Jo.

                                 JOANNA
                        More water?

                                 CARL
                        Yes, please.

           Joanna takes Carl’s glass.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Jo can help you with anything.

           CLOSE ON WATER GLASS

           Joanna fills the glass and hands it...
                                 EMMA
                        She fled when Hitler began to 
                        persecute the Jews. 

           ...back to Carl.  Instantly repulsed by the thought of Jewish 
           touch, Carl drops the glass and it shatters on the floor.

           Silence.  Carl looks at Joanna and Emma and the Senator.  

                                 CARL
                        I...

           Richard LAUGHS.

                                 RICHARD
                        Not a word, Carl.  Joanna, get him 
                        another glass.  You’re exhausted 
                        from your journey, my boy.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Can we open presents now?

                                 RICHARD
                        Alright, everyone to the living 
                        room!

           ANGLE OVER DINING TABLE -- scraps of food on all of the 
           plates, but Carl’s plate is clean, his knife and fork neatly 
           arranged.  Carl picks up his plate and pushes in his chair.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, leave the plate, dear.  Joanna 
                        will take care of it.

           Carl nods and sets his plate back on the dining table.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Catherine motions for Carl to sit down next to her at the 
           foot of the tree by the CRACKLING fire.  

           Richard hands out presents to Emma, Carl and Catherine.

           Catherine hands Carl a small present.  Carl unwraps it -- a 
           box of tootsie roll candies.

                                 CATHERINE
                        They’re my favorite.  Do you have 
                        them in England?

                                 CARL
                        I don’t eat candy, but thank you.
                                 CATHERINE
                        Well you must try these!

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Joanna sweeps up the pieces of Carl’s broken glass.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Catherine opens a present -- she holds up a pair of earrings 
           and smiles at Emma, who sits on the sofa holding up a SILVER 
           NECKLACE like the one Carl’s mother wore.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, it’s beautiful, Richard.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Lovely, mother!  Oh, did you find 
                        out about the band?

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, they’re going to play.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother’s very progressive.  She’s 
                        hired a colored band to play at the 
                        New Year’s party.  She’s also 
                        friends with Eleanor Roosevelt.

                                 RICHARD
                        Who isn’t these days.

                                 EMMA
                        Richard.

           Carl opens his present and pulls aside the wrapping tissue -- 
           a pair of white pants, a black blazer and black tie.

                                 RICHARD
                        The Knox Academy uniform, Carl.  I 
                        wasn’t sure if you had a black 
                        blazer or the trousers.  Same style 
                        I wore there as a boy.  Brings back 
                        memories. 

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, sir.  I’m very grateful.

                                 EMMA
                        We should get to the service, 
                        Richard.
                                 RICHARD
                             (glances at his watch)
                        Oh, yes.

           EXT. GOTHIC CHURCH - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of an old stone Gothic church, the roof 
           covered in snow.  In the foreground, an icy gravel parking 
           lot packed with sedans.  

                                 CHURCH CONGREGATION  (V.O.)
                        And forgive us our sins, as we 
                        forgive those who sin against us. 
                        Lead us not into temptation; but 
                        deliver us from evil...  

           A black Ford sedan pulls into the parking spot.  Headlights 
           and engine cut off.  The door opens...

           ANGLE ON BOOTS as they hit a dirty mix of slush and gravel.

           INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

           The warm, eerie glow of a candlelight service.  Members of 
           the congregation light candles and recite the Lord’s Prayer.

           Carl stands next to Catherine, Emma and Richard in an aisle 
           seat in the middle of the sanctuary.  Emma lights Catherine’s 
           candle.  Catherine turns and lights Carl’s candle. 

                                 CHURCH CONGREGATION
                        ...For thine is the kingdom, the 
                        power, and the glory, for ever and 
                        ever.  Amen.

           Pastor LEE KIRKLAND (40’s), steps behind the pulpit, his face 
           radiant in the candle light, like a man possessed. 

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        Please be seated.  

           The congregation sits.

                                 CARL
                             (whispers to Catherine)
                        Why only candle light?

                                 CATHERINE
                             (whispers)
                        Pastor Lee follows the black out 
                        law for the east coast.  Didn’t you 
                        have the blackout in England?
                                 CARL
                        Yes, of course.

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        Christmas is a time to rejoice.  A 
                        time for kindred spirits, dinner 
                        parties and gifts.  But it is also 
                        a time for solemn reflection!  A 
                        reminder of why Christ had to be 
                        born in the flesh.  Make no 
                        mistake!  There’s sin in the world!  
                        In all of our hearts.  

           CLOSE ON CARL’S CANDLE -- the FLAME flickers with a gust of 
           wind.

           Carl turns around -- in the b.g., the door to the sanctuary 
           quietly closes.  A hunched man in a dark overcoat and fedora 
           takes a seat in the shadows of the far back pew.

                                 PASTOR LEE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a devil inside every man 
                        capable of unspeakable evil.
                             (beat)
                        But who in the world is too twisted 
                        by sin, too burdened by guilt, too 
                        far gone that he is beyond 
                        redemption?  

                                 CARL
                             (whispers to Catherine)
                        Going to the loo.  Be right back.

           Carl slides out of the pew and walks down the aisle...  

           INT. CHURCH LOBBY - NIGHT

           Carl enters the lobby when a giant hand grabs his shoulder.

           Carl looks up -- THE BRUMMBAR looms over him.  No mistaking 
           the bone-white face and sunken eyes of HERR BURMANN.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Good to see you again, Carl.  

                                 CARL
                        You’re the Brummbär?

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        A field name.  Walk with me.

           The Brummbär heads toward the exit, a lumbering but 
           methodical gate, and Carl follows him outside...
           EXT. GOTHIC CHURCH - NIGHT

           A mellifluous chorus resounds as the congregation sings 
           SILENT NIGHT.  The Brummbär lights a cigarette.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        You are the eyes and ears of the 
                        Reich now.         

           INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

           ANGLE ON CATHERINE

                                 CATHERINE
                             (singing)
                        Holy infant so tender and mild.

           She looks over her shoulder at the doors to the sanctuary.

           EXT. GOTHIC CHURCH - NIGHT

           The Brummbär hands Carl a silver micro-camera.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        A Minox Riga.  It may be useful.  

           Carl pockets it.  The Brummbär exhales a stream of smoke.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        There’s a park in the woods on the 
                        other side of the lake, about a 
                        mile from the estate.  We meet 
                        there Fridays at four.

           The Brummbär drops his cigarette, twists it out with his boot 
           and walks away from Carl toward the parking lot.

           INT. CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

           Carl enters the pew next to Catherine.  She smiles as she 
           sings the last lines of SILENT NIGHT.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Sleep in heavenly peace.  Sleep in 
                        heavenly peace.
           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Silence.  Carl lies in bed, eyes open.  He looks around the 
           room -- the silhouette of angels on the baby blue border.  
           The airplane MOBILE hanging over the crib gently sways. 

           Carl closes his eyes.

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           SUPER: “New Years Eve, 1942.”

           A row of sedans parked around the circular drive of the Dent 
           mansion.  The MUFFLED sound of a JAZZ BAND and MERRY VOICES 
           continue into...

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl, immaculate in a black suit and thin tie, his hair 
           neatly combed to the side, stands before his bed.  

           He unzips the false panel in his suitcase -- the stash of 
           currency, military knife and the Minox Riga camera.  He 
           removes the camera and tucks it in his coat pocket.  He zips 
           the suitcase, puts it back under the bed and leaves the 
           room...

           ON THE SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

           Carl looks down over the railing -- a black tie formal party 
           underway below with fifty mingling guests.  Men in tuxedos 
           and women dressed to the nines in fabulous dresses, hats, fur 
           coats and gloves.

           On the far side of the living room, an all-black jazz band in 
           matching white tuxedos with female vocalist singing Irving 
           Berlin’s CHEEK TO CHEEK.

           Carl takes out the tiny camera, a quick, furtive snap shot of 
           two men conversing with Senator Dent.  He pockets the camera 
           and walks down the stairs, among the guests...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A SERVER passes Carl with a tray of champagne.

                                 SERVER
                        Champagne, sir?

                                 CARL
                        No thank you.
           Carl notices the dog trailing Joanna through the crowd on the 
           other side of the room as she offers a tray of caviar and 
           crackers to guests.

           Carl makes his way through the crowd toward Senator Dent.  
           Suddenly, Emma stops Carl in his tracks.

                                 EMMA
                        David, this is Carl, the orphan boy 
                        from England we’ve taken in.  Carl, 
                        David Randolph, he’ll be one of 
                        your new classmates at the academy.

           DAVID RANDOLPH (15) a tall, muscular young man in a tuxedo 
           flashes a smug grin at Carl.  They shake hands.

                                 DAVID
                        I can show him around the school 
                        for you, Mrs. Dent.  

                                 EMMA
                        That’s very kind, David.
                             (a beat)
                        It’s polite to say thank you when 
                        someone offers you a favor, Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Yes, ma’am.
                             (to David)
                        Thank you.

                                 EMMA
                        David’s father Lawrence owns the 
                        three largest textile mills in the 
                        state.
                             (to David)
                        Catherine must have gone upstairs.  
                        She’s probably fixing her hair for 
                        the fiftieth time, but I know she 
                        wants to see you.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you, Mrs. Dent.

           Emma turns to an elegant, older woman, MRS. VON TOBEL (60).

                                 EMMA
                        Mrs. Von Tobel, I wanted to talk to 
                        you about a speaker for the women’s 
                        society... 

                                 DAVID
                             (walks away)
                        See you in class.
           Carl peruses the crowd for Senator Dent, but he is no longer 
           with the men at the far side of the room.  Carl turns -- 
           Catherine descends the stairs in a beautiful evening dress.

           David approaches her, but she breaks away from him and 
           continues into the crowd toward Carl, smiling.  

                                 SINGER
                        And my heart beats so that I can 
                        hardly speak.  And I seem to find 
                        the happiness I seek.  When we’re 
                        out together dancing cheek to 
                        cheek.  

           A CRASH of the cymbals and the song ends to sporadic 
           applause.  Catherine arrives at Carl’s side.   

                                 CATHERINE
                        Did you get champagne?

           David watches Carl and Catherine from across the room.

                                 CARL
                        I don’t drink.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Nobody minds.  I’ve already had 
                        two, though don’t tell mother.

           She laughs.  Carl cracks a smile.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, he smiles.

                                 CARL
                        I’m trying to find your father.

                                 SINGER
                             (into mic)
                        Thank you.  We’ll be back after a 
                        break.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Don’t you just love the band?  The 
                        white bands can’t hold a candle to 
                        ‘em.  Except maybe Benny Goodman.

                                 CARL
                        Is that all you like?  Black and 
                        Jewish music?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well, what do you like?
           Carl ignores Catherine and turns to Emma.

                                 CARL
                        Excuse me, Mrs. Dent, do you know 
                        where Senator Dent is? 

           One of the black musicians interrupts Emma.  He dabs his 
           sweaty face with a handkerchief and pockets it. 

                                 BLACK MUSICIAN
                        I wondered where I might be able to 
                        find the restroom, ma’am.

           Emma looks to the living room hall -- one of the guests steps 
           out of the restroom and rejoins a conversation.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s best if you go out to the 
                        guest house.  It’s just outside.  
                        You can get there from the kitchen.

                                 BLACK MUSICIAN
                        Yes, ma’am.

           The musician lowers his eyes in respect and leaves.

                                 EMMA
                             (to Carl)
                        Richard’s retired to the billiard 
                        room to talk more war and political 
                        nonsense.  But that’s for the men.  
                        He’ll be joining the party again 
                        soon.  

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, ma’am.

           Carl traverses the grand living room through the crowd toward 
           the billiard room, adjacent to the senator’s study.  

           Carl stops in his tracks -- the dog lies at the threshold of 
           the billiard room’s double doors like a guard at his post.  

           Carl looks around -- at the far side of the room, David in a 
           heated discussion with Catherine.  Carl spots a roving 
           server.  He grabs a meat canapé from the server’s tray...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Sarge.  Would you like 
                        something to eat?

           Sarge lifts his head, sniffing the air.  Carl drops the 
           canapé on the floor and walks away.  The dog takes the bait 
           and moves away from the doors toward the meat.  
           Carl gets to the billiard room doors and KNOCKS gently.  A 
           heavyset, gray-haired gentleman with a jolly disposition, 
           MILTON HAYES (55) opens the door.  

                                 MILTON
                        Yes?

                                 CARL
                        Mrs. Dent sent me to see if anyone 
                        needs anything.

                                 MILTON
                        I think we’re quite alright.

           Milton closes the door.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Wait!  Carl, come in here!

           Milton opens the door and Carl enters the billiard room...

           INT. BILLIARD/LIBRARY ROOM - NIGHT

           ...A haze of cigar smoke hovers over the room and four men 
           ensconced on plush burgundy leather chairs to one side of a 
           red-felt billiard table.  Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.

                                 CARL
                        Yes sir.

           Richard approaches Carl, a glass of brandy in hand.  He 
           guides Carl into the room toward an empty chair.

                                 RICHARD
                        I’d like you all to meet Carl.  A 
                        fine young man from England who has 
                        come to live with our family.  
                        Carl, Professor Milton Hayes, 
                        Pastor Lee Kirkland, and Glenn Taft 
                        of Taft Steel Corp.

           Polite nods from the men.  Richard pours Carl a glass of 
           brandy from a crystal decanter.

                                 MILTON
                        Won’t you join us for a pinch of 
                        brandy, Carl?

                                 RICHARD
                        He might as well, he’ll be a Knox 
                        Academy man this week.  Have a 
                        seat, Carl.
           Richard slaps Carl on the back.  A proud, welcoming smile.  
           Carl sits down with his glass of brandy, one of the men now.

                                 MILTON
                             (raises a glass)
                        Here here.  Class of ‘28, myself.  
                        Alright, class of ‘08.  Old men 
                        drink, young men fight wars.

           Carl swirls the brandy in his glass, emulating the other men, 
           but not drinking.

                                 RICHARD
                        As I was saying, I have reliable 
                        word that Roosevelt will soon 
                        endorse a policy of unconditional 
                        surrender for Germany.  He’s 
                        meeting with Churchill and Stalin 
                        somewhere in northern Africa.

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        I favor unconditional surrender.

                                 RICHARD
                        Do you think Christ would support a 
                        war of any kind, Lee?

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        Even our Lord had a sense of 
                        righteous anger when he threw the 
                        corrupt businessmen out of the 
                        temple.

                                 RICHARD
                        His kind of war was more in spirit.

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        The body is a vessel for the 
                        spirit...

                                 TAFT
                        If we could dispense with the 
                        foolishness, Senator, I have 
                        here...
                             (opens his briefcase)
                        ...a highly privileged list of 
                        contacts for you, good men like 
                        J.P. Getty’s associates in New 
                        York, with business interests still 
                        at stake in Germany.  

           Taft hands Richard a manila file from his briefcase. 
                                 TAFT (CONT’D)
                        I know this is a delicate matter, 
                        but these are powerful men willing 
                        to lend their support to a campaign 
                        against Roosevelt and his socialist 
                        agenda. 

           Richard takes the file and opens a side door from the library 
           to his study. 

                                 RICHARD
                        You know my position.  Hitler must 
                        be removed from power, but it’s 
                        absolutely vital to keep Germany 
                        intact as a buffer state against 
                        Stalin.  

                                 PASTOR LEE
                        A lesser of two evils?

           Carl peers through the open door to the study -- Richard 
           removes a RING OF KEYS from his pocket, unlocks his desk 
           drawer and places the file inside.  Then locks it again. 

                                 MILTON
                        You know, Carl, I have very fond 
                        memories of Knox.  I was in 
                        Richard’s class.  He was quite 
                        mischievous back then.  Did he tell 
                        you about the time he and 
                        O’Sullivan got three sheets to the 
                        wind and removed the tires from the 
                        headmaster’s new model T?

           Milton chuckles.

                                 MILTON (CONT’D)
                        Some people say he’s still doing 
                        that sort of thing in the senate.  

           Milton laughs heartily.  Carl smiles politely but tilts his 
           head to see around Milton into the study and sees...   

           CLOSE ON SENATOR’S KEYS

           Richard pockets the KEYS and returns to the billiards room.  
           He closes the door to the study and locks it with a latch. 

                                 RICHARD
                        History has a way of repeating 
                        itself, and we can’t afford another 
                        Versaille.
                                 PASTOR LEE
                        I’m afraid it’ll be hell for 
                        Germany this time.  There won’t be 
                        a purgatory.

           CLOSE ON CARL -- his jaw clenched.  A KNOCK at the door.

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes?

           Emma opens the door.

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me, gentlemen, time for the 
                        countdown!

           The men exit the room, Carl last to leave.  Emma glares at 
           Carl -- he’s not supposed to be there.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON BALLOONS

                                 EVERYONE (O.S.)
                        Eight, seven, six, five...

           MOVING DOWN from a netted cluster of balloons near the 
           chandelier to the room full of guests.

           Carl stands next to the Dent family, the Senator’s arm on his 
           shoulder.

                                 EVERYONE (CONT’D)
                        ...four, three, two, one!

           The CLOCK strikes midnight and the band plays an orchestral 
           AULD LANG SYNE...

                                 EVERYONE (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        Should old acquaintance be forgot, 
                        and never brought to mind?  

           Carl watches in awe at the drunken merriment -- Catherine 
           smiles at him.  

           Milton Hayes waves his hands in jubilation, pretending to 
           conduct the band.

                                 EVERYONE (CONT’D)
                        Should old acquaintance be forgot, 
                        and days of auld lang syne!
           The band concludes and the balloons drop.  APPLAUSE and 
           CHEERS ring in the new year!

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl gets out of bed, wearing pajamas.  He rolls on a pair of 
           socks and slips out the door...

           INTO THE HALLWAY

           Dead silence except for the TICK-TOCK of the grandfather 
           clock.  The hands reveal the time -- 3:05AM.

           Carl stops before the door to the master bedroom.  He slowly 
           turns the handle and pushes the door open...

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The feet of Senator Dent and Emma Dent visible at the end of 
           their separate twin beds, divided by a night stand.

           In the b.g., Carl stands framed by the door to their bedroom, 
           a dark silhouette backlit by the dim light of the hall.

           MOVING WITH CARL

           The Senator rolls to his other side in bed.

           Carl stops, motionless for a moment.  He reaches toward the 
           top of the antique dresser, lifts the senator’s KEYS out of a 
           ceramic bowl, and steps silently out of the room.  

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Carl takes the stairs down to the entryway...

           He glances at the closed door to Joanna’s bedroom.

           INT. JOANNA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joanna sleeps in her bed.  On the night stand lies a fountain 
           pen, reading glasses and pages of a letter.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl moves silently into the grand living room...

           The dog sleeps on the rug by the dying red embers in the 
           fireplace.  
           One of the wood floor planks SQUEAKS beneath Carl’s feet.

           The dog yawns and shifts positions.

           Carl continues forward toward the study, his feet safely 
           padded by the large oriental rug.  He opens the door to the 
           Senator’s study and enters...

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Carl crosses the room to the senator’s desk.  He turns on the 
           desk lamp with a CLICK.  Light bathes the desk top.

           He tries one of the KEYS to the locked drawer -- no luck.  He 
           tries another KEY -- the drawer opens.

           Carl reaches inside and removes the manila folder that Taft 
           gave to the senator...

           ANGLE ON PAGES OF DOCUMENTS

           Carl removes the Minox Riga from his pocket.  He lays the 
           file down under the lamp light and SNAPS a photograph...

           ...flips the page.  Another photo.  And another.

           He pockets the camera, closes the folder and replaces it in 
           the drawer.  He locks it with the key.

           A LOW, MENACING GROWL.

           Carl freezes.  He slowly turns --

           The dog blocks the doorway, lips curled back and teeth bared.  

           Carl removes the KEYS from the lock and pockets them.

                                 CARL
                        Down Sarge.

           The dog GROWLS again, standing its ground.

           Carl moves slowly toward the door to the billiard room.  He 
           tries the handle -- it won’t budge.

           FLASHBACK:

           The latch locked from within the billiard room side.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           No escape as the dog blocks the only exit.  Carl retreats 
           toward the desk.  He sees the LETTER OPENER...
                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Hush meine liebling.

           The dog inches forward, GROWLING, hind legs coiled, ready to 
           attack...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Gut hund.  Komm hier.

           Carl smiles and reaches for the LETTER OPENER...

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Gut hund.  

           Sarge inches forward and SPRINGS into the air at Carl...

           In one quick motion, Carl swipes the LETTER OPENER off the 
           desk and PLUNGES the blade into the thick bristling fur of 
           the dog’s neck.

           Carl falls onto his back on the rug, the dog on top of him.  
           The dog emits a soft, dying WHIMPER, its last breath.    

           EXT. BACKYARD OF DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           Snow falling over the backyard of the Dent estate.

           The back door opens -- a barefoot Carl lugs the dog’s body 
           out into the dark, freezing night. 

           Carl steps into the snowy yard, breathing heavily. He looks 
           around -- a guest house and woods on either side.  In the 
           distance, the yard slopes down toward the frozen lake.

           Carl trudges toward the woods beyond the guest house with the 
           body of the dog in his arms...

           INT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           Carl stands in the bathroom, Sarge’s blood and fur on his 
           shirt.  His teeth chattering.  He removes his shirt.   

           He washes the blood off the letter opener in the sink.  Dries 
           the blade on a towel.

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Carl places the letter opener on the senator’s desk.  He 
           reaches for the light switch on the desk lamp, then something 
           catches his eye -- a small blood stain on the carpet.  
           Carl bends down and slides the rug over the carpet to cover 
           the stain, then turns off the light. 

           INT. JOANNA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Joanna sits up in bed and turns on the lamp on the night 
           stand.  She listens to the CREAK of the stairs.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl walks up the stairs to the second floor with his bloody 
           shirt and the key in hand.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Carl opens the senator’s bedroom door and slips inside.  

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Carl puts the KEYS back in the bowl and slips out into the 
           hall, undetected, moving stealthily back toward his room...

           IN THE HALLWAY

                                 CATHERINE (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Carl turns around -- Catherine stands in the hallway in her 
           night gown.  Carl holds the bloody shirt behind his back.

                                 CARL
                        I needed a glass of water.

           Catherine eyes Carl’s bare, muscular chest.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        I couldn’t sleep.  I’m too dizzy 
                        from the champagne.

                                 CARL
                        I hope you feel better.  

           Catherine slowly approaches Carl...

           She puts her hand on the necklace with CYANIDE CAPSULE 
           hanging over Carl’s chest.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s this?

           A tense, romantic beat.
                                 CARL
                        It was a present from my mother.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, I’m sorry.  I...

           She leans in close to Carl, kisses him softly on the cheek.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you’re here with us.

           She heads back toward her room on the opposite side of the 
           hall.

                                 CARL
                        Well, goodnight.

           Carl enters his room and closes the door...

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl stuffs the bloody shirt and the Minox Riga camera into 
           the false panel of his suitcase. 

           He puts the case back under the bed and climbs into bed.  

           Pulls the sheets up.  He stares at the ceiling.  EXHALES.

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - DAWN

           A flurry of snow in the dawn air. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        I’m going to call the police, 
                        Richard.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN

           Richard gets out of bed and dons his bathrobe.

                                 RICHARD
                        What’s that?

           Emma stands in the doorway to the master bathroom, her make-
           up on, hair in curlers.  Her brow furrowed in anguish. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s been nearly three days.  He 
                        never stays out in the cold for 
                        this long.  
                                 RICHARD
                        He’ll turn up, dear.  

           Richard looks around the room for something...

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen my slippers?

                                 EMMA
                        They’re under the bed.

           Richard looks under the bed, retrieves his slippers and puts 
           them on, smiling with satisfaction.

                                 RICHARD
                        I should make sure Carl’s awake.  
                        It’s his first day at the academy. 

           Richard walks toward the door to the master bedroom...

                                 EMMA
                        Richard.  I’ve been meaning to tell 
                        you...

           Richard turns and faces Emma.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        ...There’s something bothering me 
                        about Carl.

                                 RICHARD
                        Really?  What is it?

                                 EMMA
                        Well, he’s not normal.  He seems 
                        socially maladjusted.  And I’m not 
                        sure it’s entirely relatable to his 
                        rigid English upbringing.

                                 RICHARD
                        He’s quiet, Emma.  An orphan in a 
                        new country.  I think it’s to be 
                        expected.  

                                 EMMA
                        We’ve been very kind to him, but 
                        he’s not family, you know.  You 
                        treat him like he’s your own son.  
                        He’s not a replacement, Richard.  
                        It’s not something you can just 
                        replace.   

           Richard SIGHS and exits the room.
           IN THE HALLWAY

           Richard walks down the hall and stops at the door to Carl’s 
           room.  A BRUSHING sound.  Richard KNOCKS on the door.

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           Richard opens the door -- Carl sits on his crisply-made bed, 
           POLISHING a pair of black dress shoes to a glossy shine with 
           a shoe brush.  He wears the black blazer and white pants of 
           the Knox Academy uniform.  His hair neatly combed.

                                 RICHARD
                        How’s the fit, Carl?

                                 CARL
                        Very good, sir.

           Richard nods and smiles proudly.

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE ROAD - DAY

           Carl rides a bicycle on a snow-shoveled roadway, surrounded 
           by woods.  A leather satchel over his shoulder.

           EXT. KNOX ACADEMY - DAY

           Establishing shot of the Knox Academy, gothic stone towers 
           and halls rising up from the blanket of snow.

           EXT. KNOX ACADEMY COURTYARD - DAY

           Carl parks his bicycle in the bike rack.

           He watches a scene in the courtyard -- David Randolph and two 
           of his buddies bully MARTIN (15), a frail, feminine-looking 
           boy with long bangs, who sits on a bench.  

           The school tower BELL RINGS.  

           Martin tries to stand and David shoves him back down on the 
           bench.  David and the others laugh.

           Carl ignores the scene and walks into the classroom...

                                 KANE (O.S.)
                        Attention men!  We have a new 
                        student with us.
           INT. KNOX ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY

           An austere classroom at the Knox Academy.  A BUZZING, 
           overworked radiator.  An American flag next to a blackboard. 

           The teacher, MR. KANE (50), a fit, militant man in a gray 
           suit, stands next to Carl at the front of the classroom. 

                                 KANE
                        An immigrant joining us all the way 
                        from England.  
                             (to Carl)
                        Please introduce yourself to the 
                        class, Carl.

                                 CARL
                             (nervous)
                        Yes, sir.  Hello.  My name is Carl 
                        Demer.  I’m from Yorkshire, 
                        England.    

                                 STUDENT
                             (while coughing)
                        Pansy!

           SNICKERS from the class.  

                                 KANE
                        Quiet!  

           Carl lowers his eyes, shifts nervously.

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, find an open desk, Carl.  

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

           PAN across rows of boys.  Carl sits down in the only empty 
           seat in the back of the room, in front of David Randolph.  A 
           menacing smile from David.

                                 KANE (O.S.)
                        All rise for the Pledge of 
                        Allegiance!

           The classroom full of boys in uniform stand.  They extend 
           their hands in a ROMAN SALUTE toward the American flag, 
           eerily similar to the Nazi salute.

           Carl extends his hand like the others.
                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Headmaster Burns has reminded me of 
                        the order passed by congress.  We 
                        will no longer salute the flag in 
                        the traditional way.  Cross your 
                        right hand over your heart!  Like 
                        so!  Everyone!  

           Mr. Kane demonstrates the new posture, and the boys cross 
           their hands over their hearts.  

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        You may begin...

                                 CHORUS OF BOYS
                        I pledge allegiance to the flag of 
                        the United States of America, and 
                        to the Republic for which it 
                        stands: One Nation, indivisible, 
                        with liberty and justice for all! 

           CLOSE ON CARL -- his hand over his heart, but silent...

                                 KANE
                        Be seated!

           The boys take their seats.

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        I did not hear you, Mr. Demer!  

           Mr. Kane stalks the aisle toward Carl.

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Why did I not hear you recite the 
                        pledge?

           Carl stands, assuming a rigid military posture before Kane. 

                                 CARL
                        I do not know the words yet, sir.  
                        We didn’t say it in England.

                                 KANE
                        I did not say stand!  Sit down, Mr. 
                        Demer!

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

           Carl takes a seat.  David Randolph kicks Carl’s leg.  Carl 
           looks back at David who smirks...
                                 KANE
                        Look at me when I’m speaking to 
                        you, Mr. Demer.  You are in America 
                        now.  And you will conform. You 
                        will know the words to the pledge 
                        of allegiance by next class or you 
                        will not have a place in my 
                        classroom.  Is that clear?

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

                                 KANE
                        Alright, open your lesson books...

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY

           A gloved hand uses an ice skimmer to scoop away slush from 
           the edge of a fishing hole a couple feet in diameter across 
           the ice.

           A weathered OLD MAN (70) with a prickly white beard tosses 
           the ice skimmer on top of his tobaggan next to a gaff hook 
           and auger.  He takes a sip of warmth from a flask.  

           In the b.g., the Dent estate barely visible across the lake. 

           The old man hooks a minnow from his bait bucket and tosses 
           his fishing line into the hole.  

           A CRUNCH of STEPS in the snow.  The old man turns -- Carl 
           leans his bicycle against a tree trunk and trudges toward the 
           woods beyond the lake...

           The old man’s gaze returns to the fishing hole.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Carl plods through the snowy woods, satchel over his 
           shoulder. 

           CAW-CAW.   A flutter of wings.  A RAVEN flies from its perch.

           EXT. BASEBALL PARK - DAY

           Carl enters a clearing -- a baseball park with snow-covered 
           bleachers and fencing.  A row of benches to the side.

           The Brummbär sits on one of the benches, wearing a snow-
           speckled black overcoat and fedora, his shoulders hunched.  
           He smokes a cigarette.
                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Getting used to America, Carl?

                                 CARL
                        A little.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        A little is necessary.  You must be 
                        like them, but not one of them.
                             (off look)
                        What do you have to report?

                                 CARL
                        On New Year’s Eve, the senator met 
                        with a man named Taft who gave him 
                        a file with some names of American 
                        businessmen with ties to German 
                        industry.  I managed to photograph 
                        the file.  It’s on the film.  

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Good.

                                 CARL
                        And the senator mentioned an Allied 
                        conference in northern Africa soon.  
                        He expects that Roosevelt will 
                        demand unconditional surrender.

           The Brummbär nods.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Any problems at the home?

                                 CARL
                        The dog was a problem when I got 
                        the file, but I took care of it.  

           A cold, piercing stare from the Brummbär.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        What about the family?

                                 CARL
                        They don’t suspect anything.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Be certain they don’t.  
           EXT. DENT ESTATE - DAY

           The Senator shovels snow out of the circular driveway in 
           front of the estate.  He looks up, sees Carl riding his 
           bicycle down the drive and waves.

           Carl gets off his bicycle, leans it against the fountain 
           wall.

                                 RICHARD
                        My New Year’s resolution is to 
                        clear the damn drive.  Give me a 
                        hand, Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

           Richard smiles, hands Carl a shovel.  

                                 RICHARD
                        It’s always important for a man to 
                        work with his hands.
                             (a beat)
                        How was your first day at the 
                        academy?

           Carl glances up at the darkening horizon.

                                 CARL
                        Good, sir.

           The flutter of a curtain in an upstairs window -- Carl 
           notices that Emma watches them.

           He lowers his head and shovels a patch of snow off the drive.

           EXT. BACKYARD OF DENT ESTATE - DUSK

           The dog’s corpse wedged between the roots of a birch tree, 
           its matted fur covered in snow, nearly invisible in the 
           waning light of dusk.

                                 JOANNA
                        Sarge!  Here boy!  Sarge!

           In the b.g., Joanna approaches.  She doesn’t see the dog.  
           She turns around, heads back toward the estate.

           E/I. BURTONSVILLE POLICE STATION - DAY

           A bundled-up Deputy Roy Quinn and officer Eddie Raslo enter 
           the police station holding steaming cups of coffee.  
                                 EDDIE
                        My brother met a surgeon in upstate 
                        New York.  If he agrees to it, I 
                        could get hernia surgery.  If it 
                        heals alright, maybe I could still 
                        enlist.

           An office PHONE RINGS. 

                                 QUINN
                        That’s three or four ifs in that 
                        sentence.

           Quinn and Eddie walk through the austere lobby.  MERYL 
           (50’s), a secretary, answers a rotary phone at her desk.  

                                 MERYL
                        Burtonsville police, Meryl 
                        speaking...

           Quinn enters a small office with DEPUTY ROY QUINN stenciled 
           on the door and Eddie follows, closing the door behind them.

           INT. QUINN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Quinn throws his jacket on the back of his chair and takes a 
           seat at his desk.  He lights a cigarette.

                                 QUINN
                        Maybe you gotta reconcile to the 
                        fact that not everybody gets to 
                        make a damn difference.  Some 
                        people live in Burtonsville.

           Quinn sets his cigarette in an ashtray and picks up a copy of 
           W. L. White’s They Were Expendable from the desk.

                                 EDDIE
                        Maybe I don’t think the same way.

           Quinn opens his desk drawer, searching for something...  

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I mean, we got limited 
                        perspective...

                                 QUINN
                        Christ, Eddie.  It’s too early in 
                        the morning.

           He opens another drawer -- combs through the loose contents.
                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        Where are my goddamn glasses?

           Eddie reaches across the desk and retrieves Quinn’s GLASSES.  

           QUINN’S POV -- the pages of the novel go from BLURRED to 
           FOCUSED as Quinn puts on his glasses.

           A KNOCK.  Meryl opens the door.    

                                 MERYL
                        Fred Granger’s truck slid off the 
                        road this morning and hit a power 
                        line over on Crawford.  

                                 QUINN
                        Send Brady out there.

                                 MERYL
                        And Mrs. Emma Dent called.  The 
                        senator’s wife.

           Quinn looks up from his book.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        She’s lost her dog and wants an 
                        officer to come out to the house. 

                                 QUINN
                        Well, somebody call the police.

           Meryl laughs.

                                 QUINN (CONT’D)
                        Three generations of service, and I 
                        knew the Air Force turned me down 
                        for a reason, Meryl.

                                 EDDIE
                        You get to secure the home front.

           INT. KNOX ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY

           Carl copies geography lessons from the blackboard, writing 
           left-handed.

           Mr. Kane gets up from his desk and walks down the aisle 
           toward Carl.  He stops before Carl’s desk and takes the 
           pencil out of Carl’s left hand.
                                 KANE
                        This academy will not tolerate bad 
                        habits.  Write with your proper 
                        hand.

           Carl takes the pencil in his right hand.  He looks down at 
           his lesson book.  Struggles to continue writing.  

           A BELL sounds, and the other boys pack up their bags...

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Physical fitness next week men!  
                        Rope climbing and swimming!  

           The boys exit the classroom in a rush.  Carl grabs his 
           satchel and lesson book, the last one to leave the classroom.

           EXT. KNOX ACADEMY - DAY

           Carl enters the walkway overlooking the snowy courtyard.  

           He walks with his head down as he puts his lesson book into 
           the satchel... 

                                 DAVID (O.S.)
                        Hey orphan boy!  

           A figure SHOVES Carl into a classroom window...glass SHATTERS 
           and Carl falls to the ground amidst the shards.

           David Randolph stands over Carl.  He and two buddies 
           laughing.

           Carl picks up his satchel and lesson book and faces David 
           Randolph and the others.   

           David grabs a piece of broken glass, holding it up toward 
           Carl in a threatening manner.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Look what you did.  
                             (beat)
                        Do you miss your own country yet?

           The sound of a door OPENING.

                                 KANE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Randolph, what is this?!

           David presses the jagged glass into his hand, drawing blood.  
           He holds up his bloody hand to Mr. Kane.
                                 DAVID
                        He pushed me into the window, sir.

           Mr. Kane glares at Carl.

                                 CARL
                        I didn’t.  

           Mr. Kane grabs Carl by the collar.  Ushers him down the hall.

                                 KANE
                        In my office, now!

           Mr. Kane opens an office door and pushes Carl inside.  He 
           enters the office and SLAMS the door.

           INT. DENT ESTATE, RICHARD’S STUDY - DAY

           The PURR of a vacuum cleaner as Joanna cleans the carpet in  
           the senator’s study with a Hoover.  Suddenly, she notices 
           something and turns off the vacuum cleaner.  The rug appears 
           to have been moved.  

           She bends down and slides the rug back in place, revealing a 
           red stain in the carpet.  She scrubs it with a hand towel, 
           suspiciously eyes the towel.  She glances behind her at the 
           door to the study -- nobody there.  

           INT. DENT ESTATE, CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Catherine watches through her bedroom window -- Carl rides 
           his bicycle up the drive to the Dent Estate. 

           She finishes her knitting, the RED and WHITE scarf (nearly 
           complete) and locks it in the jewelry box on her dresser. 

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - DAY

           The Senator shovels snow out of the circular drive with 
           intense determination.  He sees Carl and waves.

           Carl gets off his bicycle.

                                 RICHARD
                        Give me a hand, Carl.

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

           Richard smiles, hands Carl a shovel.  
           The RUMBLE of a car engine.  Richard turns around -- a black 
           POLICE CAR with white doors pulls into the circular drive.

           The police car parks fifteen yards away in the shoveled part 
           of the drive, and officer Quinn steps out... 

                                 RICHARD
                        Just a minute.

           Richard sets his shovel down and approaches officer Quinn.

           Carl shovels snow, his eye on Quinn and Richard.  Murmuring, 
           indecipherable voices.  Carl can’t hear the exchange.  

           Richard motions toward the front door, then returns to Carl.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        I told her not to worry about the 
                        damn dog.  Probably off hunting in 
                        the woods again.  

           Richard picks up his shovel.  

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        He brought back a dead rabbit last 
                        winter.  Left it on the porch, a 
                        bloody mess.  

           EXT. DENT ESTATE, FRONT PORCH - DAY

           Quinn walks up the steps to the front porch.  He shakes the 
           snow off his boots.  KNOCKS at the door.

           He glances back at Carl...

           QUINN’S POV -- Carl shovels snow, LEFT-HANDED.

           Quinn KNOCKS on the door again.  Emma opens the door.  Quinn 
           takes off his hat in deference.

                                 EMMA
                        Thank heavens.  Come in, come in...

                                 QUINN
                        Now I can’t stay long, ma’am, and 
                        I’m not exactly sure what I can...

           Emma pulls Quinn inside the house and SHUTS the door.
           INT. DENT ESTATE, DINING ROOM - DAY

           The CLANK of silverware.  Carl eats a roast chicken dinner 
           with the family.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        The president’s coming to the 
                        house.

           CLOSE ON KNIFE -- Carl stops cutting his chicken.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s not for certain, Catherine. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        But you said...

                                 EMMA
                        I said he might be coming.  He most 
                        likely will be here for Eleanor.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother’s society is presenting 
                        Eleanor Roosevelt with an award for 
                        her work in women’s rights.  

           Carl takes a sip of water.  He smiles.

                                 RICHARD
                        Pass the salt, please Emma.

           Emma passes the salt to Richard.  

           Catherine looks up from a film magazine by her plate.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Do you want to go to the pictures 
                        this weekend?

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know.  I’ve never been.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What!?  Then we have to go!  

                                 EMMA
                        I told you not to bring those 
                        magazines to the dinner table.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re just crabby because the 
                        police won’t help with Sarge.
                                 EMMA
                        Joanna, more water please!

                                 RICHARD
                        Carl, Emma tells me she received a 
                        call from Howard Kane at the 
                        academy.   That you got into an 
                        altercation with another boy.

                                 EMMA
                        I thought we’d discuss it after 
                        dinner, Richard.

                                 RICHARD
                        I want to hear Carl’s side now.

           Joanna enters the room.  She refills Emma’s water glass.  

                                 CARL
                        I was caught, sir...between the 
                        devil and the deep blue sea.

           Joanna looks up at Carl.

                                 RICHARD
                        Excuse me?

                                 JOANNA
                        Sprechen sie Deutsche?

                                 CARL
                        No, I...

                                 JOANNA
                        We say that in Germany.  Like 
                        ‘between a rock and a hard place’.

                                 CARL
                        We say it in England as well.

                                 RICHARD
                             (impatient)
                        Well, what happened, Carl?

                                 CARL
                        He pushed me into a window, sir.

                                 RICHARD
                        That’s what I thought.  That’s all 
                        I wanted to know.

           Richard takes a bite of chicken, satisfied.  
           Joanna stares at Carl suspiciously.  She exits the dining 
           room to the kitchen...

                                 EMMA
                        Mr. Kane said that you pushed the 
                        other boy, that he cut his hand on 
                        the glass, and that you broke a 
                        classroom window.  Another offense 
                        and you’ll be suspended...

                                 RICHARD
                        Emma, I think...

                                 EMMA
                        At the risk of sounding callous, if 
                        you’re suspended, you may have to 
                        return to England, Carl.  It’s not 
                        what we want, but...

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother!  That’s not fair!  He 
                        didn’t...

                                 RICHARD
                        Alright, that’s enough!  I believe 
                        Carl is telling the truth.

           Emma glares at Richard.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        There won’t be another incident.  
                        Am I right, Carl?

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

                                 RICHARD
                             (to Emma)
                        I’ll speak with him after dinner.

           Carl lowers his head, takes another bite of his dinner.

           INT. RICHARD’S STUDY - DUSK

           Carl opens the study door and enters -- Senator Dent stands 
           at his desk opening a small shipping crate.  He removes a 
           bottle of scotch and a model plane from the crate.  

                                 CARL
                        You wanted to see me, sir?

           Richard hands Carl the model plane.
                                 RICHARD
                        The Martin XB-48 bomber.  We’re 
                        voting on funding next session.  I 
                        thought you might like to see it.  
                        It will be propelled by jet 
                        engines.  A new technology the 
                        Germans are also developing.

           Carl studies the model, a cast iron type with a sharp metal 
           nose extending from the cockpit.

                                 CARL
                        My father gave me a plane like this 
                        before he went to war...an RAF 
                        model.

                                 RICHARD
                        You can keep it, then.  

           Richard retrieves his pipe from the desk, stuffs it with 
           tobacco...

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        You know, it wasn’t all roses for 
                        me at the academy.  I got in a 
                        fight once with a bully named Grant 
                        Berley.  And I won.  Nothing wrong 
                        with a fight in self defense.  Been 
                        fighting bullies my whole life, now 
                        it’s Truman in the senate...

           Richard smiles warmly and puts his hand on Carl’s shoulder.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        It can take a while to get adjusted 
                        at a new school.  Don’t get down.  

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, sir.

           Richard grabs his newspaper from the desk and ushers Carl out 
           of the study into the living room...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK

           Richard sits down on the sofa with his pipe and newspaper.  
           Carl sits across from him and examines the model plane.

           A RAY of SUNLIGHT shines through the lace curtains onto the 
           living room floor next to Catherine, who flips through the 
           record collection in the cabinet.
                                 CARL
                        Sorry to interrupt sir, but when is 
                        the party for the president’s wife?

                                 RICHARD
                             (looks up from his paper)
                        The 20th of next month, I believe.  
                        Why do you ask?

           CLOSE ON RECORD PLAYER -- Catherine puts on a record.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on, Carl, let’s dance!

           APPLAUSE and the first notes of a live recording of WHY DON’T 
           YOU DO RIGHT, Peggy Lee’s sultry vocals over this scene... 

                                 CARL
                        Just curious, sir.  It’s exciting 
                        to have the president visit.

                                 RICHARD
                             (looking at the paper)
                        It’ll be a damn mess.  Secret 
                        service everywhere.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on, Carl!

           Catherine motions for Carl to join her on the rug.  She 
           smiles playfully.

           IN THE ENTRYWAY

           Emma stops half-way up the stairs, a stern appraising eye on 
           Catherine and Carl.  She continues upstairs...

           IN THE LIVING ROOM

           Carl manages a half-smile.  Shakes his head “no”.  He looks 
           to the Senator, absorbed in his newspaper.  Then back at 
           Catherine -- she laughs and shakes her hips to the reckless 
           rhythm of BENNY GOODMAN’S CLARINET.

           Catherine tosses her white dress side to side and moves her 
           bare feet in a solo jitterbug.  

           The lone ray of sunlight plays with the folds of her dress.

                                 RECORD
                        You let other women make a fool of 
                        you.  Why don’t you do right, like 
                        some other men do?
                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on, Carl!

           Carl looks down, embarrassed.  

           For the first time, he can’t keep his eyes off of Catherine.  
           He glances up, mesmerized by her beauty and the freedom of 
           her movements.

                                 RECORD
                        I fell for your jivin’ and I took 
                        you in.  Now all you got to offer 
                        me’s a drink of gin.  Why don’t you 
                        do right like some other men do?  
                        Like some other men do...

           The live recording ends with a round of APPLAUSE, and 
           Catherine curtseys for Carl.  

           Carl smiles, the first genuine smile we’ve seen from him.

                                 RICHARD
                             (folds his newspaper)
                        Looks like they executed those six 
                        German spies who came ashore by U-
                        boat.  

           Carl’s smile fades, his eyes cold...

           EXT. KNOX ACADEMY, PARKING LOT - DAY

           Carl walks his bicycle through the nearly empty parking lot 
           of the Knox Academy.  

           At the far side of the lot, David Randolph leans on a Ford 
           coupe.  Two of his buddies with him. 

                                 DAVID
                        Hey Carl!  Come over here!  

           He and his buddies laugh.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Come on Carly!  We just want to 
                        talk to ya!

           Carl ignores them, his head down.  He walks his bicycle 
           toward the entrance to the snowy courtyard...
           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Mr. Kane stands before Carl and his classmates, all wearing 
           thigh-length gym shorts, t-shirts and converse athletic 
           shoes.  

           In the b.g., two knotted ropes hang from the rafters on 
           either side of an American flag.

                                 KANE
                        The rope is a test of strength and 
                        agility, and a part of army basic 
                        training.  Your objective is to be 
                        the first to touch the high knot 
                        and back down.  Volunteers, men!?

           Silence.

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Alright, then.  Martin and Carl!

           Carl steps forward.  David and his buddies laugh, clearly 
           relishing the match-up.  Martin, the frail boy with long 
           bangs takes his place by the other rope.

           Mr. Kane blows his WHISTLE.

           Carl and Martin ascend the ropes.  Hand over hand.

           David and his buddies LAUGH and JEER at Martin, who struggles 
           to reach the midpoint.

           Carl reaches the top, his head next to the American flag, and 
           passes Martin on his way down...

                                 DAVID
                             (mock cheering)
                        Come on Martin!  Hey, I think he 
                        likes it up there!

           More LAUGHTER.

                                 KANE
                        Quiet, men!

           Martin struggles to hold on to the rope.  His grip slipping.  
           Agony and despair on his face. 

           Martin lets go and falls ten feet to the floor.  He hits the 
           gym mat with a THUD.
                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                        Get up, Martin!  This is a lesson 
                        to you men.  A company is only as 
                        strong as its weakest member! 

           Martin slowly gets up, embarrassed and grimacing in pain, 
           holding his arm.

           LAUGHTER all around.  Carl’s face cold, expressionless. 

                                 KANE (CONT’D)
                             (blows whistle)
                        Silence!

           INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Mr. Kane stands before the aqua green water of the indoor 
           swimming pool, his whistle in hand.

                                 KANE
                        In your places, men!  One hundred 
                        meter sprint at my whistle!  

           The boys, wearing swimsuits, step to the edge of the pool.

           Carl looks to his left -- David Randolph in the next lane.

           Carl stares at the glassy surface of the pool water.  The 
           WHISTLE sounds and Carl dives into the pool.

           INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Carl swims free-style through the water, neck and neck with 
           David Randolph in the adjacent lane...

           Carl pulls ahead on the return lap.

           Hard, fast strokes...

           FLASHBACK:

           EXT. NORTH SEA - NIGHT

           Carl’s powerful strokes toward the English coastline.

           END FLASHBACK.
           INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY

           Carl touches the wall and looks up, BREATHING HARD -- David 
           reaches the wall a few seconds behind him.

                                 KANE
                        Well done, Carl.  Let’s go, men!

           David glares at Carl.  Gets out of the pool.

           The others struggle to finish their laps.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Carl and a few other boys dress in their school uniforms next 
           to a row of lockers.  The other boys finish dressing and 
           leave.

           Carl combs his hair.  Slides the comb in his back pocket and 
           picks up his satchel.  Heads for the exit...  

           ...where David Randolph and his two buddies wait for him.

                                 DAVID
                        Hey orphan boy.  

           His buddies laugh. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You can put on our uniform, play 
                        dress up all you want, but you’re 
                        still a no-class orphan pansy.  
                        You’re a nobody.

           A CLANK.  A door opens -- in the b.g., Mr. Kane enters the 
           locker room and heads to a small office. 

           Carl glances at Mr. Kane and tries to step around David and 
           his buddies, but David shoves him back against a locker.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Kane’s not going to help you.  
                        My father is on the school board.  
                        I can’t get suspended for fighting.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM OFFICE - DAY

           Mr. Kane puts his whistle in his office drawer and looks 
           through the window just as...
           INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           ...SMACK!  David punches Carl, a hard right to the cheek.

           Again, Carl looks at Mr. Kane, who averts his eyes.  Carl 
           cannot fight back without risking expulsion.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe because you’re a foreigner, 
                        you don’t understand things the 
                        first time.

           David SLUGS Carl in the mouth, twice as hard this time.

           Carl barely flinches.  He faces David, an icy, unnerving 
           stare.  Smiles through bloody teeth.  

           David rubs his punching hand.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                             (disturbed)
                        Let’s get out of here.

           David and his buddies run out of the locker room.

           Mr. Kane exits his office.  Locks up.  He saw everything but 
           leaves the locker room without a word.

                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                        I usually hide in the back until 
                        they leave.

           Carl turns, facing Martin, who wears his uniform and a 
           NEWSBOY-STYLE hat.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        I could never take a punch like 
                        that.

           Carl spits up a wad of blood on the white tile floor.

                                 CARL
                        What does he want?

                                 MARTIN
                        He’s just a bully.  That and he 
                        used to go submarine watchin’ with 
                        Catherine Dent ‘til you came 
                        around.

                                 CARL
                        Submarine watching?
                                 MARTIN
                        You know, neckin’ over on lover’s 
                        lane.  His father bought him a car 
                        so he can get around...

                                 CARL
                        I’m not with Catherine.

           Martin goes to the locker room door.

                                 MARTIN
                        Sure.  I hear she’s got the hots 
                        for ya.  
                             (beat)
                        Well, I gotta get to work.  I play 
                        clarinet some nights at the Jive 
                        Cafe.  You should stop by and I’ll 
                        get ya a soda on the house or 
                        something.  

           Martin leaves the locker room.

           Carl walks over to the sink.  Turns on the faucet.  He takes 
           a swig of water and spits up blood.  Blood swirls around the 
           white sink and down the drain.

           Carl looks at himself in the mirror.

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY

           Carl leans his bicycle against a tree at the edge of the 
           woods.  He glances at the frozen lake -- the old man ice 
           fishing next to his toboggan.

           Carl scoops up a handful of snow.  Presses it to his lip.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (O.S.)
                        What happened?

           EXT. BASEBALL PARK - DAY

           Carl faces the Brummbär slumped at his park bench seat, takes 
           the ice off his lip.

                                 CARL
                        Nothing.  Just a bully at the 
                        school.  It’s not a problem.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        What do you have to report?
                                 CARL
                        The senator said they’re developing 
                        a new bomber with jet technology.  
                        The Martin XB-48.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Can you find out the location of 
                        the build factory?

                                 CARL
                        They’re not building it yet.  He’s 
                        voting on the funding next session.  
                        There’s something else...
                             (a beat)
                        The American president is coming to 
                        the house.

           A tense beat.   

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        When is this?

                                 CARL
                        In two weeks.  The senator’s wife 
                        is hosting a party to present an 
                        award to Eleanor Roosevelt.  The 
                        president will be there when she 
                        receives it.

           The Brummbär stands, looming over Carl.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        You may have been given an 
                        opportunity, Carl... 

           The Brummbär opens his jacket, removes a GERMAN LUGER.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        ...to be a hero for the fatherland.

           He loads a clip into the Luger and hands it to Carl.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        I will notify Berlin.
                             (beat)
                        Can you secure the gun somewhere in 
                        the house?

           Carl looks up at the Brummbär, jaw clenched.
           INT. DENT ESTATE, CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Catherine, wearing a black and white POLKA DOT swing dress 
           with puff sleeves, applies RED lipstick before the mirror.

           She looks out the window -- Carl rides his bicycle down the 
           drive to the house.  

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - DAY

           Carl pedals towards Richard, who shovels snow.  Richard looks 
           up at Carl.  He smiles and waves.  

           Carl adjusts the Luger inside his coat pocket.

           INT. BRUMMBAR’S APARTMENT - DAY

           A small study.  The Brummbär sits down at a desk, opens the 
           lid to a wooden case.  Inside -- a German ENIGMA machine.

           INT. CARL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Joanna dusts the dresser top in Carl’s bedroom.  She picks up 
           the cast iron model plane, dusts beneath it and sets it down.

           She opens Carl’s closet, combs through the neatly hanging 
           clothes.  

           She closes the closet and looks around the room, spotting 
           Carl’s suitcase under the bed.  She slides out the case and 
           opens the latch with a CLICK -- nothing inside.  She looks 
           closely at the bottom of the case -- a small red stain.  She 
           closes the suitcase with a CLICK. 

                                 CARL (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Joanna stands and turns around -- Carl blocks the doorway.

                                 JOANNA
                        Nothing.  I was dusting.

                                 CARL
                        My suitcase is clean enough.

           Carl picks up the cast iron plane from the dresser -- the 
           sharp tip of the plane could easily be used to kill someone.

           Joanna looks at Carl, frightened.  She nervously walks by him 
           and leaves the room.
           Carl closes the door behind her.  He sets the plane back on 
           the dresser and approaches his suitcase.  He removes the 
           LUGER from his coat pocket.  A double KNOCK.

                                 RICHARD (O.S.)
                        Carl!

           Carl quickly puts the Luger back in his coat pocket.  Richard 
           enters the room with a smile, holding a garment bag.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        I forgot to mention, Emma and I 
                        ordered a tuxedo for you.  I felt 
                        bad that you didn’t have one at the 
                        New Year’s party.  

                                 CARL
                        Thank you, sir.  

                                 RICHARD
                        I’m back in session next week, but 
                        Emma can have it altered if 
                        needed...have a look.

           He unzips the bag and hands Carl a black tuxedo...

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead, try on the jacket.

                                 CARL
                        Right now, sir?

                                 RICHARD
                        Why not?

           Carl carefully removes his overcoat, looking for a place to 
           set it down, but Richard grabs it out of his hands.  

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        I’ll hold that.

           Catherine enters the room.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Can we take the car to the pictures 
                        tonight!?  Carl’s never been.

                                 RICHARD
                        Fine.  If you’re back by eleven.

           A joyful Catherine kisses her father on the cheek.  

           Carl puts on the tuxedo jacket, his eyes glued to the outline 
           of the LUGER in the coat in Richard’s hands.
                                 CATHERINE
                        So you’ll go?

                                 CARL
                             (distracted)
                        Alright.

           Richard tosses Carl’s overcoat on the bed.  

                                 RICHARD
                             (smiles proudly)
                        I’ll say.  You’re ready to meet the 
                        president in that jacket, Carl.  

           Carl looks at the bed, the Luger still concealed.

                                 CARL
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Catherine drives past The Picture Palace movie theater on the 
           street corner.  The marquee shows CASABLANCA still playing.

                                 CARL
                        I thought we were going to the 
                        pictures...

           Catherine smiles, mischievously.

           EXT. JIVE CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The sedan turns into a snow-shoveled parking lot full of 
           jalopies with bald tires surrounded by chain link fence.  A 
           faded sign on the brick building reads: “THE JIVE CAFE.”  

           The faint sound of DRUMS and live JAZZ. 

           INT. JIVE CAFE - NIGHT

           Catherine pulls Carl inside a small but rowdy dance hall full 
           of jiving young adults, a few young men in naval uniforms. 

           Catherine pushes through a crowd, pulling Carl along... 

           Carl SLAMS into a NAVY OFFICER (20) who spills his drink. 

                                 NAVY OFFICER
                        Watch where you’re headed, 
                        civilian!   
           White booths line the walls and an open wood floor stretches 
           across to a stage at the far side.  A six piece jazz BAND 
           with piano and brass playing an instrumental intro... 

           Catherine and Carl slide into an empty booth.  Carl watches 
           the free spirits of the couples on the dance floor.  

                                 CATHERINE
                             (beaming)
                        What do you think?!  This is what 
                        it’s all about, Carl!

           Carl looks to the stage -- a bright SPOTLIGHT traces the 
           moves of the singer, BETTIE BIRD (18) in her swinging RED 
           dress.  She belts out an up-tempo rendition of Fats Waller’s 
           AIN’T MISBEHAVIN. 

                                 BETTIE
                             (singing)
                        No one to talk with, all by myself, 
                        no one to walk with, but I’m happy 
                        on the shelf.  Ain’t misbehavin, 
                        I’m savin’ my love for you.

           The SPOTLIGHT shifts from the singer to the wiry thin MARTIN 
           on jazz clarinet.  He plays a lively solo, his frail figure 
           larger than life through his music.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on, Carl!  Let’s dance!

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know!

                                 CATHERINE
                        You don’t know what!?

           Catherine takes Carl’s hand. 

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know how!

                                 CATHERINE
                        You don’t drink!  You don’t dance 
                        or go to the pictures!  You’re a 
                        piece o’ work!

           The song ends to CHEERS.

                                 BETTIE
                             (over mic)
                        We’ll be back in five, hep cats!

           Carl looks down shyly, with vulnerability.
           EXT. JIVE CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           A Ford coupe pulls into a parking spot at the Jive Cafe.  
           David Randolph gets out of the car.  SLAMS the door.

           INT. JIVE CAFE - NIGHT

           Martin approaches Carl’s booth, two opened coca-cola bottles 
           in hand. 

                                 MARTIN
                        Hey, you made it!  Drinks on the 
                        house, whud I tell ya!   

           Martin slides the drinks over to Carl and Catherine.

                                 MARTIN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Catherine.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Thanks.

           Carl takes a sip and COUGHS.

                                 MARTIN
                        I put a couple shots in there.

           Martin opens his jacket, the top of a flask visible on the 
           inside pocket.  

           The singer Bettie arrives at the table next to Martin.  
           Smiles flirtatiously at Carl.

                                 BETTIE
                        Who’s your date sugar, and is he 
                        rationed?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Hey Bettie, this is Carl.  Carl, 
                        Bettie Bird.

           Carl smiles, shyly.

           Across the dance hall, David Randolph takes a seat, watches 
           Carl’s interaction...

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your one striper, Ray?  Or 
                        did his ship come in already?  

                                 BETTIE
                        Yeah, only last week. 
                                 CATHERINE
                        I thought you’d be dockin’ it, the 
                        way you two were getting along.

                                 BETTIE
                        A girl’s gotta do her part in this 
                        war.  We’re gonna do another song, 
                        any requests?

           Catherine smiles at Carl.

           INT. JIVE CAFE - NIGHT

           Bettie grabs the mic on stage, SPOTLIGHT on her.

                                 BETTIE
                             (over mic)
                        This is an old one, but we do it 
                        our way.  It goes out to Carl.

           Carl looks up, shocked to hear his name over the PA.  The 
           band strikes up a slow swinging THE WAY YOU LOOK TONIGHT.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Come on!

           Carl takes a swig of cola.  Slides out of the booth and 
           follows Catherine onto the crowded dance floor...

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR

           Catherine takes Carl’s hand in the basic slow swing step 
           among other dancing couples.  

           AT THE BOOTHS

           David watches with envy from his booth seat...

           ON THE DANCE FLOOR

           Carl stumbles, and Catherine laughs.  

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        It’s alright!  You got it!

           Carl now in step, the beat picks up and the whole band joins 
           at the bridge...

                                 BETTIE
                        With each word, your tenderness 
                        grows, tearing my fear apart!
           Carl has got it, a thin smile spreading on his face, his feet 
           moving to the rhythm.  

           He twirls Catherine.  Laughing for the first time in years.

                                 BETTIE (CONT’D)
                        And that laugh that wrinkles your 
                        nose, touches my foolish heart!

           Everyone jiving on the floor as the song ends to CHEERS.

           Carl’s face sweating, glowing with the joy of being a kid in 
           this moment.

           EXT. JIVE CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Carl, Catherine and Martin exit the club to the parking lot, 
           slightly drunk, their breath like CLOUDS in the freezing air.  

           Martin carries his clarinet case and puts his NEWSBOY cap on 
           Carl’s head.

                                 MARTIN
                        I know it’s kind of 1930’s, but 
                        it’s my lucky cap, and you should 
                        have it for those dance moves.

                                 CARL
                        That’s alright, I don’t need it.

                                 MARTIN
                        Take it!

           Martin slaps Carl on the back.  In the b.g., a few of the 
           other band members pack the drum kit in the back of a Ford 
           pickup.  They cover the drums with a canvas tarp.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Goodnight!

                                 MARTIN
                        Yeah.  See ya next week, Carl.

           Catherine and Carl separate from Martin, walking through the 
           nearly empty parking lot toward their car.

           Catherine and Carl get in the sedan.  

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Carl takes off the NEWSBOY CAP, holds it in his lap.  Glances 
           at the rearview mirror.
           ANGLE ON REARVIEW MIRROR -- Martin walks to the far side of 
           the parking lot toward a bicycle leaning against the fence.  

           EXT. JIVE CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Martin sets his clarinet case inside the bicycle bin as David 
           Randolph grabs the handlebars.  

                                 DAVID
                        I didn’t know you and orphan boy 
                        were pals.

           He removes Martin’s clarinet from the basket, takes it out of 
           the case.

                                 MARTIN
                        Come on, David.  Put it back.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re a fairy so you like things 
                        in your mouth, don’t ya?  

           David tosses the clarinet up and down in his hand.

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           Carl, expressionless, watches the rearview mirror... 

           ANGLE ON REARVIEW MIRROR -- David smashes the clarinet 
           against the building.

           Carl’s fist tightens on the NEWSBOY CAP.  

           Catherine starts the car with a RUMBLE.  She shifts into gear 
           and drives toward the exit.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (smiling)
                        I knew you could dance.

                                 CARL
                        Stop the car.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What?

           Carl takes off his coat.

           EXT. JIVE CAFE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Martin bends down to pick up the smashed clarinet.
           David sends him to the icy pavement with a hard kick to the 
           gut, then another to the face.  Martin rolls over, holding 
           his stomach in agony.

           The CLANK of a car door slamming.

           David looks up -- Carl walks across the icy parking lot.

           Martin gets up off the pavement, his hands shaking, blood 
           flowing from his nose.  He picks up his clarinet...

           Carl steps between Martin and David, a cold stare. 

                                 CARL
                        You should leave people alone.

                                 DAVID
                        Like you did!?  You stepped in on 
                        my girl.  I’m gonna smash your 
                        pretty face in this time!

           In the b.g., Catherine gets out of the car and runs toward 
           the scene...

                                 CARL
                        You don’t know what you’re doing.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Don’t hurt him, David!

           David SWINGS at Carl, a hard right, but Carl catches David’s 
           wrist, turns his arm at the elbow, and kicks his legs out 
           from under him in swift combination.

           David HOWLS in pain and falls to his knees.

           Carl expertly twists David’s arm behind his back.

                                 CARL
                        Tell him you’re sorry, or I’ll 
                        break your arm.

           Martin wipes his bloody nose with his sleeve, in awe at 
           Carl’s ability.      

           Rage and degradation in David’s eyes.  He tries to pivot, but 
           SCREAMS in pain as Carl applies more pressure to his arm. 

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                             (slips into German accent)
                        I didn’t hear you.

           David breaks down, CRYING like a humiliated little boy, his 
           bravado gone.
                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry.

           Carl looks at Catherine.  She nods, nearly rendered 
           speechless by what she has witnessed.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        He’s sorry.

                                 CARL
                        Alright.

           Carl releases David who falls forward onto the pavement, 
           holding his arm, writhing in pain.

           INT. DENT ESTATE, MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The Senator reads Dickens’ OLIVER TWIST in bed.

           Emma Dent looks out the window onto the snow-shovelled drive.

                                 EMMA
                        How can you can just sit there 
                        reading Dickens?  It’s nearly an 
                        hour past curfew.

           Emma walks to her vanity and applies a thin layer of WHITE 
           COLD CREAM to her face in a circular motion.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Richard, I’m concerned she may be 
                        spending too much time with Carl.

                                 RICHARD
                             (looks up from his book)
                        What’s that?

           A car ENGINE and the RUMBLE of the garage door being lifted.

                                 EMMA
                        They’re back.  I’m going down 
                        there.

           INT. GARAGE/CAR - NIGHT

           The car is parked in the garage, the headlights on, 
           illuminating a workbench with tools.

           IN THE CAR

           Catherine and Carl sit in the car, facing each other. 
                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re a lot like my dad.  You’re 
                        quiet, but you’re strong.

                                 CARL
                        I think your mother’s the strong 
                        one.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother seems that way, I know.  But 
                        she cares too much about what other 
                        people think of her.   

           A beat.  Catherine looks away.  

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I really like you.  

                                 CARL
                        You don’t really know me.

                                 CATHERINE
                        We’re not that different, just 
                        because you’re from another 
                        country.

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know about that.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I know that was swell, what you did 
                        to David.  The lug deserved it.

           Carl looks away, shyly.

                                 CARL
                        You and him used to go submarine 
                        watching?

           Catherine LAUGHS.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What?  In his dreams.  

           Carl turns toward Catherine, surprised.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Mother made me go to cotillion with 
                        him since we were kids, and the 
                        jerk told everyone I had the hots 
                        for him.

                                 CARL
                        Oh.  
                                 CATHERINE
                             (vulnerable)
                        I’ve never kissed anybody before.

           A beat.

                                 CARL
                        Me either.

           Carl looks down, unsure of himself.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not who you think I am.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Nobody is, right?

           Catherine leans toward Carl.  They kiss on the lips.  A long 
           sensuous kiss.  They separate.  Then kiss again...

           The door to the house suddenly OPENS and lights flood the 
           garage. Catherine backs away from Carl, out of breath.

           IN THE GARAGE

           Emma Dent stands in the doorway looking at the car.

                                 EMMA
                        Catherine Marie Dent!  Get in the 
                        house this instant! 

           IN THE CAR

           Catherine motions for Carl to wipe his lips, then opens the 
           car door.

           Carl wipes RED lipstick onto his white shirtsleeve.  He grabs 
           his overcoat and NEWSBOY CAP and gets out, covering his 
           sleeve with his hand.

           Carl follows Catherine and Emma inside the house.

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma closes the door to Catherine’s bedroom.  Catherine sits 
           on her bed, facing her mother.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m sorry we were late, mother.  

           Emma wipes the COLD CREAM off her face with a rag.
                                 EMMA
                        I know that you have developed a 
                        fondness for Carl.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Mother, I’m not...

                                 EMMA
                        I’m your mother, Catherine.  I was 
                        your age once, and I can see these 
                        things even if your father is 
                        oblivious.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (angry)
                        I don’t understand!  Why don’t you 
                        like Carl?  What do you have 
                        against him?

           Emma SIGHS.  She wipes off the remaining cold cream.  Without 
           makeup, her face shows her age and the sadness of wisdom.  
           She sits down on the bed next to her daughter.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not Carl...it’s...

           Emma’s eyes well with tears.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I love you so much, Catherine.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, mother.

           Catherine takes her mother’s hand.

                                 EMMA
                        The thing about the first time you 
                        fall in love is...

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl lies in bed, awake.  He touches his finger to his lips.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        ...You’re never the same again...   

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma smiles, takes her daughter’s hand.  
                                 EMMA
                        ...You get your heart broken, and 
                        you don’t feel as much the next 
                        time...or the time after that.  
                        You’re so young.  Just promise me 
                        you’ll be careful who you give your 
                        heart to.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I will.

           EXT. KNOX ACADEMY - DAY

           SUPER: “One Week Later.”

           Heavy snowfall over the courtyard of the Knox Academy.  The 
           SCHOOL BELL sounds and Carl exits with other boys out of a 
           classroom into the courtyard. 

           Carl stops at the bike rack, pulls his bicycle out and looks 
           up --  David walks across the courtyard toward him.

                                 DAVID
                             (offers handshake)
                        Would you accept an apology?

           Carl dons his newsboy cap.  A beat.   

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I let jealousy get the best of me.

           Carl hesitates, then shakes David’s hand.  

           He gets on his bicycle and pedals out of the courtyard.

           David watches him leave.

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY

           Carl walks his bicycle to the edge of the forest across from 
           the frozen lake.  Snowfall hits his cap.  

           He glances toward the lake -- no old man fishing today.

           He leans the bicycle against a tree and walks into the woods.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (O.S.)
                        I trust you found somewhere to hide 
                        the gun?
           EXT. WOODS, BASEBALL PARK - DAY

           Carl stands before the Brummbär, who sits on the park bench.

                                 CARL
                        It’s secure.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Good.  I received word from Berlin.  
                        We know Roosevelt has a security 
                        detail with him when he attends 
                        social events.  Members of his 
                        secret service.  There may be close 
                        to seventy men at the estate.  At 
                        least four will be in the room with 
                        him.
                             (a beat)
                        The American propaganda films try 
                        to make Roosevelt appear strong, 
                        but he’s crippled and weak and will 
                        most likely be in a wheelchair.

           Carl nods. 

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        When you kill the American 
                        president, you will be a great hero 
                        for the Reich like your father.

           The Brummbär puts a giant hand on Carl’s shoulder.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        After it’s done, we will meet here 
                        and I will arrange for your return 
                        to Germany.  But remember your 
                        blood oath.  No matter what 
                        happens, you cannot be taken alive.

                                 CARL
                        My honor is loyalty.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Any problems with the family?

                                 CARL
                        Perhaps...with the Jewish maid.  
                        She may have opened my suitcase.  
                        She might suspect something. 

           The Brummbär stands, anger in his eyes...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        The maid is Jewish?
                                 CARL
                        Yes, but I don’t think...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        You never told me she’s a Jew!  
                        Tell me her schedule!  When does 
                        she come and go!?

           The Brummbär paces before Carl, his anger building...

                                 CARL
                        She goes to the market on Tuesday 
                        and takes her letters to post on 
                        Thursday mornings, but it’s not...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        We are so close and you neglect to 
                        tell me this!  Now I will have to 
                        deal with her myself... 

                                 CARL
                        But there’s no need to kill her.  I 
                        don’t think she knows anything for 
                        certain...

           The Brummbär slaps Carl in the face, rage in his eyes.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                             (German with subtitles)
                        Do you question me!?  Are you 
                        defending this Jew!?

           He grabs Carl’s jacket collar with a gloved hand...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                        Maybe you’re getting too accustomed 
                        to American weakness...

                                 CARL
                             (frightened)
                        If she disappears now, Mrs. Dent 
                        may cancel the party.

           The Brummbär releases Carl.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        If she doesn’t, she may expose you 
                        first.  There’s not much time...

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Carl plods through the snowy woods toward his bicycle. 
           The SNAP of a twig.  

           Carl stops in his tracks, turns around -- it’s deathly quiet, 
           nothing but falling snow...

           Carl turns back around -- David Randolph FLICKS open a 
           SWITCHBLADE and lunges at Carl!

           Caught off guard, Carl backpedals, slips and falls under the 
           swipe of the blade.  His newsboy cap falls off, landing at 
           the base of a tree.

           David falls on top of Carl, raising the knife over him.

                                 DAVID
                        You’re gonna bleed for what you 
                        did!

           David swings the blade down hard, but Carl reacts quickly, 
           expertly blocking David’s arm, and the knife stabs the snow 
           beside Carl’s body.  

           Carl reaches for something, anything...as David raises the 
           knife over him again...

           Carl’s left hand finds an ICICLE hanging from a low tree 
           branch.  With a SNAP, he breaks it off and plunges the sharp 
           end into David’s neck. 

           David SCREAMS.  He drops the knife and stumbles backward, 
           pawing at the icicle stuck in his neck, blood spewing onto 
           the snow.    

           David falls back against the trunk of a tree.  A dying GURGLE 
           as blood trickles down the side of his mouth and his arms 
           fall limp.  His dead eyes open, fixed on Carl.    

           Carl, visibly shaken, steps toward David’s body, short 
           labored BREATHS.  In the foreground, the snow-dusted NEWSBOY 
           CAP lies unseen by Carl at the foot of a tree.

           Carl looks around -- nothing but quiet woods surround him. 

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY

           Carl drags David’s body through the woods toward the clearing 
           and the frozen lake.  

           He looks out over the lake at the ice fishing hole.

           CLOSE ON ICE FISHING HOLE
           PAN up to the sky and the snowfall, an ill-defined swirl of 
           WHITE on WHITE...

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - DAY

           SUPER: “February 18, 1943.  Five Days Later.”

           Snow falls gently down on the frozen lake, landing on the 
           grotesque corpse of David Randolph, head and upper torso 
           wedged into the ice fishing hole. 

           Deputy Quinn watches Eddie Raslo struggle to pull the body 
           out of the hole.  A CRACK of ice or frozen bones breaking as 
           the body becomes dislodged and topples face-down on the ice. 

           Quinn bends down, stubs out his cigarette on the ice.

                                 HEADMASTER BURNS (V.O.)
                             (over microphone)
                        We are deeply saddened by this 
                        senseless tragedy.  Lawrence David 
                        Randolph the third was the kind of 
                        model student and young man we try 
                        so hard to cultivate here...

           Quinn rolls the body over -- the bluish-white, fish-pecked 
           face of David Randolph, gaping wound in the left side of the 
           neck.  

           The EYEBALLS eaten away.

           INT. KNOX ACADEMY AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Deputy Roy Quinn stands beside HEADMASTER BURNS (60), a 
           corpulent, balding man with a tuft of white hair who 
           addresses the dark auditorium of boys from behind a podium 
           framed by an American flag and Knox Academy flag. 

                                 HEADMASTER BURNS
                        ...His leadership and academy 
                        spirit will be sorely missed.  
                        Please remain seated as Deputy 
                        Quinn of the Burtonsville Police 
                        has a few words to say.

           The MURMUR of voices among the student body.  Headmaster 
           Burns steps aside, and a solemn officer Quinn takes the 
           podium and the microphone.  Quinn clears his throat.
                                 QUINN
                        While I can’t go into details, we 
                        are investigating David’s death as 
                        a murder case, the first we’ve had 
                        in some time.  But we will bring 
                        the culprit to swift and exact 
                        justice under the law.  

           PAN across faces of boys in the auditorium.  Carl among them.

                        If any of you have information you

                        investigation, contact the police

           Quinn steps down from the podium.

           INT. JOANNA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Joanna sits at a small desk in her room, writing a letter on 
           stationary... 

                                 JOANNA (V.O.)
                        Dearest Rebecca, my beloved sister.  
                        I hope this letter finds you safe 
                        in Marseille.  Unfortunately, I no 
                        longer feel safe myself.  Since the 
                        boy has come to live here, strange 
                        things have been happening in the 
                        home...

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE ROAD - DAY

           Joanna walks along an icy road, holding the letter, dense 
           snowy woods on either side.    

                                 JOANNA (V.O.)
                        ...I can’t discuss this with the 
                        family, but I fear for my life now, 
                        yet I have no proof, no evidence, 
                        only my suspicion.  I have decided 
                        to pack this afternoon and leave 
                        for New York on an evening train.  
                        I’ve left notice for Emma, though I 
                        can’t tell her the real reason for 
                        my departure.  Only that I’ve left 
                        to be with you...  
           INT. BURTONSVILLE POST OFFICE - DAY

           Joanna enters a post office.  On the wall behind the clerk, a 
           poster of a little girl’s face superimposed over a swastika.  
           The caption reads: DELIVER US FROM EVIL, BUY WAR BONDS.

                                 JOANNA (V.O.)
                        I have money saved, enough to live 
                        on for a while.  I will write again 
                        soon with my new address.  God is 
                        merciful.  One day soon He will 
                        reunite us.  Yours always, Joanna.

           Joanna hands the letter and a dime to the clerk.

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE ROAD - DAY

           Joanna walks along the quiet road lined with trees.  Just 
           ahead of her, blocking her path, a black sedan parked on the 
           side of the road.  

           She walks around the driver’s side...

           She notices the raised hood and a giant man in black coat and 
           fedora bent over the engine block...

           The Brummbär looks up at her...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        Excuse me, do you know if I am near 
                        the home of Senator Dent?

                                 JOANNA
                        It’s about a mile up the road.  But 
                        he’s not in, he’s in session all 
                        day.

           The Brummbär smiles, steps toward her...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        I see.  Well, perhaps you could 
                        help me with something, Joanna.

           Joanna steps back, confused.  A flicker of fear in her 
           eyes...

                                 JOANNA
                        How do you know my name?

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                             (in German with subtitles)
                        And you thought you could hide in 
                        America, Jew?
           Joanna’s eyes widen in terror.  She looks down -- the 
           Brummbär’s gloved fists pull a garrote wire taut. 

           The Brummbär lunges at her, throwing the garrote over her 
           neck.  He squeezes, teeth clenched, eyes bulging wide with 
           hate.

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - DAY

           Carl rides his bicycle down the drive toward the estate.  

           The drive is clear of snow and for the first time, the early 
           evening SUN is visible above the estate, its rays piercing 
           the gray winter haze.

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           Catherine stands before her dresser.  She finishes knitting 
           the last threads on the SCARF.   

           She unfurls the scarf and examines it -- the pattern now 
           complete, a RED CROSS on a WHITE background. 

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - DAY

           Carl lies in bed, takes out his necklace, handles the cyanide 
           capsule.  He tucks it back into his shirt and gets up...

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - DAY

           A KNOCK.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes?

                                 CARL
                             (opens her door)
                        Want to go to the pictures, this 
                        time for real?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Catherine and Carl walk downstairs into the living room.  
           Emma rushes into the living room from the kitchen, in a 
           frazzled state.  She holds a letter in hand, pacing the room.

                                 EMMA
                        I have to cancel the party!
                                 CATHERINE
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Did you see Joanna when you came 
                        home from school?  Did you, Carl!?

                                 CARL
                        No ma’am.

           Emma breaks down, CRYING.

                                 EMMA
                        First David Randolph’s death and 
                        now Joanna!  I can’t take it!

                                 CATHERINE
                        Joanna’s dead!?

                                 EMMA
                        No, she’s left!  Gone!  Moved out!  
                             (Emma shakes the letter)
                        The day before Eleanor and the 
                        President are here, and she’s gone 
                        to New York to be with her sister!  
                        We give her a home for all these 
                        years and this is the thanks we 
                        get! 

           Catherine hugs her mother, trying to console her.

                                 CATHERINE
                        We should be happy for Jo, mother. 
                        She’s been hoping to see her sister 
                        for years...

           Emma breaks away, angrily.

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t talk to me about etiquette, 
                        young lady!  It’s a matter of...of 
                        proper notice!  

                                 CATHERINE
                        But you can’t cancel the party, 
                        mother.  The food has been ordered.  
                        Everything will be fine.  I’ll 
                        help.  And Mrs. Von Tobel will be 
                        here in the morning... 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re right.  I can’t cancel on 
                        Eleanor now, with no notice.  It 
                        would be unforgivable.  
                                 CATHERINE
                        Can we go to the pictures, mother?

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Carl and I?  Can we go to the 
                        pictures tonight?

           Emma SIGHS.  She tears up Joanna’s letter.

           INT. BURTONSVILLE POLICE STATION - DAY

           Officer Eddie Raslo opens an unmarked door and enters an 
           interrogation room clouded with smoke, cup of coffee in hand.  

           Quinn sits at a table across from the OLD MAN, the ice 
           fisherman at Lake Ambrose.  They both smoke cigarettes.

                                 OLD MAN
                        You’re looking for a monster, 
                        aren’t you?  But I tell you, I 
                        didn’t see no monster.  Just the 
                        boy walkin’ into yonder woods by 
                        the lake.  Blonde kid in a school 
                        uniform.  Had a bicycle with him.

                                 QUINN
                        And you say he wore this?

           Quinn holds up the NEWSBOY CAP.  The old man nods.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re sure it was him you saw?

           Eddie holds up a black and white photo of David Randolph.

                                 OLD MAN
                        Sure as I’m sittin’ here.

           Quinn rubs his cigarette out in an ashtray on the desk.

           EXT. PICTURE PALACE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of the Picture Palace in downtown 
           Burtonsville.  The marquee reads: “SHADOW OF A DOUBT.”

           INT. PICTURE PALACE MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           Theater curtains open, revealing a dark screen.
           Catherine sits next to Carl in the theater.  

                                 CARL
                        Do you think I could ever stay in 
                        your family?  I mean, for good?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Of course.  I hope so.  I hope you 
                        never go back.

                                 CARL
                        But your father never said anything 
                        about it?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Not to me.  But he loves you.  I’m 
                        sure he does.

           Carl nods, not convinced.   

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Have some of these.

           She pours a handful of Holloway’s Milk Duds into her hand.

                                 CARL
                        I don’t eat candy, remember?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Just try some.

           Carl takes a candy in his hand.  He eats one.

                                 CARL
                        You’re prettier than the girl in 
                        your film magazines. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Who?  You mean Rita Hayworth?  Come 
                        on...

           She smiles, hopelessly in love with Carl.

                                 CARL
                        You are, no doubt about it.  

           Catherine takes his hand.  Light from the film projector 
           washes over their faces.

           A triumphant TRUMPET sounds... 

           INSERT WWII NEWSREEL FOOTAGE:  An Allied newsreel title page 
           with a drawing of an eagle in flight over UNITED NEWS.
                                 NEWSREEL NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The war in Russia enters its third 
                        year, with Soviet armies pounding 
                        the Nazis from the Black Sea to the 
                        Baltic.

           The title page dissolves to images of battles, EXPLOSIONS, 
           Russian tanks rolling over snow and retreating German troops 
           on the Russian front.

           Carl pulls his hand away from Catherine.  He looks down, brow 
           furrowed with anxiety.  

           EXT. RANDOLPH ESTATE - NIGHT

           A police car parks before a colonial-style mansion.

           INT. RANDOLPH ESTATE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           A richly furnished living room.  Quinn and Raslo on a cramped 
           love seat across from well-tailored LAWRENCE RANDOLPH (50’s) 
           and GERTRUDE RANDOLPH (50’s) who sit on a large leather sofa. 

           A fire casts a warm light over the room.

                                 QUINN
                        Do you know any reason why David 
                        might have gone to the park near 
                        Lake Ambrose a couple Fridays after 
                        school in the last few weeks?

                                 GERTRUDE
                        No.  He always comes home until...

                                 LAWRENCE
                        That’s right.  He was always home 
                        after school.

           Quinn nods.  He shifts uncomfortably in his seat away from 
           Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Do you know of any enemies your son 
                        had?  Anyone at all who might have 
                        wanted to do him harm?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        He was a good boy.  Had everything 
                        a boy could want.  

                                 GERTRUDE
                        Everyone loved David.
           Gertrude SOBBING again.

                                 EDDIE
                        Alright.  I...

                                 QUINN
                        We’ll come back and talk to you 
                        both tomorrow.  Would that be 
                        better, sir?

                                 LAWRENCE
                        I think it would be.

           Lawrence helps Gertrude up, his arm around his wife.

           Quinn and Eddie stand, and the Randolphs follow them to the 
           front door.

           Eddie removes the NEWSBOY CAP from his coat pocket.

                                 EDDIE
                        Oh, your son’s hat, ma’am.  We 
                        found it in the woods by the lake.

           Lawrence Randolph opens the front door.  A gust of icy wind.

           Gertrude wipes her eyes, takes the hat, examines it.

                                 GERTRUDE
                        This isn’t David’s.  I’ve never 
                        seen this before in my life.

           INT. CATHERINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON KEY

           Catherine, in her nightgown, unlocks her jewelry box and 
           removes the SCARF.  She holds it in her hand.

           INT. CARL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl lies in bed in his room, eyes open, staring at the 
           ceiling.  Moonlight pours through an open fold in the 
           curtain, lighting half of Carl’s face, the other half 
           obscured by shadows. 

           A KNOCK at the door.  Catherine opens the door.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I didn’t mean to wake you.

           Carl sits up in bed.
                                 CARL
                        You didn’t. 

           Catherine approaches him, one hand behind her back.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I wanted to give you something.

           She sits down on the bed next to Carl, hands him the SCARF.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        It was supposed to be a Christmas 
                        present, but it wasn’t done in 
                        time.

           Carl unfolds the scarf, the RED cross pattern over WHITE.  

                                 CARL
                        It’s very nice.  Thank you.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        It’s the colors of your country.  
                        You know, the St. George cross.  I 
                        read all about it.  How it goes 
                        back to one of the early Christian 
                        martyrs who slayed a dragon...

           Carl appears distant and despondent.

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I had to make it for school anyway, 
                        so it’s ok if you don’t like it.

           Catherine’s eyes well with tears.

                                 CARL
                        No, I like it very much.  I don’t 
                        deserve it.

           Carl turns away from her.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        The last couple months have been 
                        the best I’ve known.  With your 
                        family, with you.  I like 
                        everything about the way you are, 
                        the music you like, dancing, going 
                        to the pictures.  I never had these 
                        things before...

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s wrong then?
                                 CARL
                        Do you love your family more than 
                        your country?

                                 CATHERINE
                        What do you mean?

                                 CARL
                        You can never understand, but 
                        there’s something I must do...

                                 CATHERINE
                        You don’t have to do anything.

                                 CARL
                        Maybe it could have been different, 
                        if I was born here.  

           He tries to give the scarf back to her.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You’re right, I don’t understand.

           Catherine gets up, leaves the room, tears in her eyes.  Carl 
           starts to follow her, but stops at the door, conflicted.  He 
           returns to his bed and sits down, the SCARF beside him.

           He picks up the scarf, lies down in bed, holding it.  He 
           closes his eyes.

           INT. CARL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Carl wakes up, the SCARF over his chest.  

           He sits up and looks out the window -- the morning SUN shines 
           low on the horizon in a blue sky.  Some of the snow melted in 
           the yard.  Carl gets out of bed in a hurry...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Carl walks downstairs and looks into the grand living room -- 
           Emma and Catherine and Mrs. Von Tobel (from the New Year’s 
           Party) arrange tables and decorations.

                                 EMMA
                        This is where Eleanor will sit so 
                        that the president’s wheelchair has 
                        access to the end of the row.

                                 MRS. VON TOBEL
                        I still think the other side has a 
                        better view of the front.
           Carl notices the president’s designated position.  He walks 
           into the living room.  

           Senator Dent exits the study with a SHOTGUN in hand.

                                 RICHARD
                        First morning of spring.  Grab your 
                        coat, Carl!  

           EXT. BACKYARD OF DENT ESTATE - DAY

           Two shotgun BLASTS.

           Senator Dent lowers the shotgun, wincing.  He stands next to 
           Carl in the back yard, the morning sun reflecting off patches 
           of grass that peek through the melting snow.

           In the b.g., a clay pigeon soars through the air, intact, and 
           HITS the far side of the lawn, sliding across the lawn.

                                 RICHARD
                        My aim is not what it used to be 
                        when I was in the service.

                                 CARL
                             (surprised)
                        You were in the army?

                                 RICHARD
                        United States Marine Corp, 4th 
                        brigade.  
                             (a beat)
                        We fought the Germans at Bois de 
                        Belleau, the bloodiest battle of 
                        the war.  Lost half our men...

           Richard reloads the shotgun, sadness in his eyes.

                                 RICHARD (CONT'D)
                        That’s why I couldn’t support 
                        another war at first.  I couldn’t 
                        imagine sending our boys to fight 
                        like that again without knowing...

                                 CARL
                        Without knowing?

                                 RICHARD
                        When you’re fighting in hell, it’s 
                        hard to know for sure...

                                 CARL
                        Know what, sir?
                                 RICHARD
                        That you didn’t take the devil’s 
                        side.  
                             (beat)
                        But I know now that Hitler’s a 
                        madman.  He’s a bully, trying to 
                        conquer the world by force and 
                        fear, and Germany must be 
                        stopped...whatever the cost.  

                                 CARL
                        Do you think America will win the 
                        war, sir?

                                 RICHARD
                        Yes I do.

                                 CARL
                        But Germany has the stronger army.

           Richard hands the shotgun to Carl.

                                 RICHARD
                        Real strength isn’t measured by 
                        armies.  It’s a matter of fighting 
                        for what’s right.

           Richard launches the next clay pigeon.

           Carl raises the shotgun, takes careful aim...and BLASTS it 
           out of the air.  

           Richard nods at Carl, impressed.

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        Carl, Emma and I have discussed 
                        this, and we want you to know that 
                        there’s a place for you here for 
                        the summer, and for the next school 
                        term.  We want you to stay.

                                 CARL
                        Really, sir?

                                 RICHARD
                        You’re a part of the family now, 
                        son. 

           Richard smiles through teary eyes, his hand on Carl’s 
           shoulder.  

                                 CARL
                        I don’t know what to say, sir.
                                 RICHARD
                        Say you’ll enlist in the service in 
                        a few years, put that aim to good 
                        use.

           Richard takes the shotgun from Carl, his arm on Carl’s 
           shoulder.  Carl and Richard walk toward the back of the 
           estate.

           INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Deputy Roy Quinn and Officer Eddie Raslo sit side by side in 
           barber chairs in an old-fashioned parlor.

           The BARBER (60) wields stainless steel scissors with 
           precision.  A meticulous trim to Eddie’s neckline above the 
           white collar of the hair-speckled smock.

                                 EDDIE
                        Blood on the hat matches the 
                        victim’s type.

                                 QUINN
                        Maybe the old man saw somebody who 
                        looked like the Randolph boy.

           The barber applies shaving cream to Quinn’s face with a 
           badger hair brush.

                                 EDDIE
                        Kids are invisible.  Nobody really 
                        sees ‘em.  So another kid lost the 
                        hat in a scuffle.  Yeah...

                                 QUINN
                        What’s the problem?

                                 EDDIE
                        What kind of a kid could o’ done 
                        that to David Randolph?  

                                 BARBER
                        Neither of you have kids, do ya?

           The barber CHUCKLES, runs a straight edge RAZOR across a 
           sharpening belt.

                                 QUINN (V.O.)
                        I thought someone stabbed him from 
                        behind, except it doesn’t explain 
                        the wound cavity, at an angle from 
                        the left.
           The barber brings the razor to Quinn’s neck.

                                 EDDIE (V.O.)
                        We’re cookin’ with gas now.
                             (beat)
                        Lookin’ for a left-handed kid.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

           Quinn throws off his towel and gets out of the chair, shaving 
           cream still lathered on his face.

                                 EDDIE
                        What?

                                 QUINN
                        There’s a boy I want to talk to.

           Quinn wipes the shaving cream off on his sleeve.  

           Eddie SIGHS.  He looks at the barber, motions for him to go 
           on with the shave.

                                 EDDIE
                        It’s a kid, for Christ sake.  He 
                        can wait on the back-up.

           EXT. DENT ESTATE, FRONT PORCH - DUSK

           The Dent driveway already full of cars in the dusk light.

           At the front porch of the Dent estate, two secret service 
           agents in black suits pat down a couple SOCIETY WOMEN (60’s) 
           in gaudy dresses and fur coats. 

                                 SOCIETY WOMAN #1
                        This is rather exciting, all this 
                        heavy petting.
                                 SOCIETY WOMAN #2
                        Reminiscent of my fumbling first 
                        husband.

           They LAUGH.

           A secret service agent positions a wheel chair on one side of

           Emma Dent stands at the door, facing Quinn.

                                 EMMA
                        Lord, tell me you found him.

                                 QUINN
                        Found who?

                                 EMMA
                        Sarge, of course.  My dog.

                                 QUINN
                        Uh, no, ma’am.  I was wondering if 
                        I could speak with your son.

                                 EMMA
                        Now listen, officer, uh...

                                 QUINN
                        Deputy Quinn.

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t have a son.  I have guests 
                        to tend to.  The President of the 
                        United States is here with his wife 
                        and my maid has abandoned me and 
                        absconded to New York, so if this 
                        can kindly wait until tomorrow...

                                 QUINN
                        I’m afraid it can’t.  There was a 
                        blonde boy, ma’am.  I saw him a 
                        couple weeks ago shoveling snow out 
                        front here.

                                 EMMA
                             (sighs)
                        You must mean Carl...

           INT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           Carl walks down the curved stairway, conceals the Luger in 
           the back waistband of his trousers.  

           He enters the living room...  
           MOVING WITH CARL

           Carl eyes the perimeter of the room -- two secret service on 
           the left side, one on the right.  Their hands relaxed, eyes 
           watching the guests...

           Carl continues forward, moving through the crowd at a slow, 
           deliberate pace.     

           CARL’S POV -- as he moves at angles by the rows of tables and 
           chairs toward the president’s wheel chair.  Thirty feet... 

           A gentleman crosses Carl’s path, blocking Carl’s view of the 
           president for a moment.

           Carl continues forward...twenty feet.

           CLOSE ON CARL

           Carl raises the gun, aims at the back of Roosevelt’s head, a 
           clear shot at fifteen feet.

           Suddenly, a figure on the periphery catches his eye.  Carl 
           turns -- his eyes meet Catherine’s eyes across the room.

           Carl is too conflicted, he cannot pull the trigger.  

           Carl lowers the LUGER...

           BANG!  A gunshot rings out.

           Women stand from their seats, SCREAMING.  Chaos erupts...

           Carl spins around, his shoulder hit.

           Deputy Quinn pushes through the crowd toward Carl, gun 
           raised.  A secret service agent tackles Quinn.

           Carl runs toward the nearby window, smashes through it, glass 
           SHATTERING.  

           He tumbles outside onto the snow...

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           Carl gets up, woozy, holding his shoulder, bleeding from a 
           cut on his forehead.  

           Carl staggers forward, blood from his head dripping onto the 
           snow.
           EXT. WOODS, FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - NIGHT

           From the woods across the lake, the Brummbär watches through 
           binoculars -- Carl stumbles around to the back of the house, 
           rips off the cyanide capsule necklace...  

           EXT. DENT ESTATE - NIGHT

           Carl collapses against the stone wall, holding the cyanide 
           capsule.  For a moment, he debates the choice.  Life or 
           death.  He tosses the necklace and the Luger into the brush.  
           Blood flows down the side of his head.  The cacophany of 
           SCREAMING VOICES wanes and Carl slumps over, losing 
           consciousness, and everything goes BLACK.

           EXT. WOODS, FROZEN LAKE AMBROSE - NIGHT

           The Brummbär lowers his binoculars, rage in his eyes...

           INT. DENT ESTATE, STUDY - NIGHT

           Catherine stands at the door to her father’s study, 
           eavesdropping on his telephone conversation.

           Richard holds a shell-shocked Emma.

                                 RICHARD
                             (into phone)
                        Well, what do they plan to do?
                             (a beat)
                        I see.  Thank you.  

           Richard hangs up the phone. 

                                 RICHARD (CONT’D)
                        We’re not going to do anything.  
                        He’s at the hospital in police 
                        custody.  The FBI is taking him to 
                        Washington for questioning within 
                        the hour.  

           Catherine quietly slips away from the study and walks back 
           through the living room toward the entryway...  

           She grabs her overcoat from a hall closet, puts it on.

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE ROAD - NIGHT

           Catherine pedals her bicycle as fast as she can down the 
           dark, slushy road.
           EXT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of the brick facade of the Burtonsville 
           hospital.  A blanket of snow over the well-manicured lawn. 

           EXT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Deputy Quinn stands outside the door to a hospital room next 
           to Eddie Raslo.

                                 EDDIE
                        Ya really expect me to believe that 
                        kid in there did that?

                                 QUINN
                        It’s the gospel truth.

                                 EDDIE
                        You have any idea why?

                                 QUINN
                        All I know is when things finally 
                        get interesting, Hoover’s boys take 
                        it off our hands...

                                 EDDIE
                        How’s it feel to fire your gun?

           INT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Carl awakens in a hospital bed, shirtless, wearing blue scrub 
           pants.  A small bandage on his forehead and shoulder.  He 
           sits up.  Through the small window on the room door, the side 
           profile of Deputy Quinn visible.

           Carl looks down at his wrist, HANDCUFFED to the bed.

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Catherine drops her bicycle in the hospital yard and runs up 
           the steps to the front door.

           In the foreground, a black sedan parks across the street from 
           the hospital.

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           The Brummbär watches Catherine enter the hospital.
           INT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Catherine approaches the pretty NURSE (30) on duty at the 
           front desk.  A SECURITY GUARD (50’s) stands at the far side 
           of desk, turns the dial on a RADIO, changing stations.

                                 CATHERINE
                             (out of breath)
                        Excuse me? 

                                 NURSE
                        Are you ok?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, I need to see a patient.

           INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

           The Brummbär dons his fedora and gets out of the sedan.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Catherine stands before Quinn and Raslo in the hallway.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Just for a minute, please.  I have 
                        to see him.

           Quinn looks through the door window at Carl, who reclines in 
           bed.

                                 QUINN
                        Alright.  You got two minutes.

           Quinn opens the door to Carl’s room, and Catherine enters.

                                 EDDIE
                        I gotta piss, Quinn.

                                 QUINN
                        You got two minutes, too.

           Eddie laughs and walks down the hallway...

           EXT. STREET, BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           The Brummbär pops his collar and lumbers across the street 
           toward the hospital. 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Catherine stands over Carl’s hospital bed.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What happened?

                                 CARL
                        You can’t be here, right now.

                                 CATHERINE
                        What’s going on?  I don’t 
                        understand...

           Catherine breaks down, CRYING.  Carl hugs her to his chest 
           with his free hand.

                                 CARL
                        You wouldn’t understand even if I 
                        told you.  Listen, you must leave 
                        right now.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Not until you tell me the truth.

           Carl looks into her teary eyes.  

           A beat.  Carl confesses.

                                 CARL
                        I’m not from England.  I’m German.  
                        I was sent here to spy for my 
                        country.  To gather information 
                        from your father.  But I, uh...

           Carl’s voice shaking.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t go through with it.    

           INT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           The doors to the hospital lobby open, a set of little BELLS 
           ringing, and the Brummbär enters.

           He approaches the nurse at the front desk.

                                 NURSE
                        You must be the FBI.  They told us 
                        you were coming.

           The Brummbär stares at her.  He smiles.
                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        What room?

                                 NURSE
                        Three fourteen.  You can take the 
                        elevator at the end of the hall.  I 
                        just need to see your badge.

           The Brummbär glances at the other empty desk, a navy jacket, 
           SECURITY in white letters, draped over the chair.  The RADIO 
           crackles at a low volume.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl peruses the hospital room, searching for something.

                                 CARL
                        There’s a man coming to kill me 
                        right now.  He will not allow your 
                        FBI to question me.  He will kill 
                        everyone here...

                                 CATHERINE
                        There are police out there.

                                 CARL
                        It doesn’t matter.

           A tense beat.  Catherine wipes her tears.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        You have to leave now.  You have a 
                        great life ahead of you...with your 
                        family.  You have a lot to live for 
                        in this country...

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m not leaving you like this.

           Carl looks at the barrette in her hair.

                                 CARL
                        Then give me your hair clip.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           The Brummbär lifts the nurse out of the seat by her neck, her 
           legs squirming.  

           She claws at his massive, gnarled hands.  She cannot make a 
           sound, her EYES open in horror.
           Her high heels knock the rotary phone onto the floor as the 
           Brummbär lifts her over the reception desk.

           The SECURITY GUARD walks into the room, slack-jawed.

           The guard reaches for the gun on his belt.  The Brummbär 
           drags the suffocating nurse toward him, a dying human shield.

           The guard fumbles with his gun, FIRES a round into the 
           nurse’s back.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The sound of a GUNSHOT downstairs blends with the jet-like 
           FLUSHING of a urinal.  

           Quinn looks down the hall -- Eddie Raslo exits the restroom, 
           zips his fly on the way out.

                                 QUINN
                        You just hear something?

                                 EDDIE
                        The sound of all your worries and 
                        fears.

                                 QUINN
                        Check the window, the big boys 
                        should be here by now.

           Eddie turns around, heads toward the far end of the hall.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           The Brummbär slams the nurse’s dead body into the security 
           guard, and the guard stumbles backward.

           The Brummbär tosses the nurse’s body aside like a rag doll.

           The guard falls to his butt on the polished floor and raises 
           his gun again, but the Brummbär kicks it out of his hand.  

           The gun slides across the floor.  

           The security guard shaking, terrified.  The Brummbär’s shadow 
           rises over him.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl inserts the hair barrette into the hole in the 
           handcuffs, trying to pick the lock.
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           DING!  The elevator doors open.

           The Brummbär lumbers down the hallway toward Quinn, a Luger 
           concealed behind his back.  

           Quinn looks up, sees the Brummbär approaching.

           The Brummbär stops a few feet from Quinn.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                             (flips open his wallet)
                        FBI.

           Quinn glances at the wallet -- no badge, just a black 
           billfold.

           BANG!  The Brummbär fires a round into Quinn’s stomach.  
           Quinn GASPS, holding his gut.

           The Brummbär lifts Quinn by the neck and tosses him through 
           the air.

           Quinn’s GLASSES fly off and his back SLAMS into the wall.  He 
           slides to the floor, a trail of BLOOD left on the white wall.  

           Eddie Raslo opens FIRE at the Brummbär, hitting him in the 
           shoulder.   

           The Brummbär GRUNTS, holding his left shoulder.  He backs 
           against the wall and FIRES three shots at Raslo. 

           Raslo drops his gun and falls to the floor.  

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Carl tries to pick the lock to the handcuffs with Catherine’s 
           barrette.

                                 CARL
                        Find me a weapon, something in the 
                        cabinet.  Anything.  

           Catherine throws open the hospital cabinet, frantically 
           searching the drawers for something.  She finds a 10ML 
           SYRINGE with needle.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Brummbär walks slowly toward Eddie Raslo who drags his 
           wounded body toward his gun a few feet away...
                                 EDDIE
                        Mary Mother of God be with my 
                        spirit...

           Raslo looks up -- the Brummbär raises his gun and FIRES at 
           Raslo’s head -- blood SPRAYS the wall.

           The Brummbär heads back down the hall toward Carl’s room.  He 
           looks up at the number on the door -- 314.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The door opens and the Brummbär steps into Carl’s room, gun 
           raised.  Empty handcuffs locked to the bed rail.  No Carl.

           Suddenly, Carl slips out from behind the door, swings the 
           needle of a syringe at the Brummbär’s head.  The Brummbär 
           raises his hand to block the blow, and the needle impales his 
           gun hand.

           The Brummbär GRUNTS, drops the Luger and swivels around to 
           face Carl. 

           Carl blocks the doorway.

                                 CARL
                        Go!  Now!

           Catherine scoots out from behind the bed and runs out of the 
           hospital room.  She hesitates a moment in the doorway, 
           looking at Carl.

                                 CARL (CONT’D)
                        Get out of here!

           Catherine runs down the hall.

           The Brummbär grits his teeth and pulls the needle through the 
           back of his gloved hand.

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR
                        You disappoint me, Carl.

           The Brummbär drops the syringe on the floor and steps 
           forward...

                                 THE BRUMMBÄR (CONT’D)
                             (in German with subtitles)
                        I had...such hope for you.

                                 CARL
                        I’m not like you.
           The Brummbär swings at Carl, but Carl ducks under the punch 
           and kicks the Brummbär in the shin.

           The Brummbär GRUNTS and rushes Carl.  Carl backs into the 
           hallway, and the Brummbär SLAMS him against the wall.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           The Brummbär swings again.  Carl blocks the punch, but the 
           Brummbär elbows Carl in the face.

           Catherine disappears into the stairwell EXIT at the end of 
           the hall.

           Carl, his mouth bleeding, blocks three more punches in close 
           quarters, and SLAMS the Brummbär’s wounded shoulder.

           The Brummbär winces and falls to one knee.  Carl swings at 
           him, but the Brummbär grabs Carl’s wrist, pulls a KNIFE from 
           a shin case and plunges it into Carl’s chest.

           The Brummbär stands, driving Carl back and twists the knife.  

           Carl GASPS.  He stumbles back three steps and collapses on 
           the polished concrete, ten feet from Quinn.   

           Carl rolls onto his side, holding his chest.

           Suddenly, the sound of CAR ENGINES in the parking lot.  

           The Brummbär ducks into Carl’s hospital room...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           The Brummbär looks out the hospital room window -- five FBI 
           men get out of black sedans and walk toward the hospital.

           The Brummbär leaves the room, his dark coat FLUTTERING.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The Brummbär lumbers down the hall toward the elevator, the 
           CLANK of his boots echo off the polished concrete.

           Quinn, who sits back against the bloody wall, feet out, 
           GROANS softly and lifts his head.  He looks down the hallway.

           QUINN’S POV -- The Brummbär retreats, an ill-defined BLUR, 
           OUT-OF-FOCUS. 

           Quinn pulls his six shooter, takes aim and FIRES.
           A bullet BLOWS the GLASS out of a FIRE EXTINGUISHER case on 
           the wall.

           The Brummbär stops in his tracks and looks back at Quinn.

           Quinn raises his wobbly gun hand again, FIRES another round, 
           BLASTING a chunk of plaster off the other side of the wall.

           The Brummbär ducks and turns, retreating faster toward the 
           elevator doors.

           Quinn FIRES two more rounds, missing again.

           Carl lies face-down in a pool of blood on the white floor.  
           He inches forward on his chest.

           Carl reaches out for...

           ...Quinn’s thick, horn-rimmed GLASSES.

           With his last ounce of strength, Carl SLIDES the glasses down 
           the hall.  They glide across the polished concrete, coming to 
           rest by Quinn’s side.

           DING!  The elevator doors open.

           Quinn dons his glasses and raises his gun...

           QUINN’S POV -- The Brummbär comes into FOCUS, standing inside 
           the elevator compartment.

           Quinn FIRES just as the elevator doors CLOSE.

           EXT. BURTONSVILLE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           The FBI men enter through the lobby doors of the hospital.

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

           DING!  The elevator doors open at the rear side of the lobby 
           and the Brummbär steps out...

           ...lumbering toward the exit doors, the glowing EXIT sign 
           bathing his face in BLOOD RED LIGHT.  

           The Brummbär stumbles as he reaches for the doors, blood 
           trickling down the side of his mouth. 

           The Brummbär collapses, SLAMMING against the glass doors.  
           The glass splinters from the impact, the doors held half-way 
           open, the Brummbär’s dead body lying across the threshold.
           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Quinn sits against the wall, holding his gun.  He looks down 
           the hall at Carl.  Carl is fading fast...

                                 QUINN
                        Hang in there, kid.  You’re gonna 
                        make it.

           Carl’s EYES FLUTTER, his face resting in a pool of blood.

           CLOSE ON CARL’S EYES

           INSERT FLASHBACK:

           INT. DEMER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           A Young Carl Demer, teary-eyed, looks into his mother’s eyes.

                                 HILDA
                        You will pack your things and leave 
                        tomorrow morning with Herr Burmann.

                                 CARL
                        But I don’t want to, mama.

                                 HILDA
                        But you must.

                                 CARL
                        Why, mama?

                                 HILDA
                        You must go and become a man, Carl. 
                        You will learn what it means to be 
                        strong.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Carl’s face relaxes.  His eyes open in death.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END.
