           FADE IN:

           Stars shine through the darkness of space.

           Suddenly, the void seems to CONTORT. Space FOLDS IN ON ITSELF 
           as a TUNNEL OF PULSATING LIGHT appears. A wormhole.

           A SPHERICAL CAPSULE emerges from the tunnel -- a spaceship, 
           futuristic in design, but badly damaged, trailing smoke and 
           debris, as if it's been on the receiving end of an 
           intergalactic ass-kicking. 

           The capsule WHIZZES PAST, wiping frame to REVEAL -- 

           Earth. Dark blue seas under fleecy white clouds. PUSH INTO --

           INT. STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

           THE PILOT is ensconced in a glass cockpit, his face largely 
           obscured by a HEAVY MASK.

           DATA superimposes over the viewscreen, including the date -- 
           JUNE 4, 2013. The Pilot curses under his breath.

                                 THE PILOT
                        All right, let's find a soft spot 
                        to set her down. Initiate landing 
                        sequence.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Warning. Main power at nine 
                        percent. Core destabilizing. Re-
                        entry not advised.

           The Pilot switches to manual navigation and THROTTLES DOWN --

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           TRACKING WITH THE CAPSULE as it's drawn into the Earth's 
           atmosphere, blazing like a comet.

           INT. STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

           SPARKS and SMOKE and SCREAMING ALARMS --

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Main power at seven percent. Six 
                        percent. Five percent.

           The Pilot glances to a GROUP PHOTOGRAPH, wedged onto the 
           console. SIX ASTRONAUTS in MATCHING FLIGHTSUITS. The 
           photograph is smeared with blood.
           Darkness ahead: a STORM SYSTEM, gathering strength over the 
           northeastern United States. The view through the cockpit 
           window transitions from BLAZING FIRE to SWIRLING CLOUDS and 
           POCKETS of LIGHTNING.

           The Pilot closes his eyes, straining under the jaw-rattling G-
           forces. He whispers under his breath, an unheard prayer. 

           Gradually, turbulence fades. The ship steadies. A moment of 
           relief ... broken by a SCREAMING ALARM --

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Warning. Terrain. Warning. Pull up.

           Storm clouds break to REVEAL --

           The ground, coming up fast. Too fast. The Pilot PULLS UP as 
           the capsule plummets for a heavily-wooded area, struggling to 
           level off. 

           Just before the moment of impact, The Pilot's eyes flick down 
           to the blood-stained photograph -- 

           -- to one woman in particular -- before we CUT TO --

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

           Kids playing baseball on a summer afternoon. Bottom of the 
           ninth, score tied, winning run at the plate. From the CHANTS 
           of the crowds, his name must be Tommy -- 

           TOMMY ARCHER, 16, the very picture of stoic concentration. He 
           taps dirt from his cleats, meeting eyes with the PITCHER ... 
           who doesn't seem too happy to see him.

           IN THE STANDS, we find BONNIE ARCHER, late 30's, cheering 
           louder than every other parent in attendance.

                                 BONNIE
                        Come on, Tommy, focus! You've got 
                        this!

           TRACK THROUGH THE CROWDS, until we find a SMALL KID weaving 
           through the legs of the spectators. This is ADAM ARCHER -- 
           twelve years old, but easily mistaken for nine, half a foot 
           shorter than everyone else in his class. 

           Adam strains to peer over shoulders ... but he's not watching 
           the game. His attention is fixed on SUSIE WILCOX, 15 -- every 
           kid's first crush, standing alone at the fence.

           Adam finishes off a can of purple-flavored soda as if it were 
           liquid courage. He tries to crush the can. Can't. Frustrated, 
           he approaches.
           For a moment, Susie doesn't even realize he's there ...

                                 ADAM
                        Hey, Susie.

           Susie turns -- looking too high. She glances down to find 
           Adam (shorter than she expected) grinning up at her.

                                 SUSIE
                        Hey ... Andy, right?

           Adam is about to correct her, when -- CRACK! Tommy hits a 
           LINE DRIVE HOMERUN, deep into center field. 

           The CROWD GOES WILD as Tommy rounds the bases -- so fast he 
           nearly overtakes one of the other runners. Adam is still 
           trying to get Susie's attention. He indicates Tommy --

                                 ADAM
                        That's my brother.

           Susie snaps a look at Adam --

                                 SUSIE
                        Really?

           Adam smiles, nods. Susie leans in ...

                                 SUSIE
                        Do you think you can introduce me?

           The smile fades. Not what he was trying to accomplish. 

           ON THE FIELD, Tommy comes into home, winning the game, 
           instantly surrounded by teammates. Adam is left alone at the 
           fence, watching as Tommy is swept away in a sea of admirers.

           INT. BONNIE'S CAR - DAY

           Bonnie drives, sneaking sidelong glances at Adam, who stares 
           absently out the window. Trying to break the silence --

                                 BONNIE
                        I talked to Coach Zimmer. He says 
                        you can try out for the team next 
                        year, if you want.

                                 ADAM
                        Why bother? I can't run, I can't 
                        hit. I can't even breathe!

                                 BONNIE
                        Well, not with that attitude.
                                 ADAM
                        Besides, the cut-off's fourteen. 
                        I'm too young.

                                 BONNIE
                        Coach Z says he's willing to make 
                        an exception. He says if your genes 
                        are half as good as Tommy's --

                                 ADAM
                        They're not half as good, that's 
                        the whole point. Please don't make 
                        me try out.

                                 BONNIE
                        Make you? When have I ever made you 
                        do anything?

                                 ADAM
                             (ticking them off)
                        The football team. The soccer team. 
                        The marching band. The wrestling 
                        team. You know this arm still 
                        doesn't bend all the way back.

                                 BONNIE
                        Really?

           Adam demonstrates the "deformity". Bonnie waves it off.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh, you're fine.

                                 ADAM
                        Face it, Mom. I'm not Tommy.

           Bonnie looks to Adam ... but he's already turned back out the 
           window, disengaging. She doesn't know what to say.

           EXT. FARMINGTON HILLS - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A lonely cul de sac on the edge of untamed wilderness. 
           Thunder RUMBLES distantly ... a storm on the horizon.

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A labrador retriever named BOSCO follows faithfully underfoot 
           as Adam stomps upstairs. He pauses in front of Tommy's room --

           The shelves are stacked with TROPHIES -- MVP, All-State 
           Football, tae kwon do, even a science fair ribbon. The 
           surrounding room is filled with SPACE MEMORABILIA, including 
           a FULLY ASSEMBLED SHUTTLE MODEL. Adam notices a SPACE-THEMED 
           COMIC BOOK lying nearby. He takes it -- glances to Bosco --
                                 ADAM
                        Don't tell on me, okay?

           Off Bosco's reaction, just happy for the attention.

           INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A SNOWBOARDER swooshes through a half-pipe on a giant plasma 
           screen. Adam is focused on the game, working the balance 
           board like a pro, with a style all his own ... until he's 
           interrupted by a LIGHT KNOCK on the door. He turns off the 
           game and dives into bed, where a textbook is waiting.

                                 ADAM
                        Come in!

           Bonnie enters, modeling a skirt and blouse, hair tied tightly 
           back. She spins --

                                 BONNIE
                        What do you think?

                                 ADAM
                        Is it a date or a job interview?

                                 BONNIE
                        Little of both, I guess.

                                 ADAM
                        What was wrong with the last guy?

                                 BONNIE
                        Carl? I don't know. He was nice. 
                        Unambitious.
                             (sensing Adam's tone)
                        You think I'm being too picky.

                                 ADAM
                        No. I think it's encouraging for a 
                        woman your age.

           Ouch. Bonnie takes a seat on the foot of the bed.

                                 BONNIE
                        Okay, I deserved that. I'm not 
                        being picky for me, you know. It's 
                        all for you.

                                 ADAM
                        Why? I'm not gonna date him.

                                 BONNIE
                        No, but Tommy's grown, and you're 
                        halfway there ... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        I just don't want you going the 
                        rest of the way without some kind 
                        of male influence in your life.

                                 ADAM
                        You're close enough.

                                 BONNIE
                        Thanks. I think.

           Bonnie comes to her point --

                                 BONNIE
                        Listen. You don't have to try out 
                        for the team if you don't want to. 
                        I know you're not Tommy. I know 
                        things don't come so easy for you. 
                             (conspiratorial)
                        But you know what? I think that's 
                        what makes you stronger.

                                 ADAM
                        Stronger than Tommy? Have you met 
                        Tommy?

                                 BONNIE
                        Who knows. You might surprise 
                        yourself. But if you don't try, 
                        you'll never know.

           Bonnie turns Adam's textbook right-side-up (it's been upside-
           down this whole time). With a smile, she heads for the door.

                                 ADAM
                        Mom.
                             (off her look)
                        You look nice.

           Bonnie beams.

                                 ADAM
                        I mean --

                                 BONNIE
                        No no, stop there. Stop at sweet.

                                 ADAM
                        -- for a mom --

                                 BONNIE
                        -- can't hear you, already gone.

           She closes the door behind her.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tommy sits watching TV. ON SCREEN, amateur footage of a 
           FLAMING OBJECT crashing out of the sky -- the star capsule.

                                 REPORTER (O.C.)
                        -- obtained this exclusive footage 
                        of the unidentified object, which 
                        crashed somewhere over Oakland 
                        County late last night.

           Bonnie passes behind Tommy, in a hurry --

                                 BONNIE
                        Okay, I'm headed out. Watch your 
                        brother, okay?

                                 TOMMY
                             (fixed on the screen)
                        Did you see this? That thing 
                        crashed like five miles from here.

                                 BONNIE
                        Hey. Are you listening?

                                 TOMMY
                        Yeah, I got it, watch the insect.

                                 BONNIE
                        Don't call him that.

                                 TOMMY
                             (yeah yeah)
                        Have a good date.

           Bonnie gives herself one last look in the mirror, and then 
           she's gone. Tommy rewinds the TiVo to watch the footage of 
           the crashing object one more time. He shakes his head.

                                 TOMMY
                        That's no meteor ...

           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           DISTANT POV -- Bonnie gets in her car and drives off. A HAND 
           comes into frame and pulls back a branch. Someone's watching.

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           The house is silent and dark. Tommy crosses to a window. He's 
           about to climb down, when suddenly --

                                 ADAM (O.C.)
                        What are you doing?
           Tommy spins -- Adam CLICKS ON a flashlight and shines it into 
           Tommy's eyes.

                                 TOMMY
                        Jesus! You scared me. Kill the 
                        light, Kickstand.

                                 ADAM
                        Don't call me that. Why are you 
                        sneaking out?

                                 TOMMY
                        You know Mom has the neighbors spy 
                        on us. If she comes back, tell her 
                        I'm out studying with Walter.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay. What are you really doing?

           From below, a FAMILIAR VOICE --

                                 SUSIE (O.C.)
                        Hey, Tommy! What's taking so long?

           Adam glances out the window to find SUSIE WILCOX waiting 
           below. Tommy smiles, letting the implication speak for 
           itself.

                                 TOMMY
                        Studying. With Walter.

           Adam is heartbroken, but not surprised. Tommy hesitates, 
           misinterpreting his brother's expression as fear.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey. If you're scared to stay here 
                        by yourself --

                                 ADAM
                        I'm not scared!

           He said that louder than intended. MUFFLED LAUGHTER from 
           below. Now Susie's laughing at him! Adam looks like he wants 
           to disappear into a black hole. Tommy flashes an appeasing 
           smile, ruffles Adam's hair. Adam jerks back, annoyed.

                                 TOMMY
                        Good boy.

           With that, Tommy VAULTS out the open window, shimmies down 
           the drainpipe and lands with an IMPRESSIVE FLIP.

           PUSH IN ON ADAM, watching his brother disappear with Susie. 
           He repeats, almost to himself --
                                 ADAM
                        I'm not ...

           A THUNDERCLAP startles Adam, BANGING his head on the 
           windowsill. He pulls the window closed with a SLAM.

           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           The storm RAGES; lightning FLASHES; rain sheets down.

           INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Adam lies in bed with the lights on, flipping through the 
           comic he stole from Tommy's room. 

           ON THE PAGE, bold letters are splashed across an illustration 
           of a futuristic spaceship: WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!

           Suddenly, POWER GOES OUT. Adam groans, climbs out of bed.

           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Adam runs through the rain, coat held over his head. He 
           reaches the BREAKER BOX and is about to flip the switch, when 
           a NOISE spins him around --

           He switches on his flashlight and examines the rain-soaked 
           yard. Nothing there. False alarm.

           Adam is about to turn back to the breaker, when the NOISE 
           REPEATS, louder -- coming from the shed. A SHADOW drifts past 
           the lone window. No doubt about it; someone's in there.

           Panicked, Adam starts to run back for the house, when 
           something stops him. He turns back to the shed. A look of 
           STOIC DETERMINATION fills his eyes. He steps forward.

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           Adam approaches -- an OPEN LOCK hanging from the door. He 
           pushes through --

           SOUNDS of RUMMAGING nearby -- a SHADOWY FIGURE is rifling 
           through the contents of the shed, selecting VARIOUS TOOLS and 
           tossing them into a pile on the floor.

           A floorboard CREAKS under Adam's weight. He ducks into hiding 
           as the figure TURNS to REVEAL --

           It's THE PILOT from the star capsule -- recognizable only by 
           his eyes -- dark brown with SPECKS OF GREEN. A rare anomaly. 

           The Pilot illuminates the shed with a POWERFUL BEAM that 
           emanates from a device that looks like an ADVANCED IPHONE.
           Content that he's alone, The Pilot goes back to work, 
           selecting his tools, failing to notice as a SMALL HAND picks 
           up a socket wrench from the pile behind him, and --

           CRACK. The wrench makes SOLID CONTACT with the back of The 
           Pilot's head. The Pilot slowly turns to meet eyes with his 
           attacker -- 

           ADAM stands there, wet and trembling, holding the wrench like 
           he knows how to use it. The Pilot blinks, woozy.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You ...

           Adam frowns: me? With that, The Pilot's eyes ROLL BACK and he 
           crumples to the floor. Adam drops by The Pilot's side -- 
           amazed, overwhelmed -- he can't believe he just did that!

                                 ADAM
                        Oh my God, oh my God ...
                             (then, smiling)
                        Oh my God!

           Adam takes a closer look at this stranger --

           He's wearing a FLIGHTSUIT with an insignia that reads 
           NEXTSTAR CORP. Something protrudes from an open pocket. Adam 
           delicately reaches down and pulls out --

           A familiar blood-stained photograph: six astronauts in 
           matching jumpsuits. The Pilot is in the middle, his arm slung 
           around the shoulder of a man whose face is obscured by dried 
           blood. Adam chips away the blood to reveal the face ...

           Suddenly, The Pilot's hand SNAPS OUT, clutching the 
           photograph. Adam YELPS and brings the wrench down once more -- 

           THUD. Ouch.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           Sounds of rain fade to a gentle shower.

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           ON THE PILOT, coming to. His vision focuses -- ADAM stands 
           opposite, clutching his inhaler, ready for anything.

           REVEAL -- The Pilot has been tied to a chair. The binding job 
           is needlessly elaborate, employing a lot of rope, a lot of 
           tape, and even a garden hose for good measure.

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... what happened?
                                 ADAM
                        I knocked you out. Try anything 
                        funny and I'll do it again.

           The Pilot is struggling to wrap his head around that. He 
           peers at Adam -- this weak, asthmatic kid --

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... you?

           Adam nods and takes a hit off his inhaler -- somehow making 
           that seem like a badass gesture. He throws down the lock that 
           he found hanging from the shed door. It CLANKS at The Pilot's 
           feet.

                                 ADAM
                        Only three people know the 
                        combination to that lock. Me, my 
                        brother, and my Dad. And my Dad's 
                        gone, so how'd you open it?

           As The Pilot explains, we notice that he's starting to work 
           free of his bonds, fumbling through the restraints.

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... lucky guess. I take it you've 
                        already called the cops?

                                 ADAM
                        I will if you don't tell me the 
                        truth.

           For some reason, that makes The Pilot smile.

                                 THE PILOT
                        The truth? Sure, why not. The truth 
                        is, I am ... an astronaut.

                                 ADAM
                        An astronaut.

                                 THE PILOT
                        From the future.

                                 ADAM
                        The future.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Yes. I have to repair my spaceship 
                        and complete my mission, or the 
                        future as you know it -- as you 
                        will know it -- will cease to 
                        exist. Any information beyond that 
                        is strictly classified.
           A long pause. Adam pulls out a cellphone and starts dialing.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What are you doing?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm calling my mom. She's way worse 
                        than the cops.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I believe you. Listen ...

           The Pilot trails off when he sees that the phone in Adam's 
           hands isn't a normal phone -- it's the iPhone-looking device 
           we saw The Pilot using earlier.

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... where'd you get that?

                                 ADAM
                        I took it from you. It's called 
                        stealing, something you obviously 
                        know a lot about. 
                             (he can't get it to work)
                        What is it anyway, like an iPhone?

           For the first time, The Pilot seems genuinely scared. He 
           desperately fumbles with his bonds, trying to get free.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Listen, kid ... could you point it 
                        another way? -- 

                                 ADAM
                        -- I don't recognize these apps --

                                 THE PILOT
                        -- Adam -- !

           The Pilot FREES HIMSELF, just as the device ACTIVATES, 
           emitting a SHOCKWAVE that PROPELS Adam and The Pilot back off 
           their feet, DEMOLISHING the roof of the shed in the process. 
           Splinters fall like rain.

           The Pilot recovers. He retrieves the smoking gadget from Adam 
           -- now and forever known as the ATHENS DEVICE. Adam looks up 
           at this flightsuited stranger. Seeing him with new eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        ... not an iPhone?

           The Pilot shakes his head 'no'.
                                 ADAM
                        ... astronaut?

           The Pilot nods his head 'yes'.

                                 ADAM
                        ... from the future?

           The Pilot nods again 'yes'. Now he's getting it. 

           Adam pulls himself to his feet -- the gears in his head 
           whirling -- until only one question remains. A slow smile.

                                 ADAM
                        ... spaceship?

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Adam follows The Pilot into the woods, struggling to keep up. 
           The Pilot scans the area, searching for something.

                                 ADAM
                        This is incredible. No one's gonna 
                        believe that an astronaut crashed 
                        in my backyard! And from the 
                        future!
                             (a sudden thought)
                        ... wait a minute. You're not here 
                        to terminate anyone, are you?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Not yet. My ship crashed more than 
                        a decade short of its target. The 
                        sooner I get out of here and get on 
                        with my mission, the better.

                                 ADAM
                        What's your mission?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Can't tell you. Classified.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh, come on, who do you think I'm 
                        gonna tell? Who do you think would 
                        believe me?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Doesn't matter. From this point 
                        forward, the less you know about 
                        me, the better.

                                 ADAM
                        Why? Because of the ripples?
                                 THE PILOT
                             (a backwards glance)
                        ... the ripples?

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah. I mean, how does it work? Can 
                        you cause a ripple in the past that 
                        changes the future, like in Back to 
                        the Future, or are you creating an 
                        alternate reality to branch off 
                        from this one, like in Star Trek?

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's, uh, classified.

                                 ADAM
                        Can you at least tell me what year 
                        you're from?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Nope. Classified.

                                 ADAM
                        Well what's the future like?

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's very classified.

                                 ADAM
                        What are we looking for out here?

           KONK! Adam COLLIDES into SOMETHING INVISIBLE and falls flat 
           on his ass. The Pilot is relieved --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Finally. I swear, I can never 
                        remember where I parked the damn 
                        thing.

           The Pilot activates his Athens device -- pushes a button --

                                 THE PILOT
                        You might want to stand back.

           Suddenly, the air around Adam starts to SHIMMER -- 

           THE STAR CAPSULE UNCLOAKS, towering over him, standing TWO 
           STORIES TALL. PUSH IN on Adam, taking it in, overwhelmed. He 
           smiles --

                                 ADAM
                        Welcome to the future ...
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The Pilot has scaled the shell of the ship; he's using the 
           tools he stole from the shed to pry open an access panel. FAR 
           BELOW, Adam calls up to The Pilot -- mid-argument --

                                 ADAM
                        Come on, it's not like I want to 
                        leave the galaxy, just -- take me 
                        around the moon or something! 
                        What's the big deal?

                                 THE PILOT
                        First, it's not an amusement park 
                        ride. Second, you aren't trained. 
                        Third ... what are you, nine?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm twelve.

                                 THE PILOT
                             (a glance down)
                        Really? Late bloomer?

           Adam flips The Pilot the bird. 

           KA-CHUNK! The Pilot finishes peeling away the panel. A SOFT 
           BLUE GLOW shines from within. Slowly, reverently, he reaches 
           in and pulls out -- 

           THE CELIUM CORE. A blue orb, about the size and shape of a 
           softball, pulsating with an unknown, self-generated light.

                                 ADAM
                        What is that? And don't say 
                        classified.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I was worried it was damaged in the 
                        crash. It's celium -- an elemental 
                        energy, harvested from the deepest 
                        regions of the Earth. It's what 
                        makes it all possible. Time travel, 
                        superluminal flight ... all of it.

                                 ADAM
                        Cool ... 
                             (beat)
                        Can I have it?

           The Pilot looks down at Adam: you've gotta be kidding. Adam 
           shrugs: worth a shot.
           MOMENTS LATER, The Pilot shimmies down the length of the 
           capsule, landing with an IMPRESSIVE FLIP -- the same move we 
           saw Tommy employ earlier. He assesses the ship's damage.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I'll need a day, maybe two, to get 
                        her off the ground. All I need from 
                        you is to keep my presence here a 
                        secret until I finish my repairs. 
                        Do you think you can handle that?

                                 ADAM
                        Depends. What's in it for me?

                                 THE PILOT
                        For starters, I won't lock you in 
                        the ship's brig until I'm ready to 
                        take off.

                                 ADAM
                        You wouldn't.

           The Pilot gives Adam his best poker face ... but ultimately 
           caves, his bluff called --

                                 THE PILOT
                        What do you want from me, kid? 
                        Stock tips?

                                 ADAM
                        I told you. I want to help.

                                 THE PILOT
                        And how do you think you can help?

           Adam isn't sure he wants to broach this, but sees no choice --

                                 ADAM
                        ... I can tell you something. 
                        Something you should probably know.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What's that?

           The Pilot notices Adam is backing away from him. The Pilot's 
           expression darkens. Uh-oh. He matches Adam's pace forward.

                                 ADAM
                        Before, when you were passed out?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Yeah ...
                                 ADAM
                        I, uh ... I sort of ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam. What. Did. You. Do?

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - FOYER - NIGHT

           POLICE LIGHTS strobe red-and-blue in the driveway as Adam 
           stands alone at the door, talking to TWO COPS.

                                 COP 1
                        A noise. You heard a noise.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, like a boom -- boom -- boom. 
                        I thought maybe someone broke in, 
                        but it was just the storm.

                                 COP 2
                        Are you here by yourself?

                                 ADAM
                        That's why I got scared. You're not 
                        gonna tell my Mom, are you?

           As Adam speaks, PULL BACK to REVEAL -- THE PILOT, crouched in 
           hiding about ten feet away, Athens device in hand. Bosco 
           immediately comes up and starts licking his face.

                                 THE PILOT
                        No -- no, bad dog. Bad. Dog.

           ON COP 1, craning his neck to peer into the house. All he 
           sees is Bosco's tail, swishing happily back and forth.

                                 COP 1
                        ... do you mind if we step inside a 
                        minute?

           He's already letting himself in, but Adam blocks his path.

                                 ADAM
                        Sorry. I'm not supposed to let 
                        strangers into the house.

                                 COP 1
                        You're not supposed to call the 
                        cops over a thunderstorm, either.

                                 COP 2
                        Hey, c'mon, give the kid a break. 
                        You remember being that age, don't 
                        you?
                                 COP 1
                        Not really.

                                 COP 2
                             (to Adam, friendly)
                        What are you, nine?

           It pains him to the core, but Adam nods 'yes'. Cop 2 gives 
           Cop 1 an imploring look, and Cop 1 relents --

                                 COP 1
                        All right, we'll let this one 
                        slide. Just remember, 911's only 
                        for emergencies, all right?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, sir.

                                 COP 2
                        Lock this door when we're gone.

           The cops head off. Adam starts to push the door closed, when 
           he sees BONNIE'S CAR pulling up at the curb. Bonnie is out in 
           a panic, running for the house.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh my God, what happened!? ADAM!

                                 COP 1
                        He's fine, ma'am, just a little 
                        misunderstanding ...

           Adam SLAMS the door and runs for The Pilot's hiding spot --

                                 ADAM
                        Hey, you gotta get out of here, my 
                        mom's -- !

           -- but The Pilot is gone. Shit!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Pilot explores the house, pausing in front of a SHELF of 
           FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS. One in particular catches his eye -- Adam 
           and Tommy are posed with their FATHER, several years earlier. 

           The Pilot is so caught up staring at the photograph, he 
           hardly notices as Adam comes barreling into the room --

                                 ADAM
                        What are you doing!? My Mom's home!

                                 THE PILOT
                        What?
                                 ADAM
                        Hide!!

           Too late -- a light FLICKS ON, and Bonnie comes in, a 
           maelstrom of maternal concern.

                                 BONNIE
                        Adam!

           She pulls up short at the sight of The Pilot. Frozen moment. 
           They all just stare at each other ... until The Pilot flashes 
           a smile and extends a hand --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Hey there. You must be Adam's Mom. 
                        Mike Denton. Nice to finally meet 
                        you.

           Bonnie doesn't take The Pilot's hand.

                                 BONNIE
                        What's going on here?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Huh. I guess your son hasn't 
                        mentioned me after all.
                             (to Adam, reprimanding)
                        I told you, Adam. It's nothing to 
                        be ashamed of. Needing a tutor.

           Adam and Bonnie register this with comically matching 
           expressions. A tutor? Suddenly, TOMMY comes bursting in.

                                 TOMMY
                        Mom, what happened to the shed -- ?
                             (he stops, re: The Pilot)
                        Who's this?

           Adam chimes in quickly --

                                 ADAM
                        He's my, uh, tutor. Science tutor.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam just got a little scared, 
                        being left here alone and all.

           Bonnie shoots Tommy a burning look. Alone?

                                 THE PILOT
                        I don't live far, so he gave me a 
                        call and I came right over.
                                 BONNIE
                        Well ... thank you, Mr. -- sorry, 
                        what was your name again?

           The Pilot hesitates -- for a second, he can't remember the 
           name he obviously made up -- but it comes back to him --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Mike. Denton.

                                 BONNIE
                        Out of curiosity, who's paying you?

           Adam thinks fast --

                                 ADAM
                        I am! I didn't want you to know I 
                        needed help, so I saved my 
                        allowance and paid him myself.

           Tommy regards Adam with suspicion. The Pilot feigns surprise.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You're kidding. Your own allowance?
                             (to Bonnie)
                        I swear, I had no idea.

                                 BONNIE
                        Well, that ends now. I'm more than 
                        happy to pay. How much do I owe you 
                        for tonight?

                                 THE PILOT
                        No no, please. It was my pleasure.

                                 BONNIE
                        At least let me make it up to you. 
                        For the inconvenience. How about 
                        dinner tomorrow? My treat.

           Something in Bonnie's tone tells The Pilot she won't be 
           taking 'no' for an answer. He gives in with a smile.

           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Adam and Bonnie send The Pilot off from the doorway --

                                 BONNIE
                        Are you sure you don't need a ride?

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's no problem, I live close. See 
                        you tomorrow, Adam! We'll make some 
                        progress on that science project.
           Wink wink. Adam catches the drift. He nods, speechless, as 
           The Pilot heads off down the street. Finally, Adam turns to 
           address his mother's withering gaze --

                                 ADAM
                        ... I'm sorry I lied.

           But Bonnie just pulls him into a hug.

                                 BONNIE
                        I'm just glad you're okay.

           Over his mother's shoulder, Adam meets eyes with Tommy -- 
           casually chucking a ball into his open glove, not bothering 
           to hide his mistrust. THUD -- THUD -- THUD --

           INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Adam lies in bed. He looks up as Tommy darkens his doorway.

                                 TOMMY
                        Hey.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey.

                                 TOMMY
                        So. You hired a tutor.

                                 ADAM
                        Yep.

                                 TOMMY
                        With your own allowance.

           Adam says nothing.

                                 TOMMY
                        It's funny, cause I thought you 
                        were saving for a wii.
                             (he regards the console)
                        That one there.

                                 ADAM
                        I -- won that off Joe. On a bet.

                                 TOMMY
                        Really. What'd you bet?

                                 ADAM
                        That you'd hit two homers in your 
                        game against Southfield. You hit 
                        three, so he had to kick in the 
                        extra controls.
           Tommy stares at Adam -- through him -- then nods, giving up 
           the line of questioning for now.

                                 TOMMY
                        All right. Next time you need help, 
                        just ask me. That's what I'm here 
                        for.

           Tommy heads off. Once alone, Adam pulls out the space comic -- 

           An illustration of a square-jawed astronaut smiles out at 
           him: ADVENTURES THROUGH SPACE AND TIME WITH ASTRONAUT MIKE 
           DENTON. 

           Adam frowns. He looks from the comic to Tommy's departing 
           shadow ... his own suspicions starting to form ...

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - NIGHT

           A METEOR SHOWER is in progress, streaks of light racing 
           across the nighttime sky. Strangely, one of the meteors seems 
           to be going the WRONG DIRECTION -- getting larger, closer.

           A BURST OF FIRE as the meteor breaches the atmosphere and 
           CRASHES DOWN into the field. It's another star capsule.

           The door HISSES OPEN and a MAN EMERGES, descending the ramp. 
           He wears the same flightsuit as The Pilot, but the insignia 
           identifies him as a higher rank. This is THE CAPTAIN. We 
           recognize him as one of the astronauts from the blood-stained 
           photograph. His cold shark eyes survey the empty field ...

           The Captain pulls something from his pocket. It looks like an 
           iPhone. We already know it's not. The device BEEPS 
           RHYTHMICALLY. The Captain follows its signal.

           ACROSS THE FIELD, a PARK RANGER SUV pulls up and a RANGER 
           climbs out -- staring up in awe at the star capsule towering 
           over him. He spots The Captain -- runs to intercept --

                                 RANGER
                        Uh, excuse me? Sir? Park's closed. 
                        Anyway, you can't leave your, uh...
                             (squints at the ship)
                        ... what is that?

           Without even looking up, The Captain DISCHARGES a PULSE OF 
           SOUND WAVES from his device (a bloomer) -- sending the Ranger 
           SPRAWLING BACK into an unconscious heap.

           The Captain resumes his search. His device beeps FASTER, 
           until he finds himself standing over a BLINKING TRANSPONDER, 
           landed in the periphery of the field. 
           The Captain picks up the transponder. Stiffs a smile. Then 
           CRUSHES it in his hand until it stops blinking. He stalks 
           off, muttering under his breath --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Lucky break, kid ... you only get 
                        one of those.

           MOMENTS LATER, an OFF-SCREEN BLAST --

           The Ranger jolts to his feet in time to see the star capsule 
           taking off, rising into the sky, before CAMOUFLAGING with the 
           starfield beyond and VANISHING COMPLETELY. 

           The Ranger falls to his knees and faints.

           EXT. SKY OVER MICHIGAN - NIGHT

           The Captain pilots his capsule into position, high over the 
           GLITTERING LIGHTS of the world below. With the rest of the 
           ship camouflaged, he appears to be FLOATING -- until --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Computer. Let's begin.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Initiating surveillance.

           DATA APPEARS, swirling around The Captain. An ERUPTION OF 
           SOUND as the capsule monitors COUNTLESS TRANSMISSIONS and 
           CELLPHONE SIGNALS; it's a BLUR of NOISE, but The Captain is 
           able to parse it effortlessly, resting back as if he were 
           listening to classical music.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I know you're out there ...

           The noise builds to a CRESCENDO as we CUT TO --

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           The next day. The Pilot works on the ship, sorting through a 
           mess of tangled wiring. Adam serves as The Pilot's helper, 
           handing off tools, trying not to get underfoot.

                                 ADAM
                        So you're saying there are others 
                        like you? Other astronauts?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Not many. Six in all. The program 
                        was extremely selective. Even where 
                        I'm from, no one knows we exist.
                                 ADAM
                        Why not?

           As he works, The Pilot activates the ship's MEMORY BANK and 
           HOLOGRAPHIC RECORDINGS of PAST VOYAGES explode all around 
           him. Adam staggers back as STARS and NEBULAE swirl past -- a 
           tour of the cosmos in the middle of the Michigan wilderness.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Since the 1960's, interstellar 
                        travel has been the government's 
                        game. Arnand Zucker changed all 
                        that. A self-made man -- an 
                        entrepreneur -- and, incidentally, 
                        one of the richest men on the 
                        planet. At least he was, until he 
                        sunk his fortune into the first 
                        private sector space program.
                             (beat)
                        It was a total accident, the first 
                        time we did it.

                                 ADAM
                        Did what?

           The Pilot smiles. Even now, it takes his breath away.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Broke the speed of light.

           Suddenly, the holographic view of the cosmos CONTORTS into a 
           WORMHOLE. We witness the rush of FASTER THAN LIGHT SPEED.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Celium made it all possible. And 
                        the faster we flew, the further 
                        back we went. First just a few 
                        seconds ... then a day, then a 
                        week, then a year. Nothing could 
                        stop us. The final barrier to man's 
                        dominion over space and time had 
                        fallen. But if the government found 
                        out what we'd done, they would've 
                        shut us down in a heartbeat. So, we 
                        kept it a secret. We all agreed, 
                        the power was too great to share 
                        with the world. Turns out, it was 
                        too great for us, too. The program 
                        took a turn. Zucker ... changed.

                                 ADAM
                        And that's why you're here. That's 
                        your mission! You're trying to stop 
                        time travel from being invented!
           The Pilot doesn't deny it. He looks up at the capsule with a 
           mixture of awe and contempt.

                                 THE PILOT
                        God willing, you'll grow up in a 
                        future in which this machine never 
                        exists.

           Holographic images FADE, returning the woods to their 
           original state. The Pilot goes back to work, as Adam is hit 
           with a sudden thought --

                                 ADAM
                        What about the other pilots? Aren't 
                        they gonna come looking for you?

           A beat -- just a hint of emotion --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Not all of them ...
                             (then, cutting off 
                              questions)
                        Hand me that torque wrench.

           Adam obliges. As he does, we WIDEN to REVEAL -- TOMMY. Spying 
           from the cover of heavy woods. No way of knowing how long 
           he's been there, or how much he overheard ...

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           That night. Adam and Tommy sit opposite The Pilot and Bonnie 
           at the cramped dinner table. Bosco is affectionately licking 
           The Pilot's palms, nuzzling against his leg.

                                 BONNIE
                        That's amazing ... he never takes 
                        to strangers like that.

           The Pilot quickly stands, trying to shake off the beast.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Anyone need a re-fill?

                                 BONNIE
                        You know, why not. Special 
                        occasion. The glasses are in the --

           But The Pilot is already pulling a glass form the appropriate 
           cupboard.

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... lucky guess.
           Adam frowns; he's heard that exact excuse before. The Pilot 
           returns to his seat, surreptitiously kicking Bosco away, but 
           the dog's not budging. Finally, Tommy makes his move --

                                 TOMMY
                        So. How's your science fair project 
                        coming?

                                 ADAM
                        Since when do you care?

                                 TOMMY
                        Since I saw it. Today. In the 
                        woods.

           CLANK. Adam drops his fork.

                                 TOMMY
                        I have to admit, I'm impressed. Did 
                        you build that all on your own?

                                 BONNIE
                        Build what?

                                 ADAM
                        It's a ... a, uh --

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's a spaceship.

           Adam shoots The Pilot a look. What are you doing!?

                                 BONNIE
                        A spaceship? Really?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Just a model, of course. A 
                        prototype of what I think space 
                        travel will look like in the 
                        future. Kind of a hobby of mine. 
                        Adam's been helping me out.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, but I mean, it doesn't fly or 
                        anything.

           Adam LAUGHS, as if that were ridiculous ... then keeps 
           laughing, overselling it. The Pilot quietly kicks him.

                                 BONNIE
                             (indicates Tommy)
                        Well, you should definitely talk to 
                        this one. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BONNIE (CONT'D)
                        I thought it was just a phase, you 
                        know, all kids want to be 
                        astronauts when they grow up, but 
                        we're still waiting for him to grow 
                        out of it.

                                 TOMMY
                        Mom --

                                 BONNIE
                        What? Don't be shy. 
                             (to The Pilot, beaming)
                        He's already been accepted to 
                        Caltech. Full scholarship.

                                 TOMMY
                        I haven't decided if I'm going yet.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You will.
                             (off Tommy's look)
                        Trust me. I have kind of a knack 
                        about these things.

           Across the table, Adam looks from The Pilot to Tommy ... the 
           resemblance is becoming harder to deny with every moment.

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Bonnie washes dishes over the sink; The Pilot is on drying 
           duty. THROUGH THE DOORWAY, Adam discreetly listens in.

                                 BONNIE
                        I want to thank you for taking an 
                        interest in Adam. He tries hard, 
                        but sometimes he just needs a 
                        little extra push. I'd do it 
                        myself, but there aren't always 
                        enough hours in the day.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You do enough.

                                 BONNIE
                        ... yeah? How would you know? You 
                        just met me.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I hear it from Adam. In fact, just 
                        the other day, he was telling me 
                        how much he appreciates everything 
                        you do.
                                 BONNIE
                        Adam said that? Not a chance ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        He talks about you a lot, actually.

                                 BONNIE
                             (beat)
                        What else does he say?

                                 THE PILOT
                        He says ... it couldn't have been 
                        easy for you. To raise two kids all 
                        on your own. To lose your husband 
                        so young. He says he understands.

                                 BONNIE
                        Understands ... ?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Why you push him so hard. He says 
                        he doesn't want to let you down.

           Bonnie is moved, almost to tears, but she plays it off with a 
           shrug, forcing herself to focus on the dishes.

                                 BONNIE
                        That doesn't sound like Adam.

           ON ADAM, reacting; it sure doesn't! The Pilot resumes drying.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Sometimes kids have a hard time 
                        saying what they really mean. Until 
                        it's too late.

           Bonnie finds herself staring at The Pilot. He catches her eye 
           and she looks away, embarrassed.

                                 BONNIE
                        Sorry ... you suddenly just seemed 
                        so familiar to me.

                                 THE PILOT
                        One of those faces, I guess.

           Bonnie's hand comes down, accidentally brushing against The 
           Pilot's ... and it lingers. Instantly, The Pilot JERKS AWAY.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Uh, you know, damn, look at the 
                        time. I should go.
                                 BONNIE
                        You sure? Dessert's in the oven. My 
                        world famous cobbler.

                                 THE PILOT
                        No, yeah, I forgot, I'm late for a 
                        thing. But thank you. For dinner. 
                        And, uh ... you know ... I meant 
                        it. What I said. See ya!

           The Pilot trips over his own two feet, stumbling on his way 
           out the door, leaving Bonnie dumbstruck. She turns back to 
           the dishes with an inward sigh --

                                 BONNIE
                        World famous cobbler ... who are 
                        you kidding?

           CLOSE ON ADAM, staring after The Pilot ... the beginnings of 
           an idea starting to take hold ...

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           A FLASHLIGHT BEAM cuts through darkness as Adam steps through 
           the woods. Suddenly -- 

           KONK! He finds the star capsule the same way he did before, 
           and falls flat on his ass.

           MOMENTS LATER, Adam feels around the shell of the invisible 
           ship, looking for a way in. Suddenly, BLUE LIGHT fills the 
           air, piercing the evening mist. Adam's hand is SCANNED.

                                 COMPUTER VOICE
                        Welcome, Adam Archer.

           Adam frowns --

                                 ADAM
                        It knows me ... ?

           The capsule UNCLOAKS and the doorway OPENS. Adam checks 
           around -- no sign of The Pilot. He steps inside.

           INT. STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

           Lights FLICKER ON, revealing the central command console -- a 
           complicated array of levers and switches.

           Adam sits in the pilot's chair, which immediately CONTORTS to 
           fit his shape. A JOYSTICK is thrust into his grasp, like the 
           control mechanism for a fighter jet.
                                 ADAM
                        Wow.

           A RED BUTTON is perched on the stick. It has all the tempting 
           appeal of any red button to a curious 12-year-old mind ... 
           so, naturally, Adam PUSHES IT --

           The capsule ROARS TO LIFE, the HUM of machinery building to a 
           HIGH WHINE.

           A SIGNAL IS TRANSMITTED and we FOLLOW IT, out of the ship, 
           into the sky, through clouds, until we arrive at --

           EXT. SKY OVER MICHIGAN - NIGHT

           The Captain sits in a meditative pose amid his cocoon of 
           data. The signal reaches his vessel. His eyes SNAP OPEN.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Got you.

           The capsule UNCLOAKS, materializing around The Captain, as he 
           RACES OFF, zeroing in on his target.

           INT. STAR CAPSULE/EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The viewscreen comes alive with DATA and MEASUREMENTS; 
           contour lines SCANNING and MAPPING the heavens above. 

           Adam TOUCHES one of the stars, and our view ZOOMS IN, mapping 
           the constellation in incredible three-dimensional detail. The 
           lights of the cosmos SPARKLE in Adam's eyes ... until --

                                 THE PILOT
                        What the hell are you doing!?

           The Pilot drags Adam backwards out of the ship.

                                 ADAM
                        Hey! Get off!

           Once clear, The Pilot uses his handheld device to deactivate 
           the capsule. He scans the skies, genuinely worried.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I told you not to touch anything!

                                 ADAM
                        I was only looking for ...

           He trails off. The Pilot turns.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What?
                                 ADAM
                        ... proof.
                             (off The Pilot's look)
                        The first time you saw me, you 
                        recognized me. And -- and you knew 
                        my name before I told you, and the 
                        combination to the shed, and Bosco 
                        actually likes you, and -- admit 
                        it!

           In The Pilot's eyes: resignation. He's busted. Adam has never 
           been more sure of anything. He nods.

                                 ADAM
                        You're Tommy.

           A beat ... then The Pilot BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Tommy? You think I'm Tommy!?

                                 ADAM
                        ... aren't you?

                                 THE PILOT
                        No. Adam. God. I'm you.

           This sinks in. Adam stares at The Pilot. Shakes his head.

                                 ADAM
                        No way.

                                 THE PILOT
                        All right. You broke your arm on 
                        Brad Walden's trampoline when you 
                        were six years old. When the doctor 
                        set your arm, it left a scar.

                                 ADAM
                        How did you -- ?

           The Pilot rolls up his sleeve, revealing a LIGHT SCAR on his 
           right arm -- a slightly peculiar CURVED SHAPE. 

           Adam rolls up his own sleeve. While his younger scar is 
           slightly more prominent, it's the EXACT SAME SHAPE.

           A surreal, universe-bending moment. Adam staggers back. The 
           Pilot is about to explain further, when a LOW BEEPING catches 
           his attention. He moves to the star capsule, peers inside --

           The main viewscreen FLASHES a warning: INCOMING FIRE 
           DETECTED.
           Before The Pilot can react, a PULSE descends from above and 
           the capsule EXPLODES in a BALL OF FIRE, throwing the Adams 
           back off their feet.

           IN THE SKY, The Captain's star capsule has arrived, already 
           circling around for another shot.

           The Pilot recovers from the blast. He takes in the WRECKAGE 
           of his ship, devastated. Suddenly, Adam starts RUNNING back 
           in the direction of his house. The Pilot gives chase.

                                 ADAM
                        Help! Mom! Tommy! HELP!!!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam! Get back here! We have to 
                        leave them out of this!

                                 ADAM
                        Leave ME out of this!!!

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's too late for that!

           The Pilot TACKLES Adam. They wrestle around. Adam FLAILS and 
           PUNCHES and KICKS and SCREAMS.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You're only hurting yourself!

           The Captain broadcasts overhead --

                                 THE CAPTAIN (O.C.)
                        That was your only warning, Adam. 
                        Give up now, and there'll be no 
                        need to involve the kid further.

           Adam breaks from The Pilot, starts waving his arms in the 
           air.

                                 ADAM
                        We surrender! We surrender!

           The Pilot pulls Adam hard into the woods.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Jesus, cut it out. You're 
                        embarrassing yourself.

                                 ADAM
                        But he's only after you!
                                 THE PILOT
                        You are me. He can take out either 
                        one of us and still get what he 
                        wants. And no offense, but you're a 
                        hell of an easier target.

                                 ADAM
                        So what are we gonna do!?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Relax. I have a plan.

           The Pilot pinches a pressure point on Adam's neck -- the kid 
           instantly falls unconscious.

           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain's radar detects TWO TARGETS -- 
           one moving, one not. He pursues the target that isn't moving.

           ON THE PILOT, running for all he's worth. He slides down into 
           a CRATER, landing amid the SCORCHED WRECKAGE of his star 
           capsule. In the debris, he finds what he's looking for --

           The celium core. Glowing and intact. He takes it and RUNS --

           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain flies low to the ground. The 
           console maps the woods before him -- too thick to penetrate. 

           He FIRES a PULSE of SOUND WAVES --

           Trees BEND and SNAP, clearing a path. WIDEN to REVEAL -- 

           Adam. Still unconscious, as the capsule bears down on his 
           position. The Pilot is using his younger self as bait!

           ON THE PILOT, pitching through heavy woods, desperately 
           trying to activate his handheld device. It must have been 
           damaged in the blast.

           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain closes in, radar locked, ready to 
           fire, when he sees -- ADAM, lying helpless before him. 

           ON THE CAPTAIN ... the faintest hint of RECOGNITION ...

           Suddenly, The Pilot appears, throwing himself between Adam 
           and the ship. He MEETS EYES with The Captain through the 
           cockpit window as his Athens device POWERS UP, UNFOLDING into 
           a HANDHELD WEAPON. He raises the blaster --

           THE PILOT AND THE CAPTAIN FIRE SIMULTANEOUSLY. The blasts 
           COLLIDE in a SHOCK WAVE that sweeps The Pilot off his feet.

           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain struggles to regain control of 
           his ship, circling around, lining up another shot.
           ON THE PILOT, recovering. He searches the area and finds his 
           blaster -- landed in the branches of a tree, high above. 

           The Pilot RACES FORWARD and PARKOURS UP THE TREE. Adam comes 
           to, just in time to see this, amazed: look at me go!!

           ON THE PILOT, reaching the top. He grabs for the blaster, but 
           it FALLS FROM HIS GRASP, clattering down the branches. Damn!

           The Captain FIRES. No time to think. The Pilot LEAPS from the 
           tree, using the branches the way a gymnast would use the 
           uneven bars. The tree EXPLODES above him, erupting in flames--

           -- as The Pilot lands on his back, blaster now in hand. He 
           aims up at the capsule as it passes overhead -- FIRES --

           A direct hit. The pulse SLAMS INTO THE CAPSULE, and the ship 
           SPINS off course, slicing across treetops.

           ON ADAM, climbing to his feet, completely unaware of the 
           MASSIVE SHIP hurdling towards him. The Pilot sees what's 
           happening --

                                 THE PILOT
                        ADAM, DOWN!

           Finally, Adam sees the ship coming. He stands there, frozen, 
           too scared to do much of anything else.

           From The Pilot's POV, the ship CRASHES, and Adam is LOST in a 
           CLOUD OF DEBRIS. 

           Panicked, The Pilot runs for the wreckage, but just as he 
           approaches, the capsule ZAPS OFF into the sky at near the 
           speed of light. Gone. Retreated. For now.

           Dust clears and we find ADAM, lying on his back near the 
           crash site. The Pilot crouches over him --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam. Are you all right? Can you 
                        hear me?

           Adam comes to. His hand instinctively goes to a SHRAPNEL 
           WOUND on his neck and comes back bloody. He gasps --

                                 ADAM
                        I'm bleeding ... I'm bleeding!

           The Pilot inspects the cut -- nothing serious.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I think we'll live.
           Adam fumbles for his inhaler. The Pilot frowns -- sensing 
           something. His hand goes to his own neck, where the EXACT 
           SAME SCAR has formed. A look of realization -- figuring out 
           the rules -- as Adam takes a DEEP HIT off his inhaler.

                                 ADAM
                        Am I gonna die?

           The Pilot snaps to attention.

                                 THE PILOT
                        No, you're not gonna die. You're a 
                        soldier now, and I'm your 
                        commanding officer. That means you 
                        do exactly what I say, when I say 
                        it, and you live. Understand?

           A beat. Adam nods.

                                 ADAM
                        Yes, sir.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Good. And right now ... 
                             (he thinks; nods)
                        We need to run.

           The Pilot takes Adam's hand and HAULS him off into the woods.

           EXT. SUMMIT - NIGHT

           The star capsule has landed on an isolated summit, damaged 
           from the fight, on its last legs. The Captain deploys a 
           BEACON, which SHOOTS UP into the sky. A moment passes ...

           Suddenly, the sky above CONTORTS. A WORMHOLE OPENS, and 
           ANOTHER STAR CAPSULE APPEARS, coming in for a landing beside 
           The Captain's busted vessel. The door opens --

           THREE ASTRONAUTS step out, wearing matching flightsuits, each 
           of them recognizable from the blood-stained photograph. 

           JASPER is bulky and tough. LAURA is steely and focused. DASH 
           is the youngest. He greets The Captain with a smile --

                                 DASH
                        Hiya, Cap. Little engine trouble?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Shut up, Dash.

           The Captain pushes past, into the newly arrived capsule. The 
           astronauts exchange nervous glances -- not the greeting they 
           were expecting.
           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain arms himself from a RACK of 
           FUTURISTIC GEAR. We catch glimpses of devices to be employed 
           later -- bloomers, stilt runners, plasma gloves, etc.

                                 LAURA
                        Where's Adam?

           The Captain's eyes say it all. Jasper reads him.

                                 JASPER
                        ... he got away? Jesus, how'd you 
                        let that happen!?

                                 LAURA
                        Take it easy, Jasper. Everyone 
                        makes mistakes. He's only human.

           The Captain seems almost offended by that. He pulls on a 
           THICK GLOVE, laced with electric circuitry.

                                 JASPER
                        You should know, Cap, the others 
                        are starting to talk. Boss is 
                        worried you might not be up for 
                        this job.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I'm handling it, aren't I?

                                 JASPER
                        I don't know. Are you?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Adam's on foot with a small kid in 
                        tow, he couldn't have gotten far. I 
                        just need more time.

                                 JASPER
                        Time's the one thing we don't have. 
                        I'm sure I don't have to remind you 
                        what's at stake here.

           The Captain's glove CRACKLES with power. Jasper backs off.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        No. You don't.

           The Captain stalks past Jasper, out of the capsule.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I have the situation under control. 
                        I'll find Adam. I'll bring him in. 
                        Alive.
                                 LAURA
                        And if you can't?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                             (beat; he nods)
                        Then I'll handle him myself.

           As if to illustrate the point, The Captain FIRES the glove: a 
           BOLT ERUPTS from his palm, and RIPS a TOWERING SYCAMORE to 
           splinters. Jasper and Laura are impressed. Dash intervenes --

                                 DASH
                        I don't mean to be a buzzkill, but 
                        ... does anyone even know where 
                        Adam's going?

           Off The Captain's reaction -- working it through. He nods --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We have work to do.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED ROAD - NIGHT

           Adam and The Pilot hitchhike along a deserted road. The Pilot 
           is using his Athens device as a compass. Adam trails behind, 
           struggling to keep up, puffing on his inhaler.

                                 THE PILOT
                        We'll keep off the main roads -- no 
                        airports, no public transportation.

                                 ADAM
                        Can you slow down?

                                 THE PILOT
                        I'll get you back to our Mom as 
                        soon as this is over. Until then, 
                        we have to stick together.

                                 ADAM
                        Seriously ... I can't breathe ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        Yes you can.

           Adam goes to take another hit, when he TRIPS and TUMBLES down 
           an embankment. He looks up. GASPS.

                                 ADAM
                        My inhaler!
           It's gone. Adam frantically paws at the earth until he finds 
           himself at The Pilot's feet. He looks up. The Pilot is 
           holding the inhaler. Adam is relieved, but The Pilot promptly 
           HURLS the inhaler deep into the woods.

                                 THE PILOT
                        There. Now, breathe.

           Adam stares at The Pilot in utter shock ... then starts to 
           HYPERVENTILATE, panicking beyond reason.

                                 ADAM
                        I can't -- I can't! I'm gonna die!

                                 THE PILOT
                        You're not gonna die.

                                 ADAM
                        I can't breathe! My lungs are 
                        collapsing! You're trying to kill 
                        me!

           The Pilot grips Adam's shoulders, forcing eye contact.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam. Look at me. Look at me!

           Adam focuses on his older self. The Pilot speaks calmly --

                                 THE PILOT
                        You can breathe.

           The Pilot inhales deep, demonstrating. Adam does the same. 
           The Pilot exhales slowly. Again, Adam does the same.

                                 ADAM
                        I can breathe ...

           The Pilot nods. Adam smiles -- breathing regularly now. He 
           ERUPTS in ECSTATIC CELEBRATION.

                                 ADAM
                        I CAN BREATHE!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Congratulations.

           The Pilot resumes walking down the road. Adam follows -- 
           keeping up effortlessly now --

                                 THE PILOT
                        You can breathe, you can run, you 
                        can jump, you can swim. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE PILOT (CONT'D)
                        You can do just about anything a 
                        normal kid can do, and then some. 
                        Just stop eating peanuts. Mild 
                        allergy. Very common.

                                 ADAM
                        Really? That's it?

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's it. You would've found out 
                        for yourself soon enough, but we 
                        don't have that kind of time. We 
                        have a long road ahead of us.

                                 ADAM
                        You still haven't told me where 
                        we're going.

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's classified.

           Adam pulls up short.

                                 ADAM
                        ... still!?

           The Pilot doesn't break his stride; he's obviously not 
           joking. Adam rolls his eyes and follows, muttering under his 
           breath: unbelievable ...

           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH - DAY

           The doorbell RINGS. From inside, we hear FAST-APPROACHING 
           FOOTSTEPS. The door SWINGS OPEN -- Bonnie is a nervous wreck, 
           surprised to find police officers crowding her doorstep -- 

           The Captain, Jasper, Laura and Dash, all dressed as cops. 
           Jasper takes point --

                                 JASPER
                        Good morning, ma'am. You filed a 
                        missing persons report?

                                 BONNIE
                        I tried ... the woman on the phone 
                        said to call back after it'd been 
                        twenty-four hours.

                                 JASPER
                        That would be Cheryl. We apologize 
                        for her. May we come in?

           Off Bonnie's scrutinizing reaction ...
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           PHOTOS have been splayed across the coffee table, pictures of 
           Adam yanked from their frames. Empty frames everywhere.

                                 JASPER
                        ... and that's the last time you 
                        saw your son? He hasn't called or 
                        tried to make contact?

           Bonnie is distracted, trying to get a look at The Captain, 
           who keeps to the rear of the group, back turned.

                                 BONNIE
                        Uh ... no, he hasn't. I've been 
                        trying to think of who he might be 
                        with, but Adam never really had a 
                        lot of friends ...
                             (she trails off)
                        This just isn't like him.

           Laura displays a photo of The Pilot.

                                 LAURA
                        Do you recognize this man?

           Bonnie looks at the picture, and goes TOTALLY STILL.

                                 BONNIE
                        Well yeah, that's Adam's tutor. Why 
                        do you have his picture?

                                 JASPER
                        This man was seen crossing state 
                        lines earlier today with a boy 
                        matching Adam's description. We 
                        have reason to believe he may have 
                        kidnapped your son.

                                 BONNIE
                        No, that's -- that's impossible, he 
                        was just here. I made him dinner, 
                        he was ... he ...

           Tears spring to Bonnie's eyes, the gravity of the situation 
           finally sinking in. She covers her face.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh my God ... oh God, how could I 
                        be so stupid?

           ON THE CAPTAIN, softening somewhat at the sight of Bonnie 
           breaking down. He steps forward and lays a hand on her arm.
           A cautious glance from the "officers" -- The Captain is 
           clearly breaking protocol. Bonnie finds herself staring at 
           him -- a moment of connection -- almost recognition ...

                                 BONNIE
                        I'm sorry. What did you say your 
                        name was?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... Evans.

           Bonnie shakes her head, it doesn't ring a bell.

                                 BONNIE
                        I must be losing my mind.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        No you're not. You're just under a 
                        lot of stress. Try not to worry.
                             (a salesman smile)
                        We're the good guys.

           Bonnie looks into this stranger's eyes, and calms somewhat 
           ... finding something there she can trust.

           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Adam and The Pilot are on foot, cresting a hill that 
           overlooks a SMALL TOWN in the rural mid-west. Farmland 
           stretches as far as the eye can see.

           INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Adam wanders the aisles, filling a basket with Red Bull and 
           candy bars. OUTSIDE, The Pilot is seen conversing with a 
           MEXICAN FAMILY in what we can only assume is PERFECT SPANISH.

           Adam lays the goods on the counter. He notices a LAND LINE -- 
           whispers to the clerk, conspiratorial --

                                 ADAM
                        Can I use your phone?

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - TOMMY'S BEDROOM - DAY

           A cell-phone VIBRATES -- picked up by Tommy --

                                 TOMMY
                        Hello.
                             (his eyes widen)
                        ... Adam!? Jesus Christ, Mom's been 
                        worried sick about you!

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE BEDROOM AND THE STORE --
                                 ADAM
                        I know, that's why I'm calling. 
                        Just tell her I'm okay.

                                 TOMMY
                        Where are you?

                                 ADAM
                        Uhh, Iowa, I think? Somewhere in 
                        Linn County.

                                 STORE CLERK
                             (chiming in)
                        Actually, Linn's to the east. 
                        You've crossed over into Benton.

           ON TOMMY, taking all this down --

                                 TOMMY
                        Benton ... okay, look, just stay 
                        there. I'm coming after you.

           ON ADAM, seeing The Pilot approaching through the window.

                                 ADAM
                        Okaygreatgottagobye.

           He HANGS UP, just as The Pilot enters, arm around the 
           shoulder of the Mexican patriarch; they're laughing like old 
           friends.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Good news, Adam! Mr. Ramirez here's 
                        been kind enough to offer us a 
                        ride.

                                 MR. RAMIREZ
                        This is your son? He looks just 
                        like you!

           Adam catches The Pilot's look: play along. He shrugs --

                                 ADAM
                        That's what everyone says.

           They start to leave when the clerk intervenes --

                                 STORE CLERK
                        Hey! One dollar for the phone call.

           Busted. Adam meets his older self's accusing stare with an 
           expression of exaggerated innocence.
           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - FOYER - DAY

           The Captain and his team are half out the door, Bonnie 
           feeding them pictures as they go --

                                 BONNIE
                        Are you sure you don't need any of 
                        these? They might help with the 
                        search --

                                 LAURA
                        No, ma'am, thank you, we have 
                        everything we need --

                                 TOMMY (O.C.)
                        Mom!

           Tommy comes bounding into the room. He pulls up short, 
           locking eyes with The Captain ... for a moment, forgetting 
           what he came in to say.

                                 BONNIE
                        Tommy, this is Officer Evans. He's 
                        in charge of finding your brother.

           The Captain extends a hand.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Nice to meet you, Son.

           Reluctantly, Tommy shakes the man's hand. Some kind of charge 
           between them. He shakes it off, comes to his senses.

                                 TOMMY
                        I know where Adam is.

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           The Pilot stalks away from the store, Adam trailing behind.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I said no phone calls, didn't I? 
                        Come to think of it, I'm pretty 
                        sure I made that very clear.

                                 ADAM
                        I know, but -- I don't see what the 
                        big deal is. It's just Tommy!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Oh, sure, it's just Tommy. Except 
                        who the hell do you think is -- ?

           He catches himself before he says too much. Adam frowns.
                                 ADAM
                        Who do I think is what?

           High above, a LOUD POP as the SOUND BARRIER IS BROKEN. A 
           collective gasp from the sparse crowd of pedestrians -- heads 
           tilted back, camera phones aimed to the sky ... but there's 
           nothing to see, no trace of whatever caused the sound. 

           Only The Pilot knows. He drags Adam off towards the pickup.

                                 THE PILOT
                        This is why we don't make phone 
                        calls.

           INT. STAR CAPSULE - DAY

           The console scans the crowd below, automatically focusing in 
           on THE PILOT, bartering with Mr. Ramirez.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Lo siento, Senor, pero mi hijo y 
                        tengo que pedir prestado el camion.

                                 LAURA
                        Target acquired.

                                 DASH
                             (hopeful)
                        Break out the stilts?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Not yet. Get us in range. I want to 
                        talk to him.

                                 JASPER
                        ... talk? Due respect, sir, but I 
                        think the time for diplomacy is 
                        over.

           A beat. The Captain nods, sure of himself.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I want to talk to him.

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

           Mr. Ramirez is shocked at the WAD OF CASH The Pilot has just 
           piled into his hands.

                                 MR. RAMIREZ
                        Are you sure, Senor? This is more 
                        than ... twenty thousand dollars!
                                 THE PILOT
                        Yeah, well, it's worth a lot less 
                        where I come from.
                             (to Adam)
                        Get in!

           MOMENTS LATER, the Adams PEEL OUT of the lot, leaving the 
           Ramirez family behind. Amazed at their good fortune.

           EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

           The Pilot drives, pushing the truck to capacity, weaving 
           through heavy midday traffic.

                                 ADAM
                        Are you mad?

                                 THE PILOT
                        With you? No. I'm thrilled.

           Suddenly, The Pilot's Athens device VIBRATES like a 
           cellphone. Adam covers his ears against the noise.

           The sound takes on shape and texture, until a VOICE emerges 
           from the device -- THE CAPTAIN -- as if he's sitting right 
           next to us. INTERCUT between the pickup and the camouflaged 
           star capsule, hovering just overhead.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Pull over, Adam. No need for this 
                        to get out of hand.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Is that you, Cap?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Listen. We can do this the easy way 
                        or the hard way, but no matter 
                        what, I'm taking you home.

           A beat, as The Pilot considers ... shakes his head --

                                 THE PILOT
                        You're gonna have to catch me 
                        first.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                             (sighs)
                        Have it your way, Kickstand.

           Adam's head is spinning, but that last part registered loud 
           and clear.
                                 ADAM
                        ... TOMMY!?

           The Pilot reaches out and TIGHTENS Adam's seatbelt, before 
           VEERING sharply across the meridian, into the opposing lane 
           of traffic. Cars swerve and honk.

           IN THE CAPSULE, The Captain (who we now know is TOMMY, age 
           46) turns to the others -- nods --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Take him down.

                                 JASPER
                        Now you're talking. Break out the 
                        stilts, Dash!

           Dash pumps his fist, yesss, moves for the back of the ship.

           FOLLOWING THE TRUCK, weaving through SCREAMING TRAFFIC as the 
           air above the road starts to SHIMMER. The star capsule 
           UNCLOAKS, directly overhead. A hatch SLIDES OPEN --

           Dash drops to the road below, wearing a pair of CURVED 
           FIBERGLASS APPENDAGES that absorb the impact. As soon as he's 
           clear, the ship RESUMES CAMOUFLAGE and DISAPPEARS. 

           Dash LUNGES after the pickup, FASTER than the surrounding 
           traffic, sprinting on the stilts like a gazelle. 

           IN THE PICKUP, Adam sees Dash coming.

                                 ADAM
                        Holy shit!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Stilt runners. Cool, huh.
                             (regretting it now)
                        I helped design them.

           ON DASH, closing the gap. He pulls on a PLASMA GLOVE. The 
           circuitry CRACKLES and SPARKS, juicing up, until -- BAM! A 
           BOLT emanates from the glove, RIPPING INTO THE PAVEMENT.

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's enough, Tommy! Someone's 
                        gonna get hurt!

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Little late for that, isn't it?

                                 THE PILOT
                        You know that wasn't me. You know I 
                        didn't kill JR!
           Adam glances to the blood-stained photograph. SIX ASTRONAUTS 
           are featured -- including one woman we haven't met yet. 

           The picture is starting to comes into focus.

           ON DASH, running alongside the pickup without even breaking a 
           sweat. He FIRES his plasma glove --

           -- just as The Pilot SLAMS on the brakes. The blast MISSES, 
           taking out the FRONT TIRES of a BIG RIG, which SKIDS OUT 
           across the freeway.

           Adam CLINGS TO THE DOOR and SCREAMS as The Pilot pulls the 
           wheel hard over, executing a perfect three hundred and sixty-
           degree spin -- skirting the perimeter of the pile-up.

           The Pilot clears the damage area -- a CATACLYSMIC WRECK 
           filling his rearview. He accelerates off-road, through the 
           guardrail, heading for a DISTANT CORNFIELD.

           Dash leaps over fishtailing cars like an Olympic runner 
           clearing hurdles, pursuing the Adams into the field.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY

           The Pilot DRIVES, flattening stalks of corn that obscure his 
           vision. The conversation continues --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I'm sorry Adam, I'm just not buying 
                        it. If you didn't do anything 
                        wrong, then why'd you run?

           The Pilot hesitates before answering.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Because ... there wasn't anyone 
                        left in the program I could trust.

           This sinks in.

           EXPLOSIONS blow CRATERS in the field. One gets too close. 
           IONIZED GAS SHREDS the pickup's tired like MOLTEN LAVA.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Take the wheel!

           No time to explain, The Pilot's already climbing out of the 
           truck.

                                 ADAM
                        I DON'T EVEN HAVE A LEARNER'S 
                        PERMIT!!
           The Pilot climbs along the outside of the truck, onto the 
           flatbed. Stalks of corn WHIP OUT at him as he aims his 
           blaster through the field, counting down Dash's time between 
           jumps. He FIRES -- 

           Direct hit. Dash is BLOWN BACK -- alive, but out of the game.

           ABOVE, the star capsule UNCLOAKS -- long enough for JASPER to 
           drop out on his own pair of stilts. The Pilot takes advantage 
           -- aims up --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Sorry, Tommy.

           He FIRES. The blast SLAMS into the ship, knocking it off 
           course. IN THE COCKPIT, Laura fights with the controls.

                                 LAURA
                        Dammit! He took out our flight 
                        systems! We're going down!

           The Captain SLAMS his device, breaking the connection.

                                 JASPER (O.C.)
                        Don't worry, Cap, I'm on it!

           ON JASPER, leaping through the field like Superman.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Jasper! Remember, we're taking him 
                        alive! Him and the boy!

           Jasper pretends not to hear, focused on the chase. AHEAD, 
           corn stalks BEND, indicating the pickup's position. 

           IN THE TRUCK, The Pilot takes the wheel, shoving Adam aside --

                                 ADAM
                        What happened? You didn't hurt 
                        Tommy, did you?

           The Pilot gives Adam a sideways glance: you're worried about 
           him!? Before he can answer, MORE PLASMA BOLTS, MORE 
           EXPLOSIONS, dangerously close. The doors are BLOWN AWAY. The 
           Pilot checks his mirror -- Jasper gains at a FULL SPRINT.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Sorry, kid. Looks like you're gonna 
                        have to jump.

                                 ADAM
                        Don't call me -- wait, I have to 
                        WHAT!?
                                 THE PILOT
                        Duck and roll. Easy peasy.

           The Pilot KICKS Adam out of the truck. OUTSIDE, Adam ducks 
           and rolls, the corn stalks softening his fall. Kind of.

           ON THE PILOT, driving, coming up on the end of the field. 

           BEHIND HIM, Jasper reaches top speed and LEAPS -- 

           -- sailing CLEAR OVER THE TRUCK --

           -- and landing in The Pilot's path. He TURNS and FIRES --

           BOOM!!! The pickup TILTS END-OVER-END, tumbling over Jasper's 
           head, coming to a stop several feet away.

           Debris settles. Jasper's stilts FOLD IN AUTOMATICALLY as he 
           calmly approaches the mangled remains of the pickup.

           The Pilot staggers from the wreckage, dizzy, but ready to 
           fight. A SINGLE TOUCH from Jasper's glove sends him FLYING 
           BACK. Out cold.

                                 JASPER
                        I won't lie, Adam. I've wanted to 
                        do that for a long time.
                             (he aims the glove)
                        This is for JR.

           Before Jasper can fire, a SHOCKWAVE intervenes, dropping him 
           like a sack of potatoes. REVEAL -- The Captain stands behind 
           him -- the source of the blast. He looms over The Pilot ... 
           for the first time, the nickname sounds almost endearing --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Sorry, Kickstand. No more running.

           FURTHER BACK, we hear the sound of the plasma glove CHARGING 
           UP. The Captain turns -- ADAM is now wearing Jasper's glove.

                                 ADAM
                        Don't call me that.

           Adam FIRES and The Captain goes FLYING BACK, unconscious. 

           The Pilot finally comes to -- The Captain and Jasper splayed 
           out before him. Adam stands triumphantly over them.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Did ... did you do that?
           Adam shrugs: I guess I did. No time to celebrate, though; 
           sounds of pursuit near. Adam and The Pilot RUN through the 
           field. As they do, we RISE UP to REVEAL -- 

           A train, pulling out of a train yard in the distance.

           INT. RAIL CAR - DAY

           The Pilot helps Adam into the moving train, before hauling 
           himself aboard. He instantly COLLAPSES, wounded, exhausted. 

           Adam steps close, as if he means to help ... but grabs The 
           Pilot's Athens device and LEAPS BACK. The device UNFOLDS into 
           BLASTER MODE. This time, Adam knows how to use it.

                                 ADAM
                        Start talking.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam, what the hell are you -- ?

           Adam FIRES, blowing the train door off its hinges.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Jesus!

                                 ADAM
                        Tell me the truth! Why's Tommy 
                        trying to kill us!?
                             (beat; he swallows)
                        Am I a murderer?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam ... no. Of course not, think 
                        about what you're saying. You know 
                        me.

                                 ADAM
                        No I don't! I don't know anything 
                        about you! It's all CLASSIFIED!!

           A long beat. Adam has a point. The Pilot rests against the 
           wall of the rail car ... too exhausted to keep fighting.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You really want to know?

           Adam nods. The Pilot manages a weary smile.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You asked for it.
           INT. RAIL CAR - SUNSET

           The train cuts across the horizon, touring the countryside. 
           Adam and The Pilot sit, legs dangling over the edge, where 
           the door used to be ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        I remember when I was your age, all 
                        I wanted was to be a world champion 
                        snowboarder, like Shaun White. 
                        There was this one trail I was 
                        obsessed with ...

                                 ADAM
                        The Streif.

           The Pilot nods, that's the one.

                                 ADAM
                        So, what happened?
                             (off look)
                        We don't even like to fly.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Things change. One day, about ten 
                        years from now, Tommy shows up at 
                        your door out of the blue. He's not 
                        alone. Arnand Zucker is with him.

           FLASH: The Pilot SHAKES HANDS with Zucker. Good firm grip.

                                 THE PILOT
                        He says he wants Tommy to join some 
                        sort of experimental space program. 
                        Tommy's the golden boy, none of 
                        it's possible without him ... but 
                        he won't go without you.

                                 ADAM
                        And Tommy gets what Tommy wants.

           Adam produces the group photo. He indicates the UNIDENTIFIED 
           WOMAN.

                                 ADAM
                        What about her?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Jimmy Ryan. JR for short. Zucker 
                        recruited her from basic training 
                        at the Air Force. The first time 
                        you set eyes on her, it's like ...

           FLASH: JR's face, for just a blink, and then she's gone. 
           The Pilot falls silent at the memory. Words fail him.

                                 ADAM
                        ... gross.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You'll understand one day.

                                 ADAM
                        Did you ever tell her how you feel? 
                        I mean, do I?

           A beat. The Pilot shakes his head 'no'.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It was never part of the plan.

                                 ADAM
                        ... figures.

           The Pilot takes the photograph and stares down at JR. 
           Haunted, heartbroken. Re-living the memory.

                                 THE PILOT
                        One night, she calls you up and 
                        says she needs to tell you 
                        something. Something she can't tell 
                        anyone else. Not even Tommy.

           FLASH: We're inside an apartment -- signs of a struggle, 
           furniture tossed around. Blood-stained photos protrude from 
           cracked frames. The Pilot crouches over JR as she WHISPERS.

                                 THE PILOT
                        She found out that Zucker was going 
                        into the past for personal gain -- 
                        expanding his empire, building his 
                        fortune. She confronted him ... 
                        said it was time to take the 
                        program public.

                                 ADAM
                        ... so he killed her.

           FLASH: JR dies in The Pilot's arms. He holds her close.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I couldn't save her ...

           Adam catches the slip: 'I' instead of 'you'. The Pilot forges 
           on --
                                 THE PILOT
                        You know it's only a matter of time 
                        before they come after you. So you 
                        do what you always do.

                                 ADAM
                             (nods, not surprised)
                        I run away.

           FLASH: The Pilot takes the bloody photograph from its frame. 
           He RUNS out the back as POLICE LIGHTS arrive at the front.

                                 THE PILOT
                        But you have a plan. You know it's 
                        not enough to just go back and save 
                        JR; that's not what she would've 
                        wanted anyway. You have to end the 
                        program. You have to end it from 
                        the beginning.

                                 ADAM
                        ... then what happens to you?

                                 THE PILOT
                        I don't know. I'm as new at this as 
                        you are. My guess is, I cease to 
                        exist. My future will be in your 
                        hands. Try not to screw it up.

           A beat. Adam feels the weight of responsibility ...

                                 ADAM
                        How do we stop the program?

           The Pilot's device displays an old NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. The 
           headline reads: NOBEL LAUREATE KILLED IN FATAL CRASH. Below, 
           a picture of a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Dr. Marie Gordon. Zucker's partner, 
                        in the early days of the program. 
                        She was the first person to predict 
                        the applications of celium. If we 
                        can convince her to abandon her 
                        research, we can kill Zucker's 
                        dream in the crib before it ruins a 
                        single life.

                                 ADAM
                             (on the article)
                        This says Marie Gordon died in a 
                        car crash more than ten years ago.
                                 THE PILOT
                        July 2, 2000. That's how far back 
                        we have to go. Which is why I was 
                        trying to repair my ship.

                                 ADAM
                        Your ship was destroyed.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Thanks, I noticed.

                                 ADAM
                        So ... what are we doing now?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Now, we're finding another one.

           This sinks in.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh. Well that's not too hard. We 
                        just have to invent time travel. 
                        Decades before anyone else.

           A long pause, as the Adams take in the task before them. Adam 
           has one last question ... but he's almost afraid to ask.

                                 ADAM
                        Do we ever ride the Streif?

           The Pilot wants to lie ... but can't. Adam reads the truth in 
           his eyes, obviously not finding the answer he was looking 
           for. The Pilot puts a consoling hand on his shoulder, as the 
           train rides on ...

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

           The Captain mans the console, studying a map of Adam's 
           trajectory -- a ROLLING INDEX of possible destinations. One 
           in particular catches his eye: GRAND LAKE, COLORADO.

           Suddenly, a PRESENCE from behind. He speaks without turning --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        How's the arm, Jasper?

           REVEAL -- the astronauts are all VISIBLY INJURED from the 
           previous altercation. Dash has a black eye; Laura's face is 
           bruised. Jasper got the worst of it, his arm is in a sling.
                                 JASPER
                        Fine, sir. While we're on the 
                        subject, would you care to explain 
                        why you shot me?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You know why. Our mission hasn't 
                        changed.

                                 JASPER
                        Our mission is bigger than Adam, 
                        and you know it.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Are you here to doubt my resolve, 
                        or do you actually have something 
                        useful to report?

                                 LAURA
                        Actually, sir, Dash had an idea. A 
                        solution we might have overlooked.

           Finally, The Captain turns -- focused on Dash --

                                 DASH
                        Well, yeah, I mean ... the core's 
                        back online, right? All systems are 
                        go, so why don't we just go back 
                        further? To, like, before Adam 
                        became such a problem.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        And do what exactly?

           Dash doesn't have the heart to say it, but Jasper does.

                                 JASPER
                        Neutralize him, sir. Take him out, 
                        before he lives to a be a threat to 
                        the program, the team, and 
                        everything we've fought for.

           The Captain nods, as if that makes perfect sense ... then, he 
           LUNGES for Jasper, SLAMS him hard against the cockpit wall.

                                 LAURA
                        Captain, stop -- !

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Are you out of your mind? We're 
                        here to minimize ripples, and you 
                        want to kill him!?
                                 JASPER
                        How do you know he's not planning 
                        to do the same thing to us?

           The Captain blinks; he hadn't considered that. He releases 
           Jasper. Shakes his head.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        No ... Adam wouldn't do that.

                                 JASPER
                        The same way he wouldn't kill JR? 
                        Or confiscate one of the old man's 
                        ships?

                                 LAURA
                        Jasper has a point. After all this, 
                        we still don't even know what 
                        Adam's trying to do.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        There's nothing he can do. Not 
                        here. To affect real damage to the 
                        program, he'd have to get back at 
                        least another ten years. And 
                        without a ship ...

           The Captain trails off as realization touches his eyes. He 
           SPINS to the console -- still displaying a map of Grand Lake.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Lock these coordinates and fire up 
                        the grid for re-entry!

                                 LAURA
                        ... sir?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I know where Adam's going. MOVE!!

           The astronauts scramble to their stations, as The Captain 
           fixes his stare on the map ... a lion closing in on his prey.

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The star capsule RACES OFF, leaving a BLAZING STREAK.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. COLORADO - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A truck passes a sign: WELCOME TO HISTORIC GRAND LAKE, 
           COLORADO. It pulls over to let Adam and The Pilot out.
           EXT. SHADOW MOUNTAIN JUNIOR HIGH - DAY

           Students swarm out the front, crowding the main lawn. The 
           Adams watch from across the street.

                                 ADAM
                        Is that her?

           A GIRL, 13, is leaving school -- the only one of the crowd 
           not surrounded by friends and classmates. She power-walks 
           (her regular pace), quickly outdistancing her peers. This is 
           JR. The Pilot glances down to the photograph -- still stained 
           with JR's blood. He nods, shaken.

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's her. Jimmy Ryan.

           MOMENTS LATER, JR continues her power-walk home. Adam and The 
           Pilot follow a safe distance back.

                                 ADAM
                        What do I have to do?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Talk to her. You know how to talk 
                        to girls, right?

                                 ADAM
                        Uh, no! Why, do you?

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... not really. Just -- I dunno. 
                        Introduce yourself.

                                 ADAM
                        As what? Her future lover?

                                 THE PILOT
                        You're not -- I mean -- she's not 
                        my -- we haven't --

                                 ADAM
                        Wow, I really don't get better at 
                        this, do I.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Just give her this.

           The Pilot hands Adam a FOLDED NOTE.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You have to convince her to read it 
                        -- and, more importantly, to 
                        believe it.
                                 ADAM
                        Why? What does it say?

           Adam starts to unfold the note. The Pilot snatches it back.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's private.

                                 ADAM
                        How can something be private from 
                        yourself? Technically, I'm the one 
                        who's gonna write it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You haven't written it yet, and 
                        when you do, you'll understand why 
                        you wouldn't let you read it. 

                                 ADAM
                        That doesn't even make sense!

           Adam and The Pilot engage in a quick tug-of-war over the 
           note. Suddenly, a VOICE --

                                 JR (O.C.)
                        Um, excuse me? Hi.

           The Adams turn -- JR has somehow gotten BEHIND THEM, pepper 
           spray in hand.

                                 JR
                        So, you guys have been following me 
                        for like six blocks now. You should 
                        know I'm a state-ranked brown belt 
                        and my dad's a cop.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Investment banker. In jail for 
                        securities fraud, if my math is 
                        right.

           JR frowns --

                                 JR
                        How'd you know that? Who are you?

                                 ADAM
                        He's your boyfriend. Or, uh ... he 
                        wants to be.

           The Pilot rolls his eyes: smooth, kid. JR sizes up The Pilot  
           -- a monosyllabic judgment --
                                 JR
                        Ew.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           LATER. JR sits alone on a park bench, reading the note. Adam 
           and The Pilot keep their distance.

                                 ADAM
                        Do you think she's gonna buy it?

                                 THE PILOT
                        I don't know. You never know what 
                        she's gonna do. That's part of her 
                        charm.

                                 ADAM
                        I don't think she likes me.

                                 THE PILOT
                        She will. And when she does, you'll 
                        know what it feels like to achieve 
                        something important.

           Adam has no idea what that means. JR is returning with the 
           note; she offers it back to The Pilot. He studies her for a 
           reaction.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Did you read it?

                                 JR
                             (nods)
                        You should be a science fiction 
                        writer. I'm not kidding, no one's 
                        ever written anything that cool for 
                        me. But you didn't think I'd 
                        actually believe it, did you?

                                 THE PILOT
                        You have to. If you don't, you're 
                        gonna die.

                                 JR
                        Yeah, I got that part. Charming.
                             (she glances to Adam)
                        Who are you supposed to be? His co-
                        pilot?

                                 ADAM
                        No. I'm him. Like, now. Today.

           JR scrutinizes the pair, noticing something. She steps close, 
           staring into Adam's eyes. He shifts, uncomfortable.
                                 ADAM
                        What?

                                 JR
                        Nothing. It's just strange. You 
                        both have an anomaly in your right 
                        eye. Specks of green ... a birth 
                        defect. Rare. Kind of pretty.
                             (then)
                        I still don't believe you.

           She turns to leave --

                                 THE PILOT
                        JR, wait --

                                 JR
                        Don't follow me, freak.

           The Pilot watches JR go. He calls out, desperate --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Your mom started calling you JR 
                        when you were five, cause she 
                        thought Jimmy sounded too much like 
                        a boy's name.

                                 JR
                        Nice try. Everyone knows that.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You have a recurring dream that 
                        you're being chased by your 
                        neighbor's dog. In your underwear.

           JR stops in her tracks. Turns to The Pilot. He continues -- 
           remembering every little detail about the woman he loved --

                                 THE PILOT
                        You were scared of spiders when you 
                        were little, so you convinced your 
                        Mom to buy you a pet tarantula, and 
                        now you're not scared anymore. In 
                        school, you sometimes get questions 
                        wrong on purpose cause you don't 
                        want to skip another grade. You try 
                        not to raise your hand in class, 
                        but sometimes you can't help but 
                        show everyone how smart you really 
                        are. You tell people you want to be 
                        a doctor when you grow up ... but 
                        you really want to fly.

           JR looks at The Pilot -- and in this moment -- she believes. 
           From above, a SONIC BOOM. A STAR CAPSULE DESCENDS FROM THE 
           HEAVENS, LANDING LESS THAN A HUNDRED FEET AWAY.

           Adam, JR and The Pilot stare in dumbstruck silence as the 
           capsule HISSES OPEN, right in the middle of the park.

           JR STEPS OUT -- the woman from the photograph come to life! 
           She's 43 years old, and stunning in her silver flightsuit.

           As if on cue, the WIND picks up and SNATCHES the photograph 
           from The Pilot's hands. It flutters away, never to be seen 
           again, but The Pilot doesn't seem to notice or care. He just 
           steps forward, like a switch has been flipped and he finally 
           knows what he has to do. 

           The Pilot SCOOPS JR into his arms, and KISSES HER long and 
           well. For a moment, JR goes with it ... then REARS BACK and --

           SLAP!!! -- she delivers a blow so fierce, it nearly spins The 
           Pilot around full-circle. Only now do we see the ANGER in 
           JR's eyes.

                                 JR
                        You son of a bitch. Do you have any 
                        idea what you put me through!?

           JR displays the NOTE, now visibly aged. She wags it in The 
           Pilot's face --

                                 JR
                        Thirty years! For thirty years, I 
                        carried this stupid note! I was --
                             (points to Young JR)
                        -- she! She was going to have a 
                        life of her own! And you took that 
                        from me! From her, from us!

           A beat, as temperatures cool. The boiling anger fades from 
           JR's eyes, but she remains stiff, arms crossed. She remembers 
           her manners and nods to Young Adam --

                                 JR
                        Hello, Adam.

           Mouth agape, all Adam can think to do is wave. JR notices her 
           younger self, staring blankly forward, practically catatonic.

                                 JR
                        Am I all right?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Probably not.
           INT. JR'S HOUSE - DAY

           Young JR sits on a couch, wearing the exact same expression. 
           Utter shock. BEHIND HER, JR takes in her childhood home --

                                 JR
                        Incredible. Everything's just the 
                        way I remember it.
                             (re: her caged tarantula)
                        Hey, Terry!

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, I'm sure it's all 
                        fascinating, but can someone please 
                        explain to me what the hell just 
                        happened!?

                                 JR
                        Not much to explain. I got your 
                        note. And everything happened just 
                        the way you said. When the time 
                        came, I commandeered one of 
                        Zucker's ships and came back here -- 
                        to the coordinates you left for me.

                                 ADAM
                        Okay, so ... does that mean it's 
                        over? Did we win?

                                 JR
                        Not quite. Tommy's still coming 
                        after us, and Zucker's mission is 
                        still a go.

           That last part caught The Pilot's attention --

                                 THE PILOT
                        What mission?

           MOMENTS LATER, a BLUEPRINT is unrolled across a table -- a 
           schematic of a STAR CAPSULE, like the others we've seen, but 
           the measurements indicate a ship of MUCH LARGER SCALE.

                                 JR
                        I found this in Zucker's vault.

                                 ADAM
                        What is it?

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's a star capsule, but ...
                             (studying the schematic)
                        ... is this even possible?
                                 JR
                        As far as I can tell, it operates 
                        by the same principles as the first 
                        generation model. Except it's a lot 
                        faster.

                                 ADAM
                        What does that mean?

                                 JR
                        It means this ship can take Zucker 
                        back in time as far as he wants to 
                        go -- into the ancient past. And 
                        that's not all. For months, he's 
                        been stocking up on men, supplies, 
                        weapons. 
                             (nods, sure of it)
                        He's building an army.

           This sinks in.

                                 THE PILOT
                        He doesn't just want to change the 
                        past. He wants to conquer it.
                             (beat)
                        When do they launch?

           Surprisingly, JR smiles.

                                 JR
                        They might have a little problem 
                        there.

           INT. JR'S HOUSE - DAY

           A HEAVY CASE is set down. JR throws it open. A HEAVENLY BLUE 
           LIGHT emanates from within. Adam peers inside to find a GIANT 
           ORB OF CELIUM, filling the entire crate.

                                 ADAM
                        Whoa!
                             (he tries to lift it, but 
                              can't)
                        You got the mother lode!

                                 JR
                        Zucker's gonna need all of it to 
                        power his machine. Without this, 
                        he's stuck.

                                 THE PILOT
                        For now. He can always harvest 
                        more.
                                 JR
                        The enrichment process takes time --

                                 THE PILOT
                        -- not enough. You've slowed him 
                        down, but we don't have a second to 
                        lose. 
                             (off JR's look)
                        Our mission hasn't changed. Make 
                        sure your ship's ready to fly. 
                        We're outta here in five minutes.

                                 JR
                        I'm gonna need at least an hour to--

                                 THE PILOT
                        -- five minutes. That's an order, 
                        Lieutenant.

           The Pilot turns away. A look of hurt disappointment crosses 
           JR's face. She closes the case with a SLAM.

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

           Adam pursues The Pilot out of the house as The Pilot lugs the 
           crate of celium into the yard.

                                 ADAM
                        What are you doing?

                                 THE PILOT
                        What's it look like? You wanna give 
                        me a hand?

                                 ADAM
                             (ignoring that)
                        You brought that girl back from the 
                        dead. You said she was the girl of 
                        our dreams, and you're acting like 
                        you're not even happy to see her!

                                 THE PILOT
                        You wouldn't understand.

                                 ADAM
                        I really wish you'd stop saying 
                        that.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You never had to lose her.

           JR's capsule UNCLOAKS, right in the middle of the lawn. Adam 
           follows The Pilot inside.
                                 ADAM
                        I don't believe it. You're a ... 
                        you're just a ... you're a little 
                        chicken-shit!

           The Pilot sets the crate down with a HEAVY THUD.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I don't think you're one to talk. 
                        In fact, I know you're not.

                                 ADAM
                        Yeah, but guess what? I'm twelve! 
                        I'm allowed to be chicken-shit, but 
                        you ... you're supposed to be 
                        better than this!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Better? Kid. I'm an astronaut. I've 
                        broken the speed of light, I hosted 
                        a kickball tournament on the moon, 
                        I've been to Saturn! Saturn!! What 
                        more do you want from me?

                                 ADAM
                        I want you to grow a pair, and tell 
                        her -- !

                                 JR
                        -- tell me what?

           JR has appeared outside the capsule. The Pilot seems like 
           he's about to talk, when Young JR calls out from the doorway--

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Uh, guys? I think you might want to 
                        come see this!

           INT. JR'S HOUSE - DAY

           Adam, The Pilot and JR gather around the TV, broadcasting a 
           LOCAL NEWS REPORT. ON SCREEN, cell-phone footage of people 
           gathering on a street, staring up at a FLAMING STREAK in the 
           sky. Amateur footage of The Captain's arrival.

                                 REPORTER
                        -- strikingly similar to the 
                        disturbance witnessed yesterday in 
                        Iowa, though the government 
                        continues to deny aircraft testing 
                        in the area.

           The Pilot glances to Adam.
                                 THE PILOT
                        Want to go for a ride?

           EXT. JR'S HOUSE - DAY

           Adam, JR and The Pilot come running out of the house, now 
           dressed in MATCHING FLIGHTSUITS.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Hey! What about me?

           JR goes back to her younger self.

                                 THE PILOT
                        No time for goodbyes!

           JR whispers something in Young JR's ear. Young JR reacts with 
           a disbelieving look. Then, relenting, she shrugs.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        ... I'll try.

                                 JR
                        That's my girl.

           JR continues for the capsule. Adam comes alongside.

                                 ADAM
                        What'd you tell her?

                                 JR
                        I told her not to be so hard on 
                        you.

                                 ADAM
                        Oh ... Thanks!

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - COCKPIT - DAY

           Our trio straps themselves in as the capsule HUMS to life. JR 
           enters coordinates, charting their course via an interactive 
           map of the Solar System.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Marie Gordon died on July 2, 2000, 
                        in London, England, at the corner 
                        of Oxford and Regent. We have to 
                        get back at least before then.

                                 JR
                             (looking out the window)
                        One problem.

           JR indicates a FLAMING STREAK in the sky.
                                 THE PILOT
                        Tommy.

           INT. THE CAPTAIN'S CAPSULE - DAY

           The viewscreen ZOOMS IN and FREEZES a STILL-FRAME of The 
           Pilot's passenger -- blurry, but unmistakably JR. Glances are 
           exchanged among the crew.

                                 DASH
                        I don't get it. If Adam killed JR, 
                        why would he bring her back?

                                 JASPER
                        He obviously just needed her ship. 
                        Right, Captain?

           A hint of doubt in The Captain's eyes. He blinks it away.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Hit 'em with the EMP.

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - DAY

           SCREAMING ALARMS --

                                 THE PILOT
                        They've got weapons lock! He's 
                        gonna cripple our flight systems 
                        with one shot!

                                 ADAM
                        Take off, take off!

                                 THE PILOT
                        Can't, the grid's still firing up!

           Adam DUCKS and COVERS.

           EXT. SKY - DAY

           The Captain's capsule FIRES. A PULSE descends over JR's 
           capsule. 

           BOOOOOMMMMM!!! DUST SETTLES to REVEAL -- the capsule remains 
           untouched. Gleaming like new.

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - DAY

                                 JR
                        Shields are damaged ... thirty 
                        percent capacity.

           Adam and The Pilot peek out from cover.
                                 ADAM
                        This thing's got shields!?

                                 JR
                        I read your note. Decided to make 
                        some upgrades.

                                 THE PILOT
                             (he has to admit it)
                        You're awesome.

                                 JR
                        I know. Grid's up.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Rock and roll.

           EXT. JR'S HOUSE - DAY

           JR's capsule EXPLODES into space and The Captain pursues -- 
           TWO MATCHING STREAKS in the clear blue sky. JR watches from 
           her window, eyes fixed into the heavens. She's hooked.

                                 YOUNG JR
                        Wow.

           EXT. SPACE/INT. JR'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           Finally: a lightspeed chase across the cosmos. The Pilot 
           drives, textbook evasive maneuvers.

                                 JR
                        He's on our tail! Can you shake 
                        him?

                                 THE PILOT 
                        Always wanted to find out.

           The Pilot BANKS HARD, accelerating towards an ASTEROID FIELD. 
           JR sees what he's doing and SHOUTS back to Adam --

                                 JR
                        Seat belts!

           INT. THE CAPTAIN'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           The Captain locks onto JR's ship. MILLIONS of CHUNKS of 
           INTERGALACTIC ICE and ROCK, from BUICKS to BASKETBALLS, go 
           SOARING PAST.

                                 LAURA
                        Captain, fall back! You're gonna 
                        get us all killed!
           But The Captain remains focused, unwavering.

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           The Pilot clears the larger rocks, but SMALLER DEBRIS PELTS 
           THE SHIP. CRACKS snake across the viewscreen. 

           The Pilot's device VIBRATES -- The Captain's voice ECHOES --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Adam, think about what you're 
                        doing. If you go back any further, 
                        I can't protect you.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Is that what you've been doing so 
                        far? Protecting me?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I convinced Zucker to let me bring 
                        you in alive, but if you do this, 
                        all bets are off. No telling what 
                        the old man might do.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I understand the risks.

                                 JR
                        INCOMING!!

           AHEAD, a COLOSSAL ASTEROID, the size of a skyscraper hurdles 
           towards them. The Pilot targets a MINISCULE OPENING and 
           BLASTS THROUGH, threading the needle. A moment passes ... 
           then The Captain emerges, also clearing the belt. 

           The viewscreen now shows a CLEAR VIEW of OPEN SPACE.

                                 JR
                        Now's our chance. If we're gonna 
                        breach, it has to be now.

           The Pilot's finger hovers over a BIG RED BUTTON. The 
           Captain's voice rings in his ears.

                                 THE CAPTAIN (O.C.)
                        It doesn't have to be like this. 
                        Just circle back, we can talk this 
                        through. Please, Adam ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        Sorry, Cap. I've made my choice. 
                        You make yours.

           ADAM PRESSES THE BUTTON -- 
           The ship GAINS SPEED, throwing Adam violently back against 
           his seat. A COUNTDOWN appears -- 

           TIME TO BREACH. :59, :58, :57 ...

           INT. THE CAPTAIN'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

                                 DASH
                        They're gonna breach!

           The Captain knows what he has to do ... and it kills him.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Sight target. Prepare to fire.

                                 LAURA
                        Captain, if we fire at this speed, 
                        we could rupture their fuel cells. 
                        We could kill them!

                                 JASPER
                        Torpedoes are locked! I don't know 
                        how much longer I can hold them ...

           A moment's decision ... The Captain nods --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Fire.

           EXT. SPACE/INT. JR'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           A torpedo LAUNCHES, FRACTURING OFF into a MULTI-HIT 
           PROJECTILE.

                                 JR
                        Weapons away!

           The Pilot VEERS across space -- a deadly game of cat and 
           mouse with the fractured torpedo. JR climbs in back with 
           Adam, helping him situate his mask.

                                 JR
                        Okay, focus. You're about to get a 
                        crash course in faster-than-light 
                        astronautics. Speed is all about 
                        reducing friction. The ship will do 
                        its job, but you have to do yours. 
                        Clear your mind of everything, all 
                        thoughts and memories, even the 
                        sound of my voice. Can you do that?

           Adam nods, but his eyes are full of fear. 
           The projectiles FLANK the ship, coming in for the kill, just 
           as the countdown reaches ZERO.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Drive's online! Everybody ready?

                                                           JR
                           ADAM
           Ready for what!?
                                              Punch it!

           The Pilot PUSHES A LEVER --

           The space ahead seems to CONTORT as the projectiles close in 
           from all directions. They COLLIDE with a MASSIVE ZERO-GRAVITY 
           EXPLOSION.

           INT. THE CAPTAIN'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           The Captain watches as the vacuum of space absorbs the blast 
           to REVEAL -- 

           The ship is gone. He PUNCHES his console. Damn!

           EXT. WORMHOLE/INT. JR'S CAPSULE - NIGHT

           BREACHING THE LUMINAL BARRIER. We shift into ADAM'S POV, 
           experiencing the teeth-rattling rush of lightspeed for the 
           first time. He glances out the window as the starfield 
           COLLAPSES into a SINGLE POINT OF LIGHT; the light EXPANDS 
           into a TUNNEL, which ENVELOPS the ship as we TRANSITION TO --

           A BRILLIANT FLASH OF IMAGES --

           FLASH: Tommy hits a LINE DRIVE HOMERUN as CROWDS CHEER and 
           Adam watches from the sidelines.

           FLASH: Adam pulls away from Tommy at the window --

                                 ADAM
                        I'm not scared!

           FLASH: Adam shakes hands with an UNSEEN MAN --

                                 TOMMY
                        Adam, this is Arnand Zucker. He has 
                        a proposition he'd like to discuss 
                        with you ...

           FLASH: JR's smiling face.

                                 JR
                        Hi, I'm Jimmy Ryan. My friends call 
                        me JR. You must be Adam ...
           FLASH: All of the astronauts pose in their flightsuits -- 
           Adam, Tommy, JR, Jasper, Laura and Dash -- one happy family. 
           A picture is taken (the picture). With a FLASH --

           Adam's eyes SNAP OPEN, coming out of his trance to the SOUND 
           of SCREAMING ALARMS --

                                 JR
                        Dammit! We're out of warp! 

                                 THE PILOT
                        A projectile must've connected 
                        before we breached. How far back 
                        did we get?

                                 JR
                        One way to find out.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Sling-shot?

                                 JR
                        Sling-shot.

                                 YOUNG ADAM
                        What's sling-shIIIIIIIIIIIT!!!!

           THE PILOT SLING-SHOTS THE CAPSULE AROUND THE MOON --

           The sudden speed causes Adam to RETCH in his mask. He 
           apologizes to JR with his eyes.

           The Pilot completes the sling-shot maneuver, ROCKETING back 
           towards Earth. Gravity takes hold and the capsule enters the 
           atmosphere. It instantly catches FIRE. Layers of the exterior 
           shell BURN UP and PEEL OFF, disintegrating immediately.

           A LAND MASS appears through the clouds. EUROPE.

           EXT. LONDON - RIVER THAMES - DAY

           Tourists fill the Parliament grounds, posing in front of the 
           Big Ben, snapping photos from Westminster Bridge. In the 
           distance, the London Eye is gleaming and freshly-built.

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - DAY

           Adam's SCREAMS are overwhelmed by the DEAFENING NOISE of the 
           crashing ship. The Pilot decelerates, but the ground is 
           coming up fast. It's gonna be close ...
           EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

           BAM! The capsule SMASHES into the Thames, SKIPPING LIKE A 
           ROCK.

           A PAIR OF SAILBOATS ahead. Adam BANKS HARD, skirting between 
           the watercraft as the occupants dive over the side.

           ON THE BRIDGE, tourists see the ship coming. They RUN 
           SCREAMING, abandoning their belongings. It looks like the 
           capsule is on a collision course --

           -- before it LOSES ALTITUDE at the last moment, passing UNDER 
           THE ARCHES, displacing HUGE AMOUNTS OF WATER, which SOAKS the 
           pedestrians above.

           The capsule skids to a graceless stop across the river 
           surface. It bobs a moment. Then SINKS.

           INT. JR'S CAPSULE - DAY

           Descending rapidly through the river depths. JR starts to 
           unlatch the celium crate.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Leave it! There's no time! Don't 
                        worry, it'll survive the blast!

                                 ADAM
                        Blast ... what blast!?

           The Pilot finishes keying in a sequence. He moves for an 
           EMERGENCY HATCH.

                                 THE PILOT
                        On my count, take a deep breath! 
                        Make for the surface! They're gonna 
                        try to arrest us, so swim opposite 
                        directions! Lead them off!
                             (a sudden thought; he 
                              looks to Adam)
                        Are you sure you can do this?

           Adam manages a weak thumbs up.

                                 ADAM
                        Easy peasy.

           The Pilot smiles, finding comfort in Adam's humor. He grips 
           the hatch --

                                 THE PILOT
                        One! Two! THREE!
           Everyone takes a DEEP BREATH and The Pilot OPENS THE HATCH --

           Water SLAMS into the cockpit, SUBMERGING our group. They swim 
           off DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS as the capsule SINKS into oblivion.

           EXT. RIVER THAMES - DAY

           Adam pulls himself out of the river. IN THE DISTANCE, he sees 
           The Pilot and JR, already surrounded by police.

           MOMENTS LATER, Adam pushes through the crowd. The Pilot and 
           JR are under arrest, handcuffs SNAPPED on as The Pilot pleads 
           with the squad leader --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Listen, I know how this is gonna 
                        sound, but what day is it? What 
                        year?

                                 JR
                        Adam ...

           JR is focused on a newsstand. Every paper features the 
           current date: JULY 2, 2000. 

           A look of SHEER PANIC crosses The Pilot's face. He LUNGES 
           against his restraints, pulling free from the constable. He 
           reaches for his Athens device --

           -- but it's knocked from his hands, skidding across the 
           ground, stopping at Adam's feet. Adam picks it up.

           The Pilot is overpowered, SLAMMED onto a car hood. His head 
           is held down, forcing his gaze to Adam. He SHOUTS --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Adam! It's up to you! You have to 
                        save her!
                             (Adam doesn't understand)
                        Marie! She's gonna die, Adam! 
                        Today!

           COPS start coming towards Adam when they see him holding the 
           fallen device.

                                 THE PILOT
                        GO!!

           Adam comes to his senses and RUNS, slipping off into the 
           crowd, using his lack of size as an advantage to evade 
           police. Mid-run, he activates the device --

           A newspaper article fills the screen: NOBEL LAUREATE KILLED 
           IN FATAL CRASH. FOCUS on the time of the accident: 2:45 PM.
           Adam has a clear view of the Big Ben: just past 2:30. He 
           inwardly groans -- figures -- then HAULS ASS. Behind him --

           SPLA-WHOOOOSSSHHHHHH! The capsule DETONATES, sending a GEYSER 
           SHOOTING STRAIGHT UP, right in the middle of the Thames.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

           DR. MARIE GORDON, 50's, is at the podium, addressing a 
           sparsely-crowded auditorium. As she speaks, we PAN THROUGH 
           the crowd -- a sea of drooping eyelids and disbelieving 
           smirks. This woman obviously isn't taken seriously.

                                 MARIE
                        ... as we know, an object gains 
                        mass as it gains speed, which 
                        requires energy, so as an object 
                        approaches the speed of light, its 
                        mass becomes infinite -- thereby 
                        requiring an equal amount of energy 
                        to break the luminal barrier. In 
                        short, to go beyond infinity. But 
                        what if infinity is closer than we 
                        think? What if we could break the 
                        luminal barrier without even 
                        breaking the speed limit on the M4, 
                        through the manipulation and 
                        deformation of spacetime itself?

           Muffled laughter from a distant corner of the auditorium. 
           Marie shrugs -- the possibilities alive only in her 
           imagination.

                                 MARIE
                        What if?

           EXT. LONDON STREET CORNER - DAY

           Adam runs to catch a DOUBLE DECKER BUS, already pulling away. 
           He barely makes it -- breathlessly addresses the DRIVER --

                                 ADAM
                        Wait! Please, I need to get to the 
                        corner of Oxford and Regent.

                                 DRIVER
                        Oxford and Regent? What does this 
                        look like to you, son? It's a 
                        bloody tour bus!

           Adam notices -- the bus is FILLED WITH TOURISTS. A moment's 
           decision. Adam aims his blaster at the driver.
                                 ADAM
                        Not anymore.

                                 DRIVER
                        What's that? Video game?

           Adam shuts his eyes and emits a SHOCKWAVE that SHATTERS EVERY 
           WINDOW on the bus. PASSENGERS SCREAM, evacuating the bus in 
           droves.

                                 ADAM
                        No, wait! Where are you going!? I 
                        can't drive this thing myself!

           Quickly, Adam is alone -- except for ONE KID, smiling from a 
           nearby seat, up for a little adventure. Adam glances to the 
           now-vacated wheel. What choice does he have?

           INT. DOUBLE DECKER BUS - DAY

           Adam drives, barreling through downtown traffic, trying to 
           look at a map and keep his eyes on the road at the same time.

                                 ADAM
                        Oxford and Regent, Oxford and 
                        Regent ... why's everyone driving 
                        on the wrong side of the road!?

           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           The Pilot and JR are seated in back, a SINGLE OFFICER up 
           front. His radio CRACKLES --

                                 DISPATCH
                        All units be on the lookout, we 
                        have a disturbance in progress, 
                        west of Regent Park.

                                 OFFICER
                        Go ahead.

                                 DISPATCH
                        Looks like some kid's taken a tour 
                        bus on a bit of a joyride. 
                        American, most likely.

           The Pilot and JR share a look. Uh-oh. SIRENS WAIL as the 
           officer REVERSES DIRECTION --

           INT. DOUBLE DECKER BUS - DAY

           Adam SWERVES to avoid a collision. Ahead, traffic is STALLED.

           Adam can't reach the brakes, so he VEERS onto the sidewalk.
                                 ADAM
                        Kid! Help with the brakes!

           The Little Kid answers the call of duty, manning the pedals.

                                 LITTLE KID
                        I just want you to know, you're the 
                        coolest kid I've ever met in my 
                        entire life.

                                 ADAM
                        ... okay. You push, I'll steer!

           The kid palms the gas.

           INT. MARIE'S CAR - DAY

           Marie drives at a leisurely pace, sipping coffee. The clock 
           on the dash reads 2:42. Her cellphone RINGS. She answers.

                                 MARIE
                        Hello? Arnie! I was just on my way 
                        to see you. How'd it go today?

           A beat. Marie's face drops. Clearly, whatever she's hearing, 
           it's big news.

                                 MARIE
                        You're joking ... you're joking! 
                        And it's stable? At that 
                        temperature? 
                             (not a chance)
                        The measurements must be off. Run 
                        it again.

           INT. DOUBLE DECKER BUS - DAY

           Adam takes a HARD LEFT and the double decker bus TILTS UP ON 
           ONE END, barely making the turn.

                                 ADAM
                        What's the shortest way to Oxford 
                        Circus!?

                                 KID
                        Through the park!

           Off Adam's reaction -- why not? --

           EXT. REGENT PARK - DAY

           The bus tears through the park, scattering joggers, upending 
           picnic tables. Total pandemonium.
           INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

           The officer coasts along a quiet street.

                                 OFFICER
                        Liz, I'm heading east on Regent. I 
                        don't see any tour bus ...

                                 DISPATCH
                        It should be there ...

           The Pilot turns towards the park. Eyes go wide --

                                 THE PILOT
                        BRACE!!

           THE BUS COMES OUT OF NOWHERE, clipping the front of the 
           patrol car, sending it SPINNING OUT across lanes of traffic. 
           We can faintly hear Adam SHOUTING back as the bus VEERS OFF 
           towards Oxford Circus --

                                 ADAM (O.C.)
                        Sorryyy ... !

           The cruiser is badly-damaged but operational, the officer 
           unconscious behind the wheel. The Pilot and JR climb out in 
           time to see the bus careen around a bend. A shared glance ...

                                 JR
                        I'm driving.

           MOMENTS LATER, the patrol car SCREECHES off in pursuit of the 
           bus, leaving the officer splayed out across a park bench.

           INT. MARIE'S CAR - DAY

           The clock on the dash reads 2:44. One minute to go. Marie is 
           still on the phone with "Arnie" --

                                 MARIE
                        Well, I'm not saying you can't have 
                        a party, let's just not get ahead 
                        of ourselves. We should at least 
                        verify the --

           She hits a bump and spills coffee on her blouse.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh ... shoot, just a second.
                             (fumbling for a napkin)
                        Three PhD's and I can't even have a 
                        cup of coffee without making a mess 
                        of myself ...
           INT. DOUBLE DECKER BUS - DAY

           The bus SLAMS through a barricade, riding the shoulder. Adam 
           checks the time. Exactly 2:45.

                                 ADAM
                        Gas, hit the gas, don't stop, don't 
                        stop!!

           The kid SLAMS THE GAS, flooring it.

           EXT. OXFORD AND REGENT - DAY

           Marie's car comes to a stop at a busy intersection. WIDEN to 
           REVEAL the road signs -- OXFORD and REGENT. 

           The light turns green. Marie idles into the intersection, 
           failing to notice an SUV, racing through the opposing red 
           light at 70 mph, barreling down on her, too fast to stop.

           Suddenly --

           CRASH!! The double decker bus comes out of nowhere, blocking 
           the SUV and absorbing the collision in the nick of time.

           The crash SLAMS the bus sideways into Marie's car, SMASHING 
           it against a concrete partition. 

           Then, silence. No way of knowing who survived. 

           PUSH IN on the smoking husk of the bus. The doors OPEN --

           Adam staggers out. He finds Marie's car, pancaked between 
           steel and concrete. He climbs onto the sunroof. Starts 
           POUNDING on the glass.

                                 ADAM
                        Hello? Dr. Gordon!?

           No response. Adam finds a loose chunk of debris and SMASHES 
           in the sunroof. He drops into the car -- 

           INSIDE THE CAR, Marie is slumped against the wheel. From 
           somewhere, we hear the DISEMBODIED VOICE of the man she was 
           talking to --

                                 VOICE
                        Marie, are you there? Marie? Can 
                        you hear me?

           Adam finds and hangs up the phone. He focuses on Marie. It's 
           hard to even tell if she's even breathing ... until her eyes 
           BLINK OPEN and settle on Adam.
                                 MARIE
                        Hello.

           Adam smiles, overcome with relief.

                                 ADAM
                        Hi.

                                 MARIE
                        I don't mean to be rude, but who 
                        are you?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm, uh ... 
                             (settling on the truth)
                        ... an astronaut from the future.

           Marie takes that in. Nods, delirious.

                                 MARIE
                        All right.

           She passes out. Adam collapses in the passenger seat beside 
           her. Exhausted.

           EXT. OXFORD AND REGENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Pilot and JR pull up in the busted patrol car. Adam and 
           the Little Kid are hauling Marie from the wreck between them.

                                 ADAM
                        I did it! I saved her!

           The Pilot takes in the MASSIVE PILE-UP.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Yeah ... good job ...

           SIRENS approach. The Pilot and JR hurry to help as we CUT TO--

           NEW ANGLE -- The Captain spies on the scene from a distant 
           rooftop. He turns to the other astronauts ... all waiting for 
           a decision. He nods.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Call it in.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. PICADILLY RESTAURANT - DAY

           Adam and The Pilot wolf down food with bizarrely synchronous 
           gestures, mirroring one another's idiosyncracies. Across the 
           table, Marie can only stare.
                        THE PILOT
                                                          ADAM
           What?
                                              What?

           Marie shakes that off, starts gathering up her things.

                                 MARIE
                        Listen, I appreciate everything 
                        you've done, but what you're asking 
                        me to believe -- that you knew the 
                        accident was going to happen? Come 
                        on ...

           The Pilot slides his Athens device across the table -- still 
           chronicling the gory details of Marie's death.

           Marie's face drops as she studies the article. She shakes her 
           head. Refusing to believe it.

                                 MARIE
                        ... this doesn't prove anything.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What do you think? We forged that? 
                        Then what, staged the accident 
                        ourselves?

                                 MARIE
                        Is that any harder to believe than 
                        time-traveling astronauts on a 
                        mission to ... to do what exactly?

                                 THE PILOT
                        To warn you. 
                             (he leans in)
                        You need to shut it down. Your lab, 
                        your research. All of it.

                                 MARIE
                        Why would I do that?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Because one day -- one day soon -- 
                        you're going to unlock the secret 
                        to time travel and effectively hand 
                        control of the universe over to one 
                        man. Arnand Zucker.

           A tense beat -- then Marie LAUGHS.

                                 MARIE
                        ... Arnie? Please. He put you up to 
                        this, didn't he.

           Marie stands to leave. The Pilot grabs her hand.
                                 THE PILOT
                        You're harnessing celium. In your 
                        lab, as we speak. That's how it all 
                        starts.

                                 MARIE
                        Let go of my hand.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's silicon-based, highly 
                        unstable, until you try testing it 
                        at extreme temperatures, at which 
                        point it not only stabilizes, but 
                        yields an unlimited output, 
                        essentially creating energy from 
                        nothing. Tell me I'm wrong.

                                 MARIE
                        I don't even know what celium is. 
                        Frankly, it sounds made up.

           This Pilot blinks. He wasn't prepared for that. He lets go of 
           Marie's hand.

                                 MARIE
                        ... it's a good story, though. Race 
                        against time, save the world and 
                        all that. Very exciting. And the 
                        outfits. I love the outfits.

           With that, Marie is gone, leaving our trio behind, in their 
           matching shiny flightsuits.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Marie exits the restaurant. As soon as she's clear, we notice 
           that her hands are SHAKING. She strides quickly off.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

           A star capsule comes in for a landing before The Captain, 
           standing alone in an open field. The ramp descends and Jasper 
           emerges, followed shortly behind by Laura and Dash. They have 
           to SHOUT over the ROAR of the machine --

                                 JASPER
                        It's not good! The old man says 
                        you've lost control! He wants Adam 
                        neutralized!

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Neutralized ... ?
           The Captain notices the KILL TEAM emerging from smoke behind 
           Jasper, filing down the ramp. Trained soldiers, armed to the 
           teeth, faces obscured by high-tech faceplates.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... you're gonna kill him!?

           Jasper shrugs: what'd you expect? The Captain looks to Laura 
           and Dash to confirm, but they can't meet his gaze.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I can't let you do that.

                                 JASPER
                        I thought you might feel that way.

           Jasper nods to the soldiers. They APPREHEND The Captain, 
           grabbing him by either arm.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        What the -- what are you doing!?

                                 JASPER
                        What you should've already done. 
                        Sir.

           Restraints are clamped on. Jasper steps close.

                                 JASPER
                        Not to worry, Cap. Your title will 
                        be reinstated as soon as Adam's 
                        handled. The old man wanted me to 
                        be clear about that. In the 
                        meantime ...

           Jasper gives a signal and the kill team moves out in perfect 
           formation, to a series of waiting transports. The Captain is 
           helpless to do anything but watch. This is gonna get ugly ...

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. RENT-A-CAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The Pilot and Adam sit alone in a (presumably) stolen car, 
           staking out the lot of a rental agency.

                                 ADAM
                        What do we do now?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Follow the good doctor until she 
                        leads us to something we can use 
                        against the program.
           Adam nods, staring vacantly out the window. The Pilot notices 
           his distant expression.

                                 THE PILOT
                        What's wrong?

                                 ADAM
                        Nothing ...
                             (then)
                        When we were coming in, back on the 
                        ship, I thought I ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... saw something?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Like a memory?

                                 ADAM
                        Yes! Except, it was strange. Like a 
                        memory that never happened.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It did happen, it just hasn't 
                        happened yet. We call them 
                        flashbulb premonitions. We've all 
                        had them. Try not to worry about 
                        it.

           The Pilot can see Adam isn't satisfied. He leans in --

                                 THE PILOT
                        Listen. I know you've got 
                        questions. I would, too. But if I 
                        told you everything you wanted to 
                        know, you could wind up on a 
                        completely different course.

                                 ADAM
                        Different from what? From you? 
                             (beat)
                        What if I don't want to be you?

           The question stings. JR returns to the car, cutting off the 
           conversation.

                                 JR
                        She's on the move. Purple Neon, 
                        heading north on Barton.

           The Pilot keys the ignition.
           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Tailing a DODGE NEON into a residential neighborhood. AHEAD, 
           a HOUSE PARTY is in full swing.

           BLASTING MUSIC can be heard all the way down the street. 
           Nearly a hundred people are crammed into the house, many 
           spilling onto the lawn, where a table tennis tournament looks 
           to be entering its third hour.

                                 JR
                        This can't be where she's going.

           But sure enough, Marie leaves her car and heads straight into 
           the party. Adam takes in the crowd.

                                 ADAM
                        These are the people who take over 
                        the world?

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's always the nerds. Wait here.

           The Pilot gets out. Adam and JR share a glance once he's gone 
           ... roll their eyes, follow after him.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           The place is packed. Marie moves through the ocean of bodies 
           until she finds who she's looking for -- a YOUNG MAN with his 
           back turned, staring forward at something with great 
           interest. She SHOUTS over the music --

                                 MARIE
                        Arnie! I need to talk to you!

           ARNAND ZUCKER hardly seems old enough to be out of college, 
           let alone the master of the universe we know him to be.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Not now, Marie. I have to 
                        concentrate.

                                 MARIE
                        It's important!

                                 ZUCKER
                        So is this.

           Zucker holds up a PING PONG BALL. With the focus of a heart 
           surgeon, he BOUNCES it across the table, into a red plastic 
           cup. Crowds ERUPT in CELEBRATION. The vanquished player 
           groans -- lifts his cup in salute --
                                 ZUCKER
                        Drink it! And leave the ball in 
                        this time! Boss's orders!

           Finally, Zucker turns to Marie. His smile fades when he sees 
           her -- still banged up from the accident.

                                 ZUCKER
                        My God, what happened to you?

                                 MARIE
                        What? Oh -- this, nothing. I was in 
                        a car accident.

                                 ZUCKER
                        You were in a car accident, and 
                        that's not what you want to talk to 
                        me about?

           Off Marie's reaction: where to begin?

           ACROSS THE PARTY, The Pilot enters, drawing a bit of 
           attention to himself. He spots Zucker and Marie across the 
           room. Starts making his way over.

           BACK TO ZUCKER AND MARIE -- mid-story --

                                 MARIE
                        ... but you should have seen them, 
                        Arnie, they were genuinely serious. 
                        They actually believed --

                                 ZUCKER
                        -- what? That they were from the 
                        future? Come on Marie, it's obvious 
                        someone was having a go at you. The 
                        important thing is, you're safe. 
                        And you're at a party! Try to 
                        lighten up a bit.

           Zucker hands Marie a drink.

                                 MARIE
                        I don't want this.

                                 ZUCKER
                        You will. When I tell you why we're 
                        celebrating.

           Marie looks Zucker in the eye ... and for a moment, all 
           worries of time-traveling astronauts are forgotten.

                                 MARIE
                        You verified the results?
                                 ZUCKER
                        I'm telling you, M, this stuff is 
                        miraculous. I can feel it, this is 
                        everything we've waited for, 
                        everything we've worked for. I've 
                        already put in a bid to double our 
                        lab's supply.

           Over Zucker's shoulder, Marie spots THE PILOT, coming towards 
           her through throngs of partygoers.

                                 MARIE
                        Arnie --

                                 ZUCKER
                             (talking over her)
                        -- and we even have a name for it 
                        now, too! Jared thought it up on 
                        the way over. And here I thought he 
                        was completely useless --

                                 MARIE
                        -- Arnie, that's him, that's --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Celium.

           Marie FREEZES at the word.

                                 MARIE
                        ... what?

                                 ZUCKER
                        Celium! That's what we're calling 
                        it! Has a ring, don't you think?

           Marie meets eyes with The Pilot across the room. She pushes 
           past Zucker.

                                 MARIE
                        Excuse me.

           Zucker watches after Marie as she intercepts The Pilot and 
           discreetly pulls him out the back door. His eyes narrow, 
           suspicious ... then he addresses the crowd --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Who's my next victim?

           Volunteers CHEER, pushing enthusiastically forward.

           EXT. BACK LAWN - NIGHT

           Marie confers with The Pilot and JR --
                                 MARIE
                        Okay, so assuming for one second I 
                        believed you are who you say you 
                        are ... what's the next step?

                                 JR
                        That depends. You're sure Zucker 
                        knows about celium?

                                 MARIE
                        He begins field testing tomorrow. 
                        He's already buying up mines of the 
                        stuff.

                                 JR
                        It won't be long before he turns 
                        his attention to space.

                                 MARIE
                        Space. Outer space? No no, that's 
                        impossible. Arnie gets carsick.

           So far, The Pilot has said nothing. Marie notices, worried.

                                 MARIE
                        What are you going to do?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Whatever I have to.
                             (then)
                        I'm sorry.

                                 MARIE
                        For what?

           A SUBTLE PULSE and Marie faints into The Pilot's arms. A few 
           partygoers notice, but The Pilot waves off their concerns --

                                 THE PILOT
                        She's fine! Just had a bit too much 
                        to drink ...

           JR helps The Pilot ease Marie into a comfortable resting 
           position.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Stay with her.

           She knows what he's thinking.

                                 JR
                        Adam, you can't do this.
                                 THE PILOT
                        Starting tomorrow, the company goes 
                        public with the results. If Zucker 
                        dies tonight, the program dies with 
                        him. 

                                 JR
                        If we do it like this, we're no 
                        better than he is.

           The Pilot nods, he knows it's the truth. Something occurs to 
           him; he looks around. Uh-oh.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Where's Adam?

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           The beer pong tournament has become TRULY EPIC. Adam sinks a 
           MASTERFUL SHOT. Crowds ROAR, hoisting Adam up in victory as 
           the loser -- Zucker -- is forced to drink.

                                 ZUCKER
                        You're quite good at this, young 
                        man! I think your size gives you an 
                        unfair advantage.

           The Pilot appears, fixed on Adam.

                                 THE PILOT
                        There you are! You had me worried 
                        sick.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Oh, I'm sure he didn't mean any 
                        harm. Is that your little one? I 
                        can tell, he's got your eyes.
                             (then, on closer 
                              inspection)
                        Good God man, what are you wearing?

           Zucker pauses when he notices the logo on The Pilot's suit: 
           NEXTSTAR CORP. Even drunk, we can detect a flash of the cold, 
           calculating intelligence in Zucker's eyes.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Ah, I see. You came with Marie, 
                        didn't you. I heard you played 
                        something of a practical joke on 
                        her. I can assure you, I will not 
                        be so easily fooled.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I believe you.
                                 ZUCKER
                        Although, I admit, I am impressed. 
                        You only could've known what you 
                        knew if someone with access put you 
                        up to it. One of my staff, perhaps? 
                        Maybe even someone in this house? 
                             (a conspiring whisper)
                        Give me their names, and whatever 
                        they paid you, I'll double it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Is there someplace we can talk?

           For a moment, the two lock eyes. Across the table, Adam 
           watches with the interest of a voyeur. Finally, Zucker 
           smiles, ignoring whatever internal warnings may be sounding.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Of course. Follow me.

           Zucker leads The Pilot off. As he does, The Pilot quietly 
           reaches into his pocket, and activates his Athens device.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. VACANT FIELD - NIGHT

           Dash keeps watch over The Captain. He's pacing, nervous. The 
           Captain's eyes follow him, sensing weakness.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        They're gonna kill him, Dash. You 
                        know Jasper, he won't even give 
                        Adam a chance to surrender.

           Dash stops pacing.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        I know you like him. I know he was 
                        your friend. We can still save him.

           A beat. Dash is toying with the key to The Captain's 
           restraints. He turns. A decision reached.

                                 DASH
                        Make it look good.

           Dash tosses the key. The Captain realizes what he's asking.

           MOMENTS LATER, the CRACK of a PUNCH, and Dash SPRAWLS OUT in 
           the field, unconscious. A transport races off.
           INT. TRANSPORT - NIGHT

           The Captain drives in a panic, swerving through traffic. His 
           Athens device is tuned to the kill team's frequency --

                                 JASPER'S VOICE
                        All units stand by, prepare to push 
                        in on my command.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           The kill team sweeps through shadows, checking weapons, 
           positioning charges. None of the surrounding partygoers comes 
           close to noticing.

           INT. HOUSE - ZUCKER'S PARLOR - NIGHT

           Zucker leads The Pilot into a private study. A DRUNK COUPLE 
           excuses themselves from making out, avoiding eye contact. 
           "Sorry, Boss." Zucker crosses to the bar.

                                 ZUCKER
                        You know what they say. The harder 
                        they work ...

           He starts preparing a couple drinks. Unbeknownst to them 
           both, ADAM crouches at the door, listening in.

                                 ZUCKER
                        So, what are you, exactly? The 
                        three of you. Some sort of 
                        traveling troupe?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Something like that.

           The Pilot's hand remains in his pocket -- like a gunslinger 
           preparing to draw. Zucker hands him a drink. The Pilot uses 
           his free hand to accept it.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Of course, I can take a joke as 
                        well as the next fellow, but you 
                        must understand, what we do here is 
                        very sensitive.

                                 THE PILOT
                        And what's that exactly?

                                 ZUCKER
                        We punch holes in the universe. 
                             (a disarming smile)
                        That's the dream, anyway.
                                 THE PILOT
                        ... interesting dream.

           The Pilot takes a sip without breaking eye contact.

                                 ZUCKER
                        So, go on. A deal's a deal. Who put 
                        you up to it?

           The Pilot just stares at Zucker. Impossible to read.

           CLOSE ON ZUCKER, starting to realize something is wrong here. 
           Something in the way The Pilot is staring at him ... the slow-
           burning intensity behind his eyes.

           Zucker moves to get around The Pilot. A BURST OF MOVEMENT -- 

           The Pilot DROPS his glass and PULLS his Athens device. It 
           retracts into BLASTER MODE as the glass SHATTERS and Adam 
           RUNS IN --

                                 ADAM
                        Don't!

           The Pilot freezes. Finger on the trigger.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Get out of here, Adam.

                                 ADAM
                        You can't do this. This isn't us!

                                 THE PILOT
                             (convincing himself)
                        We don't have a choice.

                                 ADAM
                        We have to. We're not a killer!

           Zucker looks between the two Adams.

                                 ZUCKER
                        ... we?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Shut up!

           The Pilot's grip tightens ... but his hands are shaking. He's 
           losing his nerve. He can't do it. 

           Just as he starts to lower the weapon -- BOOM! AN EXPLOSION 
           ROCKS THE HOUSE.
           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           CHARGES DETONATE one by one, SHATTERING windows, DEMOLISHING 
           the face of the house. SCREAMING PANIC as guests scramble to 
           evacuate.

                                 RANDOM PARTYGOER
                        It's the cops!!

           Jasper and his team advance into the melee, rifles raised.

                                 JASPER
                        All units advance! Sweep in pairs! 
                        No one leaves until we ID the 
                        targets!

           Faceplate readouts SEE THROUGH WALLS, scanning and 
           identifying the panicked crowd as they flee past.

           INT. ZUCKER'S PARLOR - NIGHT

           The Pilot picks out from under debris. Zucker is gone. Damn. 
           He crouches over Adam, SLAPS him awake.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Listen. I want you to stay here. 
                        Hold for my signal, then run. Don't 
                        wait for me. Here --

           The Pilot hands Adam his Athens device.

                                 ADAM
                        What's this for?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Think like me. You'll know what to 
                        do.

           With that, The Pilot SPRINTS from the room, head down. 

           He slides into the kitchen as artillery pock-marks the wall 
           behind him, EXPLODING the contents of the fridge.

           Back to the counter, The Pilot KICKS the stove until it JARS 
           LOOSE. A gas line SEVERS, HISSING flammable fumes.

           ON THE KILL TEAM, sweeping through the house. 

           SOLDIER'S POV -- Pilot-shaped infrared BREAKS COVER and RUNS. 
           On instinct, the soldier raises his rifle --

                                 JASPER
                        No, DON'T!!!
           -- and FIRES, catching the gas line, which SPARKS, then 
           IGNITES in a STAGGERED, CATACLYSMIC EXPLOSION that DEVASTATES 
           what's left of the house. The Pilot dives clear of the blast. 

           ON ADAM, feeling the impact of the explosion. He SPRINTS out 
           a side exit, unnoticed in the commotion.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

           The Pilot recovers from the blast. He starts to stand, when a 
           VOICE from behind stops him cold.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Adam.

           The Pilot turns. THE CAPTAIN has his blaster raised. The 
           Pilot shows his hands.

           ON ADAM, crouched in hiding. From his vantage point, he can 
           see The Pilot's predicament. He STARTS FORWARD, intending to 
           intervene --

           -- but The Pilot wordlessly signals him to stay back. All the 
           while, The Pilot keeps his gaze fixed on The Captain. SOUNDS 
           of the kill team getting closer hang over the scene.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        No more running, Adam. It's over.
                             (re: the house)
                        Looks like you pushed one too many 
                        of the old man's buttons when you 
                        stole that celium.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You think I'm just gonna tell you 
                        where it is?

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        There's no other way out of this. 
                        They've cut off every escape within 
                        fifty miles. If you even try to 
                        run, they'll shoot you. And JR. You 
                        want out of this, you have to do 
                        what I say.

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's what I'm good at, right? 
                        Doing what you say. Following 
                        orders. Look where it got me ...

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You know none of this was my fault. 
                        You started this ... you can end 
                        it.
           The Captain retracts his blaster. Moving forward, as though 
           approaching a wild animal.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Just stop running. Just trust me.

           A long beat, as The Pilot decides ...

           EXT. BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Soldiers clear the flaming wreckage. JR is with them, already 
           restrained. Through the smoke, a figure appears -- THE 
           CAPTAIN, accompanied by The Pilot.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Relax, gentlemen! I want it noted, 
                        he surrendered of his own accord!

                                 JR
                        Adam! Where's -- ?

           The Pilot subtly shakes his head: don't mention the kid. JR 
           clams up as Jasper PUSHES past her -- badly burned from the 
           blast, and pissed.

                                 JASPER
                        Where is he? I'm gonna kill him!

           Jasper raises his blaster to The Pilot, but The Captain steps 
           between them.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Wait, Jasper, wait! It's okay, we 
                        got him. He told us where the 
                        celium is, I've already dispatched 
                        a retrieval team. It's over ...

           A beat. Slowly, Jasper calms. He begrudgingly stows his 
           weapon ... but can't help but SLUG The Pilot once in the gut, 
           doubling him over. JR winces. 

           That accomplished, Jasper nods to the others. Soldiers 
           advance. The Pilot glances back in the direction Adam took 
           off, before he's SHOVED forward.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

           Adam watches from hiding as the star capsule TAKES OFF, 
           vanishing into the sky. We HOLD on his face ... a helpess 12-
           year-old kid, lost and alone.

                                                       CUT TO:
           EXT. CUL DE SAC - NIGHT

           Emergency vehicles have arrived; cops and EMTs swarm the 
           street. Adam sits in an open ambulance, blanket around his 
           shoulders. Two EMTs converse --

                                 EMT 1
                             (re: Adam)
                        What's his story?

                                 EMT 2
                        The kid? Shock, most likely. 
                        According to his statement, he 
                        hasn't even been born yet. All in 
                        all, no stranger than half the 
                        statements I've taken so far 
                        tonight.

           ON ADAM, staring down at a cellphone in his hands. He's 
           already dialed a number, but hesitates before hitting SEND. 

           Finally, he does. The phone DIALS.

           INT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           A MAN picks up. We may or may not recognize him from the 
           shelf of photographs we saw earlier. It's Adam's father.

                                 MAN
                        Hello.

           INTERCUT WITH ADAM. Tears immediately fill his eyes.

                                 ADAM
                        ... Dad?

                                 MAN
                        Excuse me?

           Behind the Man, BONNIE appears -- several years younger, and 
           several months pregnant.

                                 BONNIE
                        Who is it, hun?

           The Man puts down the phone and moves off with a shrug. 
           Bonnie picks it up.

                                 BONNIE
                        Hello?

           ON ADAM ... soaking in the sound of his mother's voice. For a 
           moment, speechless. He's never felt more alone.
                                 BONNIE (O.C.)
                        ... hello? Is anyone -- ?

           Adam hangs up. He goes to put the phone away, when he notices 
           the Athens device, still in his hands. 

           He remembers The Pilot's final words to him --

                                 ADAM
                        Think like me ... think like me, 
                        think like me ...

           As if on cue, the ambulance RUMBLES to life and ACCELERATES 
           down the street. Adam clings to the door to keep from falling 
           out. EMTs give chase.

                                 EMT
                        Hey, what the -- STOP!!

           Adam crawls to the partition, slides it over to REVEAL -- 
           Marie is behind the wheel, driving like a madwoman.

                                 ADAM
                        ... Dr. Gordon!? What're you 
                        doing!?

                                 MARIE
                        What does it look like? I'm 
                        stealing an ambulance. 
                             (off look)
                        You want to help your friends, 
                        don't you?

                                 ADAM
                        How? They're already gone!

                                 MARIE
                        That all depends on your 
                        perspective. I can tell you where 
                        they're going. Only question is, 
                        when will they get there?

           Adam notices a SCALPEL, lying on a tray of medical equipment. 
           He picks it up. Looks from the small knife to the Athens 
           device in his hands. An idea occurs. He grins.

                                 ADAM
                        Step on it!

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The ambulance PLOWS through a police barricade.

                                                       CUT TO:
           INT. STAR CAPSULE - NIGHT

           DATA flashes across the cockpit screen, showing the new date: 
           JUNE 4, 2043. The Pilot sits alone, restrained in his chair. 
           He frowns, notices --

           A SCAR has materialized on his left arm -- a SINGLE INCISION 
           has turned the curve-shaped scar on his right arm into the 
           number 9. As this sinks in ...

                                 THE CAPTAIN (O.C.)
                        Strange ...

           The Pilot hides the scar as The Captain takes the empty seat 
           beside him. He indicates out the window. A distant view of 
           Earth.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... up here, everything looks the 
                        same.

           The Pilot says nothing. The Captain lowers his voice --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        You gotta give the old man some 
                        credit. Just explain what happened, 
                        tell him you overreacted. He's not 
                        a monster. He'll understand.

                                 THE PILOT
                        We had a deal. We said we wouldn't 
                        try to change the past.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Really? Then what've you been doing 
                        this whole time?

                                 THE PILOT
                        That's different.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Is it really?

           The Pilot suddenly doesn't seem so sure.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Try to think of the bigger picture. 
                        We've got a chance to shape the 
                        future. Isn't that the dream?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Not my dream ... I never wanted any 
                        of this.
                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Then why didn't you just quit?

           The Pilot considers ...

                                 THE PILOT
                        Because, I couldn't remember.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Remember what?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Who I was, if I wasn't the guy 
                        trying to live up to your standard.

           That stings.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... and now?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Now, I remember.

           From the pilot's chair, Laura interrupts --

                                 LAURA
                        We're here.

           THROUGH THE WINDOW, NextStar headquarters comes into view -- 
           a towering structure that doubles as an AERONAUTICS BASE, 
           complete with its own FLIGHT CONTROL TOWER.

                                                       MATCH DISSOLVE:

           The same base, forty years earier, still under construction. 
           The main building is nearly complete, but the flight tower is 
           nowhere to be found. We are --

           EXT. NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - NIGHT (2000)

           A shift change is in progress -- SECURITY PERSONNEL coming 
           in, CONSTRUCTION CREWS going out.

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           Marie kills the engine as Adam finishes bandaging his arm, 
           fixed on the approaching compound.

                                 ADAM
                        This is NextStar?

                                 MARIE
                        It will be. Here ...
           Marie hands Adam a CARDKEY.

                                 MARIE
                        You'll need this to access the 
                        elevators.

                                 ADAM
                        Will it get me past the guards?

                                 MARIE
                        No.

           Marie climbs out.

                                 ADAM
                        Where are you going?

                                 MARIE
                        To get you past the guards.

           With that, she's gone.

           INT. NEXTSTAR LOBBY - NIGHT

           A security guard named FRANK mans the front desk, listening 
           to ISLAND MUSIC via headphones ... which is why he doesn't 
           notice as a CRANE rumbles to life outside the facility. 

           Frank HUMS ALONG to the music as the crane arm SWINGS AROUND, 
           getting closer ... closer ... closer ... Finally --

           CRASH! THE CRANE SLICES THROUGH THE BUILDING. Frank dives for 
           cover as SMOKE and DEBRIS fills the air. He scrambles to his 
           feet, failing to notice as ADAM sneaks in through the 
           commotion, hiding behind a SCALE MODEL of an EARLY STAR 
           CAPSULE DESIGN that dominates the lobby. 

           Frank fumbles for his radio --

                                 FRANK
                        Disturbance on level one, 
                        requesting backup! Repeat, 
                        requesting immediate backup ...

           Frank sighs, taking in the surreal sight of the crane arm, 
           wedged through the middle of the rotunda.

                                 FRANK
                        ... cause I sure as hell ain't 
                        cleaning this up.
           INT. NEXTSTAR HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY - NIGHT (2043)

           The Pilot and JR are escorted through the SAME LOBBY, now 
           glistening and intact. They pass by FRANK -- the same guard, 
           manning the same desk, now well past retirement age.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Hiya, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Mr. Archer.

           AHEAD, a man stands with his back turned, facing a BANK OF 
           MONITORS that cycle through NEWS BROADCASTS from around the 
           world. Fires in Moscow. Bombings in Washington. Riots in 
           Greece. Looting in Japan. Global pandemonium.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... sir?

           The man turns -- ARNAND ZUCKER, now in his 60's. But this 
           isn't the optimistic kid we met before. This man is hard and 
           cold, his genius long-since joined with madness. 

           The crate of celium is set down before Zucker and opened -- 
           the blue glow fills his eyes. He addresses The Pilot --

                                 ZUCKER
                        I'm curious ... did you really 
                        believe you could swim upstream 
                        from fate? I admit, I've enjoyed 
                        watching you try. But here we are, 
                        despite your best efforts ... right 
                        back where we started.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Not exactly, sir.

           Zucker bristles. For a minute, it seems like he might do The 
           Pilot harm ... but instead, he just smiles. Almost charming.

                                 ZUCKER
                        I want to show you something.
                             (he nods to The Captain)
                        It's time.

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT (2000)

           Adam starts to sneak off, when BROKEN GLASS CRUNCHES 
           underfoot. Frank SPINS -- 

           He clicks on his flashlight and steps around the star capsule 
           model. Adam is careful to move with him, keeping the model 
           between them as they trade positions.
           A tense beat. Frank turns away, content that he's alone. Adam 
           breathes a sigh of relief ... until the model TILTS FORWARD 
           and SMASHES to the floor.

           Frank stares at Adam. Adam stares at Frank. Adam smiles ... 
           then RUNS. Frank CHASES after him, grabbing for his walkie.

                                 FRANK
                        Breach! Security breach on level 
                        one! He's heading for the 
                        elevators!

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT (2043)

           Striding for the elevators. Zucker leads the way --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Are you saying we have to leave 
                        now? Tonight?

                                 ZUCKER
                        My hands have been forced. Your 
                        brother's stunt has drawn some 
                        unwanted attention to our 
                        operations. It won't be long before 
                        the wrong people start asking the 
                        right questions.

           Off the reactions of the astronauts. Nervous, unsure.

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT (2000)

           Adam race for the elevators. Security guards move to cut him 
           off, but Adam LAYS THEM OUT with WELL-TARGETED BLOOMERS. 
           Guards fly like popcorn against the lobby walls.

           AT THE ELEVATORS, Adam fumbles with the cardkey. He SWIPES it 
           through a reader. A RED LIGHT FLASHES. Access denied.

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT (2043)

           A GREEN LIGHT FLASHES as Zucker SWIPES his cardkey. A SECRET 
           ELEVATOR opens. From the looks of the crew, no one knew it 
           was there -- not even Tommy. Zucker enters.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Going down?

           INT. LOBBY - NIGHT (2000)

           Adam swipes again, again, again. Nothing but red. NEARBY, 
           guards have regrouped and are CHARGING towards him.
           Finally, the GREEN LIGHT FLASHES and the elevator OPENS. Adam 
           runs inside, tap-tap-tapping the DOOR CLOSE button. The doors 
           close, just as the guards POUND against them.

           INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT (2043)

           Crammed into the elevator, going down. Way down. Zucker 
           whispers to The Pilot --

                                 ZUCKER
                        The truth is, in retrospect it 
                        seems almost inevitable -- your 
                        betrayal. You never had any stomach 
                        for the bigger picture.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Enlighten me.

                                 ZUCKER
                        It got to me when I was young. 
                        Crawled in behind my eyes like a 
                        parasite, and soon, I couldn't see 
                        anything else. It was a vision.

                                 THE PILOT
                        ... a vision of what?

                                 ZUCKER
                        The future.

           The elevator stops. Doors open to REVEAL --

           INT. SECTOR NINE - DOCKING STATION - NIGHT

           A CAVERNOUS CHAMBER, filled with SOLDIERS and ENGINEERS, 
           clambering over the frame of a TOWERING STAR CAPSULE -- 

           It's the machine from JR's blueprints, brought to vivid, awe-
           inspiring life. Zucker has the unmistakable glow of a 
           father's pride --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Just as I always imagined it would 
                        be.

           The Pilot notices a sign that reads SECTOR NINE. He 
           subconsciously covers the scar on his arm.

           INT. SECTOR NINE - NIGHT (2000)

           The SAME ELEVATOR opens to reveal the SAME FACILITY ... but 
           no star capsule. Not yet built. Adam enters --
           Behind him, the elevator is CALLED UP. Only a matter of time 
           before the guards return. Adam quickly gets to work. He 
           selects an app off the device and FIRES, CRATERING the floor.

           INT. DOCKING STATION - NIGHT (2043)

           A platform DESCENDS, lowering the soldiers and astronauts 
           past the frame of the incredible ship.

                                 ZUCKER
                        I'm calling her The Ark. Capable of 
                        withstanding speeds nearly a 
                        thousand times greater than the 
                        first generation model.

           JR notices MASSIVE ELECTRIC GENERATORS lining the walls of 
           the chamber. She frowns --

                                 JR
                        What are the generators for? The 
                        capsules don't run on electric 
                        power.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Clever girl. It turns out, Dr. 
                        Gordon had it right all along. The 
                        key to superluminal travel isn't to 
                        move faster than light, but to 
                        deform spacetime into faster-than-
                        light speeds. Like a doorway into 
                        the past, and all you have to do is 
                        ... step through.

                                 JR
                        A doorway. You're talking about a 
                        black hole. In the middle of 
                        Europe.

           ON THE ASTRONAUTS, frozen by this revelation. Zucker is 
           prepared for this. He nods, admits --

                                 ZUCKER
                        The dream is coming at a larger 
                        cost than originally imagined. And 
                        yes, the world as you know it will 
                        likely be destroyed. But from the 
                        ashes, a new world will be born. A 
                        new future, of our own design ... 
                        under our control.

                                 THE PILOT
                        You mean your control.

           Zucker ignores that -- focused on the others --
                                 ZUCKER
                        I never could have gotten this far 
                        without you. All of you.
                             (beat)
                        I hope you're with me now ...

           The astronauts are clearly conflicted ... but also aware of 
           the HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS, standing to attention nearby. The 
           Captain is the first to step forward.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        We're with you, Boss.

           The Pilot shoots The Captain a glare, which he ignores. One 
           by one, the other astronauts step forward, joining The 
           Captain. 

           Zucker grins: as he expected. He nods to his CHIEF TECH --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Fire her up.

           Switches are flipped, and generators ROAR to life -- huge 
           amounts of energy cycling through this facility.

           EXT. NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - NIGHT

           MAGNETIC FIELD EMITTERS rise from underground, forming a 
           CIRCLE. They begin to ROTATE, faster and faster.

           INT. SECTOR NINE - NIGHT (2000)

           Adam digs in a frenzy, deepening the hole. The elevator is on 
           its way down. Whatever he's doing, he's running out of time.

           INT. DOCKING STATION - NIGHT (2043)

           The station has turned into a hive of activity, soldiers 
           loading GEAR and SUPPLIES onto the Ark. JR whispers to The 
           Pilot --

                                 JR
                        In case we don't get out of this, I 
                        just wanted to say thank you.

                                 THE PILOT
                        For what?

                                 JR
                        For saving my life.
                             (off The Pilot's look)
                        It's probably the nicest thing 
                        anyone's ever done for me.
           This sinks in. Their hands join through restraints. NEARBY, 
           The Captain overhears the exchange ...

           Zucker SHOUTS UP to the engineers on top of the Ark --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Lock in the payload!

           HIGH ATOP THE ARK, the celium core is locked into place. The 
           entire ship POWERS TO LIFE, the WHINE of machinery building 
           to a POWERFUL ROAR.

           EXT. NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - NIGHT

           The array spins FASTER, a BLUR of IMPOSSIBLE MOVEMENT. 

           The air above the campus starts to RIPPLE and BEND. We've 
           seen this sort of anomaly before. It's a wormhole, except 
           this one is just a few miles off the ground.

           Surrounding buildings start to COME APART, uprooted into the 
           expanding vortex.

           INT. DOCKING STATION - NIGHT (2043)

           The Pilot is SLAMMED against the side of the ship, held down, 
           prepared for execution. JR SCREAMS --

                                 JR
                        NO!! Tommy, do something! Don't let 
                        them do this, Tommy, please!

           The Captain crosses to Zucker --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Sir, we had a deal.

                                 ZUCKER
                        I agreed to let you bring your 
                        brother in alive. And there he is, 
                        perfectly alive.

                                 THE PILOT
                        It's okay, JR, just look away. Look 
                        away!

           Zucker leans close to The Captain --

                                 ZUCKER
                        Don't forget what we're doing here, 
                        Tommy. We're rebooting the entire 
                        human race. We at the beginning 
                        must be uncorrupted. We must be 
                        pure.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZUCKER (CONT'D)
                             (he offers a blaster)
                        All of us.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        ... sir?

           Zucker places the blaster in The Captain's hand -- then 
           raises The Captain's arm, until his aim is fixed to the back 
           of The Pilot's head.

                                 ZUCKER
                        Show me your heart is still in this 
                        game.

           Zucker steps back, as if he's flipped a switch, and he's 
           waiting to see what will happen. Glances pass between the 
           astronauts. They didn't sign up for this. JR struggles --

                                 JR
                        No, Tommy, listen to me! This isn't 
                        you, Tommy. You can't do this!!

           JR's voice rings in The Captain's ears. A long moment ... 

           ... then, his arm LOWERS, as if it's been drained of 
           strength. He looks to Zucker and shakes his head -- a single, 
           whispered syllable --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        No.

           Zucker nods his disappointment. He takes back the blaster.

                                 ZUCKER
                        That's the problem with soldiers, 
                        isn't it. Once they stop following 
                        orders, they outlive their 
                        usefulness.

           Zucker raises the blaster -- aimed at The Captain. The 
           Captain closes his eyes, accepting his fate.

                                 ZUCKER
                        I hope you don't mind my saying ... 
                        I've always thought of you as a 
                        son.

           Zucker's finger grazes the trigger, when suddenly -- 

           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

           The noise is FAINT and DISTANT. Zucker is the first to hear 
           it. He lowers the blaster.
                                 ZUCKER
                        Quiet, QUIET!!

           Workers pause in their duties, and the sound becomes clearer-- 

           BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

           Soldiers fan out, instinctively rooting out the source of the 
           noise -- an oddly comical sight, like a SWAT team hunting for 
           a cricket.

           INT. SECTOR NINE - NIGHT (2000)

           Adam stops digging. He enters a FAMILIAR DATE onto the Athens 
           device -- JUNE 4, 2043 -- then buries the weapon --

           INT. DOCKING STATION - NIGHT (2043)

           Soldiers gather around a point on the floor where the noise 
           is loudest. A soldier LEANS DOWN --

                                 SOLDIER
                        What is that?

           ON THE PILOT ... surreptitiously backing away from the noise. 
           He indicates for JR to do the same.

           INT. SECTOR NINE - NIGHT (2000)

           As Adam fills the hole, we PAN DOWN to the buried Athens 
           device. A COUNTDOWN has begun ... a forty year countdown.

           INT. DOCKING STATION - NIGHT (2043)

           MATCH PAN below the floor, where the SAME DEVICE has remained 
           buried for the PAST FORTY YEARS. The countdown finishes --   

           3 ... 2 ... 1. BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEP-BEEEEEEEEEEEP --

           AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, BLOWING A GIANT CRATER 
           RIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE CHAMBER. 

           Machinery goes HAYWIRE; the roof RETRACTS and is immediately 
           RIPPED AWAY by the PULL of the WORMHOLE, swirling above.

           TOTAL PANDEMONIUM: The Pilot and JR STRIKE in unison, taking 
           out a pair of soldiers before they're overpowered, 
           restrained, about to be shot ...

           ... but the astronauts make their move. 

           Dash grabs a rifle as Laura palm-thrusts a soldier's nose. 
           Jasper activates his plasma glove, sending soldiers shooting 
           across the chamber. The Pilot and JR twist free.
           IN THE SKY ABOVE THE CAMPUS, the wormhole continues to 
           EXPAND, spreading its path of destruction.

           Equipment is RIPPED FROM WALLS, as though uprooted by a 
           POWERFUL TORNADO. Engineers flee in an end-of-the-world 
           panic, abandoning their stations, running for their lives.

           Zucker steps forward, completely disconnected from the chaos 
           that surrounds him. He stares up at the wormhole, entranced, 
           as astronauts and engineers seek refuge inside the Ark. 

           The Pilot turns back to find Zucker, standing out in the 
           open, clutching a rail. They meet eyes. Unbelievably, Zucker 
           is SMILING.

                                 ZUCKER
                        I've always wanted to punch a hole 
                        in the universe!

           With that, he LETS GO and goes FLYING into the void. It pulls 
           him in, and he's GONE -- VANISHED into space and time.

           IN THE FACILITY, the last of the engineers piles into the Ark 
           -- all except JR. She's still outside, working the generator 
           controls, struggling to stay on her feet. The Pilot SHOUTS --

                                 THE PILOT
                        JR!! GET OUT OF THERE!

                                 JR
                        I HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE ARRAY! IF I 
                        CAN OVERLOAD THE GENERATORS, WE 
                        MIGHT HAVE A CHANCE!

           The Pilot sprints to a storage locker in the Ark, starts 
           frantically pulling on a flightsuit. The Captain approaches --

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Adam, what are you doing? You can't 
                        go out there!

                                 THE PILOT
                        You can't stop me.

           The Captain GRABS The Pilot and SLAMS him against the wall.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Want to bet?

           The Pilot looks his brother in the eye -- admits --
                                 THE PILOT
                        I'm not as strong as you, Tommy ... 
                        I'm not strong enough to lose her 
                        again.

           A moment between them. Frustration. Anger. And then -- 
           finally -- understanding. The Captain releases The Pilot. 
           Hands him an OXYGEN MASK.

                                 THE CAPTAIN
                        Good luck, Kickstand.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Don't call me that.

           ON JR, gripping onto the console as her feet LEAVE THE 
           GROUND, pulled in by the wormhole. She REACHES for a SHUTDOWN 
           LEVER -- almost there -- almost ...

           And just as she finally GETS IT, she LOSES HER GRIP and goes 
           FLYING out of the facility, into open space, reaching out for 
           help that isn't there.

           SLOW MOTION -- everything seems to happen at once --

           The Pilot allows himself to be YANKED from the Ark, pulled in 
           by the wormhole. He angles his body like a GUIDED MISSILE, 
           reaching for JR as the void extends its maw.

           HANDS CLASP. The Pilot goes for a chute strap, but the 
           gravitational forces are INCREDIBLY STRONG. His eyelids 
           flutter, on the edge of consciousness.

           BELOW, generators ERUPT, unable to handle the power.

           The array SHUTS DOWN and the wormhole collapses in on itself, 
           VANISHING in a VIOLENT ERUPTION OF BLINDING WHITE LIGHT. 

           The light fades. We're left with the view we began with --

           Stars shine through the darkness of space. 

           The Pilot and JR enter frame -- FLOATING, as though 
           weightless, eyes closed, hands clasped, wind whipping at 
           their hair. REVEAL -- 

           They're free-falling from THOUSANDS OF FEET IN THE AIR, 
           unconscious at terminal velocity.

           Suddenly, The Pilot's eyes drift open. He looks to JR, 
           falling alongside him, almost dreamlike. He notices the 
           ground, coming up fast. Very fast. This could be the end.

           A BURST OF AWARENESS -- 
           The Pilot pulls JR in and ACTIVATES HIS CHUTE. It deploys, 
           but just before we can find out if they made it, we --

                                                       CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. NEXTSTAR CAMPUS - SUNRISE (2000)

           The headquarters are still in decent condition, save for the 
           crane arm wedged through the middle of the lobby. 

           YOUNG ZUCKER steps out of an approaching car. He finds MARIE, 
           flanked by building security. She smiles when she sees him.

                                 MARIE
                        Hello, Arnie.

           Zucker is staggered by the scale of the destruction.

                                 YOUNG ZUCKER
                        Marie ... what have you done!?

                                 MARIE
                        Let's just say I made an investment 
                        in the future of this company.

           Zucker's expression hardens.

                                 YOUNG ZUCKER
                        You don't have a future with this 
                        company. Not anymore.

           Marie thinks it over. Smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        I can live with that.

           She gives Zucker a kiss on the cheek and heads off, leaving 
           him baffled.

           EXT. CAMPUS - SUNRISE

           Adam stands alone, half a mile from the facility, studying 
           the fading stars. Marie approaches on foot. Adam shakes his 
           head without turning from the sky.

                                 ADAM
                        They should be back by now.

           Marie follows Adam's gaze into the heavens. A solemn beat ... 

           Finally, a FAMILIAR SOUND -- a SONIC BOOM. A HUGE SMILE fills 
           Adam's face.
           EXT. NEXTSTAR HEADQUARTERS - SUNRISE

           Back at the facility, Zucker catches a FLEETING GLIMPSE of 
           the star capsule coming in for a landing, vanishing behind 
           the treeline.

           Zucker starts moving forward ... slowly at first, then 
           breaking into a MAD SPRINT.

           EXT. CAMPUS - SUNRISE

           The capsule lands. The door HISSES OPEN, venting steam. Adam 
           waits, holding his breath as a FIGURE emerges from the steam.

           The Pilot. Impossible to read the expression on his face, 
           until he steps aside -- 

           JR is with him. They're holding hands, alive and well.

           Adam dashes up the ramp and FLIES into The Pilot's arms.

                                 ADAM
                        I knew we'd make it.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I'm glad one of us did. By the way, 
                        that stunt with the Athens device? 
                        Couldn't've done it better myself.

           The Pilot acknowledges Marie as she ascends the ramp, staring 
           up at the ship, amazed. He shakes her hand. Sincere.

                                 THE PILOT
                        Thank you. If there's anything I 
                        can do ...

           Marie is still taking in the sight of the capsule. Her dream 
           come to life. She smiles.

                                 MARIE
                        I could use a ride home.

           EXT. CAMPUS - SUNRISE

           MOMENTS LATER, Zucker arrives at the landing site -- winded, 
           panting for breath. He scans the area -- no sign of the star 
           capsule. Maybe it was just his imagination. 

           Suddenly, behind him, a FLAMING STREAK cuts across the sky, 
           before FADING and DISAPPEARING ... as if it was never even 
           there at all ...

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. ARCHER RESIDENCE - SUNSET (2013)

           Bonnie steps outside, lugging a garbage bag. She looks like 
           she hasn't slept in days. Behind her, a SHOOTING STAR falls 
           from the sky and lands in the woods behind her house. 

           Bosco takes off into the woods, BARKING like mad.

                                 BONNIE
                        Bosco! Dammit ... dumb dog ...

           She runs after him.

           EXT. CLEARING - SUNSET

           Adam and The Pilot emerge from the capsule. Home. An awkward 
           moment between them ... neither sure what to say.

                                 THE PILOT
                        I guess this is it ... 

                                 ADAM
                        Will I ever see you again?

           They both smile, realizing what an odd question that is.

           FURTHER BACK, Bonnie chases Bosco into the woods --

                                 BONNIE
                        Bosco! C'mere, boy ...

           BACK TO THE ADAMS -- they can hear Bosco getting closer. The 
           Pilot turns back for the capsule ... but stops. He can't 
           resist. He crouches down before his younger self.

                                 THE PILOT 
                        All right, listen. Don't join Joe 
                        Kirkpatrick's paintball tournament 
                        unless you want to lose vision out 
                        of your right eye for three months. 
                        Don't ask Leslie to prom; she'd say 
                        yes, but you'd rather go with 
                        Stacey. Also, you love asparagus, 
                        but you're about to develop a late-
                        term allergy to avocado, so stay 
                        away from the guacamole at Kyle 
                        Friedman's graduation party. And 
                        one night, freshman year, Amy 
                        Gilfoil's gonna offer you a ride 
                        back to your dorm. I know it's 
                        tempting, I know she's cute, but 
                        don't get in that car. And, uh ... 
                             (he thinks, nods)
                        ... yeah. That's it.
                                 ADAM
                        Why'd you tell me all that!?

                                 THE PILOT
                        Because those were my mistakes. You 
                        have to start making your own. 
                        Starting now.

           A beat. Adam nods. The Pilot extends a hand. Adam shakes it.

           EXT. CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

           Bonnie pushes into the clearing. She pulls up short, the 
           breath stolen from her lungs.

           WHAT SHE SEES: Adam stands in the middle of the clearing with 
           his back turned. Bosco happily wags his tail, as if to say: 
           look who I found! 

                                 BONNIE
                        ... Adam?

           Adam turns. Bonnie wills herself to move. She stumbles 
           forward and THROWS her arms around her son, overcome with 
           relief.

                                 BONNIE
                        Oh my God ... are you okay, baby? 
                        Are you hurt?

                                 ADAM
                        I'm fine. Really, Mom, I'm okay.
                             (then)
                        How are you?

           Bonnie pulls back from the hug. She finds herself caught up 
           staring at Adam. She almost doesn't recognize him.

                                 ADAM
                        ... what?

                                 BONNIE
                        Nothing, I just ...
                             (she has to ask)
                        When did you get so grown up?

           AN OFF-SCREEN BLAST cuts off Adam's reply. Bonnie GASPS as 
           the star capsule RISES over the horizon.

           Adam takes his mother's hand -- watching the capsule go with 
           an expression of total serenity. 
           Bonnie soaks in the calmness of Adam's expression ... maybe 
           for the first time noticing the silver flightsuit he's 
           wearing. She holds her son as if he's the only thing keeping 
           her upright.

           The capsule departs, receding into the heavens, until it's 
           just another point of light in the star-speckled sky. 

           An ENERGETIC MUSIC CUE kicks in as we CUT TO --

           EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

           The star capsule RACES through the cosmos. AHEAD, a WORMHOLE 
           forms. The ship PUNCHES THROUGH -- 

           A BRILLIANT FLASH OF IMAGES

           FLASH: Adam at high school graduation. Bonnie and Tommy wave 
           enthusiastically from the stands.

           FLASH: Adam exchanges vows with JR. Tommy is his best man.

           FLASH: Adam hits the Streif, swooping through a mean-looking 
           half-pipe, working the balance board like a pro, with a style 
           all his own.

           Focus on an ELDERLY MAN, cheering from the crowds. Pride 
           fills his eyes, which sparkle and shine. With specks of 
           green.

                                                       FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
