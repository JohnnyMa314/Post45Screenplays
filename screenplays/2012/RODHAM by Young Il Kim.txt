                        We have vowed that we shall not see 
                        space filled with weapons of mass 
                        destruction, but with instruments 
                        of knowledge and understanding.

           The radio dial cuts off John F. Kennedy’s speech until it 
           settles on “Do You Love Me” by the Contours. As it plays...

           EXT. CHICAGO SUBURBS - DAY - SUMMER OF 1962

           A 1954 Cadillac de Ville rolls past the department store with 
           mannequins dressed in the latest Jackie Kennedy fashion.

                                 CONTOURS (V.O.)
                        You broke my heart 
                        ‘Cause I couldn’t dance.
                        You didn’t even want me around.

           An appliance store with TVs showing identical Cubs games. One 
           in a small black and white TV and the other in a bigger, 
           vibrant color TV. Yes, this new technology is here to stay.

                                 CONTOURS (V.O.)
                        And now I’m back to let you know
                        I can really shake ‘em down.

           The radio dials back to the Kennedy speech as the Cadillac
           drive down the road. On its rear bumper are two faded 
           stickers of “I Like Ike” and “Nixon/Lodge in 1960.”

                                 KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        We set sail on this new sea because 
                        there is new knowledge to be 
                        gained, and new rights to be won, 
                        and they must be won and used for 
                        the progress of all people. 

           AT A NEARBY GAS STATION, six attendants in pristine uniforms 
           clean and refuel a Lincoln Capri at 31.5 cents per gallon.

           The Cadillac turns into a residential street as a plane flies 
           overhead. The radio dial changes back to the Contours.

           The car drives past a milkman who delivers fresh bottles to a 
           June Cleaver who greets with her hello. Then the car moves 
           past a sidewalk stand where Brownie Scouts sell lemonade.

           The radio dial moves back to the Kennedy speech. No, it 
           changes back to the Contours. Back to Kennedy. No, back to--

                                 TEENAGE GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mom! Mom!! Make Daddy stop.
           The car drives past a park where boys play baseball. This is 
           as America as America gets. And judging by the failed “Nixon 
           For President” signs that hang, it’s Republican territory.

                                 MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Hugh, let her listen to her radio.

                                 FATHER (O.S.)
                        But that man’s a damn Communist.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL (O.S.)
                        No. He’s a Democrat.

                                 FATHER
                        Same thing. And he’s Catholic!

           Regardless, the radio dial goes back to the Kennedy speech.

                                 KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        We choose to go to the moon in this 
                        decade and do the other things, not 
                        because they are easy, but because 
                        they are hard.

           The Cadillac pulls into the driveway of a suburban home. The 
           14 year-old girl (whose face we don’t see) jumps out of the 
           car and runs to the mailbox. From it, she pulls out--

           An envelope from NASA. The letter she’s been waiting for!!

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Oh please please please...

           She opens it and pulls out the letter. It reads:

                                 KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        Because that goal will serve to 
                        organize and measure the best of 
                        our energies and skills. Because 
                        that challenge is one that we are 
                        willing to accept...

           “Dear Miss Rodham. We regret to inform you that we do not 
           admit women into the NASA astronaut training program.”

                                 KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        There is no strife, no prejudice, 
                        no national conflict in outer space 
                        as yet. Its conquest deserves the 
                        best of all mankind.

           The girl, wearing her “AuH2O” shirt, slumps on the ground as 
           disappointment weighs her down.
           The rejection letter floats in the wind until it hits the 
           lawn sign of “Elect Nixon in 1960.” As the wind sweeps the 
           letter away, MATCH CUT TO:

           EXT. NEW HAVEN - DAY

           A graffiti of “Dick Head” smeared on “Re-Elect Nixon” and 
           “Richard Nixon & Spiro Agnew in 1972” signs. Unsatisfied by 
           the graffiti, a Hippie girl kicks a sign to knock it down.

           This is Yale where the spirit of Woodstock and Haight-Ashbury
           makes its last stand. The Hippie girl walks past...

           ...THE WASHINGTON POST box. She pulls out an October 10, 1972
           edition with the headline of “FBI Finds Nixon Aides Sabotaged 
           Democrats” by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein and “Supreme 
           Court to deliberate on Roe v. Wade.”

                                 HIPPIE GIRL
                        Nixon’s an asshole.

           The NEW HAVEN REGISTER box shows headlines of “Former US 
           Senator and Yale Alum Prescott Bush Dead” and “New Haven 
           Court Acquits Black Panthers Bobby Seale and Ericka Huggins.”

           EXT. YALE LAW SCHOOL - DAY

           Students-- one half dressed to rule the world and the other 
           half dressed to turn on, tune in, drop out-- enter...

           INT. LAW SCHOOL LIBRARY - DAY

           JOE LIEBERMAN, 30, stands by the entrance of the main reading 
           room and hands out flyers to law students passing by.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Vote me for State Senate. Joe 
                        Lieberman, Law School Class of ‘67.
                             (to an attractive co-ed)
                        Joe Lieberman for State Senate.

           The co-ed takes the flyer and dumps it in a trash can. 
           Lieberman sighs. And as this attractive co-ed walks off...

           ...a VIKING of a man slows down to watch her. He has a full 
           mane and a six inch beard. And he towers over Lieberman.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Are you a registered voter in New 
                        Haven? Vote for me for Connecticut 
                        State Senate. I’m Class of ‘67.
           Lieberman sticks out a flyer but the Viking’s eyes move to--

           A TABLE full of books, legal briefs, and folders

           where a diminutive ROBERT REICH, 27, scribbles furiously on a 
           notepad. The Viking’s eyes shift away from Reich and land on 
           the girl writing over what Reich just wrote. She is--

           A blonde girl whose face is hidden behind an awful haircut 
           and a hideous pair of COKE-BOTTLE glasses. Her tie-dyed T-
           shirt has a faded “AuH2O” on it. She’s the valedictorian of 
           the “look-like-shit school of feminism.”

           The Viking smiles, seeing a beauty in her that others will 
           never see. Perhaps sensing a glance, Coke-Bottle looks up--

           --just as the Viking redirects his attention to Lieberman.

                                 VIKING
                        Sorry...
                             (looks at the flyer)
                        Joe Lieberman. I’m not registered 
                        in New Haven. But if you ever run 
                        in Fayetteville, you got my vote.

           Coke-Bottle grabs a Reich-edited paper and adds her own notes 
           in green ink. Judging by her edits, Coke-Bottle is a control 
           freak, practically writing everything herself.

                                 VIKING
                        Why don’t you ask that girl? The 
                        one Robert Reich is tutoring.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Actually, she’s tutoring him.

                                 VIKING
                             (genuinely shocked)
                        No way. Reich’s summa cum laude and 
                        a Rhodes scholar.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Yes way. But she’s a Republican. 
                        She interned for Gerald Ford.

                                 VIKING
                        How do you know?

           Coke-Bottle looks up. The Viking turns away barely in time. 
           Then he peeks back, now fascinated on a whole new level.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Everyone knows. She was in LIFE 
                        magazine.

                        Look. She was a Goldwater Girl.

                                 VIKING
                        I bet ya I can get her to switch 
                        sides.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        Yeah, right. And George McGovern’s
                        going to be President.

           Coke-Bottle looks up again, certain she was being watched.

                                 VIKING
                        Who’s your campaign manager?

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        I don’t have one.

                                 VIKING
                        Now you do.

                                 JOE LIEBERMAN
                        I can’t pay you.

                                 VIKING
                        We’ll think of something.

           The Viking wraps his arm around the slighter Lieberman. He 
           tries to sneak a peek at Coke-Bottle when she catches him.

           She SLAMS her book shut, rises, and STORMS UP to the Viking. 
           She’s half-angry, half-irritated, and fully urgent.

                                 COKE-BOTTLE
                        If you’re going to keep looking at 
                        me, and I’m going to keep looking 
                        back, we might as well be 
                        introduced.

           We now get a full look at the woman who extends her hand.

                                 COKE-BOTTLE
                        I’m Hillary Rodham.

           Her piercing gaze leaves the Viking speechless as we...

                        We made such a pretty pair.”

           The voice la-la-las some of it. Not quite sure of the words.

                             (into the camera)
                        Today marks the fifth day of 
                        attacks by the Egyptian and Syrian 
                        forces on the Israeli-held Sinai 
                        Peninsula and Golan Heights.

           A few blocks away, HILLARY RODHAM, 26, approaches a building 
           with CHILDREN’S DEFENSE FUND as a tenant. She uses a rolled-
           up newspaper as an imaginary microphone.
                                 HILLARY
                        “And that you would never leave 
                        But you gave away the things you 
                        loved and one of them was me.”

                                 TV REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The conflict began when the Arab 
                        Coalition attacked Israel on Yom 
                        Kippur, the holiest day for the 
                        Jewish people.

           With a salon hairstyle, subtle make-up, and a pencil skirt, 
           Hillary is very feminine and sexy even if she doesn’t think 
           so. And she hates that she has to dress up like this when she 
           would much rather be in a simple floral dress and sandals.

                        “I had some dreams, they were 
                        clouds in my coffee. Clouds in my 
                        coffee, and...”

           But today, Hillary doesn’t have a care in the world. Heck, 
           she doesn’t care if she can’t sing like Carly Simon. Yeah, 
           screw Carly Simon. Because this song ain’t about her.

           INT. CHILDREN’S DEFENSE FUND - DAY

           Hillary sneaks down the hallway, passing a wall clock of 
           7:05. Seeing an open door to an office in her way, she...

           ...opens a compact and uses the reflection to peer into the 
           office. MARIAN WRIGHT EDELMAN, a mid-30s black woman of 
           strength and dignity, concentrates on a legal brief.

           Hillary scurries past the door and to her cubicle. She’s the 
           second person in the office and that’s still too late.

           IN HER CUBICLE

           She sets down the October 10, 1973 edition of The Washington 
           Post, opens up her Rolodex, and dials a number.

                                 HILLARY
                        This is Hillary Rodham from the 
                        Children’s Defense Fund. May I 
                        speak to Congressman O’Neill 
                        please?

           The Rolodex is opened to the business card of Thomas “Tip” 
           O’Neill with a hand-written note of “Majority Whip Leader.”
                                 HILLARY
                        Of course I know what time it is. 
                        Listen, it’s much cheaper for him 
                        to talk to me now than to talk to 
                        Mrs. Marian Wright Edelman later.
                             (beat)
                        Yes. Thank you. 

           She’s put on hold. So she skims the Post with the headline of 
           “VP Agnew Accepted $30,000 in bribes.”

                                 HILLARY
                             (faux-polite)
                        Congressman O’Neill. How are you 
                        doing this morning?... Yes, the 
                        Middle East situation is 
                        terrible...
                             (flips through the paper)
                        With Golan Heights and Sinai. 
                        Especially during Yom Kippur and 
                        Ramada...
                             (looking closer)
                        Ramadan. Rah-mah-dan. I meant Rah-
                        mah-dan... Yes, I know. One’s a 
                        holiday and the other’s...
                             (trying too hard)
                        ...like a Holiday Inn.

           She cringes at her own bad joke. We pan across her cubicle 
           wall. Framed diplomas of Wellesley (political science) in 
           1969 and Yale Law School in 1973. As we continue...

                                 HILLARY
                        I wasn’t trying to make light of 
                        the situation. Sorry. Mrs. Edelman
                        would love to have you as the 
                        keynote speaker for our fundraiser
                        during the Head of the Charles 
                        regatta... Cambridge, of course, 
                        your congressional district.

           ... a photo of Bill and Hillary at Yale, another photo of 
           Hillary Rodham and House Minority Leader GERALD FORD, and, 
           finally, the NASA rejection letter. The letter hangs at her 
           eye-level as if to taunt her every single second.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes, thank you. Yes, yes, I’ll 
                        definitely study up on the Middle 
                        East. Thank you so much.

           She hangs up. She looks at the next name on the To-Call list. 
           “George Bush, Chairman of the Republican National Committee.”
           She slumps her head against the desk. She doesn’t want to 
           make this call. She picks up the phone and dials as...

           ...Marian enters this larger office. She refills her coffee. 
           Then she pours the pot into Hillary’s First United Methodist 
           Church mug. Four cubes of sugar and a little cream.

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                             (assertive)
                        Chairman Bush please. This is 
                        Hillary Rodham from the Children’s 
                        Defense Fund.
                             (controlled anger)
                        He’s not available? Is he not 
                        available because the Republican 
                        National Committee doesn’t care 
                        about children or because he
                        doesn’t care?

           Marian stands by Hillary’s cubicle and sets the mug down. 
           Marian mouths and gestures “I’ll leave you alone.” She gives 
           Hillary a reassuring thumb-up before she leaves.

                                 HILLARY
                        Can I inform the Post that Chairman 
                        Bush will be at the Children’s 
                        Defense Fund charity event this 
                        Sunday? His counterpart, Chairman 
                        Robert Strauss of the Democratic 
                        National Committee, already pledged 
                        five thousand dollars. Surely, the 
                        RNC has deeper pockets than--

           The faint dial-tone of an open line becomes a series of 
           beeps. Hillary hangs up. She stares at Bush’s business card.

                                 HILLARY
                        You can do this. You can do this.

           She picks up the phone, gets a fresh dial tone, and dials the 
           rotary phone in earnest. Ugh.

           INT. LOCAL BAKERY/DELI - DAY

           Hillary eyes the baked goods in a glass case while Marian 
           looks up at the board menu of sandwiches. Through the store 
           window, we notice a theater marquee of Deep Throat. Theaters 
           of this era played XXX films alongside Love Story and A 
           Clockwork Orange. These were innocent times.

                                 MARIAN
                        How did you get the RNC Chairman to 
                        agree to the fundraiser?
                                 HILLARY
                        That’s a trade secret, Marian. The 
                        only way to enjoy a hot dog is by 
                        not seeing how it’s made.

           Hillary gestures to a tray of pies inside a glass case. The 
           theater and a gas station reflect off the glass...

                                 HILLARY
                        Are these your famous peach pies?

                                 BAKERY CLERK
                        Yes, ma’am. Would you like one?

           Looking past Hillary, the clerk notices the gas station with 
           Self-Serve gas at 33.9 cents and Full-Serve at 35.5 cents.

                                 HILLARY
                        Do you have any deformed ones? 
                        Maybe in the back kitchen?
                             (off the clerk’s look)
                        You know, leftovers. The ones the 
                        staff usually takes home.

                                 BAKERY CLERK
                        Why would you want those?

                                 MARIAN
                        I know what’s going on. Bill’s 
                        visiting this weekend, isn’t he? 
                        And you’re trying to pass these 
                        pies as your own. But these are too 
                        store perfect.

                                 HILLARY
                        Marian, that’s outrageous.

                                 MARIAN
                        I’ll tell you what’s outrageous. 
                        You baking only one pie for Bill 
                        when you clearly made a few more 
                        for your co-workers.
                             (smiling at the clerk)
                        She’ll take three more of your 
                        ugliest pies from the kitchen.

           Hillary shakes her head in mock disgust as she takes out a 
           ten dollar bill to pay for four $2 pies. 

                                 MARIAN
                        Is that sort of how you got George 
                        Bush to agree to the fundraiser?
                                 HILLARY
                        I learned from the best.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Half the bar patrons (men in suits) watch the evening news 
           while the other half watch the MLB playoff game between the 
           Baltimore Orioles and the Oakland Athletics. A patron nudges 
           his friend and points to the front door. Check her out. 

           Hillary just entered. She scans the restaurant for a familiar 
           face among the sea of men in power suits and the occasional 
           women who accompany them. Then she singles out a voice.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Hope, Arkansas is the home of the 
                        world’s largest watermelon!

           Hidden behind a giggling waitress is BILL CLINTON. No longer 
           sporting the Viking look, Bill has an aw-shucks charm about 
           him and an easy smile. And the way he looks at you makes you 
           feel like you’re the most important person in the world.

                                 BILL
                        They’re the firmest, juiciest 
                        melons I ever laid my eyes on.

           Hillary beelines to his booth and sits down. She shoots the 
           waitress a look to force her away.

                          HILLARY
                  (quick, territorial 
                  kiss)
           Sorry I’m late, honey. 
                                                        WAITRESS
                                              You’re too much, Bill. I’ll 
                                              get one more beer for your 
                                              girl.

           Hillary eyes Bill but he smiles her off with his casual 
           charm. She grabs the beer from Bill’s hand and drinks it.

                                 BILL
                        Hey darling, the Razorbacks won 
                        today. Let’s get married.

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh Bill, our wedding announcement 
                        won’t even make the back pages.

                                 BILL
                        It might be front page news in the 
                        Arkansas Democrat.

                                 HILLARY
                        I mean a real paper like the 
                        Washington Post. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HILLARY (CONT'D)
                        Did you read today’s? Woodward and 
                        Bernstein are bigger than Simon and 
                        Garfunkel.

           She sips the beer, not noticing that Bill might be serious.

                            BILL
                                                         HILLARY
           Maybe I mean it this time.
                                                 (not hearing him)
                                              My bra’s itchy. I think it’s 
                                              the wires.

                                 BILL
                        Then don’t wear them.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’d like that, wouldn’t you? 
                        Betsey wants me to have Beach 
                        Blanket Bingo Boobies.

                                 BILL
                        Betsey? Betsey Wright from the 
                        Austin campaign?

                                 HILLARY
                        She thinks I need to have torpedo 
                        titties like Annette Funicello.
                             (looks down at her chest)
                        What do you think, honey?

                                 BILL
                        I think you have great things ahead 
                        of you.

           Thrown off by his response, she laughs. He laughs back in 
           that inviting way of his. The laughs fade to a lingering 
           smile. Just when Bill thinks he can steer the conversation--

           OUTSIDE, news vans zip across Pennsylvania Avenue and head 
           toward the White House.

                                 HILLARY
                        What do you think that’s about?

                                 BILL
                        I don’t care.

                                 HILLARY
                        Sure you do. That’s the White 
                        House.

                                 BILL
                        I didn’t come here for a tour. I 
                        came to spend time with you.
           Hillary looks at Bill. He’s very serious. Can he really mean 
           what he said? Behind them, the TV screen cuts from the ALCS
           game into BREAKING NEWS.

           Bill takes a deep breath. She smiles. But in this quiet 
           moment, we hear Walter Cronkite in the background. 

                                 CRONKITE (O.S.)
                        We now go live to the White House 
                        where Vice President Spiro Agnew 
                        will announce his resignation.

                                 BILL
                        So what do you think?

                                 HILLARY
                             (notices the TV)
                        Um, about what?

                                 BILL
                        Us getting married.

           She’s trying to ignore the TV screen as VP AGNEW announces 
           his resignation. (We don’t need to hear the entire clip. Just 
           know that this historical moment distracts Hillary.)

                                 HILLARY
                        And what about the teaching job at 
                        the law school?

                                 BILL
                        I can put in a word for you to Dean 
                        Davis.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill, I’m not movin’ to Arkansas. I 
                        meant your classes, your students.

                                 BILL
                        I have to finish out the academic 
                        year. But in the summer--

                                 HILLARY
                        You’ll move up here?

           Off his nod, she reaches for his hand. She wanted this for so 
           long and it’s finally happening. As she caresses his hands...

                                 HILLARY
                        D.C. bar exam’s much harder than 
                        the one in Arkansas. You can’t just 
                        show up and expect to pass.
                            BILL
                  (mysterious smile)
           Maybe I won’t be a lawyer.
                                                   SPIRO AGNEW (ON TV)
                                              I take leave of you tonight, 
                                              my friends, in that same 
                                              sober but trusting spirit...

           Distracted by the TV, Hillary pulls her hand away from him.

                                 HILLARY
                        You know what this means, don’t 
                        you? House Speaker Carl Albert’s 
                        next in line to be President. Then 
                        President Pro Tempore, Mississippi 
                        Senator James Eastland.
                             (smiles)
                        Both Democrats.

                                 BILL
                             (gives up for now)
                        Then Secretary of State Henry 
                        Kissinger.

                                 HILLARY
                        He’ll never be President.

                                 BILL
                        Because he’s Jewish?

                                 HILLARY
                        Because he was born in Germany. 
                        It’s unconstitutional.
                             (a thought occurs)
                        How do you think Pat Nixon feels 
                        about all this?

                                 BILL
                        The First Lady?

                                 HILLARY
                        Do you know any other Pat Nixon?

                                 BILL
                        Not yet.

           People leave their booths to move to the bar to watch the TV 
           screen. Hillary wants to follow them but can’t.

                                 HILLARY
                        After Eastland, it’s Treasury 
                        Secretary George Shultz. Then 
                        Defense Secretary Schlesinger. 
                        Attorney General Elliot Richardson.
                                 BILL
                        There’s nothing more romantic than 
                        talking about the Presidential 
                        order of succession.

                                 HILLARY
                        Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz.

                                 BILL
                        Lots of assholes, not enough Butz.

                                 HILLARY
                        Are you being funny?

                                 BILL
                        Apparently not. Can we talk about 
                        something more important, like us?

                                 HILLARY
                        Just a second. Then Secretary of 
                        Commerce Frederick Dent and Labor 
                        Secretary Peter Brennan.

                                 BILL
                        No. Interior is before Commerce.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill, don’t correct me. Then it’s 
                        Secretary of Health, Education, and 
                        Welfare Casper Weinberger.

                                 BILL
                        Pills. Books. Food Stamps.

                                 HILLARY
                        Secretary of Housing and Urban 
                        Development James Lynn and 
                        Secretary of Transportation Claude 
                        Brinegar. And that’s it.

                                 BILL
                        Oh thank god.

           Everyone left their dinner to watch the TV because this is 
           Washington. All except Bill and Hillary.

                                 HILLARY
                        When Truman bombed Hiroshima, do 
                        you think he consulted with 
                        Commerce Secretary Henry Wallace or 
                        Interior Secretary Harold Ickes?
                                 BILL
                        Hiroshima sounds good right now.
                             (off her glare)
                        Harold Ickes Junior and I ran 
                        Operation Pursestrings together.
                             (recalls the debauchery)
                        Good times, good times.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who gives a shit about Harold Ickes
                        Junior, Bill? 

                            BILL
                                                         HILLARY
           No need to add tobasco to 
           your language, darlin’. 
                  (off her question)
                                              Do you think Truman talked 
                                              about Hiroshima over with his 
                                              wife Bess?
           Is this what you and Betsey 
           talk about every day?

                                 HILLARY
                        Who do you think has more say in 
                        the Oval Office? First Lady Pat 
                        Nixon or Secretary of Housing and 
                        Urban Development?

                                 BILL
                        For what? Curtains? Rugs?
                             (off her sharp look)
                        Pat Nixon.

                                 HILLARY
                        But she can’t be President 
                        because...

                                 BILL
                             (afraid to say it)
                        She’s a woman?

                                 HILLARY
                        Exactly! Thelma Catherine Patricia 
                        Ryan Nixon is the First Lady. And 
                        Richard Milhous Nixon is the 
                        President. What’s the opposite of 
                        First Lady?

                                 BILL
                        I dunno. Second Lady? Last Lady?
                             (her look: try again)
                        First Man? First Husband?

                                 HILLARY
                        You don’t know because it doesn’t 
                        exist. What’s the female equivalent 
                        of Mr. President?
                                 BILL
                        Mrs. President.

                                 HILLARY
                        Wrong. Mrs. President is someone 
                        who’s married to Mr. President. If 
                        we got married, people will call me 
                        Mrs. Clinton even if I want to be 
                        called Rodham.

                                 BILL
                        About that--

                                 HILLARY
                        Did you know that both Miss and 
                        Mrs. are derived from “Mistress?” 
                        Women need a title that shows we 
                        don’t belong to a man. 

                                 BILL
                        How about Mizz? M-S. Mizz.

                                 HILLARY
                        Like the magazine?

                                 BILL
                        What magazine?

                                 HILLARY
                        The one started by Gloria Steinem. 
                        Ms. It hurts my lips just sayin’
                        it. Do you know any Mizz? Other 
                        than Mizz Gloria Steinem.

                                 BILL
                        Ms. Ferraro. Geraldine Ferraro.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who? Anyway, Miss Rodham’s fine for 
                        now but someday...

           She looks out toward the White House. There’s chaos outside 
           but all she sees is the mansion beyond the gates.

                                 HILLARY
                        You think a woman can be President?

                                 BILL
                        I think you can. You’re what this 
                        country needs. And...
                             (sly grin)
                        There’s nothing I’d love more than 
                        to be under you, Ms. President.
           He stares at her with such intensity and sincerity that she 
           can’t help but believe. And she wants him. Now.

                                 HILLARY
                        Sara’s out of town tonight. And I 
                        baked peach pie.

           Bill plops a five dollar bill on the table. Hillary and Bill 
           hurry out of the booth and head toward the exit.

           INT. HILLARY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A modest home of someone who uses this place primarily to 
           catch her daily 5 hour sleep. We hear scratches and thuds on 
           the front door until it finally opens--

           Bill and Hillary devour each other, moving toward the kitchen 
           until he presses her against the wall. He fumbles with her 
           blouse as she pelts him with kisses all over. Then she sees--

           --her PHONEMATE ANSWERING MACHINE, a ten pound wooden box 
           with reel-to-reel tape. She presses PLAY even as--

           Bill tears off the buttons of her blouse. As he buries his 
           head into her cleavage...

                                 FIRST MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        Hi Hillary, it’s Betsey. I talked 
                        you up to everyone at NWPC.

                                 BILL
                        NWPC?

                                 HILLARY
                             (trying to focus on Bill)
                        National Women’s Political... 
                        something. Not important.

                                 FIRST MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        They want to meet you on Monday. 
                        Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm, 
                        Betty Friedan, and Myrlie Evers. 

                                 BILL
                        The widow of Medgar Evers?

                          HILLARY
                                                   FIRST MESSAGE (V.O.)
           She can wait. I can’t.
                                              Call me as soon as you get 
                                              this.

           Hillary pulls Bill’s shirt off but it’s stuck around his 
           neck. She cannot wait, kisses his chest and stomach.
                                 SECOND MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        I’m not sure if I have the right 
                        number. This is Shelly Lowell. I’m 
                        trying to reach Professor Clinton.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who’s Shelly?

           Bill pulls the shirt off of him, meeting Hillary’s gaze.

                            BILL
           Not important.
                  (off her look)
           The department secretary.
                                                  SECOND MESSAGE (V.O.)
                                              I apologize for calling but 
                                              you told me to contact you at 
                                              this number in case of an 
                                              emergency.

           Bill pulls away from Hillary. The only thing he notices is 
           the answering machine and a peach pie next to it.

                                 SECOND MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        Former Assistant Attorney General 
                        John Doar wants you to call him 
                        right away. He said it’s a matter 
                        of national importance. His home 
                        number is 202-555-8273.

           Hillary blocks his path to the phone. She wants him. Now.

                                 BILL
                        Honey, it’s a matter of national 
                        importance.

           He cuts himself a slice of pie and dials. And as he waits, he 
           takes a bite of the pie and gives a thumbs-up.

                                 BILL
                        This is delicious. Did you make it?
                             (into the phone)
                        Yes, Mr. Doar? This is Bill Clinton 
                        returning your call... Of course, I 
                        remember. You judged the Barrister 
                        Union Prize Trial that Miss Rodham 
                        and I performed at Yale Law.
                             (smiling)
                        Thank you, sir. I was relieved when 
                        the jury acquitted Rick Blaine of 
                        Victor Laszlo’s murder, too.
                             (looks at Hillary)
                        Miss Rodham deserves most of the 
                        credit. I barely did anything... 
                        Yes sir, I’ll pass along the 
                        message next time I bump into her.
           Bill pulls her closer and wraps his hand around her waist. 
           But whatever Bill hears removes his playful mood. Hillary 
           hits SPEAKER on the answering machine to listen.

                                 JOHN DOAR (ON SPEAKER)
                        I’ve been appointed as the chief 
                        counsel for the House Judiciary 
                        Committee’s inquiry for President 
                        Nixon’s impeachment.

           Hillary and Bill look at each other. This is serious.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        I’m forming a legal team and I want 
                        you to be on it.

                                 BILL
                        This is a monumental challenge and 
                        honor. I don’t know what to say.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Say yes. Bill, you are my top 
                        choice from your Yale class. I want 
                        only the best and the brightest. 
                        And that is you.

           Hillary forces a smile, happy for him yet slightly hurt.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        What I’m asking you is to join the 
                        staff that will conduct an 
                        impartial impeachment inquiry of a 
                        sitting President.

                                 BILL
                        I know, sir. But I cannot.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        May I ask why?

           Hillary’s equally shocked. It takes all her self-control not 
           to hit or yell at Bill. This is an opportunity of a lifetime!

                                 BILL
                        Because I plan to run for Congress 
                        in Arkansas’s third district 
                        against John Paul Hammerschmidt.

                          HILLARY
                                                        JOHN DOAR
                  (mouthing, shocked)
                                              Really?
           Really?
                                 BILL
                        I believe Arkansas needs me more 
                        than Washington. Sir.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Good luck, Bill. You were the first 
                        name on my list. So if you ever 
                        change your mind--

                                 BILL
                        Then you’ll be the first to know. 
                        Thank you, sir.

           He hangs up before he could be dissuaded. Hillary’s in shock.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re running for Congress? You 
                        just turned down a chance to be on 
                        the House Judiciary Committee--
                             (stunned)
                        You’re running for Congress? When 
                        the hell were you going to tell me?

                                 BILL
                        I tried at the restaurant!
                             (calms himself)
                        I’m running because I want us to be 
                        together. You’re the most amazing 
                        and brilliant person I’ve ever met 
                        and I’d be a damn fool to lose you.
                             (embraces her in his arms)
                        If I win, I’ll have to move to D.C, 
                        wouldn’t I? And you’ll be sleeping 
                        with a Congressman.

                                 HILLARY
                        You want to be in D.C?

                                 BILL
                        No. I want to be with you. 

           He eyes her with such intensity that she feels naked, 
           vulnerable, and aroused all at once. A seductive, penetrating 
           gaze that makes her want to explode with pent-up desires.

                                 HILLARY
                        I want you.

           She leaps into his arms and wraps her legs around him. As 
           their foreplay becomes more urgent--

           RING. RING.
           He grabs her wrists and pins her against the wall. Feeling so 
           wonderfully submissive to his primal, masculine needs.

                                 OUTGOING MESSAGE (V.O.)
                        You’ve reached Sara Ehrman and 
                        Hillary Rodham. We aren’t in right 
                        now. If you need to reach Hillary, 
                        please leave a message or contact 
                        her at the Children’s Defense Fund. 

           Bill and Hillary kiss each other all over. The answering 
           machine tape rolls for a new message.

                                 JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                        Hello, Miss Rodham. This is John 
                        Doar calling. Perhaps you remember 
                        me from the Barrister Union Prize 
                        Trial at Yale six months ago.

           She withdraws from the kiss, distracted by the call. But Bill 
           pulls her face back in, forcing his lips on her.

                                 JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                        I recently accepted the position of 
                        chief counsel for the House 
                        Judiciary Committee.

           Hillary gets off of Bill’s embrace. She moves to the phone.

                                 BILL
                        Don’t get that.

                                 JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                        After speaking with Professor Burke 
                        Marshall, I decided to add his best 
                        former students to my staff.

           Bill kisses the back of her neck, trying to rekindle the 
           moment. But his touch, so inviting before, sickens her.

                                 HILLARY
                        Don’t... Don’t touch me!

                                 JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                        You’re my top choice for a position 
                        that I’d rather discuss directly... 
                        before I move down my list of 
                        candidates.

           She shields her face from Bill, hiding the hurt that cuts 
           inside. And it cuts deeper with each word. She shudders and 
           shirks away from the once-gentle caress of his fingers.
                                                     JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                            BILL
           Hillary... darling. I’m sure 
           we were both on top of his 
           list. He knows we’re a team.
                                              Please call me at 202-555-
                                              8273. Miss Rodham, you’re the 
                                              first person I’ve contacted. 

           Her face quivers from the sting of the lies.

                                 JOHN DOAR (V.O.)
                        Please call me back as soon as you 
                        can. It’s a matter of national 
                        importance.

           She stares at the phone. CLICK. The call ends. A beat before--

                                 BILL
                        Let’s calm down. I’m certain he--

           She YANKS the phone cord from the wall socket.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not a consolation prize.

           She marches past him to the bathroom and slams the door.

           IN THE BATHROOM

           She turns on the hot faucet on full blast. She leans on the 
           sink and breathes in the steam. KNOCK, KNOCK.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Hillary. Can you come out? Please?

           She stares at the mirror and sees a woman who doesn’t know 
           whether she’s hurt or angry. Or by whom. Bill, John Doar... 
           herself? The steam fogs up the mirror.

           On her side of the counter, cosmetic products of all types to 
           hide her blemishes and to draw out her beauty. Bottles, 
           sprays, scissors, razors, and tweezers to color, style, cut, 
           shave, and pluck every hair on her body. Perfume scents to 
           attract a man. And for what? To be a consolation prize?

           On Sara’s side of the counter, toothpaste and soap. A beat.

           She swipes everything from her counter. Then slumps on the 
           floor, so frustrated by the inequality of it all.

           KNOCK KNOCK. The doorknob rattles. KNOCK KNOCK.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Are you alright? Hillary?
                             (beat)
                        What are you doing? Are you okay?
                                 HILLARY
                        Go away! GO AWAY!
                             (softens, pleading)
                        Please, I just want to be alone.

           And as she buries her head between her knees, DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           An irritated Hillary hurries down the steps of the Capitol 
           and walks toward the Washington monument on the horizon. 

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        Hillary, slow down. Hillary!

           BETSEY WRIGHT, 30, and SARA EHRMAN, 50, catch up with her. 
           Betsey and Sara are her best friends in Washington. But 
           lacking any tangible political future of their own, they seek 
           to ride the Rodham Express as far as it will take them.

                                 BETSEY
                        Don’t you want to wait for Bill?

                                 HILLARY
                        He can burn in Hell. He’s just 
                        using me for the apartment.

                                 SARA
                        But I left town on Friday so--

                                 HILLARY
                        He isn’t even using me for sex!

           Hillary hurries toward the Washington Monument, not caring 
           that a family of tourists heard her. Sara and Betsey avoid 
           the cold stares of the parents and catch up to Hillary.

                                 BETSEY
                        Did you wear the Dici Wonderbra I 
                        bought you?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes. The wires kept pushing my two 
                        small breasts to form one big one.

                                 SARA
                        That’s what men want.

                                 HILLARY
                        They want one big boob right in the 
                        middle, Sara?
           Hillary walks even faster, anger and frustration building 
           with each step. Betsey and Sara practically jog to keep pace. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I thought he wanted to see me. 
                             (re: the Capitol)
                        No, he wanted to see John Little 
                        McClellan and William Fulbright.

                                 SARA
                        Who?

                                 BETSEY
                        Senators from Arkansas. Democrats.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill wants their blessing and their
                        endorsement. But did he want my 
                        blessing? No. No. No! He didn’t 
                        even consult me.

           Hillary grips the arm of Betsey. Tight. It hurts.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m not just a warm body that he 
                        can have his way with. I have 
                        needs, too.

                                 SARA
                        Wait, what are your needs?

           Hillary releases Betsey’s arm. Takes a deep breath. Sighs.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill always said we were a team... 
                        We were in this together.

                                 SARA
                        And you’re not?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t know. I don’t know what we 
                        are any more. He barely comes up to 
                        see me and when he does...
                             (sighs, looks at them)
                        I’m going off the pill. It’s not 
                        worth the money or the trouble.

                                 BETSEY
                        So you two didn’t even have sex?

                                 HILLARY
                        It depends upon what the meaning of 
                        the word “sex” means.
                                 BETSEY
                        You don’t know what sex is?
                             (ignores Hillary’s look)
                        Like Linda Lovelace in Deep Throat.

           She mimes the unzipping of a man’s pants and whipping it out.

                                 HILLARY
                        No. We were about to but he got a 
                        phone call of national importance.

           Hillary’s face tightens. On her quick feet, MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. SOME BUILDING - DAY

           Hillary, Betsey, and Sara step into an elevator. Betsey 
           presses a button to close the door.

                                 HILLARY
                        How can I take the job knowing that 
                        I was the second choice?
                             (itemizes on her fingers)
                        I had better grades than Bill. I 
                        took harder classes than Bill. And 
                        I did 80 percent of the work for 
                        the Barrister Prize. But John Doar 
                        gives Bill all the credit because--

                                 SARA
                        He’s a man?

           This forces Hillary to stop and reflect. She softens.

                                 HILLARY
                        No. That isn’t fair to Bill. 
                        I’m just not as smart as him.

                                 BETSEY
                        Stop it. Now you’re fishing for 
                        compliments.

                                 HILLARY
                        No. He is the most brilliant man 
                        I’ve ever met. Really.
                             (admiring, frustrated)
                        He makes the impossible look easy. 
                        I feel like a Sham running against 
                        Secretariat. It just isn’t fair.

                                 SARA
                        Is that your mind talking or your 
                        heart believing?
           Before Hillary can answer, the door opens to reveal--

           An open office with women working the phones, barking orders, 
           and updating the political maps where women are running for 
           office. This doubles as the National Women’s Political Caucus 
           headquarters and the publishing house of Ms. magazine.

                                 BETSEY
                        You’re no longer a Brownie. You 
                        just graduated to the Girl Scouts.

           ACROSS THE ROOM, SHIRLEY CHISHOLM, 49, talks to a group of 
           campaigners and volunteers.

                                 HILLARY
                        Is that Shirley Chisholm?

                                 BETSEY
                        The first black woman elected to 
                        Congress? Yeah, you’ll meet her.

                                 SARA
                             (her hands close)
                        She came this close to beating 
                        McGovern for the Democratic 
                        Nomination.
                             (widens her hands a bit)
                        But she’s black.
                             (stretches her arms)
                        And a woman.

                                 BETSEY
                        Who do you think we’ll see in the 
                        Oval Office first? A black man or a 
                        white woman?

                                 HILLARY
                        A woman. Definitely a woman.

                                 BETSEY
                        Good. Let’s go.

           Betsey knocks on a door. Without waiting, she opens it to--

           THE CONTROL ROOM

           A think-tank of who’s who of the Feminist movement. GLORIA 
           STEINEM, BETTY FRIEDAN, BELLA ABZUG, and MYRLIE EVERS. They 
           stop their strategy discussion and look toward the door. To 
           an awestruck Hillary, they are Elvis and the Beatles.

                                 BETSEY
                        Hillary, meet everyone. Everyone, 
                        meet Hillary Rodham. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETSEY (CONT'D)
                        The first student commencement 
                        speaker ever at Wellesley.

           Betsey holds up a LIFE magazine with Hillary in it. (While 
           this may not seem much now, it was a huge deal back then.)

                                 BETSEY
                        The first Yale law student featured 
                        in Life magazine. And...

           Sara pops open the Phonemate Answering Machine and replaces 
           the message tape from the one in her pocket. Hillary gasps.

                                 HILLARY
                        Sara! That’s private.

                                 JOHN DOAR (ON TAPE)
                        You’re my top choice for a position 
                        that I’d rather discuss directly... 
                        before I move down my list of 
                        candidates.

                                 GLORIA STEINEM
                        Ms. Ehrman, what is this?

                                                   JOHN DOAR (ON TAPE)
                                              Please call me at 202-555-
                                              8273. Miss Rodham, you’re the 
                                              first person I’ve contacted. 
                            SARA
           Miss Rodham is not only the 
           youngest of the 44 lawyers 
           chosen for the House 
           Judiciary Committee to 
           impeach Richard Nixon but...

                                 SARA
                        But one of only three women.

           Now it’s the feminists who look at Hillary as if she’s the 
           rockstar. Hillary feels overwhelmed yet flattered.

                                 GLORIA STEINEM
                        Is this true, Ms. Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        Sort of. Um, maybe.

                                 GLORIA STEINEM
                        It’s a yes or a no.

                                 HILLARY
                        I haven’t decided yet, Ms. Steinem.

                                 GLORIA STEINEM
                        Yes or no?
                                 HILLARY
                        Yes.
                             (reassuring herself)
                        Yes. YES!

                                 BETTY FRIEDAN
                        Good. Nixon’s an asshole.

           Betsey places her arm around Hillary, partly because she’s 
           proud. Mostly because she wants others to know their bond.

                                 BETSEY
                        Hillary Rodham will be a U.S. 
                        Senator someday.
                             (dramatic)
                        And our first Female President.

           Off Hillary’s forced smile from their adulating looks...

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           By baggage claim, family and friends greet each other with 
           hugs and kisses. By ticket counters, others exchange 
           bittersweet farewells. All around, unapologetic displays of 
           love and affection except...

                                 BILL
                        You’re going to listen to Gloria 
                        Steinem and Betty Friedan over me? 
                        They’re using you for their 
                        feminist agenda, nothing more.

           ...Bill and Hillary in a heated argument as he heads toward 
           his gate. He walks faster than her to avoid her face.

                                 HILLARY
                        No, Bill. I don’t need anyone’s 
                        permission to do what I want. It 
                        was my decision. It’s my life.

                                 BILL
                        I thought you weren’t going to take 
                        Doar’s offer. You said you didn’t 
                        want the impeachment inquiry job.

           He catches himself shouting. He lowers his voice and temper.

                                                          BILL
                          HILLARY
           No. I didn’t want to be the 
           consolation prize. To you.
                                              I think you’re making a 
                                              terrible mistake.
                                                 (off her anger)
                                              Forget it.
           Bill walks off in disgust. She catches up and grabs him.

                                 BILL
                        Go ahead. Plan your entire life 
                        without me... Christ!

                                 HILLARY
                        What, Bill? I need your permission 
                        to live my life? Is that it? But 
                        you can run for Congress without 
                        consulting me, your girlfriend?

           She tests his patience. Yet he forces himself calm.

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s the kind of life-changing 
                        decision we should’ve talked about. 
                        You said we were a team. That was 
                        your promise to me when we started.

                                 BILL
                        That’s not why I came up here.

                                 HILLARY
                        Then why did you?

                                 BILL
                        I came to see you!!

           Others notice them. Some pull down their newspapers with 
           headlines of “Agnew Pleads No Contest” and “Nixon Nominates 
           Gerald Ford for Vacant VP.” Bill pulls her to a corner.

                                 HILLARY
                        Let go! Don’t touch me.

                                 BILL
                        I love you but you drive me up the 
                        wall sometimes.

                                 HILLARY
                        What the hell does that mean?

           He shakes his head in defeat. But then she softens a 
           little... until he can talk to her again.

                                 BILL
                        I meant what I said at the 
                        restaurant. And I meant it when I 
                        asked you at Lake Ennerdale. You 
                        treat it like a joke but I meant it 
                        every time I said it.
                                 HILLARY
                        Meant what? The marriage?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah! I came up this weekend 
                        because I want to marry you. I’m 
                        running for Congress because I want 
                        to be with you. Everything I do, I 
                        do because I love you.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re so full of shit, Bill. 
                        You’ll say anything to put the 
                        blame on me. 

           That does it. He whips out a ring box from his pocket and 
           forces it on her. Hurry up and open it, dammit!

           She opens the box and sees a modest ring. Yet it’s the most 
           beautiful thing she ever laid her eyes on. She’s stunned.

                                 BILL
                        Do you believe me now?
                             (she musters a nod)
                        This isn’t how I wanted to do it 
                        but you leave me no choice.

           He holds her hand. Behind them, the passengers start to board 
           their flight.

                                 BILL
                        Every holiday weekend, every dime I 
                        make, every free moment, I spend 
                        trying to be with you. But...
                             (shakes his head)
                        But you have your whole life 
                        planned. You know exactly what you 
                        want to do and how to do it. And 
                        that’s why you’re so incredible and 
                        why I love you. But...

           Only when he lifts the ring out of the box does Hillary 
           finally look him in the eyes.

                                 BILL
                        But where do I fit in your plans?

           It’s all so sudden. She didn’t prepare for this. A beat.

                                 BILL
                        Do you love me?
                                 HILLARY
                        Yes, I think so. Yes, yes.
                             (convinces herself)
                        Yes, I love you more than I thought 
                        I was ever capable of.

                                 BILL
                        Then marry me.

           He holds the ring an inch away from her finger. Her fingers 
           clench. Yet she is afraid to withdraw her hand from him.

                                 BILL
                        Don’t you want to marry me?

                                 HILLARY
                        I, I don’t know.

           Bill deflates in defeat. He pulls the ring away.

                                 BILL
                        I have a plane to catch.

           He grabs his bag. But she clings to his arm.

                                 HILLARY
                        Don’t go. Let’s talk this over. 
                        Please, Bill. Don’t go. 

                                 BILL
                        Then give me the one answer to make 
                        me stay. Please say yes. I love 
                        you, Hillary. Say you’ll marry me.

           She shakes, unable to speak. Her world crumbles in the most 
           wonderful yet devastating way. Her heart wants to say yes. 
           But her mind calculates the ramifications. She doesn’t know.

                                 BILL
                        I’m not going to ask again.
                             (off her silence)
                        Good-bye, Hillary.

           He frees his arm, grabs the bag, and walks to his gate.

           She stares at him, hoping... praying he’ll turn around. But 
           he doesn’t. He wants to. But how can he when she doesn’t feel 
           the same way about him?

           No, he can’t. He’s making the right decision. He hands the 
           ticket to a flight attendant and boards his flight.

           And just like that, Bill is gone from her life.
           We hold on her. She’s trying to hold it together, aware that 
           others witnessed all of this. On her conflicted face...

           EXT. RODHAM HOUSE IN CHICAGO - DAY

           We stand in front of “The Rodhams” sign on the door before it 
           swings open. HUGH RODHAM, early 60s, notices us.

                                 HUGH RODHAM
                        Hillary! What are you doing here?

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello, Daddy.

           Hillary smiles. She gives her daddy a hug. Judging by how 
           they do it, this is not normal for either of them.

                                 HUGH RODHAM
                        Well, come in, come in.
                             (shouts upstairs)
                        Dottie! Hillary’s home. 

           DOROTHY RODHAM, mid-50s, comes out of her room. Upon seeing 
           Hillary, her face lights up. She hurries down the stairs.

                                 DOROTHY RODHAM
                        Hillary! Oh my baby!

           Dorothy embraces Hillary. Warmer, more natural. Hugh takes 
           Hillary’s bag upstairs.

                                 DOROTHY RODHAM
                        Oh look at you, honey... You must 
                        be tired and hungry.

           Hillary nods, holding her smile as she watches her father 
           climb up the steps. Then she looks at her mother.

           Her mother’s smile fades. She knows something’s wrong.

           Yet Hillary keeps up her smile. Holding it until Hugh carries 
           her bag into her old room and disappears.

                                 DOROTHY RODHAM
                        What’s wrong, dear?

           Hillary struggles to keep the facade of a strong woman. But 
           it’s her mom. And moms always know.

           Dorothy’s eyes water, hurting for her daughter.

           Hillary weeps. She promised herself she wouldn’t. But she 
           can’t help it.
                                 DOROTHY RODHAM
                        Oh Hillary.

           Dorothy pulls Hillary into her embrace, holding her daughter 
           as she has always done. Hillary sobs shamelessly as Dorothy 
           holds her baby girl. 

           We pull away from the Rodham house to find American flags on 
           neighborhood lawns and yellow ribbons tied around oak trees 
           to honor their loved ones in Vietnam. And on that...

           CUE “Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree” as...

           A SERIES OF IMAGES AND NEWS FOOTAGES

           - US Air Force unleash bombs in North Vietnam.

           And as political unrest escalates, the song fades away.

           INT. CHILDREN’S DEFENSE FUND - DAY

                                 MARIAN (O.S.)
                        How comfortable are you with the 
                        fund-raising process?

                                 FEMALE INTERVIEWEE (O.S.)
                        I organized a campaign dinner for 
                        Senator Muskie last year. Five 
                        hundred dollars a plate.
           Hillary approaches Marian’s open office. She takes a deep 
           breath to work up the courage...

                                 MARIAN (O.S.)
                        Five hundred?! And how do you feel 
                        about raising money for children?

                                 FEMALE INTERVIEWEE (O.S.)
                        I serve on the education boards of 
                        my daughters’ school. 

           Hillary KNOCKS and enters, interrupting Marian’s interview 
           with a 36 year-old woman who has the air of calmness and self-
           assurance without a hint of arrogance or entitlement.

                                 FEMALE INTERVIEWEE
                        You must be the woman whose job I’m 
                        hoping to taking over.

           Confused and a bit surprised, Hillary turn to Marian.

                                 MARIAN
                        John Doar called me yesterday.
                             (forcing a smile)
                        Congratulations. It’s a great 
                        honor... I’m sorry. This is Dr. 
                        Madeleine Albright. Dr. Albright--

           DR. MADELEINE ALBRIGHT extends her hand toward Hillary.

                                 DR. ALBRIGHT
                        Hillary Rodham, right? I was at 
                        Wellesley for your Class of ‘69 
                        commencement speech.
                             (shaking hands)
                        My class reunion. Class of ‘59.

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s a pleasure to meet you, Dr. 
                        Albright.

                                 MARIAN
                        I assumed you would take Doar’s 
                        offer so I made a few calls.

                                 HILLARY
                        I, I don’t know. I wasn’t Doar’s 
                        first choice.

           Marian and Albright exchange a look. Then a subtle nod.

                                 MARIAN
                        Do you think I am anyone’s first 
                        choice?
                                 DR. ALBRIGHT
                        Life’s not about being the first 
                        choice. Prove to him and everyone 
                        else that you are the best choice.

           Dr. Albright’s conviction forces Hillary to nod. She doesn’t 
           even realize it at first. But then Hillary fully agrees.

           Marian slides Hillary’s church mug into view. She then puts 
           it in her top drawer.

                                 MARIAN
                        As long as your mug’s here, you’ll 
                        always have a job at the Children’s 
                        Defense Fund.

                                 HILLARY
                        Thank you, Marian.

           Marian extends her hand for a good-bye. But that doesn’t feel 
           adequate. So she gets up and gives Hillary a hug.

                                 MARIAN
                        Make us proud. And never lose sight 
                        of why you came to Washington.

           Hillary nods as Marian’s words slowly sink in.

           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL - DAY

           The Capital police guard THE CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL within the 
           campus that holds the House Office Buildings.

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL - DAY

           The police and the FBI have overtaken the entire lobby. They 
           check everyone entering and leaving the hotel.

           BERNARD NUSSBAUM, late 30s, enters one of two checkpoints 
           where an FBI AGENT gesture him to open his bags.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Do you have any cameras or 
                        recording devices?

                                 BERNARD NUSSBAUM
                        No. Do you?

           Unamused, the FBI agent yanks the newspaper tucked under 
           Nussbaum’s arm. As the agent flips through the pages...
                                 BERNARD NUSSBAUM
                        It’s just a newspaper.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        I’ll be the judge of that.

           ...we linger on the headline of “SATURDAY NIGHT MASSACRE: 
           Nixon fires independent prosecutor Cox; Atty General 
           Richardson and his deputy resign in protest.”

                                 BERNARD NUSSBAUM
                        I can keep my clothes on, right?

           The FBI Agent shoots him a look before returning his 
           belongings. Nussbaum enters the elevator lobby as...

           ...Hillary enters the checkpoint. The FBI Agent blocks her 
           path because she must be at the wrong place.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Miss, this is a restricted area.

                                 HILLARY
                        I should hope so.

           Hillary hands over a purse to a policeman. But he doesn’t 
           bother to check it because she’s clearly in the wrong place.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Who are you here to see?

                                 HILLARY
                        John Doar. I’m on his legal 
                        committee. Hillary Diane Rodham.

           The FBI Agent looks at his list of names. A beat before he 
           gestures the policeman to check her purse.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Can I see some identification?

           She pulls out her Illinois driver license. The woman in the 
           photo is hidden behind a hideous hair style and coke-bottle 
           glasses. The FBI Agent doesn’t see the resemblance yet.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Um, do you have another form of ID?

           Frustrated, Hillary grabs her purse from a policeman and 
           pulls out her hideous glasses. She puts it on and then 
           ruffles her hair to turn into that awkward woman once again.
                                 FBI AGENT
                             (stifling a smirk)
                        Have a nice day, Miss Rodham.

           The FBI agent allows her through. More lawyers, all male and 
           older than Hillary, enter the building for their new job.

                                 JOHN DOAR (PRE-LAP)
                        The last time Congress tried to 
                        impeach a sitting President was in 
                        1868 against Andrew Johnson for his 
                        attempt to remove Secretary of 
                        State Edwin Stanton from the 
                        Cabinet. 

           INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           JOHN DOAR, 50, tall, lean, and fit, stands next to two 
           CONGRESSMEN in their early sixties. They face over forty 
           lawyers, from late 20s to mid-40s. These lawyers are the 
           brightest minds from the best schools and they know it.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Congress had no legal precedent for 
                        impeachment except for a poorly 
                        worded Office of the Tenure Act 
                        that Supreme Court later ruled as 
                        unconstitutional.

           As Doar talks, we pan across the faces of each lawyer, 
           ambitious and sizing up each other already.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                             (in Hillary’s direction)
                        What we endeavor to do is to create 
                        a formal and fair legal process.
                             (re: the two Congressmen)
                        Democratic Congressman Peter Rodino 
                        and Republican Congressman Edward 
                        Hutchinson of the House Judiciary 
                        Committee oversaw the formation of 
                        this assembly.

           John Doar moves toward the front row where the older lawyers, 
           including Bernard Nussbaum, are seated.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        I have only three rules. First, 
                        check your ideology and politics at 
                        the door. I don’t care if you voted 
                        for Nixon or McGovern. I don’t even 
                        care if you didn’t vote. We will 
                        focus only on facts and the law. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN DOAR (CONT'D)
                             (pacing the room)
                        Second, outside of this hotel, you 
                        will keep your mouth shut. That 
                        means no talking to reporters, 
                        friends, families, or wives.
                             (noticing a female lawyer)
                        Or husbands.

           He pulls out a set of index cards and taps them on his arm.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        No document shall leave this hotel. 
                        At the end of each day, you will 
                        put your findings into these index 
                        cards. One fact per index card. No 
                        more, no less.

           A few lawyers look at each other. Is he serious?

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Third, we will respect the office 
                        of the Presidency. Richard Nixon is 
                        our current President and will be 
                        addressed only as President Nixon, 
                        Mr. Nixon, or Mr. President. Any 
                        objections?

           He walks over to a board that shows an organizational chart: 
           Congressmen Rodino and Hutchinson are heads of the House 
           Judiciary Committee to Impeach the President. Below them is 
           John Doar. And below him are SIX SENIOR STAFFERS who each 
           must manage SIX LAWYERS. In total, 43 lawyers.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        You will be paired up. One Democrat 
                        and one Republican. You will check 
                        and proof each other’s work to 
                        ensure objectivity and fairness.

           John Doar points to three large ovals where most of the names 
           are placed, including Hillary’s in the second oval.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        First group will conduct 
                        constitutional and legal research. 
                        Your job is not only to look back 
                        at past impeachments but also 
                        executive privilege. But executive 
                        privilege does not mean that any 
                        one man, even the President, is 
                        above the law.

           Off Doar’s nod, Congressman Rodino flips over the chart to 
           reveal a new one with NIXON at the center. 
           Lines connect him with various individuals of CREEP 
           (Committee to Re-Elect the President) and ODESSA 
           (Organization Directed to Eliminate the Subversion of the 
           Secrets of the Administration).

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        The other teams will investigate 
                        the Watergate Hotel break-in and...
                        The “plumbers.” Nixon’s men from 
                        CREEP and ODESSA who were hired to 
                        plug the White House leaks.

           On this new chart, photos are labeled with names like CHARLES 
           COLSON, G. GORDON LIDDY, E. HOWARD HUNT. Solid lines link 
           them to White House staffers H.R. HALDEMAN, JOHN ERHLICHMAN, 
           and JOHN DEAN. Dotted lines connect them to the CIA, RAND, 
           the Pentagon, and Miami. This is impossibly complicated.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        And we’ll track the emoluments. Any 
                        questions?

           Hillary stares at the chart. Like others, she has a million 
           questions. But she dares not ask. However, one of two other 
           women in the room does. 

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Yes. Sorry, I forget your name.

                                 FEMALE LAWYER
                        Terry Kirkpatrick from University 
                        of Arkansas. What’s an emolument?

           A few men snicker and look at each other. Of course. A woman 
           from the backwoods state school.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Compensation. Pay. Stipend. Perks. 
                        We’ll follow the money trail. Any 
                        other questions?

                                 FEMALE LAWYER
                        Yes. Just one more. Are we supposed 
                        to use fancy Ivy League legalese 
                        all the time or can we speak in 
                        plain ole American?

           The room explodes with laughter. Even the stoic John Doar 
           exchanges a chuckle with the Congressmen. More importantly, 
           Hillary notices how this lady won over the room with her 
           effortless Southern charm. Good to know.
           INT. HOTEL - DAY

           Hillary walks through the hallway where mattresses and bed 
           frames lean on the walls. She enters--

           A HOTEL ROOM

           Converted to an office with two desks, whiteboards, and 
           stacks of books and files. She plops her bags on the desk 
           with a view of the Capitol Hill. As she is about to sit...

                                 WELD (O.S.)
                        I’ll arm-wrestle you for it.

           WILLIAM WELD, 28, enters. Golden hair, dashing good looks, 
           and tall and muscular frame. He won the genetic lottery.

                                 WELD
                        Maybe paper-scissor-rock?

           He flashes his playful smile. As he extends his arm...

                                 WELD
                        Hi. I’m William Weld.

           ...she whips out her arm with a “rock” fist when he was 
           merely offering a handshake (which looks like “paper”). 

                                 HILLARY
                             (embarrassed, one-upped)
                        I’m Hillary Rodham.

           They shake hands. He sets his bags on the second desk.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

           Nussbaum and two policemen, each carrying boxes, enter. The 
           policemen set theirs down and leave. Nussbaum waits until 
           they are fully gone before relaxing a bit.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        I’m Bernard Nussbaum. Not only will 
                        I be overseeing your efforts but I 
                        also brought over a few presents.

           Nussbaum pulls out a Sony TC-800B recorder from his box. Then 
           pops a reel tape into it.

                                 HILLARY
                        What is this?

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        You’ll see.
           Nussbaum presses PLAY. The reel rolls and...

                                 JOHN DEAN (AUDIO)
                        The resources that have been put 
                        against this whole investigation to 
                        date are really incredible. 

                                                    JOHN DEAN (AUDIO)
                           WELD 
           My god? Is that White House 
           Counsel John Dean?
                                              It’s truly a larger 
                                              investigation than was 
                                              conducted against the after 
                                              inquiry of the JFK 
                                              assassination.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        It gets better.

                                 H.R. HALDERMAN (AUDIO)
                        Isn’t that ridiculous though?

                                 JOHN DEAN (AUDIO)
                        What is?

                                                  H.R. HALDERMAN (AUDIO)
                                              This silly ass damn thing.
                          HILLARY
           And that’s White House Chief 
           of Staff H.R. Haldeman.

           Weld opens the second box. More tapes.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Former White House Chief of Staff 
                        Haldeman and Former White House 
                        Counsel.

                                 THIRD VOICE (AUDIO)
                        Yeah.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who was that?

           Nussbaum grins. It can’t be... can it?

                                 H.R. HALDERMAN (AUDIO)
                        That kind of resources against--

                                                      WELD/HILLARY
                    THIRD VOICE (AUDIO)
           Yeah. For Christ’s sake!
                                              Nixon.

           Weld and Hillary tear open the third box. More tapes, each 
           carefully marked. And a letter from Congress.
                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Special Prosecutor Jaworski fought 
                        hard for these tapes. Let’s hope 
                        they are worth the bloodshed.

                                 RICHARD NIXON (AUDIO)
                        Goldwater put it in context, he 
                        said "Well, for Christ's sake, 
                        everybody bugs everybody else." We 
                        know that.

                                                  H.R. HALDERMAN (AUDIO)
                                              Yeah.  I bugged--
                          NUSSBAUM
           Transcribe these tapes. Don’t 
           screw up. It’s only the fate 
           of the Presidency at stake.

                                 RICHARD NIXON (AUDIO)
                        Well, it's true.  It happens to be 
                        totally true.

           Nussbaum stifles his wry grin and walks out.

                                 WELD
                        Goddamn, we’re going to bring down 
                        the President.

           Hillary grabs a pen and index cards as the tape continues.

                                 RICHARD NIXON (AUDIO)
                        We were bugged in ‘68 on the plane 
                        and bugged in ‘62, uh, even running 
                        for Governor. God damnedest thing 
                        you ever saw.

           Weld rewinds the tape to start from the very beginning. 
           Hillary and Weld share a look, a spark between two ambitious 
           lawyers who are about to make history.

           INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - NIGHT

           Sara enters the near empty diner and spots Hillary and Betsey 
           at the counter. Sara holds some mail and magazines, including 
           an envelope from the D.C. Bar Association.

                                 SARA
                        Here’s your mail for this week. 
                             (re: the D.C. bar one)
                        Congratulations, HDR. You’re 
                        officially one of them now.

           Betsey peeks and sees the envelope. Ho-hum, another accolade 
           for Hillary. Sara hands over the mail and then wedges herself 
           in Betsey’s stool, forcing Betsey to slide one stool over.
                                 SARA
                        What did I miss?

                                 BETSEY
                        Nothin’. The Rod’s more tight-
                        lipped than the Rosenbergs.

                                 SARA
                        Give us something, Hill. Anything.

                                 HILLARY
                        I can’t. It’s all top secret. A 
                        matter of national security.

                                 BETSEY
                        She’s been spendin’ all her time 
                        with William Weld.

                          HILLARY
           Betsey! We just work together-
                                                          SARA
                                              William Weld as in the Welds 
                                              of Boston? They’re the 
                                              Protestant Kennedys!

                                 BETSEY
                             (laughing)
                        Kennedy without the Pope.

                                 SARA
                        So... Is he cute?

                          HILLARY
                                                         BETSEY
           Sara!
                                              Look! She’s blushing.

           Hillary hides her face behind the stack of mail. Meanwhile, 
           Betsey pulls out a notepad with a chart that looks like this:

                                  WELD
                                                      CLINTON

                                  Harvard              Georgetown
           Money:             Filthy Rich          Dirt Poor
           Undergrad:
           Masters:           Oxford               Oxford (dropped out)
           Law School:        Harvard              Yale
           Home:              Boston               Arkansas
           First Name:        William              William
           Middle Name:       Floyd                Jefferson
           Party:             Republican           Democrat

                                 BETSEY
                        Money?...

           Hillary flips through her mail, delaying opening the DC Bar 
           one. Time cover of a somber Nixon with the caption of “THE 
           PUSH TO IMPEACH.” Newsweek cover is of Ford and Nixon with 
           the caption of “AFTER AGNEW.” And...
           ...the first issue of Ms. of cartoon and caption of “WONDER 
           WOMAN FOR PRESIDENT.” A handwritten note of “Ms. Rodham, you 
           are a superhero for women. - Ms. Steinem.”

                                 BETSEY
                             (moving down the list)
                        Weld. Weld. Weld.

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        Bill is a Rhodes scholar though.

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        Big fuckin’ deal. Rhodes doesn’t 
                        accept women.

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        Neither does Harvard.

           Finally, the DC Bar Association. Hillary takes a breath and 
           tears it open. And she finds...

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        Fine. A tie then. Fair?
                             (next item)
                        Boston or the Ozarks. Birthplace of 
                        the American Revolution or the 
                        birthplace of moonshine?

           ...a letter informing her that she failed the D.C. bar exam. 
           Hillary is shocked. This must be a mistake. Has to be!

           Betsey tears off the sheet and hands it to Hillary who 
           quickly buries the rejection letter and recovers.

                                 BETSEY
                        The voting’s unanimous. Weld would 
                        be a much better First Lady.

           Her friends have checked Weld’s name on nearly everything.

                                 HILLARY
                        You two are ridiculous.

           Hillary folds up the list inside her bar exam rejection 
           letter. She shoves her mail into her purse and gets up. 

                                 BETSEY
                        Let’s hit up a few D.C. bars since 
                        you passed the big one.

                                 HILLARY
                        Sorry. I have to go back to work.
                                 BETSEY
                        Oh, I see. Running off to see your 
                        new boyfriend.

                                 SARA
                        Ask William Weld if he’s Ryan 
                        O’Neal from Love Story!

           Hillary shoots her a look before heading toward the exit.

           EXT. HOUSE OFFICE BUILDINGS CAMPUS - DAY

           Hillary and Weld, each carrying boxes, walk a few paces 
           behind Doar, Nussbaum, and JOE WOODS as they approach the 
           Congressional Hotel. In fact, they’re far enough back from 
           the senior lawyers to carry their own private conversation.

                                 HILLARY
                        Just admit that you’re Oliver 
                        Barrett in Love Story.

                                 WELD
                        I refuse to dignify that remark. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Barrett Hall in Harvard Yard. Weld 
                        Hall in Harvard Yard. C’mon.
                             (semi-quoting the movie)
                        Yeah, you’re the guy that owns Weld 
                        Hall.

           Ahead of them, the Capital police push journalists from the 
           curb to allow the Doar lawyers to enter the hotel.

                                 WELD
                             (playing along)
                        I don’t own Weld Hall. My great 
                        grandfather happened to give it to 
                        Harvard.

                                 HILLARY
                        Let me ask you this. When they 
                        filmed Love Story, what building 
                        did they use for Barrett Hall?

                                 WELD
                        Weld Hall.
                             (off her victorious grin)
                        Tell ya what. We’ll go see it next 
                        weekend and I’ll prove to you scene 
                        by scene how I’m not Ryan O’Neal. 
                                 HILLARY
                        Deal. My friends think your family 
                        came over on the Mayflower.

                                 WELD
                        Actually, they sent the servants 
                        over on the Mayflower to get the 
                        cottage ready.

           The journalists push their way to John Doar and his lawyers.

                                                     JOURNALIST TWO
                       JOURNALIST ONE
           Can you tell us what’s on the 
           Watergate tapes?
                                              When can we expect Nixon’s 
                                              impeachment?

                                 WOODWARD (O.S.)
                        Mr. Doar, can you tell us more 
                        about the missing minutes on the 
                        Watergate tapes?

           BOB WOODWARD pushes himself in their path, cutting in front 
           of Hillary and Weld as if they don’t exist.

                                 DOAR
                        Your source is misinformed, Bob. 
                        There are no missing minutes.

           Doar hurries toward the building. Woodward keeps pace, now 
           facing Joe Woods who walks ahead of Hillary and Weld.

                                 WOODWARD
                        So you buy the White House excuse 
                        that Nixon’s personal secretary 
                        accidentally deleted them.
                             (to Joe Woods)
                        Isn’t it a conflict of interest 
                        that you’re the brother to Nixon’s 
                        secretary and on this committee?

                                 JOE WOODS
                        You have the wrong Joe Woods.

                                 WOODWARD
                             (mutters, writes on pad)
                        Senior Counsel Joseph A. Woods, Jr. 
                        affirmed that he is indeed not Joe 
                        Woods of the FBI and the brother of 
                        Rose Mary Woods.

                                 BERNARD NUSSBAUM
                        Fuck off, Woodward.
                                 WOODWARD
                             (mutters to annoy them)
                        Bernard Nussbaum, who served in the 
                        Justice Department under Kennedy, 
                        just told this Washington Post 
                        reporter to fuck off.
                             (approaches Hillary)
                        How does it feel to be the Jill 
                        Wine Volner of the Impeachment 
                        Inquiry Committee...
                             (a stab in the dark)
                        Miss Terry Kirkpatrick?
                             (off Hillary’s grin)
                        Who are you then? Give me a clue. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Get a Life, Bob.

           Hillary and Weld follow their bosses into the building.

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

           Sequestered from the media circus outside, Doar twitches his 
           lips. That’s about as much display of anger he will show. He 
           now notices that Hillary is wearing a skirt. 

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Miss Rodham, you’ll wear suitpants
                        from now on. I will not have the 
                        press mistake you for Miss Volner.

           Doar grabs the box from Hillary’s hands and walks off.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Don’t worry. You’re nothing like 
                        Jill Wine Volner.

           That... was not a compliment. Hillary looks at her outfit. 
           From this day forward, she will always wear suitpants.

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Weld and Hillary tack index cards on the wall that serves as 
           a Watergate timeline from June 17, 1972, the date of the 
           Break-In and Arrest of five men associated with CREEP. 
           Meanwhile, Nixon’s private recording plays in the background.

           Weld tacks an index card labeled “Tape 162” above the 
           timeline date of 8/30/72.
                                 HILLARY
                        That’s not right, Will. Halderman 
                        mentions indictments against Hunt 
                        and Liddy.

                                 WELD
                        Oh, you’re right.

           Weld re-tacks the card above “9/15/72,” the indictment date 
           of the five “WH Plumber”: James W. McCord, Frank Sturgis, 
           Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez and Virgilio Gonzalez.

           Hillary tacks an index card of “TAPE 251” between 1/11/73 
           (when Howard Hunt pleads guilty) and 1/15/73 (Barker, 
           Gonzalez, Martinez and Sturgis plead guilty). 

           She stares at the length of the timeline with lots of Time
           covers of Nixon and index cards. She shakes her head.

                                 HILLARY
                        Our job would be so much easier if 
                        Woodstein told us who Deep Throat 
                        is.

                                 WELD
                        If Woodstein told us who Deep 
                        Throat is, we’d be out of jobs.

           Weld tacks another index card above “1/30/73” when Nixon 
           aides Gordon Liddy and McCord are convicted of conspiracy, 
           burglary, and wiretapping. Staring at the timeline...

                                 WELD
                        It’s like clockwork when a Nixon 
                        aide gets arrested, fired, or is 
                        forced to resign.

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        How do you mean?

                                 WELD
                        Two days after Woodward and 
                        Bernstein drop a new bombshell or 
                        when Nixon makes the cover of Time, 
                        someone always takes the fall.
                             (re: names from timeline)
                        White House Counsels John Dean and 
                        Ehrlichman. White House Chief of 
                        Staff Haldeman. Attorney General 
                        John Mitchell. Vice President Spiro 
                        Agnew. 
                             (re: 10/20/73)
                        And the Saturday Night Massacre. 
           He turns and notices Hillary holding index cards an inch from 
           her face. That’s how she reads without glasses.

                                 HILLARY
                        We should ask Peter Rodino or Tip 
                        O’Neill to re-subpoena Nixon for 
                        the missing 18 and a half minutes.

                                 WELD (O.S.)
                        We should get you glasses.

           Weld has been watching her the entire time. A beat. She pulls 
           out her glasses from her purse. She hesitates before she puts 
           them on. He bursts into laughter.

                                 WELD
                        They’re hideous!

           Weld approaches her, pulls the Coke-bottle glasses off her 
           face, and puts them on his face.

                                 WELD
                        How do I look?

                                 HILLARY
                        Like a cross-eyed Ryan O’Neal. How 
                        do I look?

                                 WELD
                        Like a Monet painting.
                             (pulls off the glasses)
                        I think I have vertigo.

           They laugh, each person’s chuckle filling the silence. Their 
           laughs die but their gaze remains fixed. A tense beat.

                                 HILLARY
                             (suddenly uncomfortable)
                        I’m going to get coffee. Want any--

                                 WELD
                        No. I’m, I’m good. I should 
                        transcribe tape 472 anyway.

           Weld withdraws to the box of tapes. Hillary hurries out--

           INT. HOTEL - DAY

           --to the hallway. She fidgets and folds her arms to stifle 
           her sudden nervousness. She walks down the hallway until--
           INT. REFRESHMENT ROOM - DAY

           A hotel room converted into a kitchen. Tables laid out with 
           donuts, fruits, and sandwiches. And Terry Kirkpatrick waits 
           by the coffee machine that pours a fresh brew.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hey, Terry. You’re from University 
                        of Arkansas in Fayetteville?

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        And you’re from Yale in New Haven.

           Hillary forces a smile to ease her lingering nervous energy.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re just the second person I’ve 
                        met from Arkansas.
                             (”sudden” thought)
                        Maybe you know him. He’s a 
                        professor there.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        I doubt it. It’s a big school.

           The coffee pot is now full. Terry lays out four empty cups.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill Clinton.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Professor Clinton?
                             (smiling fondly)
                        Yeah, he’s quite the ladies man.

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh really?

           Terry fills each cup with coffee and sugar. Her smile linger.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Of course! The first thing he tells 
                        you is Hope grows the world’s 
                        biggest watermelons. Next he tells 
                        you he’ll be President someday. 

           President? Bill never told her this.

                                 HILLARY
                        Small world.
                             (off Terry’s nod)

                        I noticed you get The Arkansas 
                        Traveler and The Democrat delivered 
                        here. Do you mind if I look through 
                        them when you’re done?

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Oh, why?

                                 HILLARY
                        I like the Razorbacks.
                             (changing topic)
                        Are you going to drink all that?

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        No but Mr. Jenner and Mr. Cates
                        wanted coffee.

                                 HILLARY
                        Making coffee’s not your job.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        I don’t mind.

                                 HILLARY
                        But I do.

           Hillary yanks the coffee pot from Terry and puts it back. She 
           whips out an index card and writes something. Then she sets 
           the index card on the coffee machine. It reads:

                          WOMEN WERE NOT HIRED TO MAKE COFFEE!!!!!

           Hillary smiles proudly. But Terry shakes her head.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        We can’t all be Hillary Rodham.

                                 HILLARY
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Not everyone appears in Life
                        magazine out of college or gets 
                        mentored by Gloria Steinem and 
                        Betty Friedan.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re being ridiculous.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Am I? You delivered the Wellesley 
                        commencement speech. I deliver 
                        coffee to the senior counsel and 
                        type up their notes.

                             (not jealous or bitter)
                        Mr. Doar trusts you with the 
                        Watergate tapes. I know my place. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You should never think that way.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        But I do. And you don’t. That’s why 
                        you’re Hillary Rodham and I’m not.

           Angered yet flattered, Hillary hurries out of the room.

           She storms down the hallway and KNOCKS on a door.

                                 JOHN DOAR (O.S.)
                        Come in.

           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hillary marches in and finds John Doar looking through stacks 
           of Congressional folders. 

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Done with the tapes, Miss Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        No. Almost.

           Noticing Hillary’s firm posture, Doar sets down his pen.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        What’s on your mind?

                                 HILLARY
                        When you offered Bill Clinton the 
                        associate counsel role, did you 
                        know that he called you from my 
                        apartment?

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        No.

                                 HILLARY
                        I know Bill was your top choice. 
                        But I will work harder, I will work 
                        smarter than everyone else to prove 
                        to you that I was your best choice.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Your relationship with Bill--
                                 HILLARY
                        We don’t have a relationship.

           John Doar takes a moment to soak all this in. A beat.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        You feel you can handle the 
                        workload, Miss Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        I know I can.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Good.
                             (re: his pile)
                        Go through this. And join Nussbaum, 
                        Woods, and me for coffee tomorrow 
                        at seven sharp.

           Hillary stares at the stack. She wasn’t prepare for this.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Is that fair, Miss Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        I won’t make you coffee.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        That’s not why I chose you.

           EXT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL - NIGHT

           As “CHELSEA MORNING” (Bill and Hillary’s song) plays...

           We move from window to window. All dark and empty except a 
           ROOM where Woods and Nussbaum are in a heated discussion. 

           And THE NEXT ROOM where John Doar and Peter Rodino type up 
           some memo with Congressman Rodino’s letterhead. Then--

           HILLARY’S OFFICE. She pores over the Congressional files. 
           They are boring as shit, especially after midnight. She takes 
           a break to flip through The Arkansas Democrat until--

           A small blurb about a University of Arkansas law professor 
           announcing a run against incumbent John Paul Hammerschmidt. 
           The article doesn’t mention the Democratic challenger’s name.

           She cuts the article, puts it in a box with other clippings 
           and photos of Bill, and buries the box in her desk drawer.
           EXT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL - MORNING

           A rooftop view as the sun rises. We see all the famous 
           landmarks from here, including the Capitol a block away. 

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Weld finds Hillary asleep on her desk, her head pressed 
           against a newspaper. He nudges her. Then shakes her.

                                 WELD
                        Wake up, Yalie.

           She stirs awake. She pulls the newspaper off her face. Half 
           of the article about Clinton is smeared on her cheek.

                                 HILLARY
                             (re: a Watergate tape)
                        Ben Stein’s voice put me to sleep.

                            WELD
                                                         HILLARY
                  (wiping his own face)
                                                 (wiping her drool)
           You got some...
                                              What time is it?

                                 WELD
                        Ten minutes to seven.

                                 HILLARY
                        Shit, shit, shit!

           Hillary starts to unbutton her blouse. Then stops herself.

                                 HILLARY
                        Turn around.

           Weld turns and stares at her reflection on the room mirror 
           until he’s met by her icy glare. He shuts his eyes.

           Hillary grabs a dry-cleaned suit from the closet. But as she 
           removes her clothes, she looks up to find him grinning. 

           Now fully changed, she grabs the Congressional folders and 
           heads for the door. But Weld grabs her arm.

                          HILLARY
                                                          WELD
           I’m late for a meeting.
                                              Hold on. Your face.

           Weld licks his fingers and wipes the ink off her face. She 
           catches her reflection in the mirror.

           Hillary hurries into the bathroom, comes back out with a wet 
           towel, and wipes her face as she runs out. Weld smiles. She’s 
           so charming in her own crazy way.
           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Doar, Nussbaum, Woods, and Hillary sit around a coffee table. 
           Hillary nurses her fifth coffee cup to stay alert. Doar knows 
           how overextended she is. But he either doesn’t care or wants 
           to push her to her breaking point.

                                 DOAR
                        Bernie is drafting a memo outlining 
                        the procedures for impeaching a 
                        President.
                             (re: Joe Woods)
                        And Joe is listing the standards of 
                        evidence required to trigger an 
                        impeachment.
                             (re: Hillary)
                        Gentlemen, Miss Rodham feels that 
                        we haven’t given her enough work. 

           Nussbaum and Woods smile like drill sergeants on the first 
           day of boot camp. 

           EXT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BUILDING - DAY

           Doar marches a few steps ahead of Hillary who wears heels and 
           carries two boxes. If she hastens her pace, he does, too. 

                                 JOHN DOAR
                             (rapid, quizzing her)
                        Who was the first federal official 
                        impeached?

                                 HILLARY
                        William Blount, US Senator. 1799.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Who was the first impeached 
                        official removed from office?

                                 HILLARY
                        New Hampshire Judge John Pickering.
                             (gasping, buying time)
                        Removed on March 12, 1804.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Wear shoes next time.

           John Doar climbs up the granite steps. Hillary keeps up.

                                 HILLARY
                        You told me to dress more feminine.
                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Feminine yes. Feminist no. Can you 
                        handle that, Miss Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes. Can you?

           Doar stops dead in his tracks. Off her smile, he finally 
           cracks a grin. He grabs one box from her.

                                 HILLARY
                        Where are we going?

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        You’ll see.

           INT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS CORRIDOR - DAY

           Doar and Hillary walk through a claustrophobic hallway where 
           each room feels like a medieval jail cell.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        When was President Andrew Johnson 
                        impeached?

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s a trick question. First 
                        attempt was made on November 21, 
                        1867. But the measure failed 57 to 
                        108. And the second attempt--

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Okay, okay. Shut up, Rodham. You 
                        know your impeachment history.

           INT. RESEARCH ROOM - DAY

           A dozen researchers, including Yale Professor VANN WOODWARD, 
           look up and stare at Doar and Hillary by the entrance.

                                 HILLARY
                        Professor Woodward?

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Good. You know each other.
                             (to Vann Woodward)
                        Hillary Rodham was recommended by 
                        your colleague Burke Marshall.
                             (to Hillary)
                        Vann Woodward was recommended by 
                        Professor Burke Marshall.
                                 WOODWARD
                        Nice to see you again, Hillary.

           Off Hillary’s confusion, Woodward looks toward Doar who nods.

                                 WOODWARD
                        Mr. Rodino authorized a report that 
                        will detail the responses of all 36 
                        presidents to charges of misconduct 
                        including accusations of high crime 
                        and misdemeanors. From George 
                        Washington to Lyndon Johnson.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        You will be the liaison between 
                        Professor Woodward and myself. Any 
                        questions, Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes. What is this for?

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        We’re building a case in the event 
                        of a stalemate between Congress and 
                        the White House.
                             (off her look)
                        We will take this to the Supreme 
                        Court.

           Finally, she is overwhelmed by the historical weight of the 
           impeachment. But she nods to accept the Atlas task.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

           The Doar lawyers gather around a TV to watch the evening 
           news. (An actual clip or something like below)

                                 NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV)
                        While President Nixon fights for 
                        his political life at home, 
                        Secretary of State Kissinger has 
                        mediated a cease-fire between the 
                        Israelis and the Arab Coalition in 
                        the Middle East...

           The lawyers break into a cheer, toasting each other with beer 
           bottles. Weld looks around for a familiar face as...

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           ...Hillary scribbles on an index card, one of hundreds that 
           she has done. And she has several hundred more to go.
                                 WELD (O.S.)
                        Let’s have a drink. Kissinger just 
                        ended the October War. 

                                 HILLARY
                        You go ahead, Will. I still have 
                        some work left.

           Weld pulls a flat, wrapped present from his desk drawer.

                                 WELD
                        First, you stood me up for Love 
                        Story. Now you’re standing me up 
                        for a drink. What must a Harvard 
                        boy do to take a Wellesley girl out 
                        for a drink?
                             (offering the gift)
                        Happy birthday, Hillary.

                                 HILLARY
                        How’d you know it was my birthday?

                                 WELD
                        Deep Throat.

           They laugh. She unwraps the present to find a vinyl record.

                                 WELD
                        It’s a compilation of this year’s 
                        greatest hits... of sorts.
                             (off her look)
                        One drink. Or else I’ll tell 
                        everyone it’s your birthday.

           EXT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL ROOFTOP - NIGHT

           A full moon. Hillary walks out of the stairwell and finds a 
           record player and a bottle of wine on a table. 

           Weld pours wine while Hillary puts the needle on a record. A 
           beat before Nixon’s voice pours out of the speakers.

                     JOHN DEAN (AUDIO)
                                                          WELD
                                              I took the best parts of the 
                                              Watergate tapes. A souvenir 
                                              of our time together.
           We have a cancer within, 
           close to the presidency, 
           that's growing. It's growing 
           daily. It's compounding.

                                 HILLARY
                        This is the best present a girl can 
                        ever have. Thank you, Will.
           Will and Hillary toast their wine glasses. And as we hear the 
           secret recordings of Nixon and all the President’s men...

                                 NIXON (AUDIO)
                        I really need a son-of-a-bitch like 
                        Huston who will work his butt off 
                        and do it dishonorably. Do you see 
                        what I mean? Who will know what 
                        he’s doing and will—I want to know, 
                        too. And I’ll direct him myself.

           ...Hillary’s smile fades. She sets her glass on the ledge.

                                 HILLARY
                        We’re going to bring down Nixon, 
                        aren’t we?

           Hillary and Weld stare out toward the landmarks. The Capitol. 
           The Washington Monument. And The White House.

                                 WELD
                        We have to. Nixon is a cancer to 
                        democracy.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah... America deserves better.
                             (ironic, self-pitying)
                        Politics is a great job if not for 
                        all the politics.

           Weld nods. They stare at the full moon over the White House.

                                 WELD
                        Jack, Bobby, Dr. King... They left 
                        us with Richard Fuckin’ Nixon.
                             (beat, in JFK accent)
                        We choose to go to the moon in this 
                        decade and do the other things, not 
                        because they are easy, but because 
                        they are hard.

           They don’t see Terry Kirkpatrick approaching them.

                                 WELD/HILLARY
                        Because that goal will serve to 
                        organize and measure the best of 
                        our energies and skills, because 
                        that challenge is one that we are 
                        willing to accept...

           They draw closer to each other for that inevitable kiss. He 
           wants to. She expects it.
                                 WELD
                        One we are unwilling to postpone, 
                        and one which we intend to win--

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Hillary! You got a call.

           Terry realizes she interrupted a moment. Hurries to leave.

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        I’ll just take a message.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who is it? Who called?

                                 TERRY KIRKPATRICK
                        Bill Clinton...
                             (hesitant)
                        He called to wish you a happy 
                        birthday.

           Off Weld’s look, Hillary freezes. Weld or Clinton? The 
           present or the past? Right here, right now or...

                                 WELD
                        Who’s Bill Clinton?

           Hillary avoids his look and walks toward the stairwell. He 
           looks at Terry who doesn’t reply. But he knows the answer.

           INT. TERRY KIRKPATRICK’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Hillary walks in and spots the phone receiver resting on the 
           desk. She grabs it and is about to talk...

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (ON PHONE)
                        It’s Friday night, Bill. Let’s get 
                        a drink at the Gas Lite.

                                                     BILL (ON PHONE)
                  ANOTHER WOMAN (ON PHONE)
           C’mon, Professor. Let’s go!
                                              Hold on, hold on!

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        I have to wish a special lady 
                        friend a happy birthday. I’ll catch 
                        up with you later. 

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (ON PHONE)
                        You have girls in every city. 

           Hillary cups the receiver. Noticing Terry at the door, she 
           waves Terry away. Off Hillary’s conflicted look...
                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        But she’s the only girl I ever want 
                        to marry.

                                 ANOTHER WOMAN (ON PHONE)
                        I don’t see you settling down.

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        For her I would.
                             (hint of sadness)
                        It doesn’t matter. She said no.

           Hillary doesn’t know if Bill meant it or he’s playing the 
           sympathy card for his two companions. Hillary sets the phone 
           down, walks out to the hallway, and shouts toward the room. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Terry, I can’t talk for long. I 
                        have a meeting with Mr. Doar in 
                        five minutes.

           She makes plenty of noise as she approaches the phone again.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello?

                                 BILL
                        Hello, Hillary...
                             (off her cold silence)
                        I wanted to wish you a happy 
                        birthday before the day was over. 

                                                          BILL
                          HILLARY
           It’s 10 minutes to midnight.
                                              Hold on, don’t hang up. 

           From the other line, a saxophone plays “Happy Birthday.” 

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill, BILL! I have work to do.

           Bill improvises the tune that morphs into “Hail to the 
           Chief.” She giggles and hates herself for it. But she’s also 
           genuinely touched by the gesture. He has that effect.

                                 BILL
                        Did ya like it, Madam President?
                             (off her non-response)
                        How you doing?

                                 HILLARY
                        I have to get back to work.
                                 BILL
                        Right. Of course. I, I...
                             (beat)
                        Nevermind. Happy birthday, darling. 
                        For what it’s worth, I think you 
                        made the right decision.

           She senses defeat in his voice. This makes her feel awful.

                                 HILLARY
                        How’s your campaign coming along?

                                 BILL
                        Terrific. I moved up from non-
                        existent to irrelevant in the 
                        polls. Why just last week, I got 
                        booed off-stage at Fort Chaffee. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I read about that in The Democrat.

                                 BILL
                        You did?

                                 HILLARY
                        Who schedules a draft dodger at a 
                        military base when the incumbent 
                        earned a Distinguished Flying Cross 
                        in World War Two? Your campaign 
                        manager is a fuckin’ bastard. 

                                 BILL
                        How would you run my campaign?

                                 HILLARY
                        I wouldn’t convince voters why 
                        you’re as good as John Paul 
                        Hammerschmidt. I would show them 
                        why you are different.

           Hillary sits down and writes on a pad, biting the bait of 
           political strategy that Bill cast in her direction. We stare 
           at the wall clock that moves closer to midnight...

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        Your supporters are the Kennedy 
                        Democrats. Those of us who grew up 
                        on Camelot and the New Frontier. 
                        Don’t you have a picture of you 
                        with JFK in the Rose Garden?

                                 BILL
                        The Boys Nation one?
                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        Yeah. Get Paul Fray to leak it to 
                        the press. Make voters see that 
                        you’re the next John Fuckin’
                        Kennedy.

           ...and now the clock moves ahead several hours. 

                                 BILL
                        Darling, I love it when you add 
                        tobasco to your language.

           The clock moves ahead a bit more. Hillary has an entire 
           speech written out on the notepad. SHE LOVES THIS.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hammerschmidt’s one of the few 
                        Republicans still defending Richard 
                        Motherfuckin’ Nixon. You have to 
                        attack your opponent on Watergate.

                                 BILL
                        But I know nothing about Watergate.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’ve forgotten more about Watergate 
                        than you’ll ever know... Can I 
                        trust you to keep this between us?

                                 BILL
                        Of course. Doesn’t this remind you 
                        of the McGovern campaign?

                                 HILLARY
                        No. He was a loser. You’re not...
                             (re: her notepad)
                        From now on, don’t improvise your 
                        speeches. This isn’t law school. 
                        I’ll send you a new one tomorrow--
                             (looks at the clock)
                        Today. Memorize it for the labor 
                        rally in Bentonville on Thursday.

                                 BILL
                        You know my schedule better than I 
                        do. Thank you, darling. Thank you.

           The clock moves ahead again. They moved to Hillary’s work.

                                 BILL
                        Have you looked at the other three 
                        House resolutions to impeach Nixon? 
                        Ones by Leo Ryan and John Conyers?
                                 HILLARY
                        No. God, I forgot. How could I have 
                        been so stupid?

                                 BILL
                        You aren’t stupid. Hillary, you’re 
                        the most brilliant person I know.
                             (he means it)
                        You just have been overworked.

           Hillary nods, trying to settle her weary, tired nerves.

                                 HILLARY
                        I wish you were here to proof my 
                        work like you used to.

                                 BILL
                        I wish I was with you like we used 
                        to. I miss you.

           Her eyes tear. The more she fights it, the worse it becomes.

                                 BILL
                        We don’t have to get married. But 
                        can we give us another chance?

                                 HILLARY
                        I can’t, Bill. I have so much work. 
                        And the House Judiciary Committee 
                        needs me and Mr. Doar--

                                 BILL
                        I need you, Hillary. I don’t want 
                        to lose you.

           Hillary nods. She wipes her eyes and her nose. 

                                 BILL
                        I love you. I always have...
                             (pleading)
                        Don’t you love me, Hillary?

                          HILLARY
           I don’t know. We’re so 
           different.
                                                          BILL
                                              I forced the marriage thing 
                                              on you. It’s my fault.
                  (over Bill)
           I don’t think we’ll work.

                                 BILL
                        Listen. I’m going to count to a 
                        hundred. If you’re certain you 
                        don’t love me, hang up any time 
                        before I reach a hundred. Okay?
                                 HILLARY
                        Okay.

                                 BILL
                        Okay. One. Two. Three.

           Hillary closes her eyes, just listening to his voice.

                                 BILL
                        Four. Five... If you’re certain you 
                        don’t want to marry me, hang up any 
                        time before I reach two hundred.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hang up before a hundred if I’m 
                        certain I don’t love you, before 
                        two hundred if I’m certain I don’t 
                        want to marry you?

                                 BILL
                        Yeah. That’s right. Got it?

                                 HILLARY
                        I got it.

           As Bill counts...

           EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - MORNING

           The sun rises over the Potomac. The count reaches 99. A long 
           beat before Bill counts 100. He continues counting as 
           protestors gather in front of the White House.

           EXT. CAPITOL HILL - MORNING

           The count continues. The Doar lawyers file into the 
           Congressional Hotel except Hillary who stayed up all night.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        198. 199... 200... 201. Are you 
                        still there?

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        Yeah. Get some sleep.

                                 BILL (O.S.)
                        Listen, darling. I’m going to count 
                        to three hundred. And if you are--

           CLICK. She hangs up before he can coerce another concession.
           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL BASEMENT GARAGE - DAY

           Nussbaum steps in his car and unlocks the passenger door for 
           Doar and the backseat for Hillary. But Doar approaches a 
           LAWYER putting boxes into the trunk of a nearby car.

                                 DOAR
                        What are you doing, Mr. Dixon?

                                 LAWYER
                        My wife’s in labor. I have to go. 

                                 DOAR
                             (pulls out a box)
                        And what is this?

                                 LAWYER
                        Grand jury testimonies and Senate 
                        Watergate Committee transcripts.
                             (he’s already so late)
                        I promise I’ll get them summarized 
                        and filed by Wednesday.

                                 DOAR
                        My god, what would happen if you 
                        were killed in a car accident? 
                        These documents will be leaked to 
                        the press.

                                 LAWYER
                        But I’m a very careful driver.

           Doar removes the boxes from the trunk as the lawyer’s eyes 
           plead to Nussbaum and Hillary.

                                 LAWYER
                        Please, Mr. Doar...

                                 DOAR
                             (”you’re fired”)
                        I’m assigning your work to someone 
                        else. Go. Your wife’s in labor.

           Doar carries a box to Nussbaum’s car. Nussbaum and Hillary 
           avoid the lawyer’s eye contact as they grab the other boxes.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           As Nussbaum drives the car toward the guarded gate, Hillary 
           stares out, locking eyes with protestors, mostly there for 
           Watergate and Vietnam. A few for Women’s Rights. They all 
           agree on one thing: Richard Nixon must resign.
           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           A White House aide (his nametag reads HENRY PAULSON) leads 
           Doar and Nussbaum through the hallway. Hillary lags behind to 
           admire the West Wing.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        First time in the White House?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah.
                             (mutters)
                        I’ll be back. I’ll be back.

           INT. ROOSEVELT ROOM - DAY

           Hillary, Nussbaum, and Doar enter and find three White House 
           staffers seated on one side of the table. They each have 
           identical folders in front of them.

           The first man is DONALD RUMSFELD (41), Counselor to the 
           President. His role in Nixon’s administration is vague yet so 
           ubiquitous that Nixon gave him Cabinet status.

                                 DOAR
                        Where’s President Nixon?

                                 DONALD RUMSFELD
                        He’s finalizing the Middle East 
                        cease-fire with Dr. Kissinger.
                             (smirks at Hillary)
                        Nice to see you again, Miss Rodham. 

           She studies his face but has no idea who he is.

                                 DONALD RUMSFELD
                        Donald Rumsfeld. We met when you 
                        interned for Gerald Ford in ‘68. 
                             (to Doar, Nussbaum)
                        She didn’t tell you she was the 
                        president of Wellesley College 
                        Young Republicans? Miss Rodham even 
                        worked Nelson Rockefeller’s GOP
                        campaign in ‘68.

                                 HILLARY
                        That was a long time ago.

                                 DONALD RUMSFIELD
                        To a young lady, five years must 
                        seem like a lifetime. Nice to see 
                        you back in Washington, Hillary.
                                 DOAR
                        Tip O’Neill assured us we’d be 
                        speaking with the President.

                                 JAMES ST. CLAIR
                        We speak for the President.

           The middle man is JAMES ST. CLAIR (53), the latest in the 
           revolving door that is the White House Counsel.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        And who the hell are you?

                                 JAMES ST. CLAIR
                        I’m James St. Clair, the White 
                        House Counsel to the President.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Oh, that’s right. Your last two 
                        predecessors are serving time. If I 
                        were you, I’d resign before taking 
                        the fall for this President.

                                 JAMES ST. CLAIR
                        I believe my client to be a fair 
                        and a moral man. And he will be 
                        cleared of any wrongdoing.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Maybe you’ll get lucky and only get 
                        disbarred when this is all over.

           The next man is ALEXANDER HAIG (50), in military uniform with 
           four stars and ridiculous amounts of medals and decorations. 

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        And you must be the most decorated 
                        White House Chief of Staff in 
                        history, General Haig.

                                 ALEXANDER HAIG
                        The White House wages many wars. At 
                        home and abroad.

           Haig opens his folder. Rumsfeld and St. Clair follow suit.

                                 HAIG
                        We looked through your committee 
                        report. And we need to separate the 
                        truths from these terminological 
                        inexactitudes before we can agree 
                        upon the impeachable offense you 
                        are seeking.
                                 DOAR
                        Terminological inexactitudes?

                                 HAIG
                        Yes, your calculated ambiguities.

                                 ST. CLAIR
                        Lies.

                                 DOAR
                        That’s outrageous. What we have is 
                        a pattern of flagrant abuse by the 
                        White House.

           Hillary pulls out a dossier and slides it over to Haig. It 
           includes transcripts of Nixon’s Watergate tapes.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Watergate is just the tip of the 
                        iceberg. Wire-tapping, obstruction 
                        of justice, concealments, misuse 
                        and abuse of the executive power--

                                 HAIG
                             (skims the document)
                        Do you have any proof that ties 
                        your accusations directly to the 
                        President?
                             (he knows they don’t)
                        Our predecessors turned over every 
                        document requested by the House 
                        Judiciary Committee.

                                 ST. CLAIR
                        And every recorded conversation by 
                        my client from the Oval Office. And 
                        you don’t have enough to pursue 
                        impeachment--

                                 HAIG
                             (cuts St. Clair off)
                        What’s your angle, Doar?

                                 DOAR
                        I have no angle. 

                                 HAIG
                        Sure you do. You were a big man on 
                        campus when Kennedy was President. 
                        You miss that, don’t you? You want 
                        to be remembered as the man who 
                        brought down Richard Nixon.
                                 DOAR
                        And you want to run the White House 
                        while Nixon hides from Watergate.

                                 HAIG
                        At least we’re being honest with 
                        each other.

           Rumsfeld leans forward to intermediate between Haig and Doar.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        The last thing any of us wants is a 
                        drawn-out Congressional hearing 
                        where we force our President to the 
                        stand and exacerbate the public 
                        perception of our government.

           Rumsfeld slides the dossier back to Doar and Nussbaum.

                                 RUMSFELD
                        Especially when America has such a 
                        precarious position in the Middle 
                        East, Vietnam, and China. We need 
                        our President to be strong when 
                        he’s dealing with the Soviets.

                                 DOAR
                             (slides the folder back)
                        We have enough evidence to prove 
                        that Mr. Nixon committed an 
                        impeachable offense.

           Off Nussbaum’s nod, Hillary writes “Discussion points of WH
           meeting” on her notepad.

                                 ST. CLAIR
                        Alright, Mr. Doar. Let’s waste 
                        everyone’s time and tax dollars 
                        then.
                             (to Hillary)
                        There’s no need to take notes. We 
                        will send you a recording.

                                 HILLARY
                        We’re being recorded?

                                 ST. CLAIR
                        We record every meeting in the 
                        Roosevelt Room.
           INT. HILLARY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Hillary sits on the couch, talks on the phone, and has a 
           checkbook out with a blank check to “William J. Clinton.” 

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        ...so if you wouldn’t mind sending 
                        five hundred, I’ll pay you back as 
                        soon as the semester’s over.

                                 HILLARY
                        Uh-huh, okay. Listen to this.
                             (raises volume)
                        Every single one of Nixon staffers 
                        was afraid of us. Not me, of 
                        course. But John Doar definitely. 
                        And Bernie Nussbaum, too. 

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        Even Alexander Haig?

                                 HILLARY
                        Especially Alexander Haig. Listen.

           She holds the phone to the Sony TC-800B recorder. (Haig: “You 
           just crossed the line between a legal case and a political 
           cause, Mr. Doar. You want to bring down Nixon when I want to 
           uphold the American Presidency. You want to take down one man 
           when I’m trying to save the goddamn country!”)

                                 BILL
                             (as the recording plays)
                        It’s the Western Union in 
                        Fayetteville.

                                 HILLARY
                        I got it. Just listen to the tape.
                             (pauses the tape)
                        This isn’t a campaign donation by 
                        the way. It’s a loan. You have to 
                        pay me back by Christmas.

           She plays the rest of the Haig speech and writes “-500” on 
           her checkbook which lowers her account from $589 to $89.

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                             (changing topic)
                        So you nailed Nixon. 

                                 HILLARY
                        No. We don’t have any direct 
                        evidence. But they don’t know that. 
                        And if they don’t know that, maybe 
                        they’ll make a deal.
                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        Maybe they do know.

                          HILLARY
                                                     BILL (ON PHONE)
           No, they don’t. 
                                              I think they do.

           Hillary flips through her transcribed notes. Her temper rises 
           by Bill’s line of questioning.

                                 HILLARY
                        Trust me, they don’t.

                            BILL
           Then you weren’t listening.
                  (off her shouting)
           No need to get mad, darling. 
           I just think you--
                                                         HILLARY
                                              And you know this because you 
                                              spend 120 hours a week on 
                                              Watergate like I do, Mr. 
                                              Rhodes Scholar?

                                 HILLARY
                        You can’t balance your checkbook 
                        but you know all about Watergate?

                                 BILL
                        Can I explain without you cutting 
                        me off?... Hillary?

           Hillary is beet red. She angrily scribbles out the last line 
           of her checkbook. Then she tears the check to shreds.

                                 BILL
                        Promise not to get angry and I’ll 
                        tell ya. Deal?

                                 HILLARY
                        Fine. Tell me.

                                 BILL
                             (still cautious)
                        Rewind to the beginning. I think 
                        James St. Clair was trying to tell 
                        you something without saying it.

           Grudgingly, Hillary rewinds the tape.

                                 BILL
                        St. Clair said that they turned 
                        over all of Nixon’s tapes from the 
                        Oval Office.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah. What’s your point?
                                 BILL
                        He said “Oval Office.” Not “The 
                        White House.”

           Hillary plays the tape again.

                                 ST. CLAIR (ON TAPE)
                        And every recorded conversation by 
                        my client from the Oval Office. And 
                        you don’t have enough to pursue 
                        impeachment--

                       HAIG (ON TAPE)
                                                          BILL
           What’s your angle, Doar?
                                              Now fast forward a bit.

           Hillary does. 

                                                    HILLARY (ON TAPE)
                                              We’re being recorded?
                            BILL
           Then he went out of his way 
           to tell you that you didn’t 
           have to take notes of the 
           meeting.

                                 ST. CLAIR (ON TAPE)
                        We record every meeting in the 
                        Roosevelt Room.

                                 BILL
                        St. Clair was trying to tell you 
                        something without violating 
                        attorney-client privilege.

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh my god. Shit, SHIT, SHIT!!!

                                 BILL
                        You have to subpoena Nixon’s 
                        recordings from the Roosevelt Room.

                                 HILLARY
                        I fuckin’ love you. I mean that. I 
                        love you and I want to fuck you.

                                 BILL
                        Great. Listen, I need the money by 
                        Thursday or they’ll cut off my--

                                 HILLARY
                        I gotta go. Bye.

           Hillary hangs up, grabs her bag, and storms out of the room.
           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Hillary bursts into the room and finds Weld at a desk with a 
           typewriter. He smiles upon seeing her.

                                 WELD
                        Well well well, if it isn’t the 
                        teacher’s favorite pet. Mee-ow.

                                 HILLARY
                        Real funny, Ryan O’Neal.

           She bumps Weld off the seat just enough that their hips press 
           into each other. She inserts a House Judiciary Committee 
           letterhead and types away. Weld sneaks a peek.

                                 WELD
                        Oh, a subpoena. Against who?

                                 HILLARY
                        Richard Motherfuckin’ Nixon.

           He relinquishes his seat so she can type in earnest.

                                 WELD
                        Any relations to Richard Milhous
                        Nixon?

                                 HILLARY
                        One’s an asshole. One’s a dick.

                                 WELD
                        That covers both ends of the man.
                             (off Hillary’s smile)
                        Let me guess, Yalie. This is one of 
                        Doar’s special projects that you 
                        can’t tell me anything about.

                                 HILLARY
                        Sorry, Harvard.

                                 WELD
                        “Love means never having to say 
                        you’re sorry.” 
                             (off her look)
                        You know, from the movie about my 
                        life we never saw?

                                 HILLARY
                        Cute, Harvard. Real cute.

           Weld picks up his jacket and bag. He lingers by the door to 
           see if Hillary might look his way. But she doesn’t. 
           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Hillary stands proudly as Doar reads her draft of the 
           subpoena. He also holds the Roosevelt Room transcript with 
           St. Clair’s statements in highlights.

                                 DOAR
                        This is brilliant. I can’t believe 
                        we overlooked this.
                             (off her smile)
                        This is great work... And a load of 
                        horseshit.

           Doar feeds the draft and the transcript into the shredder. 

                                 HILLARY
                        What are you doing??

           From his top drawer, Doar pulls out phone records with 
           “Washington, D.C. - Fayetteville, AR” calls in highlights. 
           They were all placed in November, 1973 from 11PM to 4AM.

                                 DOAR
                        Long-distance calls to Arkansas 
                        with tax-dollars. Registered mail 
                        using tax dollars.

           Doar pulls out an Arkansas Gazette with the headline of 
           “Representative Is ‘Out of Step,’ Clinton Charges.”

                                 DOAR
                        “William Clinton, a law professor 
                        at the University of Arkansas, said 
                        there was no question that an 
                        admission of making false 
                        statements to government officials 
                        and interfering with the FBI and 
                        the CIA is an impeachable offense.”

           Doar throws down the paper and explodes with rage.

                                 DOAR
                        How the hell does he know more 
                        about this than most of my staff?

                                 HILLARY
                        I, I don’t know. He’s very smart--

                                 DOAR
                        Shut up. Just shut up!

           Doar pulls out more newspaper clippings, phone records, and 
           mail receipts to Fayetteville, Arkansas.
                                 DOAR
                        I have more proof Bill Clinton is 
                        behind your work than I have of 
                        Nixon behind Watergate. Dammit, 
                        you’re making me look like a fool.

           She trembles, on the verge of a breakdown. Doar shakes his 
           head in disgust. At her. At himself. At this whole situation.

                                 HILLARY
                        Are you going to fire me?

                                 DOAR
                        Arrest you is what I should be 
                        doing! But you’re a goddamn woman. 
                        If I get rid of you, Gloria Steinem 
                        and Shirley Chisholm will shove 
                        their Feminist army up my ass.

                                 HILLARY
                        I will not fail you again, sir.

                                 DOAR
                        No, you certainly will not. Bill 
                        has no business in this committee. 
                        He passed up his chance.
                             (stares sternly)
                        You will keep your personal life 
                        separate from your professional 
                        one. And we will find a different 
                        way to get those tapes. Are we 
                        clear, Miss Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes, Mr. Doar. I’m sorry, sir.

                                 DOAR
                        Get back to work, Rodham.

           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

           Hillary bursts in, rushes to the faucet, and turns the hot 
           water on full blast. She stares at her reflection before she 
           rushes into a stall. She pukes from the stress.

           INT. HILLARY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The phone rings. But Sara and Betsey lounge on the couch and 
           watch late-night TV. Hillary comes out of the bathroom and 
           shoves toiletry into her suitcase. She goes into her room.

           After the answering machine’s prompt, we hear Bill.
                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        Thanks for the loan, darling. But 
                        it doesn’t feel right so I’ll just 
                        send it back to you. If you’re 
                        there, pick up...

                                 BETSEY
                        I bet William Weld never has to 
                        borrow money.

           Hillary comes out of her room and shoves underwear into her 
           suitcase. She pauses. Should I answer the phone?

                                 BILL (ON PHONE)
                        You must be at work. Call me later 
                        tonight so I can wire your money 
                        back. I miss you, darling.

           Hillary drags her suitcase but stops in front of the TV. 
           Blocking their view, she hands Sara a mail package.

                                 HILLARY
                        Can you drop this off at the post 
                        office tomorrow?

                                 SARA
                        What is this?

                                 HILLARY
                        Fresh socks and underwear. I just 
                        want Bill to know I care.

                                 BETSEY
                        If you really care, send him your
                        underwear.

           Hillary ignores their laughs and heads out of the apartment. 
           The answering machine’s outgoing message plays again as...

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

                                 BILL (V.O.) 
                        I won Hot Springs Teacher’s Union 
                        endorsement today. And I rented a 
                        small office on Main Street.

           Using scattered index cards on the desk, Hillary types a new 
           document titled:

           RESPONSES OF THE PRESIDENTS TO CHARGES OF MISCONDUCT
           An Authoritative History Requested by Counsel John Doar for 
           the Impeachment Inquiry Staff Investigating Charges Against 
           Richard M. Nixon.
                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I even have volunteers working the 
                        phones. Wait, they want to tell you 
                        something.

           Hillary types “By C. Vann Woodward, Sterling Professor of 
           History, Yale Uniber--”

                                 YOUNG WOMEN (V.O.)
                        William Jefferson Clinton for 
                        Congress! 

           Irked by the women, Hillary makes a typo. Their singing of a 
           Bye Bye Birdie song angers her more. She pounds the keys.

                                 YOUNG WOMAN (V.O.)
                        We love you Clinton. Oh yes we do.
                        We love you Clinton. And will be 
                        true!

           INT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS RESEARCH ROOM - DAY

           Hillary hands the typed manuscript to Vann Woodward. In 
           return, his staffers hand her stacks of index cards. She 
           forces a smile to feign appreciation.

           INT. LIBRARY OF CONGRESS MAIN READING ROOM - DAY

           Hillary walks past occupied desks, mostly scholars and 
           students immersed in academia. She finally finds a seat. She 
           sits down and reads the index cards. We pan away...

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        I ran out of gas on my way to a 
                        fundraiser. So I used your loan to 
                        fuel my car and my tummy. But I’ll 
                        send the rest back next week.

           As time elapses, people around Hillary change. But she 
           remains, focused on her task... even if she is dead tired.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                             (off machine’s BEEP)
                        I need a new speech for the farmers 
                        co-op next week. I miss arguing 
                        with you. I’ve grown accustomed to 
                        your swearing...

           A librarian walks past empty desks and shakes Hillary awake. 
           Hillary is the only one left in this vast Rotunda. 
                                 LIBRARIAN
                        The library is now closed.

           EXT. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE - DAY

           A tinted sedan drives toward the main entrance where the 
           press from the networks and newspapers wait.

                                 DOAR (O.S.)
                        Enter through the garage.

           INT. DOJ HALLWAY - DAY

           A guide leads Doar, Woods, and Hillary to the office of “Leon 
           Jaworski, Special Prosecutor” and “Jill Wine Volner, 
           Assistant Prosecutor.”

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        Hello, stranger. Thanks for the 
                        socks and underwear. Paul and Mary 
                        Lee Fray loved your cookies, too. I 
                        moved in with them to save some 
                        money. Every penny counts, right? I 
                        miss you terribly. Call me.

           They enter and shake hands with LEON JAWORSKI, nearing 70 but 
           still full of energy, and JILL VOLNER, 28, in a clingy 
           business attire that reveals all her best features. 

           QUICK CUT TO: Hillary’s answering machine that rolls tape.

                                 BILL (ON TAPE)
                        I wish you were down here to have 
                        some of Ma’s sweet potato pie and 
                        mashed potatoes. Happy 
                        Thanksgiving, my darling.
                             (pepping himself up)
                        Fuck Richard Nixon!

           BACK TO the Impeachment committee and the Justice Department. 
           Hillary notices how Jill Volner, only a couple years older, 
           takes full charge of the room and has the men captivated.

                                 JILL VOLNER
                        Nixon has refused every court order 
                        to release the additional tapes of 
                        his conversations by citing 
                        executive privilege. 
                                 JOE WOODS
                        His lawyers offered to have Senator 
                        Stennis review and transcribe the 
                        tapes in a private session.

                                 JILL VOLNER
                        Everyone knows Stennis is fuckin’
                        deaf. Nixon gives us no choice but 
                        to take this to the Supreme Court.

           INT. HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HEARING - DAY

           Chairman Peter Rodino sits at the center of the panel with 
           two dozen other Congressmen. He stares directly at...

           ...the White House table where PAT BUCHANAN, 36, sits between 
           James St. Clair and Alexander Haig.

                                 PETER RODINO
                        I was promised by Speaker of the 
                        House Albert and Vice President 
                        Ford that President Nixon would be 
                        present at the hearing today.

                                 PAT BUCHANAN
                        We speak for the President.

                                 PETER RODINO
                        And who are you?

                                 PAT BUCHANAN
                        Pat Buchanan. I’m President Nixon’s 
                        speechwriter. So I assure you, I do 
                        speak for the President. 

           Volner, Jaworski, Woods, and Doar sit at the Impeachment 
           Committee table. Hillary is forced to sit behind them. 

                                 PETER RODINO
                        Then answer me this. Why does the 
                        President defy every subpoena 
                        ordering him to release all White 
                        House tapes and papers between 
                        himself and those indicted by the 
                        grand jury?

                                 PAT BUCHANAN
                        Executive privilege, Congressman 
                        Rodino. It’s a right guaranteed to 
                        the executive branch by the United 
                        States Constitution. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAT BUCHANAN (CONT'D)
                        And that privilege is an absolute, 
                        unqualified Presidential privilege 
                        of immunity from judicial process 
                        under all circumstances.

           Buchanan throws a disdainful look toward Doar, Jaworski, and 
           others of the justice department and impeachment committee.

                                 PETER RODINO
                        And let me assure you, Mr. 
                        Buchanan. Executive privilege is 
                        not mentioned in the Constitution.

           This catches a smug Buchanan by surprise. 

                                 PETER RODINO
                        And executive privilege is just 
                        that. A privilege. Not a right.

                                 JILL VOLNER
                        Having exhausted all legislative 
                        means, the Justice Department has 
                        no recourse but to take this matter 
                        to the Supreme Court.
                             (off Rodino’s nod)
                        United States versus Richard Nixon.

                            HAIG
                                                      PAT BUCHANAN
           This is an outrage, Peter!
                                              Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman!

           Amidst the chaos, Doar leans back toward Hillary.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        How’s Professor Woodward’s project 
                        coming along?

                                 HILLARY
                        His staff recessed for winter 
                        break. And he needs another four 
                        months after that.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Get it to me by March 15.

           Off Doar’s stern look, Hillary nods to accept his challenge.

           INT. HILLARY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The answering machine tape rolls to take a new message.
                                 BILL (ON TAPE)
                        I have to attend a New Year’s Eve 
                        party at Don Tyson’s house. He runs 
                        a big chicken farm down here and...

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

           The Capital police block Sara and Betsey’s path into the 
           hotel. They hold fresh dry-cleaning and food in tupperware.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        ...and I’d look foolish going by 
                        myself and, well, I could ask one 
                        of the girls down here but...

           Hillary steps out of the elevator, walks past the police. She 
           is so happy to see her two best friends. But more 
           importantly, she’s happy for fresh clothes and food.

                                 BILL (V.O.)
                        You’re as pretty as any of them. 
                        But they don’t know the difference 
                        between habeas corpus and Corpus 
                        Christi. What I’m saying is... 

           INT. HILLARY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           The tape keeps rolling. Hillary enters the apartment.

                                 BILL (ON TAPE) 
                        I really miss you and I’m using a 
                        chicken rancher as an excuse to see 
                        you. Please, Hillary.

           She hurries to the phone and picks it up. 

                                 HILLARY
                        Hello, hello? 
                             (smiling)
                        I missed you, too.

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Betsey and Hillary (now plainly dressed like her Yale hippie 
           days) drag their suitcases toward a terminal. 

                                 BETSEY
                        Roughing it with Howdy Doody isn’t 
                        how I want to spend my Christmas.
                                 HILLARY
                        Fine, I’ll go all alone. But you 
                        know and I know there’s a good 
                        chance I won’t come back.
                             (fuckin’ with her)
                        Ever.

                                 BETSEY
                        Don’t you dare. You’re my ticket to 
                        the White House.

                                 HILLARY
                        Well, that ticket’s boarding a 
                        flight to Arkansas.

           Betsey stands her ground and watches Hillary approach the 
           departure gate. A beat before Betsey mutters expletives and 
           pulls her suitcase to catch up to Hillary.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           Hillary and Betsey step out of the airport and find Bill and 
           his friend, JIM MCDOUGAL (35) by a wood-panel station wagon.

                                 BILL
                        My darling, Hillary!

           Bill embraces Hillary in a hug. Then a cautious kiss since 
           they’re not quite sure of their status. But Hillary kisses 
           him back and back and back. Like a Big Red gum commercial.

           Betsey coughs to get their attention. Without breaking the 
           kiss, Bill extends his arm and pats Betsey on the head. 

                                 JIM MCDOUGAL
                        Jim McDougal. You must be Betsey 
                        Wright.
                             (re: his station wagon)
                        Bill’s Gremlin died coming back 
                        from Springdale. 

                                 BETSEY
                        Good riddance.

           EXT. NORTHWEST ARKANSAS - DAY

           The station wagon drives through roads that cut through the 
           poverty-stricken bowels of America. This is also a Republican 
           stronghold with “RE-ELECT HAMMERSCHMIDT” signs on every gas 
           station, five and dimes, and barbershops.
           Now the wagon drives by the meandering whitewater of the 
           White River that cuts through the undeveloped Ozarks.

           INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

           Hillary leans over to the front, annoying Jim who drives. 
           Bill skims through a folder of typewritten speeches.

                                 BETSEY
                        How do you two know each other?

                                 BILL
                        Jim and I ran Senator Fulbright’s
                        re-election office in Little Rock.

                                 JIM MCDOUGAL
                        And that’s all we did.

           Bill and Jim laugh until Bill catches a fierce look from 
           Hillary. He quickly moves his gaze to the written speeches.

                                 HILLARY
                        Those cover your stance on welfare, 
                        education, Vietnam, the Equal 
                        Rights Amendment, and crime.

                                 BILL
                        Got it. I’m pro-crime, right?

           Bill and Jim laugh. Hillary stifles her annoyance.

                                 HILLARY
                        And I’ll talk to Paul and Mary Lee 
                        to finalize your views on abortion 
                        and foreign policy on China, 
                        Cambodia, and the Middle East. 

                                 BILL
                        Darling, darling, I’m only running 
                        for Congress, not the White House.

                                 HILLARY
                        But you thought about it.

                                 BILL
                        Thought about what? These issues?

                                 HILLARY
                        No. The White House.

                                 BILL
                        Sure, maybe once or twice.
           Jim eyes Betsey through the rearview mirror. They don’t know 
           each other but they know where this is headed.

                                 JIM MCDOUGAL
                        What do you think of the view? It’s 
                        the White River. Nice, right?

                                 HILLARY
                        Yes. We never saw a river before.

                                 JIM MCDOUGAL
                        That may be. But you know how much 
                        waterfront property costs up in 
                        Chicago, New York, and DC? A 
                        fortune.

                                 BETSEY
                        That’s because people want to live 
                        in Chicago, New York, and DC.

                                 BILL
                        Jim and his fiancee plan to buy up 
                        all this land and sub-divide it 
                        into lots for vacation homes.
                             (smiles at Hillary)
                        What do you think? 

                                 BETSEY
                        That’s the dumbest idea I’ve ever 
                        heard.

           Hillary stares out, seeing the serene beauty of it all.

                                 BILL
                        Jim and Susan will give us the best 
                        lot. I can teach Willie Junior how 
                        to fish, raft, and build a fire.

                                 HILLARY
                             (still slightly annoyed)
                        Do you even know how to fish, raft, 
                        or build a fire?

                                 BILL
                        Not yet. But you’ll teach us.

           Off Bill’s boyish grin, Hillary smiles despite herself. 

                                 HILLARY
                        It’s not a bad idea. 
                             (beat)
                        Us, huh?
                                 BILL
                        You, me, and Willie Junior.

           Bill eyes her with sincerity and intensity that Hillary can’t 
           help but share his dream. Betsey shakes her head in disgust.

           EXT. THE CLINTON HOUSE - DAY

           A backyard party packed with Bill’s friends, family, and 
           campaign volunteers that spills to a neighboring yard. As 
           Betsey moves through the crowd, she hurries past Jim McDougal
           who pitches the Whitewater project to anyone within earshot. 

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        I don’t care who she is, Mary. That 
                        carpetbagger isn’t going to tell me 
                        what to do.

                                 MARY LEE FRAY
                        Relax, Paul. Relax. She’ll be gone 
                        in a week. Let’s cool off inside.

           PAUL FRAY holds up a written document with Hillary’s 
           trademark overbearing edits. As Betsey is about to defend her 
           best friend, a woman’s hand grabs her arm.

                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                        I could use some help with the 
                        cooking, dear.

           VIRGINIA CLINTON, 50, caked in make-up and false lashes, 
           disapproves of Betsey’s butch appearance because all women 
           should look like Donna Reed. Her contempt is obvious.

                                 BETSEY
                        I’m not good around the kitchen.

                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                             (re: Betsey’s girth)
                        I doubt that. Where’s your friend?

           IN THE NEIGHBORING BACKYARD, Bill has his arm wrapped around 
           Hillary while his two friends, VINCE FOSTER, 29, and JIM GUY 
           TUCKER, 30, hand Hillary their business cards.

                                 BILL
                        Vince is the youngest partner at 
                        the Rose Law Firm.
                             (re: Jim Guy)
                        And Jim Guy left the firm to become 
                        the youngest state attorney general 
                        in the country.
                             (holds Hillary’s hand)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                        Hillary’s the youngest and the 
                        prettiest commencement speaker in 
                        Wellesley College history.

                                 HILLARY
                        You all grew up next to each other?

                                 VINCE FOSTER
                             (re: the adjoining yards)
                        Right next door. Funny that.
                             (off Bill’s slight nod)
                        Billy tells me you’re thinking of 
                        going into private practice when 
                        Nixon is out of office.

                                 BILL
                             (avoids Hillary’s gaze)
                        She’s smarter than me and Robert 
                        Reich put together.

                                 VINCE FOSTER
                        We know, Bill, we know. He doesn’t 
                        ever stop talking about you. Did 
                        you take the bar exam yet?

                                 HILLARY
                        No, not yet. I haven’t made up my 
                        mind what I want to do...

                                 VINCE FOSTER
                        Just call me if you want to work at 
                        the Rose firm and I’ll set that up.

                                 HILLARY
                        Oh, you have offices in D.C.?

           Jim Guy chortles. But Hillary wasn’t joking.

                                 VINCE FOSTER
                        No. We don’t even have any female 
                        lawyers in our firm... yet.

                                 BILL
                        You would be the first woman 
                        associate in the Arkansas office.

                                 JIM GUY TUCKER
                        First woman in any Rose office. Or 
                        you could always work for me in the 
                        justice department. We could always 
                        use a feminine touch.

           Virginia Clinton cuts into the middle of the conversation.
                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                        Hillary dear, let the boys talk 
                        politics while you help me in the 
                        kitchen.

           Virginia grabs Hillary by the arm but Hillary doesn’t budge. 
           Virginia eyes daggers at her. Bill intervenes.

                                 BILL
                        Ma, Ma! Hillary doesn’t cook.

                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                        A woman needs to know her way 
                        around the kitchen if she’s going 
                        to feed my boy.

                                 BILL
                        Ma, she was class president at 
                        Wellesley. And she’s bringing down 
                        Nixon. She doesn’t have to cook.

                                 HILLARY
                        I would love to help, Virginia.

           Hillary follows Virginia into the house as Bill mouths his 
           thank you. And assured they are far enough away...

                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                        I have a few dresses you can wear.
                             (looking Hillary over)
                        Something prettier for a girlfriend 
                        of my boy.

                                 HILLARY
                        You say that as if you expect there 
                        to be more.

           The party attendees, each a lifelong Arkansan, wave or say 
           hello to Virginia as the two women head toward the house.

                                 VIRGINIA CLINTON
                        You’re just a phase, darling. He’ll 
                        grow out of it.
                             (re: the party crowd)
                        I don’t see a good fit, do you?

           INT. THE CLINTON HOUSE - DAY

           Hillary, now in a blue prom dress designed to reveal the 
           curves and boobs that she doesn’t have, carries a tray of 
           food and drinks through the hall. Though she hears noise and 
           laughter from a nearby room, she steps into Bill’s old room.
                                 ROGER CLINTON (O.S.)
                             (high, giggly)
                        Who wins in a street fight? Joe 
                        Frazier or Bruce Lee?

           Bill’s room is exactly what you would expect. Lots of awards 
           for leadership and diplomas. And two photos by his bedside. A 
           fading B&W one of Virginia Clinton and William Blythe (Bill’s 
           biological father) and another of a teenaged Bill shaking 
           hands with President Kennedy.

           Hillary finds Bill’s more recent photos. Of his days at 
           Georgetown, Oxford, and Yale. Yet she’s not in any of them.

                                 ROGER CLINTON (O.S.)
                        Okay, okay. Who do you think fucked
                        more women? Bill or Hillary?

           Between laughs, the votes for Bill and Hillary are even.

                                 PAUL FRAY (O.S.)
                        I wouldn’t piss in her ear if her 
                        brain was on fire.

           She hears the next room burst with laughter. She whips 
           around, storms out, and heads--

           INT. CONVERTED OFFICE - DAY

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        Mark my words, that woman is going 
                        to be Bill’s Waterloo.

           --into a makeshift campaign office where Paul and Mary Lee 
           Fray and their friends stuff envelopes. They suddenly stop 
           their gossip and hide their joints.

                                 HILLARY
                        More lemonade?

           Hillary moves the tray to a coffee table where ROGER CLINTON, 
           18, holds a bong with marijuana smoke oozing out. Clearly 
           unwelcome, she grabs the dirty plates and storms out.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Hillary passes wives and girlfriends who set a table, cook 
           and fry food on the stove, and cut up vegetables. She dumps 
           more dirty plates into the bubbly sink where Betsey cleans 
           the dishes. Betsey winces at Hillary’s dress.
                                 BETSEY
                        What the hell happened? You look 
                        like a redneck Stepford wife.

                                 HILLARY
                        I was kidnapped by Ozzie and 
                        Harriet. Oh golly, I feel so swell!

                                 BETSEY
                        This is one small step for man, one 
                        giant tumble for womankind.
                             (re: the cleaning duties)
                        I fuckin’ hate you.

           Hillary pulls out a soapy dish and wipes it clean. So much so 
           that grease and stains spill on her blue dress. Oh well.

                                 HILLARY
                        At least they aren’t calling you a 
                        Yankee carpetbagger hippie.

                                 BETSEY
                        No. Being called a three hundred 
                        pound lesbian is much better.
                             (indignant)
                        I’m not 300 pounds.

                                 HILLARY
                        Look on the bright side. They think 
                        we’re lovers.
                             (re: stained blue dress)
                        Aw, look. I got soap all over me. 
                        This dress is ruined.

           Hillary scrubs a plate, causing creamy dressing to splatter 
           all over her dress. They chuckle at their humiliation until 
           they notice Virginia across the kitchen. She heard it all.

           EXT. FAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS - DAY

           Hillary hands pamphlets to adults who enter and exit mom and 
           pop shops with two types of signs on their display windows: 
           NO WALMART IN FAYETTEVILLE and GO ARKANSAS RAZORBACKS!

                                 HILLARY
                        Clinton for Congress. Thank you. 
                        Vote for Bill Clinton.

           ONE BLOCK AWAY, Mary Lee Fray hands campaign buttons to 
           college coeds. Hillary gets closer enough to eavesdrop.

                                 COED ONE
                        We don’t care who wins.
                                 MARY LEE FRAY
                        Of course you do. 
                             (photo of candidates)
                        Do you want to vote for this old 
                        guy or... This young man?

                                 COED TWO
                             (points to Bill’s photo)
                        He is way, way cuter.

                                 MARY LEE FRAY
                        So you want to vote for him?

                                 COED TWO
                        Oh, I want to do more than that.

           Other coeds nod and giggle in agreement. Hillary holds her 
           tongue and walks past them.

                                 MARY LEE FRAY (O.S.)
                        That’s why you have to vote. We 
                        need more hunks in Congress.

           Hillary approaches the campaign headquarters. A station wagon 
           pulls up to the curb. Jim McDougal and Betsey step out.

                                 BETSEY
                        Help us, will ya, Yankee hippie?

           Betsey grabs a box from the trunk and gives it to her. Jim 
           and Betsey unload more boxes from a local printing press.

                                 BETSEY
                        This campaign’s a fuckin’ train 
                        wreck. It’s a good thing I fuckin’
                        love fuckin’ train wrecks.

           INT. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY

           Jim opens the boxes to reveal bundles of posters and flyers, 
           all with the slogan of “Spreading Hope Across Arkansas.” 

                                 JIM MCDOUGAL
                        Fantastic, isn’t it? Bill’s from 
                        Hope and he’s spreading across 
                        Arkansas. And he’s also spreading 
                        hope, like optimism or a dream.

                                 HILLARY
                        Jim, that’s so clever!

           Jim smiles in agreement, choosing to ignore her sarcasm. 
                                 PAUL FRAY (O.S.)
                        Who’s got Boone County? All yours, 
                        Patricia Kingsley!

           NEARBY, Paul Fray writes “PK” on a card and tacks it on the 
           wall map of Arkansas’s Third Congressional District as 
           volunteers raise their hands to divvy up territories.

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        Who wants Marion and Newton 
                        Counties? Jenny and Michelle.
                             (points to the map)
                        How about Crawford County?

           Hillary squeezes through the crowd of volunteers until she’s 
           within arm’s length of Roger Clinton. Sniff sniff. Hillary 
           notices a joint tucked in his ear and a bong in his hand.

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        Last one. Madison County. Thank 
                        you, Libby.

           Hillary points to two gaps on the map.

                                 HILLARY
                        Hey Paul, why isn’t anyone taking 
                        Sebastian County?

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        That’s a great question, Hillary. 
                        Sebastian County is Fort Smith and 
                        Fort Chaffee military base. So we 
                        would look pretty darn stupid 
                        campaigning there when...
                             (emphatic)
                        Our candidate draft dodged the 
                        Vietnam War!

           The volunteers smirk and let out condescending chuckles. 
           Again, she puts up with it for Bill’s sake. Betsey grabs 
           Hillary’s arm to pull her away but Hillary doesn’t budge.

                                 HILLARY
                        You got me there, Paul.
                             (really, really trying)
                        I want Bill to win as much as you, 
                        if not more. I’m trying to help.

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        Yeah, I got your help right here. I 
                        never realized that Khmer Rouge, 
                        Cambodia and Who Gives a Fuck trail 
                        were so important to our voters.
           Paul holds up a typed up speech with her edits. He crumples 
           it and tosses it in the trash. This gets smiles and cheers 
           from all those tired of Hillary’s presence. Hillary smiles 
           away her embarrassment and takes the high road.

                                 HILLARY
                        Betsey and I worked the McGovern
                        campaign in Austin. And I know many 
                        strategists in D.C--

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        Clinton ain’t McGovern. And this 
                        ain’t D.C.
                             (cutting her off)
                        Up there, you’re a small fish in a 
                        big pond. So you just roll in here 
                        and act like a big fish in a small 
                        pond. But you know what?
                             (re: the entire crowd)
                        We were here from the beginning. We 
                        built this pond. And we don’t need 
                        you or your friend to tell us how 
                        to run Bill’s campaign!

           It takes every ounce of willpower for her to remain calm.

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        You come acting like a big shot 
                        ‘cause you’re bringing down Nixon. 
                        But we all know you got that job 
                        because Bill didn’t want it.
                             (crowd shouts amen)
                        So you want to work the campaign, 
                        fine. But get off your high horse, 
                        lady, because you gotta earn your 
                        way into this campaign. You gotta 
                        earn your stripes, Hillary.

                          HILLARY
                                                         BETSEY
                                              It’s not worth it, Hillary.
           You got me there, Paul. 
                  (over Betsey’s voice)
           But why’s no one taking 
           Russellville and Dardanelle?

           More smirks from the crowd, none louder than Roger. Betsey 
           grabs Hillary’s arm to pull her away from all this.

                                 VOLUNTEER ONE
                        Because that’s negro county.

                                 HILLARY
                        They can vote.
                                 VOLUNTEER TWO
                        If they can read.
                             (grins, daring her)
                        Knock yourself out if you want to 
                        get raped and killed there.

                                 HILLARY
                        Serious? Are you fucking serious?!

                                 ROGER CLINTON
                        Hey Paul, write HR on Dardanelle!

           The crowd bursts into laughter. Hillary swats Betsey’s arm 
           away, rips the bong from Roger’s hand, and hurls it toward 
           Paul. It misses but SMASHES against the wall map.

                                 HILLARY
                        Where’s Bill? WHERE’S BILL?!

           Catching a few furtive glances, Hillary spots a backroom. She 
           storms toward it when Jim McDougal and Paul Fray block her.

                                 PAUL FRAY
                        He’s in a meeting.

           She pushes past them and reaches for the doorknob. But it’s 
           locked. She knocks and shakes the door violently.

                                 HILLARY
                        Bill, I need to talk to you.
                        Open the goddamn door!

           Finally, the door opens. And a SORORITY GIRL, 20, steps out 
           with Bill. Hillary catches them grinning.

                                 SORORITY GIRL
                        You made great points on education 
                        and welfare, Professor Clinton. 

                                 BILL
                        Under Hammerschmidt, Arkansas is 
                        50th in education and 50th in 
                        living wages. Vote for me and I 
                        promise we’ll be at least 49th!

                                 SORORITY GIRL
                        You’re so funny, Bill.  

           The girl avoids Hillary’s gaze, waves her cheery good-bye to 
           the staffers who greet back, and hurries out of the place. 
           Hillary enters Bill’s office and slams the door shut.

                                 HILLARY
                        Who the hell was that?
                                 BILL
                        A former student of mine.
                             (off her “what else” look)
                        And the President of Arkansas 
                        College Democrats. And her uncle 
                        got me a meeting with Sam Walton.

           She studies his face and accepts his explanation. Or at 
           least, that’s a discussion/argument for another time. 

                                 BILL
                        Is everything alright? 

                                 HILLARY
                        No. Everything is not alright. Your 
                        entire staff is a bunch of pot-
                        smoking, racist assholes!

                                 BILL
                        Darling, darling. Calm down. Paul’s 
                        got everything under control.

                                 HILLARY
                        Yeah? He’s the ringmaster of the 
                        circus. And why did you tell him I 
                        was Doar’s consolation prize? Is 
                        nothing sacred between us?

                                 BILL
                        I didn’t say that.

                                 HILLARY
                        So John Doar just left a message on 
                        Paul Fray’s answering machine?

           She tosses the “Spreading Hope” button on his desk. 

                                 HILLARY
                        And what the hell is this Mr. 
                        Roger’s Neighborhood shit? 

                                 BILL
                        Hey, wait a minute. Jim raised most 
                        of the campaign money. And this 
                        came out of his own pocket.

                                 HILLARY
                        Then what did my fifteen hundred 
                        dollars pay for?

           She wounds him and regrets it.
                                 HILLARY
                        It’s not your fault. I just... This 
                        trip was a mistake. I’m completely 
                        useless. I don’t belong here.
                             (frustrated by everything)
                        I wish we were back in Yale. Back 
                        when we talked about how we were 
                        going to change the world. 

                                 BILL
                        We are, darling. You’re building 
                        the most important legal case in 
                        American history. And I’m trying to 
                        change the system from within. 

           Bill wraps his arms around her but she pushes him away. Now 
           it’s his turn to get frustrated by her mood swings.

                                 HILLARY
                        But at what cost, Bill? We’re 
                        following our dream but that 
                        dream’s tearing us apart.

                                 BILL
                        Only until Nixon’s out of office or 
                        when I win the election.

                                 HILLARY
                        You’re not going to win!!

           That did it.

                                 BILL
                        You don’t think I can do it. This 
                        campaign, it’s a joke to you. 

                                                         HILLARY
                                              No. I didn’t mean that. 
                            BILL
           This campaign’s a circus and 
           I’m Bozo the fuckin’ Clown!

                                 BILL
                        Yes, you did. That’s why you don’t 
                        return my calls. Why you don’t 
                        answer my letters. 

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s not true. I’ve been so busy 
                        with all these projects--

                                 BILL
                        It’s goddamn true. You use Nixon’s 
                        impeachment as an excuse and I’m 
                        supposed to be fine with that 
                        because he’s the President?
                                 (MORE)
                                 BILL (CONT'D)
                             (fed up)
                        I turned down Gary Hart so I could 
                        follow you to Oakland. I gave up 
                        working the South for McGovern just 
                        to be with you.

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s not fair. I’m down here 
                        because I’m trying, Bill. But 
                        everyone’s making it so damn hard. 

           She loses it. But she will not cry. Not in front of Bill. 

                                 HILLARY
                        I can’t deal with this right now. 

           She heads for the door when Bill stops her.

                                 BILL
                        Where are you going?

                                 HILLARY
                        Your mother hates me. Your brother 
                        hates me. Your staff hates me. I 
                        want to go where I’m not hated, 
                        where I’m not a consolation prize!

           She grabs the doorknob but Bill won’t let her open it. He 
           reaches for her but she swats him away. Everything about him 
           and his world repulses her right now. DON’T TOUCH ME!!!!

                                 HILLARY
                        I really tried. I tried and tried. 
                        I thought I could make this work 
                        but I can’t. I can’t do this. 

                                 BILL
                             (softening)
                        Then don’t. If you can’t handle the 
                        campaign, don’t.

           Her heart breaks.

                                 HILLARY
                        I mean us.

           “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” by the Rolling Stones...

           INT. TAXICAB - DAY

           ...plays on the radio. Above it, a handwritten note of “Due 
           to gas shortage, fare is doubled the posted amount” rests on 
           the meter that jumps from $5.05 to $5.10.
           The cab driver looks through the rearview mirror. A beat 
           before he pulls the sports section from The Chicago Tribune. 
           As he reads about the upcoming Super Bowl between the 
           Minnesota Vikings and the Miami Dolphins, we linger on...

           ...the main section of the Tribune with the headline of 
           “Supreme Court to hear United States v. Nixon” and “Illinois 
           Rejects Equal Rights Amendment.”

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        What’ll it be, young lady? You 
                        gonna get out or what?

           In the backseat, Hillary vacantly stares out toward her 
           childhood home around the intersection. She spots Mrs. Rodham 
           stepping out of the house to get the mail. 

           What Hillary needs right now is her mother. Her hug and her 
           love. All she has to do is open the door.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m sorry. Can you go back to 
                        O’Hare?

                                 CAB DRIVER
                             (whatever)
                        Okay. I have to fill up first.

           EXT. CHICAGO SUBURBS - DAY

           The cab pulls away from the intersection. After a decade of 
           Vietnam, political unrest, and Nixon’s presidency, this once 
           charming neighborhood drowns in pessimism and cynicism.

           The Little League field is now filled with homeless vets who 
           drink away their misery. Perhaps a few drug addicts as well.

           In stores, American electronics stand alongside identical 
           Japanese ones at half price. In dealerships, why buy a used 
           fuel-guzzling Chevy Malibu at $3,500 when you can purchase a 
           brand new high mpg Toyota Corolla for $2,200?

           The Gas Station that once had cheery attendants wiping and 
           cleaning your car at 31.5 cents per gallon is now a Mobil
           with a line of cars that stretches around the block. 

           The cab drives past a sign of “Even numbered plates only. 10 
           gal max” to a pump designated for commercial vehicles. 
           EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

           Hillary, Doar, and Joe Woods climb up the steps toward the 
           Supreme Court. The press spots them, runs down, and passes 
           them and approach Leon Jaworski and Jill Wine Volner.

                                 JILL VOLNER
                        The White House counsel argues that 
                        his client is as powerful a monarch 
                        as Louis the Fourteenth and is not 
                        subject to the processes of any 
                        court in the land.

           The reporters have their cameras and microphones aimed at the 
           photogenic Jill Wine Volner who points to the building.

                                 JILL VOLNER
                        Let’s see what this one court has 
                        to say about that.

           Hillary sees the reporters fawning over Volner who smiles 
           toward the camera before she climbs up to the Supreme Court. 
           On the repeated CLICK CLACK sound of her heels against the 
           marble steps, the Rolling Stones song fades. CLICK CLACK.

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           CLICK CLACK. Hillary pulls a sheet out of a typewriter. She 
           inserts a new one and types away. CLICK CLACK.

           ON THE TYPEWRITER, these following words appear.

                                 ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT.

           RESOLVED, that Richard M. Nixon, President of the United 
           States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors...

           And the rest of the words are SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN as...

           INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

           The Doar and the Jaworski teams face a Supreme Court of eight 
           white men and one Thurgood Marshall. As St. Clair steps up to 
           present his side of the case...

           ...Hillary opens the thick manuscript by C. Vann Woodward. 
           She slides it over to Joe Woods and points to a section. 
           Woods tears off the page and jumps out of his seat.

                                 JOE WOODS
                        Mr. St. Clair can shelter his 
                        client behind executive privilege 
                        all he wants but the truth is that 
                        36 Presidents before Nixon have 
                        never been accused of secretly 
                        using government agencies to defame 
                        or discredit political opponents 
                        and critics, to obstruct justice...

           As Joe Woods continues, Doar pats Hillary on the back. 
           Meanwhile, Joe shows a tape recording of Richard Nixon’s oath 
           of office with Warren Burger.

                                 JOE WOODS
                        Heretofore, the previous 36 
                        Presidents have never been accused 
                        of creating secret investigative 
                        units to engage in covert and 
                        unlawful activities against private 
                        citizens and their rights.

           The justices watch themselves on TV as Richard Nixon has his 
           hand on the Bible and vows to an entire nation.

                                 RICHARD NIXON (ON TAPE) 
                        ...will to the best of my ability, 
                        preserve, protect and defend the 
                        Constitution of the United States.

                                 JOE WOODS
                        I could not have said it better 
                        myself, your honors.

           A second typewriter pounds away at the keys. It’s William 
           Weld. He points to a word on Hillary’s typewriter.

                                 WELD
                        You misspelled “surreptitious.”
                                 HILLARY
                        Where?

                                 WELD
                        Here. You wrote “surreptititious.”
                             (re: an index card)
                        See? Only one tit. You have two 
                        tits.

           Weld’s wordplay doesn’t register on either of them. 

                                 WELD
                        “...surreptitious payment of 
                        substantial sums of money for the 
                        purpose of obtaining the silence or 
                        influencing the testimony of 
                        witnesses, potential witnesses, or 
                        individuals who participated in 
                        such unlawful entry and other 
                        illegal activities.”

           Hillary yanks out the paper from the typewriter and starts 
           over. As the CLICK CLACK of typing continues...

                                 WELD
                        “Endeavoring to misuse the Central 
                        Intelligence Agency, an agency of 
                        the United States.”

           LATER, Weld feeds hundreds of index cards and memos into the 
           shredder. But by Hillary’s desk, she feeds newspaper 
           clippings of Bill’s campaign into her shredder.

           SUPERIMPOSE typewritten words of: On June 17, 1972, agents 
           of... the President committed unlawful entry... for the 
           purpose of securing political intelligence

           The first shredding of The Arkansas Democrat hurts. Even the 
           next one about Bill’s campaign from the Yale Law Alumni 
           newsletter. But subsequent ones get easier and easier.

           Shredding an article about the 3rd congressional district 
           Democratic primary where Bill Clinton gets 59,697 votes while 
           his three main opponents split the rest.

           Then she shreds the next article about the Democratic primary 
           runoff where Bill Clinton gets 37,788 votes to Gene 
           Rainwater’s 17,011 votes.

           Then more articles that show Bill’s campaign taking shape. 
           With Paul and Mary Fray, Jim McDougal, and Vince Foster. 
           Arkansas Attorney General Jim Guy Tucker endorsing Bill. 
           Finally, her failed Washington Bar Exam letter and Betsey’s 
           chart comparing Weld to Clinton. She shreds it, purging the 
           last remnants of the biggest distraction of her life.

           She walks to Weld’s desk to shred more documents. Then 
           watches Weld type a new set of words. 

           “Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, 
           engaged personally...”

           “To conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert 
           activities.”

           “Making or causing to be made false or misleading statements 
           to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees 
           of the United States.”

           EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

           Reporters stick their recorders toward Chief Justice WARREN 
           BURGER who stands with the other justices on a united front.

                                 WARREN BURGER
                        Special Prosecutor has proven a 
                        sufficient likelihood that the 
                        tapes contain conversations 
                        relevant to the indictment.

           Standing behind the justices, Doar and Woods walk off. 
           Nussbaum taps Hillary to pull her away this limelight.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        Come on, Rodham. Our work’s just 
                        getting started.

                                 WARREN BURGER
                        In reaching a unanimous decision, 
                        the Supreme Court rejects President 
                        Nixon’s claim to an absolute, 
                        unqualified Presidential privilege 
                        of immunity from judicial process 
                        under all circumstances.

           As Burger speaks, SUPERIMPOSE the typewritten words of:

                                Article 2: Abuse of Power.

           “He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret 
           Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or 
           disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens...”
           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Department of Justice vehicles roll into the compound. 
           Outside the gates, protestors all want Nixon’s resignation.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: “...acted in a manner contrary to his trust as 
           President and subversive of constitutional government, to the 
           great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the 
           manifest injury of the people of the United States.”

           Alexander Haig, Pat Buchanan, and Donald Rumsfeld watch as 
           Jaworski and the DOJ confiscate every single tape.

           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Doar looks at a document titled “Articles of Impeachment.” He 
           finishes reading it and looks up at Hillary.

                                 DOAR
                        Take out the sections on Cambodia 
                        bombings and income tax fraud.

                                 HILLARY
                        But we have enough evidence.

                                 DOAR
                        Let’s stick to Watergate. 

                                 HILLARY
                        But--

           Doar tears the document to shut her up.

                                 DOAR
                        How we deal with Mr. Nixon will set 
                        a legal precedent for all future 
                        impeachments. Our purpose isn’t to 
                        bring down President Nixon on every 
                        single charge but to uphold 
                        democracy and the Presidency.

           Hillary nods. She finally understands.

                                 DOAR
                        Do it again.
           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Accompanied by federal agents, Nussbaum carries a box inside. 
           Weld opens the box and finds a few tapes. Can this be???

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        This is the tape recording between 
                        Nixon and the former White House 
                        Chief of Staff right after the 
                        Watergate break-in.

           Hillary pulls out a tape marked “Roosevelt Room. 6/23/72.”

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        This is it. The smoking gun.

           Nussbaum inserts the tape into the recorder. And as Nixon’s 
           incriminating voice is heard...

           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Doar reads “ARTICLE 3: CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS” on the document.

                                 HILLARY
                        I need another day to make it 
                        perfect.

           Doar hands The Articles of Impeachment back to Hillary.

                                 DOAR
                        No. This is great.

                                 HILLARY
                        This isn’t about Nixon. It’s about 
                        the future of the American 
                        Presidency.
                             (off Doar’s wry smile)
                        I’ll give it one more pass.

           INT. HILLARY AND WELD’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Hillary types the latest version when Weld approaches her 
           with a stack of index cards.

                                 WELD
                        Here’s the transcript of The 
                        Smoking Gun tapes. Nixon is cooked.

           She types “Wherefore, Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, 
           warrants impeachment and trial and removal from office.”
                                 WELD
                        Over five hundred thousand index 
                        cards to make three articles of 
                        impeachment.

           Off her nod, he shreds the last index cards.

                                 WELD
                        When we turn this over to Congress, 
                        we’ll all be unemployed. Have you 
                        thought about what you’ll do next?

                                 HILLARY
                        Maybe I’ll be a lawyer.
                             (off Weld’s laugh)
                        What’s so funny? You don’t think I 
                        can be a good lawyer?

                                 WELD
                        I think you can be anything you put 
                        your mind to. But a lawyer? No.

                                 HILLARY
                        Why not? How hard can it be to pass 
                        the bar exam?

                                 WELD
                        Passing the bar’s the easy part. 
                        The hard part is finding a wife.

                                 HILLARY
                        What the heck does that mean?

                                 WELD
                        You’ll need a wife to take care of 
                        all your personal needs so you can 
                        focus on your career.

                                 HILLARY
                        Maybe I should get a wife.

                                 WELD
                        You can’t get a wife. You’re a 
                        woman.

                                 HILLARY
                        That’s not very fair.
                             (Weld shrugs)
                        What if I wasn’t a woman? Think I 
                        can be a lawyer then?

                                 WELD
                        If you weren’t a woman, I think 
                        you’d be President.
           He kisses her on the cheek. He grabs his jacket and walks 
           toward the front door.

                                 WELD
                        Remember me when you get to the 
                        White House, okay, Yalie?

           She finishes typing, pulls out the sheet, and places it in 
           the folder labeled “ARTICLE 3: CONTEMPT OF CONGRESS.”

           INT. DOAR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nussbaum reads from the folder of “ARTICLE 1: OBSTRUCTION OF 
           JUSTICE.” Joe Woods from “ARTICLE 2: ABUSE OF POWER.” And 
           Doar closes folder 3 and hands it back to Hillary.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        This is it. We are ready.

                                 HILLARY
                        Good luck in Congress tomorrow.

                                 NUSSBAUM
                        You’re coming with us, Miss Rodham. 
                        You earned it.

                                 JOE WOODS
                        You can even wear a mini-skirt like 
                        Jill Volner.

                                 HILLARY
                        Only if you will.

           The men burst into laughter. Hillary heads for the door but 
           Doar has one last bit to say to her.

                                 DOAR
                        You were the best choice for the 
                        job, Miss Rodham.

                                 HILLARY
                        Thank you, sir.

           INT. THE HOUSE OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           With the inner circle of the Doar team watching from the 
           front row, Congressman Peter Rodino speaks to the House 
           leadership, including Tip O’Neill and Carl Albert.
                                 PETER RODINO
                        On Article 1: Obstruction of 
                        Justice, the House Judiciary 
                        Committee votes 27 to 11 in favor 
                        of impeachment.

           Hillary catches Volner pumping her fist in triumph.

                                 PETER RODINO
                        On Article 2: Abuse of Power, the 
                        House Judiciary Committee votes 28 
                        to 10 in favor of impeachment.

           Hillary seems baffled by Doar who seems overcome by sadness. 

                                 PETER RODINO
                        On Article 3: Contempt of Congress, 
                        the House Judiciary Committee votes 
                        21 to 17 in favor of impeachment.

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HOTEL BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Hillary and the entire team eat their final meal together. A 
           somber mood fills the air as Doar gives the final speech.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        I want to tell you that this moment 
                        is a triumph for democracy. I want 
                        to convince you that we used the 
                        constitutional right of impeachment 
                        to force a man out of office but...

           Overcome with emotion, he gathers himself.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Thirty years ago, Dr. Oppenheimer
                        led a team of the brightest 
                        scientific minds to build the 
                        hydrogen bomb because he believed 
                        that it was the only way to stop 
                        the World War. After we dropped the 
                        bomb on Hiroshima, he said...
                             (chokes on words)
                        “When you see something that is 
                        technically sweet, you go ahead and 
                        do it and you argue about what to 
                        do about it only after you have had 
                        your technical success.”

           Now Hillary understands Doar’s sudden sadness.
                                 JOHN DOAR
                        Together, we built the impeachment 
                        process to cripple a President. Let 
                        us pray that we never use or abuse 
                        this power again. 

           Hillary exchanges somber looks with her closest associates, 
           each now feeling the full weight of Doar’s burden.

                                 JOHN DOAR
                        You are forty-three of the 
                        brightest legal minds I have ever 
                        known. You have your entire life in 
                        front of you. Please, please do not 
                        let this committee be the legacy of 
                        your time on earth. 
                             (in Hillary’s direction)
                        As you continue your journey, 
                        please remember what Dr. Robert 
                        Oppenheimer said...
                             (to everyone)
                        “There are children playing in the 
                        streets who could solve some of my 
                        top problems in physics, because 
                        they have modes of sensory 
                        perception that I lost long ago.”
                             (again to Hillary)
                        Do not lose your sensory 
                        perception. Do not lose your moral 
                        compass. Do not lose sight of why 
                        you chose your life’s path.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE OVAL OFFICE - DAY

           A letter for Dr. Kissinger sits at the Resolute desk. Dated 
           August 9, 1974, it reads:

           Dear Mr. Secretary,

           I hereby resign the Office of President of the United States.

           As the hand signs “Richard Nixon...”

           INT. CHILDREN’S DEFENSE FUND - DAY

           Hillary takes a sip of coffee from her old mug and sets it 
           back down on Marian Wright Edelman’s desk.

                                 MARIAN
                        If I were you, I’d take the 
                        editor’s job at Ms. magazine.
                                 HILLARY
                        Gloria Steinem doesn’t want me. She 
                        wants Wonder Woman.

                                 MARIAN
                        No shit. Those feminists can be 
                        crazy bitches sometimes.

           They laugh. Hillary feels comfortable, feels at home.

                                 HILLARY
                        Can I get my little office back?

                                 MARIAN
                        It’s messy just like you left it.

           Hillary stands up but Marian gestures her back down.

                                 MARIAN
                        You can have any job in the world. 
                        Why do you still want to work here?

           Marian is serious. Hillary really thinks about it.

                                 HILLARY
                        When my grandmother Della divorced 
                        my grandfather, she abandoned my 
                        mother Dorothy when she was just 
                        four years old. For fourteen years, 
                        my mother grew up abandoned by her 
                        own mother. Then...
                             (recalls Dorothy’s pain)
                        Then one day, out of the blue, 
                        Della calls her and asks her to 
                        live with her and her new husband 
                        in Chicago. Della promised my 
                        mother a new start, even offered to 
                        pay for my mother’s college.

           Hillary grips her mug to prevent herself from shaking. But 
           that makes the shaking worse. She sets the mug down.

                                 HILLARY
                        When my mother moved back to 
                        Chicago, she found that Della 
                        wanted her only as a housekeeper.
                             (tearing up)
                        Heartbroken, my mother moved into a 
                        small apartment and found an office 
                        job paying two dollars a day. Once 
                        I asked my mother why she went back 
                        to Chicago even if she knew... And 
                        she said. She said...
           Hillary wipes her eyes, tries to collect herself.

                                 HILLARY
                        She said “I had hoped so hard that 
                        my mother would love me that I had 
                        to take the chance and find out.” 
                        Every abandoned child I see, I see 
                        my mother. 

           Off Marian’s smile, Hillary manages a teary smile back.

                                 MARIAN
                        Can I offer you one bit of advice? 
                        I know you can do anything your 
                        mind wants to. In fact, I expect no 
                        less. But...
                             (beat)
                        Are you strong enough to follow 
                        what your heart needs you to?

           Off Marian’s gaze, Hillary’s eyes land on her coffee mug.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           Nixon speaks as President one final time. 

                                 RICHARD NIXON
                        Good evening. This is the 37th time 
                        I have spoken to you from this 
                        office, where so many decisions 
                        have been made that shaped the 
                        history of this Nation.

           EXT. DUPONT CIRCLE, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

                                 RICHARD NIXON (V.O.)
                        I have never been a quitter. To 
                        leave office before my term is 
                        completed is abhorrent to every 
                        instinct in my body. But as 
                        President, I must put the interest 
                        of America first.

           Hillary rearranges the trunk space of a Volkswagen. Behind 
           her, Sara holds the last box containing Hillary memento’s 
           from her CDF cubicle: her mug, the NASA rejection letter, the 
           framed diplomas, a photo of Hillary with Gerald Ford (now 
           President), and a photo of Bill and Hillary at Yale.

           Hillary grabs the box but Sara refuses to let go.
                                 SARA
                        He's just a country lawyer. Do you 
                        love him that much?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t even know if I love him. 
                        But I have to take the chance and 
                        find out.

                                 BETSEY  (O.S.)
                        WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!

           From a block away, Betsey runs toward them, not giving a shit
           about traffic as she jaywalks across the street.

                                 BETSEY
                        Where the hell are you going?!

                                 HILLARY
                        Arkansas.

                                 BETSEY
                        You can’t both be President!

           Hillary pauses, stares at her box. Betsey is right. A beat.

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t care.

           Hillary shoves the box into the trunk and closes it.

                                 BETSEY
                        Like hell you don’t!

           Betsey flings opens the passenger door and throws clothes, 
           shoes, and plates back to the curb.

                                 HILLARY
                        Betsey, what are you doing? Stop.

                                 BETSEY
                        If you’re going, I’m going.

                                 HILLARY
                        But it’s fourteen hundred miles.

                                 BETSEY
                        Yeah. That’s fourteen hundred miles 
                        to beat some sense into you.
                             (to Sara)
                        Why are you evicting her?!

                                 SARA
                        I didn’t. It wasn’t my decision.
                                 BETSEY
                        But it’s your car. Dammit, Sara.
                             (holds out her hand)
                        Gimme the keys. GIMME THE KEYS!!

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                                 NIXON
                        Therefore, I shall resign the 
                        Presidency effective at noon 
                        tomorrow. Vice President Ford will 
                        be sworn in as President at that 
                        hour in this office.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

           The Volkswagen drives past 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue which, as 
           you can imagine, is chaotic.

           INSIDE THE CAR, Hillary is cramped in the middle between 
           Betsey and Sara in a packed car.

                                 BETSEY
                        Look outside. This is what you’re 
                        giving up. The White House.

                                 HILLARY
                        I’m fine with that.
                             (at peace with herself)
                        Yeah. I’m fine with that.

                                 NIXON (V.O.)
                        By taking this action, I hope that 
                        I will have hastened the start of 
                        that process of healing which is so 
                        desperately needed in America.

           EXT. THE NATIONAL MALL - DAY

           The Volkswagen drives past the Congressional Hotel. Then the 
           Capitol. Then heads toward the National Mall.

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        How about the Senate? Don’t you 
                        want to be a Senator?

           Now the Volkswagen drives past the Supreme Court.

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        Perhaps the first woman Chief 
                        Justice. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BETSEY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        You can wear anything under the 
                        robe. You don’t even have to wear 
                        the Wonderbra. Or any bra.

           Now the Volkswagen crosses the Potomac, leaving behind 
           Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. 

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                                 NIXON
                        I shall leave this office with 
                        regret at not completing my term, 
                        but with gratitude for the 
                        privilege of serving as your 
                        President for the past 5 1/2 years. 

           EXT. THE PENTAGON - DAY

           The Volkswagen passes The Pentagon as it leaves the city.

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        How about the Pentagon? Maybe you 
                        can be Secretary of State.

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        I don’t want to be Secretary of 
                        State. Just drive, Betsey.

           The Volkswagen gets on the highway, entering Virginia.

                                 SARA (O.S.)
                        How about Secretary of Energy? 
                        We’re low of gas.

           INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                                 NIXON
                        To have served in this office is to 
                        have felt a very personal sense of 
                        kinship with each and every 
                        American. In leaving it, I do so 
                        with this prayer: May God's grace 
                        be with you.

           EXT. ROUTE 29 - DAY

           The Volkswagen drives through a rural highway. And while the 
           entire country is under a cloud of pessimism, the day cannot 
           be any brighter for Hillary.
                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        Does he know you’re coming?

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        No.

                                 BETSEY (O.S.)
                        So what are you going to do when 
                        you show up at the doorstep?

                                 HILLARY (O.S.)
                        Maybe I’ll get on my knee and ask 
                        him to marry me.

                                 BETSEY
                        Oh really now. Can he keep his last 
                        name or will he take yours?

                                 HILLARY
                        I don’t care what he does. But I’m 
                        keeping mine.

                                 BETSEY
                        Miss Hillary Rodham?

                                 HILLARY
                        Ms. Hillary Rodham.

           The sign indicates at least 1,000 more miles to Arkansas. And 
           as they bicker all the way down Route 29...

           FADE OUT.

           Bill Clinton lost to Hammerschmidt in 1974. Clinton succeeded 
           Jim Guy Tucker as Arkansas Attorney General in 1976.

           Betsey Wright ran Clinton’s subsequent campaigns for Arkansas 
           Governor and served as his chief of staff. She was deputy 
           chair of Clinton’s 1992 Presidential Campaign.

           William Weld became a two-term Governor of Massachusetts. In 
           1997, Clinton nominated him as Ambassador to Mexico. In 2006, 
           Weld ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York.

           Jim Guy Tucker, Jim McDougal, and Susan McDougal served 
           prison terms for their involvement in the Whitewater scandal 
           which opened the door to impeachment of Bill Clinton. 

           Bernard Nussbaum became White House Counsel, overseeing 
           Whitewater and the investigation of Vince Foster’s suicide. 
           He resigned after Clinton ignored his advice to not appoint 
           Kenneth Starr as independent counsel.
           Kenneth Starr’s investigations of Monica Lewinsky and Paula 
           Jones led to the impeachment of Bill Clinton, using the legal 
           procedure developed by Hillary Rodham in 1974.

           Marian Wright Edelman continues her crusade for the rights of 
           children. Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of 
           Freedom in 2000.

           Jim McDougal passed away in 1998. During his final month in 
           office, Clinton pardoned Jim Guy Tucker and Susan McDougal
           for Whitewater and Roger Clinton for cocaine possession.

           Hillary Rodham served on the board of the Children’s Defense 
           Fund and became the first female partner at The Rose Firm 
           where she performed pro bono cases for child advocacy. She is 
           the first First Lady with a graduate degree and the first 
           First Lady who sought public office. She is the most 
           prominent Secretary of State since Henry Kissinger.
