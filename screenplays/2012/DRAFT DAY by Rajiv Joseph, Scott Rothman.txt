           FADE IN:

           INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - MORNING

           It’s early morning.  Radio City is empty.  Almost 
           ghostly.  We see thousands of empty seats...

           A large stage with a giant NFL BANNER hanging behind a 
           podium....

           Tables and chairs for Teams and Media...

           The WAITING ROOM for the top draft prospects...

           As we see these places, the echoes of the place are 
           heard.  Things like, “With the first pick in the 1998 NFL 
           Draft, the Indianapolis Colts take...”

           Intercut with NEWS CLIPS/PHOTOS of famous #1 draft picks 
           (i.e. O.J. Simpson, Terry Bradshaw, Bo Jackson, Troy 
           Aikman, Michael Vick, etc.)... 

           Sounds of CROWDS CHEERING AND BOOING...ANNOUNCERS 
           critiquing draft picks and NFL GMs...

           We see a GIANT BANNER of ALL 32 NFL TEAM LOGOS...then 
           slowly ZOOM IN ON:

           THE BUFFALO BILLS LOGO.

                                                           MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. SONNY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           CLOSE ON: THE BUFFALO BILLS LOGO.  

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Nobody can predict the future. 

           Still close on the Bills Logo, we PAN OUT to see that it 
           is emblazoned upon a plaque that reads:

           IN LOVING MEMORY - COACH SAMUEL “SONNY” WEAVER SR. BILLS 
           HEAD COACH 1985-2007.  There’s a photo of the old coach.  

                                 ANOTHER MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sure, but you gotta get lucky SOMETIMES, 
                        right?

           We zoom out to see that this brand-new plaque is still in 
           bubble wrap, sitting on a chair, amid a pile of clothes.
           We then see a radio alarm clock on a bedside table and 
           realize we’re listening to local sports radio.  

                                 RADIO HOST #1 
                        One would think luck would come your way, 
                        one would think, but for the Bills, for 
                        the city of Buffalo, even when we’re 
                        lucky, we’re unlucky. 

           We’re in a nice but unremarkable bachelor apartment in 
           downtown Buffalo.  SONNY WEAVER JR., 40’s, sits on his 
           bed, staring into space.

                                 RADIO HOST #2
                        I’ll tell you what the real problem is:  
                        Sonny Weaver JUNIOR.

                                 RADIO HOST #1 
                        Not Senior.  Senior, rest in peace, was a 
                        saint.

                                 RADIO HOST #2 
                        Right.  I’m talking bout Junior.  As 
                        General Manager, he has run this team 
                        into the ground in just four years.  And 
                        now, today, we’re looking at a nice plump 
                        7th overall pick and I just want to watch 
                        and see how Weaver screws this up.  I 
                        really do.  

                                 RADIO HOST #1 
                        Is the team leaving?  Is this gonna be 
                        the Los Angeles Bills next season?

                                 RADIO HOST #2 
                        Depends who you ask.

           Sonny grabs a PAD OF BRIGHT GREEN PAPER, scribbles 
           something, tears it off and stares at it.

                                 RADIO HOST #1 
                        Shameful.  You’re almost glad Coach 
                        Weaver isn’t around to see his son sell 
                        us down the river...

           The radio is suddenly snapped off by--

           ALI, 35, a beautiful, sharply dressed woman, exiting his 
           bathroom.  They stare at each other.

                                 ALI
                        Look, Sonny, this is not the end of the 
                        world.  You know?  
           Sonny stares at her.

                                 SONNY
                        You look nice.

                                 ALI
                        Shut up. 

                                 SONNY
                        You do.

                                 ALI
                        Can you please address the topic at hand?

           Sonny stares at the floor.

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Okay, this wasn’t part of the plan.  But 
                        now it is.  So can you please just say 
                        something to me?  Let me know how you’re 
                        processing this?  Please?

           A beat.  He stares at her and then down to the ground.  
           He crumples the piece of green paper.

                                 SONNY
                        Do you want to keep it?

                                 ALI
                        Do I want to keep it?

                                 SONNY
                        I mean.  First things first. 

                                 ALI
                                 (disappointed, not angry)
                        Jesus, Sonny.

                                 SONNY
                        You had to tell me today?  Why today?

                                 ALI
                        Because I found out yesterday and so I 
                        wanted you to know.  I need you to know. 
                        I thought you’d be happy.  
                                 (beat)
                        Yes.  I’m “keeping it”.

           She starts to leave.  Then stops.

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        You suck.  Do you know that?  You fucking 
                        suck.  
                                 SONNY
                        Ali...

           She walks out.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Ali!

           The door slams.  Sonny throws the green paper across the 
           room and steps on a remote control, clicking the TV on by 
           accident. 

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Oww...shit!

           ESPN!  Music and fanfare.

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        ...That’s right! It’s draft day!  32 
                        teams, 7 rounds...the fate of 224 
                        collegiate athletes will be decided 
                        today...

           Sonny goes and looks-- 

           OUT THE WINDOW

           And sees Ali peel off, hitting some garbage cans as she 
           does.

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #2
                        Well, Michigan quarterback Bo Callahan’s 
                        is the number one overall pick.  That’s a 
                        lock.  He’s going to Detroit.  

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        Oh, he’s a once-in-a-lifetime, ready for 
                        prime time bluechipper.  But everyone 
                        else?  Who’s going in the first round for 
                        the next 31 teams?  Who’s the number one 
                        pick for YOUR TEAM?  It’s anyone’s guess.  

           Sonny watches Ali stop the car, get out, and put the 
           garbage cans back where they were.  

           A PHONE RINGS.  Sonny grabs his cell...but it’s not 
           ringing.  His other cell is.  He picks that one up.  

                                 SONNY
                        Ali, look, I....

           THE SCREEN SPLITS
           To show a middle aged woman, MARIE in her kitchen.  
           (NOTE: The split screen will be a “thing” throughout) 

                                 MARIE
                        Nope.  Marie Michaels calling from Tom 
                        Michaels phone.  He asked me to try and 
                        get you while he stuffs his face with 
                        pancakes, Sonny.  It’s disgusting.

           We see TOM behind her, shoveling pancakes into his mouth.  

                                 SONNY
                        Hey Marie.  How’s the weather in Detroit?  

                                 MARIE
                        Terrible.  I’m sorry about Coach, Sonny.  
                        How’s Mom holding up?  

           Sonny takes the BILLS PLAQUE OF COACH SAM “SONNY” WEAVER 
           off his chair and turns it over, face down.

                                 SONNY
                        Hanging in there.  She wanted me to thank 
                        you for the flowers. 

           Tom speaks unintelligibly, his mouth full of pancakes.

                                 MARIE
                        Tom says you need to make a decision.

           Tom grabs the phone from her, still chewing.  

                                 TOM
                                 (into phone)
                        Your number one this year, your number 
                        one next year and your first rounder the 
                        year after that.   

                                 SONNY
                        No thanks.  

                                 TOM
                        I know what it sounds like... 

                                 SONNY
                        It sounds like you’re trying to sodomize 
                        me.

                                 TOM
                        I would never do that.  

                                 SONNY
                        Our number one this year and our next two 
                        number twos.  
                                 TOM
                        I need number ones, not number twos.  

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not selling the farm.

                                 TOM
                        You should.  Your farm sucks and I have 
                        the golden ticket.  If I give it to you, 
                        you get to save football in Buffalo.

                                 SONNY
                        That’s...overly dramatic.

                                 TOM
                        Your 7th pick gets you, what?  A running 
                        back with a rap sheet and bad knees?  You 
                        are staring down the barrel of a gun, 
                        kiddo.  Sell the farm.  Pick Number One.  
                        Get Bo Callahan.  Win.

                                 SONNY
                        Why don’t you take him?

                                 TOM
                        I have a quarterback.  

                                 SONNY
                        So do I.   

                                 TOM
                        Brian Drew?  Are you talking about Brian 
                        Drew?  Jesus, Sonny, you are hilarious.  
                        Look, you have 10 seconds and then I have 
                        to go to work.  Tell me we have a deal or 
                        go fuck yourself.

                                 SONNY
                        Enjoy your pancakes, Tom.

           Sonny hangs up.  Split screen ends.  Sonny walks off.

           INT. SHOWER - MORNING

           Sonny stands under the water, eyes closed, girding 
           himself for the day ahead.

           INT. SONNY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sonny dresses in an impressive power suit and tie.  ESPN 
           still blaring on TV, anchors arguing, as insanely 
           impressive GAME CLIPS OF BO CALLAHAN, superhero QB, play.
                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        We’re talking about a once in a 
                        generation player--

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #2
                        I’m not arguing that--

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        What are you arguing then?

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #2
                        Nobody’s saying Bo Callahan isn’t the 
                        finest raw quarterback prospect since 
                        Elway--

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        You just said that.

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #2
                        No.  I said Callahan is gonna be BETTER 
                        than Elway.

                                 ESPN ANCHOR #1
                        This is stupid.  Callahan’s going to 
                        Detroit number one, no question.  Let’s 
                        talk about picks two through thirty-two.  
                        Because that, as the kids say, is wide 
                        open...

           Sonny flips the TV off.  He grabs the crumpled piece of

           INT. SONNY’S CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           Nice car.  Same local hosts on the radio.  As Sonny 
           drives, he looks out the window at Allentown, a depressed 
           section of Buffalo.  PEDESTRIANS wear Bills jerseys.

                        Look, if it was easy everyone would do 
                        it.

           Sonny notices a bunch of GOING OUT OF BUSINESS and FOR 
           SALE signs on the storefronts...

                        was Sonny’s Dad who picked him, but Sonny 
                        gave him the franchise tag.  And now we

                        how it is down there.  The part they got 
                        wrong is that we started it.  Those guys 
                        came at us.  They were big, too.  My boys 
                        did what they felt was right.

                                 MOLINA
                        I was talking about Nana.
                                 SONNY
                        You sure made it sound like--

                                 MOLINA
                        Just make a splash, Sonny.  That’s what I 
                        need you to do.  It’s why I went out four 
                        years ago and brought you back home.  
                        When nobody else would.  I need to sell 
                        tickets.  If I don’t sell tickets here, I 
                        sell tickets somewhere else.  

                                 SONNY
                        You can’t move the Bills.  I grew up 
                        here.  These people are--

                                 MOLINA
                        Save me the prodigal son bullshit. 
                        You fired your own father.    
                                 (beat)
                        May he rest in peace.

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus, Roger....

                                 MOLINA
                                 (sternly)
                        Hey.  I stood behind you.  When have I 
                        not stood behind you?  
                                 (beat, smiles)
                        That was delicious though.  Felt like I 
                        had front row seats to some awful Greek 
                        tragedy...  

           Roger watches the whale jump again.  Splash.

                        Oh you poor beast.  Jumping through hoops 
                        for some half-dumb crazy old sonofabitch.

                                 SONNY
                        You know Roger, I don’t know what the 
                        hell you’re talking about sometimes. 

                                 MOLINA
                        Then let’s talk about the draft.  As you 
                        know, our shiny new head coach wants a 
                        shiny new running back.  

                                 SONNY
                        You said you would stay out of it.  Let 
                        me do my job.
                                 MOLINA
                        And I will but...whaddya say we get that 
                        for Coach Penn?  Coach Penn has Super 
                        Bowl rings.  He coached the Cowboys, you 
                        know.

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.  I know that, Roger.

                                 MOLINA
                                 (sadly)
                        The Cowboys have the best helmets.

                                 SONNY
                        Look, you have to let me do my job or 
                        there’s no reason for me to be here.  I 
                        don’t want Ray Banks.  I want Vontae 
                        Mack.  He’s special.  He’ll make our 
                        whole defense--

                                 MOLINA
                        Defense doesn’t make a splash.

                                 SONNY
                        I thought we were talking about winning 
                        football games.

                                 MOLINA
                        We’re talking about making a splash.  

           Whale jumps.  Splash.  

                                 MOLINA (CONT’D)
                        People pay to get wet, Sonny.

           Sonny snaps the radio off and holds up his hand again. 

           Still not shaking.   

           He stops at a red light.  He picks up his phone and

           THE SCREEN SPLITS 

           And shows VONTAE MACK, 20s, outside linebacker.  Think 
           Ray Lewis.  His athleticism is only overshadowed by his 
           big personality.  He’s driving too.  Bluetooth in ear.

                                 VONTAE
                        Sonny Weaver Junior!  Tell me something 
                        that’s gonna make Vontae smile.  
           As Sonny speaks, his side of the split screen shows GAME 
           CLIPS OF VONTAE BEING AWESOME next to Vontae speaking.   

                                 SONNY 
                        The draft doesn’t start until eight, 
                        Vontae.  

                                 VONTAE
                        Who you picking?  If I were you I’d take 
                        a lightning quick middle linebacker who 
                        can murder the gaps in a 3-4.

                                 SONNY 
                                 (joking)
                        Totally agree.  You have Reggie Wilson’s 
                        number down at Purdue? 

                                 VONTAE
                        I’m not stupid.  You don’t take me at 
                        seven, I drop down to twenty or twenty-
                        one.  I watch ESPN’s Draft Tracker!  I 
                        know who’s picking who and I can’t fall 
                        to twenty.  I can’t take a twenty pick 
                        paycheck.  Vontae needs a seven pick 
                        paycheck.  Got a gaggle of nephews need 
                        to get fed.

                        Nephews!  Say hello to Mister Sonny 
                        Weaver Junior!

           We see Vontae is driving a minivan with FOUR LITTLE BOYS.

                                 BOYS
                        Hello Mister Sonny Weaver Junior!

                                 VONTAE
                        I’m taking them to tumbling.  Nephews 
                        love to tumble.  Nephews!  You love 
                        tumbling, yes or no?

                                 BOYS
                        Yes!

                                 VONTAE
                        You hear that Mister Sonny Weaver Junior?  
                        They love tumbling.  See, that is the 
                        difference between them and me.  I do not 
                        like tumbling.  Especially if I’m 
                        tumbling thirteen picks.  Feel me?  
                                 SONNY
                        Vontae, forget about what I’m doing.  You 
                        gotta run your own race.  

                                 VONTAE
                                 (quietly)
                        Listen, I am seriously SWEATING here, 
                        Sonny. I just want you to know that.  The 
                        number seven pick will make triple of 
                        what I get at twenty.  And then I’m 
                        looking at taxes, agent, manager, and 
                        then I got my nephews.  I need you to do 
                        me up, Weave.  For real.  

                                 SONNY
                        Everything will work out in the end, 
                        Vontae.  It always does.

                                 VONTAE
                        Okay, okay.  I never said sorry about 
                        your Dad, yo.  That sucks.  

                                 SONNY
                        Thank you.

                                 VONTAE
                        Mine died, too.  I’m a man because of 
                        him.  You gonna be fine.  

           BEEP.  Another call coming in: UNKNOWN NUMBER.

                                 SONNY
                        I gotta go.  

                                 VONTAE
                        Okay...Vontae...nephews...out!

           Vontae’s screen is quickly replaced by...DOTTIE, 75, an 
           extremely excitable and worried older woman.

                                 SONNY
                        Hello?

                                 DOTTIE
                        It’s Dottie Wilson! From next door!

                                 SONNY
                        Mrs. Wilson?  Are you okay?

                                 DOTTIE
                        There’s a fire!

                                 SONNY
                        What?  
                                 DOTTIE
                        Your mother is in the backyard and she’s 
                        making a fire!

                                 SONNY
                        She’s “making a fire”?  Mrs. Wilson, what 
                        are--

                                 DOTTIE
                        I’m not crazy!  Your mother calls me 
                        crazy, but there she is, in the backyard, 
                        burning things and you gave me your 
                        number and told me to call you if--

                                 SONNY
                        Wait, Mrs. Wilson, is the fire out of 
                        control, or--

                                 DOTTIE
                                 (deeply crazy)
                        I don’t know!  Fire is fire!  All living 
                        things are frightened of fire!  You can’t 
                        control fire!  Come quick!

                                 SONNY
                                 (to himself)
                        Shit...
                                 (he hangs up; shouts)
                        I DO NOT NEED THIS TODAY!

           Sonny makes a U-Turn.

           EXT. WEAVER HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny’s car screeches to a halt in the driveway of a nice 
           ranch home with some land in East Aurora, a town outside 
           Buffalo.  He gets out and sees:

           A huge bonfire and his mother, BARB WEAVER, 60s, tough, 
           still beautiful, tossing FOOTBALL STUFF into the fire 
           (jerseys, newspaper clippings, photos, etc.).  

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus.

           Sonny walks by - THE NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE - as he goes to his 
           mother.  Dottie is at the window.

                                 DOTTIE
                        Do something!  Please!
                                 SONNY
                                 (containing his anger)
                        Will do, Miss Wilson!  Thanks for the 
                        call!

           He walks on to his mother.  She doesn’t look at him.  

                                 BARB
                        They’re reading his will today.  

                                 SONNY
                        You know, Canton would take half this 
                        stuff.    

                                 BARB
                        They can sift through the ashes.  Are you 
                        coming?

                                 SONNY
                        To what?  

                                 BARB
                        His will, Sonny.  I told you, they’re 
                        reading his will.  

                                 SONNY
                        Why even ask?  C’mon, Ma.  You know what 
                        today is.  Please stop.

           Sonny makes her stop.  

                                 BARB
                        You’re taking Vontae Mack, aren’t you?

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t know yet.  

                                 BARB
                        He’s undersized.  Slow.  

                                 SONNY
                        It’s the guy, not the numbers.  Vontae 
                        could be one of the best middle 
                        linebackers we’ve ever--

                                 BARB
                        Ray Banks ran a 4.2 forty.

                                 SONNY
                        So what. 

                                 BARB
                        Backwards.  
                                 SONNY
                        No he didn’t.  
                                 (beat)
                        Did he?  

                                 BARB
                        That’s the word.

                                 SONNY
                        Vontae Mack is raising his dead sister’s 
                        four sons.  That says something.

                                 BARB
                        You and your father.  I swear it’s like 
                        you’re running a charity sometimes.  

                                 SONNY
                        What’s going on?  Are you okay?

                                 BARB
                        I suppose I miss my dead husband a 
                        little.  What kind of question is that, 
                        ‘am I okay’?  
                                 (beat)
                        I wish you and Dad had patched things up.  

                                 SONNY
                                 (coldly)
                        Well, we didn’t.

                                 BARB
                        You’re grown men, you should have 
                        resolved your differences.

                                 SONNY
                        I could have told him why I fired him.  
                        Would you have liked that?  Should I have 
                        told Dad the whole story?

           A long silence.  They stare at the fire.  She throws a 
           game ball on the fire.  He grabs it out of the fire.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        This is from the ‘89 Oilers Game! 

                                 BARB
                        What a waste.  Dying for a stupid game...

           They watch the fire.  Sonny looks at the football he just 
           saved.  It’s covered with autographs of the players.  He 
           sees his father’s autograph: a very simple SONNY WEAVER.

                                 SONNY
                        You know...it’s not a bad fire.
                                 BARB
                        I’m happy with it.

           A ridiculous car horn honks.  They look to see COACH 
           RANDY “DOC” WOODSON, getting out of a giant Cadillac.  

           Woodson, 60s, prickly, brilliant, brash, larger than 
           life, a coaching legend.  Think Bill Parcells with a dash 
           of Jerry Glanville.  Sonny hates him. 

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus, what’s he doing here?

                                 BARB
                        We’re having brunch.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re having brunch?

                                 BARB
                        Yes, Sonny.  Brunch.

           He stares at her.  This info enrages him.

                                 SONNY
                        Whatever, Mom.  Burn the fucking house 
                        down for all I care.

           He leaves.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny walks to Woodson.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re blocking my car.

                                 WOODSON
                        No hug for Uncle Woody?
                                 (squinting into distance)
                        What’s she got going on there?  A fire?

                                 SONNY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 WOODSON
                        We were gonna have brunch, talk about new 
                        and exciting ways for me to spend my 
                        retirement years, hear your Dad’s will 
                        being read, maybe watch the draft later.  
                        I like Vontae by the way, but Ray Banks, 
                        that’s a lot to pass up.  
                                 SONNY
                        She just lost her husband. 

                                 WOODSON
                        And I just lost my friend.  

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah?  What kind of person sleeps with 
                        his friend’s wife?

           A beat.

                                 WOODSON
                        I’ve known your folks since freshmen 
                        year, Sonny.  Forty-two years. 

                                 SONNY
                        I know...

                                 WOODSON
                        He was gonna introduce me in Canton this 
                        fall. 

                                 SONNY
                        Lucky him.  

                                 WOODSON
                        There’s not a part of that man I didn’t 
                        know and admire and on my best day I’d 
                        like to think the feeling was vice versa.   

                                 SONNY
                        You got a hell of a way of showing it, 
                        Coach. 

           Woodson and Sonny in a mini stare down.  

                                 WOODSON
                        I’d pick Vontae Mack. 

           Woodson’s the first guy to agree with Sonny on Vontae.    

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah?  Why?

                                 WOODSON
                        He’ll get you one of these.

           Woodson shows Sonny his three Super Bowl rings.   

                                 SONNY
                        Wow, coach, hadn’t noticed your three 
                        Super Bowl Rings before.  You know most 
                        people would just wear one. 
                                 WOODSON
                        Most people don’t have one.  Remember you 
                        used to ask me if you could wear them?

                                 SONNY
                        I was seven.  Move your goddamn ugly car.

           Woodson smiles, walks to his Cadillac.

                                 WOODSON
                        Better relax, kiddo.  Gonna be a long 
                        day.

           Woodson gets in the Cadillac and backs out.

           INT. SONNY’S CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           Sonny drives.  He holds up his hand and looks at it.

           It’s shaking a little now.

           Sonny shakes the hand violently, then tries again.

           Still shaking.

           He lowers his hand and rolls his head around his neck.  
           Clearly bothered.  Clearly uncomfortable. 

           He takes out his cell.  Stares at it.  Looks up and sees 
           A GIANT TRUCK stopped at a red light.

           Sonny SLAMS ON THE BRAKES!  Screeching, he’s definitely 
           going to crash....but he doesn’t.  Barely.  

           Sonny is a wreck.  Sweating, panting, shaking...  

           INT. GAS STATION RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny washes his face, looks up into the dirty mirror.

           He stares at himself, then turns to go.  But his eyes 
           fall on something...

           Amid the graffiti on the walls, someone has written, 
           almost childlike, almost sweetly: GO BILLS.  

           Sonny stares at it for a long moment.

           He takes out his phone.  Makes a call.  
           INT. SONNY’S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Sonny’s driving again and back in a SPLIT SCREEN with Tom 
           Michaels, Detroit GM, owner of the #1 pick.

                                 SONNY
                        Our first round pick this year, our first 
                        round pick next year and the year after 
                        that.  

                                 TOM
                        And your first rounder the year after 
                        that.

                                 SONNY
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        You heard me.

                                 SONNY
                        That wasn’t your offer.

                                 TOM
                        I changed my offer.  We lived in a 
                        different world a half hour ago.  I made 
                        you a fair offer and you told me to 
                        “enjoy my pancakes”, which I interpreted 
                        as a vague ethnic slur.

                                 SONNY
                        You’ve been bugging me about those three 
                        number ones for two months... 

                                 TOM
                        You’re panicking, Sonny.  And I intend to 
                        take advantage of that.  

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not panicking.

                                 TOM
                        Your next four first round picks.

           Sonny pulls into the Buffalo Bills Administrative and 
           Training Facility in suburban Orchard Park, twenty 
           minutes from downtown Buffalo.  

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Anybody home?

           The building is massive.  Looks like an industrial park.  
           There’s a small practice field next door and down the 
           street Ralph Wilson Stadium is seen (where Bills play).
           Sonny stares ahead.  Deep breath.

           INT. BILLS COMPOUND - MORNING

           The place is sleek and constantly reminds one of the 
           team’s past success (trophies, pennants, photos, etc.) 

           Sonny looks shell-shocked.  He seems to be drifting 
           through the halls.  PEOPLE pass and say hello, but he’s 
           somewhere else...floating...right into...

           INT. WAR ROOM - MORNING

           The war room.  The epicenter.  An excited balance between 
           intelligent debate and pure chaos.

           This is a huge room with a large unbelievably messy 
           conference table.  Food, coffee and papers EVERYWHERE.  
           And more food.  Tons of food.  Not healthy food.  

           A white marker board on the wall.  One side says: VONTAE 
           MACK.  The other: RAY BANKS.  Pros and cons for both.

           A huge pull down TV screen on another wall plays TAPE of 
           both guys.  On another wall is a floor to ceiling “draft 
           board” - hundreds of players ranked by position.

           Sonny is still in a daze.  He surveys the room, all the 
           people, all the processes that make this team work...

           There’s about ten people here, mainly scouts, all men, 
           all in suits, and we’ll meet them all in good time.   

           The one person not wearing a suit and not eating crap 
           (he’s in shorts and eating yogurt) is the Bills’ intense 
           wunderkind COACH PENN, 40.  Think Jon Gruden.  He’s in 
           the midst of a one-sided argument with a wide-eyed scout.

                                 COACH PENN
                        Ray Banks.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        But Sonny--

                                 COACH PENN
                        Ray Banks.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        I’m telling you, Sonny doesn’t--

                                 COACH PENN
                        Ray Banks.  
           Sonny enters, taking the whole scene in.

                                 COACH PENN (CONT’D)
                        Nice of you to show up, Sonny.  I was 
                        just telling your man here that we’re 
                        taking Banks at 7.  Am I right or are you 
                        crazy?

           Sonny walks over to the dry erase board...and erases both 
           Vontae and Ray’s names.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        What are you doing?  

                                 SONNY
                        I just made a trade with Detroit.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        For--

                                 SONNY
                        The number one pick.  

           Everyone shares looks as we...

           CUT TO

           RICK THE INTERN walking down the hall carrying coffees 
           which he promptly drops upon hearing EVERYONE SHOUT FOR 
           JOY!

           CUT BACK TO

           The war room.  Everyone high-fiving.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        You got us Bo fucking Callahan?

                                 SONNY
                        I got us the number one pick.  Now we 
                        need to figure out if it’s going to be Bo 
                        Callahan.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        What did we give up?

                                 SONNY
                        Our number one pick...

                                 SCOUT #3
                        And?

                                 SONNY
                        Our first round pick next year...
                                 SCOUT #4
                        That’s okay...

                                 SONNY
                        And the year after that...

           That one hurts.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Well, it’s a lot but when you have the 
                        chance at--

                                 SONNY
                        And the year after that.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Four consecutive first rounders?  That’s 
                        our future.  

           Sonny almost looks dizzy... the words “Our Future” echo 
           in a distorted way and the edges of Sonny’s sight get 
           blurry... everyone’s voice sounds too deep.  Then:

                                 SONNY
                        No.  
                                 (beat; he’s back)
                        Bo Callahan is our future unless we can 
                        find a good reason why he’s not.  

           Sonny sees Coach Penn leave, SLAMS the door behind him.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Why he’s NOT!?  Are you crazy?  He’s the 
                        best player in the draft!  We pick him!

                                 SONNY
                        You have 90 minutes to find one good 
                        reason why we shouldn’t.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Sonny, all due respect, that’s a huge 
                        waste of time.  We already did our due 
                        diligence.

           Sonny looks at him and walks over to him.

                                 SONNY
                        Well, I’d hate to waste your time, 
                        Greenberg.  Maybe you should pack up and 
                        go home since you have so many better 
                        things to do.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        That’s not what I me--
                                 SONNY
                        Because I’m taking this first pick very 
                        seriously.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        I am t--

                                 SONNY
                        I take my job seriously.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Sonny--

                                 SONNY
                        And I won’t waste my time with ass-mats 
                        who don’t want to WORK for this TEAM!

                                 SCOUT #3
                        He didn’t mean anything by it, Sonny.  
                        It’s just that... I mean, Bo Callahan?  
                        Who else would we pick?

                                 SONNY
                                 (calming; right at Scout #1)
                        I know we already looked at Bo.  Look at 
                        him again.  I need you to find out 
                        everything we missed before, find answers 
                        to every question we never thought to ask 
                        before.  I want to know what his favorite 
                        toothpaste is, what his resting heart 
                        rate is, what his Mom’s resting heart 
                        rate is.  Everything we overlooked when 
                        we watched his films last December.   
                        Stats only tell us what happened.  Not 
                        how.  Not why.  We have about ten hours 
                        to do about ten months worth of looking 
                        under and between the stats, so get off 
                        your asses and get busy.  

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Sonny walks down the hallway.  He’s sweating, but trying 
           to keep it together.  

           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE AREA - MORNING

           As Sonny enters his big but disheveled office, he hears a 
           voice on the phone.

                                 RICK(O.S.)
                        I know and I can appreciate that but I’m 
                        just filling in for--
           Sonny is surprised to see Rick, the intern who dropped 
           the coffees before, taking his calls.

                                 SONNY
                        Where’s Ali?

                                 RICK
                                 (into phone)
                        Yes, can you just hold on one second...?

                                 SONNY
                        Where’s Ali?

                                 RICK
                                 (into phone)
                        Thank you, I’ll be right with you...just 
                        hold.

                                 SONNY
                        Where the fuck is ALI!?!

                                 ALI (O.S.)
                        I’m right here.

           Ali is standing in the doorway to Sonny’s office. 
           Surprise: The girl from the beginning is also Sonny’s 
           assistant.  She’s holding a box with her things.  

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been?  

                                 SONNY
                        What is he doing here and why are you 
                        holding that box?

                                 ALI
                        This is Rick.  He’s an intern.
                        He’s taking my place today.

                                 SONNY
                        He’s what?

                                 ALI
                        He’s taking my place.  He can do 
                        everything I can.  He’s been here for a 
                        year.  

                                 SONNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 ALI
                        I quit.

           Sonny stares at her, before--
                                 SONNY
                                 (to Ali)
                        Rick, go get a soda or something.

                                 RICK
                                 (holds up phone)
                        It’s...Robert Attenweiler from ESPN.  He 
                        heard a rumor.

                                 SONNY
                        Tell him to go fuck himself.  
                                 (to Ali)
                        Okay.  Cancel all media requests.  Tell 
                        people to stop forwarding me emails...

                                 ALI
                        Tell him.  Talk to Rick.  I quit.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re not quitting.  

                                 RICK
                        You want a soda?

                                 SONNY
                        No!  I don’t want a god damn soda!

                                 ALI
                        Don’t yell at him.  Give us a second, 
                        Rick.

           Rick leaves.  Sonny closes the door behind him.

                                 SONNY
                        Look, I’m sorry.  About how I responded 
                        this morning... it was just, I was 
                        just...in shock, and...

                                 ALI
                        I’m not mad at you.

                                 SONNY
                        Yes you are.

                                 ALI
                        No, I’m not.  I put you in a weird 
                        position.  But I have to make a decision. 
                                 (beat)
                        I’m moving back home.  

                                 SONNY
                        What are you...Ali, come on, you’re 
                        overreacting!
                                 ALI
                        I’m not overreacting, I’m REACTING. Which 
                        is what you couldn’t do.  You should know 
                        this about me by now.  I do not sit 
                        around waiting for things to happen.

                                 SONNY
                        No.  No, not today.  You can’t quit.  You 
                        can’t...you’re leaving me and quitting on 
                        the same day?  Draft day?

                                 ALI
                        The timing’s never gonna be right.

                                 SONNY
                        You can’t go.

                                 ALI
                        I’m going.

                                 SONNY
                        You CAN’T GO!

           She turns to leave.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        I just made a trade with Detroit for the 
                        number one pick.

           She stops, turns back to him.

                                 ALI
                        Whoa.

                                 SONNY
                        I know.

                                 ALI
                        For today’s number one overall?

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.

                                 ALI
                        Whoa.

                                 SONNY
                        I know.

                                 ALI
                        What’d you give up?
                                 SONNY
                        Our number one picks for the next four 
                        years.

                                 ALI
                                 (cringes)
                        Whoa.

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.

           A voice in the next room starts yelling like crazy...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        What the fuck do you mean you don’t 
                        know?!  Are you fucking retarded!?  Get 
                        me the things I fucking need now or I 
                        will have you fucking fired!

           Sonny closes his eyes.  The pressure is mounting 
           everywhere.

                                 SONNY
                        Please.  Ali.  Do not leave today.  Give 
                        me one more day.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        No, the other one.  THE OTHER ONE!  You 
                        fucking goat, get your head out of your 
                        ass!

           Ali opens the door to see Scout #1 laying into Rick, who 
           is on the verge of tears.

                                 ALI
                        What’s going on?

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Who the fuck is this?  

                                 ALI
                        This is our intern.  Rick.  What do you 
                        want?

                                 SCOUT #1
                        We need every tape of Callahan like, 
                        YESTERDAY,and suddenly every tape of 
                        EVERYONE is AWOL and shitshow johnny over 
                        here doesn’t have a fucking clue where 
                        they are!

                                 ALI
                        Game tape is in the archives.  Chill. 
                        Out.
                                 SCOUT #1
                        They changed the punch code!

                                 ALI
                        Oh for christ sake, everyone in this 
                        building is a fucking child!  I will get 
                        it.  Okay?  I will get the Callahan 
                        tapes.  Rick, handle lunch orders and all 
                        of Sonny’s calls, will you?  Hank, don’t 
                        ever yell at another intern like that.  
                        Go back in the war room.  Your tapes will 
                        be there shortly.

           Scout #1 thinks of saying something, then thinks better 
           of it.  Ali sticks her head in at Sonny who is sitting at 
           his desk with his head in his hands.

                                 ALI (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking care of this one thing, and 
                        then I am gone.

           She leaves.  Rick sticks his head in, very timidly.

                                 RICK
                        Um... Sonny?

                                 SONNY
                        What?  

                                 RICK
                        Brian Mackenmaker’s on line 3.  

                                 SONNY
                        Shit.  Already?

                                 RICK
                        And Brian Drew’s called three times in 
                        the last five minutes.  

                                 SONNY
                        Christ...can’t deal with him today.  When 
                        he calls back, just tell Drew I’m in 
                        meetings all day but will call tomorrow.  
                        Mackenmaker on 3?

                                 RICK
                        Yeah.

           Sonny breathes deep, takes the phone.

                        Mackenmaker!  How’s my favorite super 
                        agent?

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        What a coup, Sonny.  What a coup.    

                                 SONNY
                        C’mon, Bri.  Some of us didn’t go to 
                        Harvard.  What’s a coup?  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        You went to Princeton, asshole. 

                                 SONNY
                        I know, we’re both a couple of ivy league 
                        douchebags.  How my favorite Wolverine?

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Bo loves playing in cold weather.  

           On Sonny’s cell, a call comes from: MOM.  As Sonny goes 
           to answer, his Mom’s face comes up in a “THREE-SCREEN”, 
           but then quickly disappears, when Sonny pushes REJECT.

                                 SONNY
                        I need to talk to him.

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                                 (playing stupid too)
                        Wait.  Talk to who?

                                 SONNY
                        I know Bo’s sitting right there, Brian.  
                        Put him on.    

           Sure enough, across from Brian on a couch is the perfect, 
           almost Amazonian, BO CALLAHAN, holding up two dress 
           shirts for approval.  Brian points at one of them.

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Gotta dash, Sonny.  Let’s talk later.    

           Brian hangs up.  Sonny looks at the phone.  That was 
           weird.  

           Sonny’s CELL RINGS.  MOM again.

                        What’s wrong with you?  You could have

                        Vontae Mack just tweeted it.  

                                 SONNY
                        He tweeted it?

                        Doc’s on Twitter.  He thinks you need 
                        to... 
                                 (to Doc in background)
                        ...what was that?

                                 DOC (O.S.)
                        Put on his big boy pants!

                                 MOM
                        He wants you to put on your big boy 
                        pants.  I don’t even know what that 
                        means.

                                 SONNY
                        He’s probably drunk.

                        And you sold a cow for magic beans.

           Coach Penn walks into the office and...casually lights 
           some papers on fire and throws them on Sonny’s desk.  
           They stare at each other over the flames.

                                 SONNY
                        I gotta go, Mom.  
           He hangs up.  Mom disappears.  Sonny and Penn stare each 
           other down.  Rick enters, screams, runs out. 

           Ali comes in, rolls her eyes, grabs a fire extinguisher 
           and blasts the fire out on the desk.

           Neither men have moved or reacted to any of this.

                                 ALI
                        Can I get you gentlemen some coffee?

                                 SONNY
                        None for me.  Coach?

                                 PENN
                        No thank you.

                                 ALI
                        Great...

           As she exits, she shakes her head and places the 
           extinguisher by the door.  

                                 PENN
                        Tell me: why am I here?

                                 SONNY
                        Existence is a mystery.

                                 PENN
                        You know what’s not a mystery?  How to 
                        win a football game.  That’s why I 
                        thought you brought me here, because I 
                        thought you wanted one of these...

           Penn shows Sonny his Super Bowl ring.

                                 SONNY
                        What is it with you guys showing--

                                 PENN

                        need a quarterback.  Brian Drew is 
                        serviceable.  I know I wanted a running 
                        back.  I know I wanted Ray Banks.  I know 
                        I had my choice of teams to go to last 
                        year and I chose this one.  I chose to 
                        coach this team.  Not the one you’re 
                        putting together on the fly because 
                        you’re freaking out because your old man 
                        died last week and you’re banging your 
                        assistant.

                        I remember.  I saw your highlight reel.  
                        I also remember he beat you.

                                 VONTAE
                        Watch it again.  But don’t watch me.  
                        Watch him.  Watch me sack him four times.  
                        Then watch what happens after. 

                                 SONNY
                        What happens after what?

                                 VONTAE
                        Just watch.

           Vontae hangs up.  As Sonny walks off, he sees his 
           oversized strength and conditioning coach, TONY “BAGEL” 
           BAGLI step out of his undersized Prius. 
                                 SONNY
                        Tony Bagel.  How’s my favorite strength 
                        coach?

                                 TONY
                        What the hell’d you do to Brian Drew?  

                                 SONNY
                        Good morning to you too, Tony.  And it 
                        just so happens I don’t know what I’m 
                        doing with the first pick yet so Drew’s 
                        not definitely--

                                 TONY
                        First pick?  What are you talking about, 
                        first pick?  

                                 SONNY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 TONY
                        Just that Brian Drew came in and wanted 
                        me to work him out a little yesterday.  
                        See how his knee is.  

                                 SONNY
                        Bad news?  

                                 TONY
                        Opposite of bad news.  The exact 
                        opposite.  He squatted four--

                                 SONNY
                        We told him to stay away from--

                                 TONY
                        Squatted four hundred.  
                                 (off Sonny’s reaction)
                        I know.  But what’s even more impressive 
                        is his arm.  Your star wide receiver 
                        Andre Bello’s been telling me about these 
                        secret workouts they’ve been doing 
                        together all winter, you know about 
                        those? 

                                 SONNY
                                 (no)
                        Yeah...

                                 TONY
                        Well Andre thinks Brian can throw a good 
                        fifteen yards deeper now, but I didn’t 
                        believe it until I saw what he benched 
                        yesterday.      
                                 SONNY
                        What did he--

                                 TONY
                        Two fifty.  Twenty times.  

           Sonny looks a little dazed.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Translation: Brian Drew is in the best 
                        shape of his life.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM - DAY

           Splashing of water.  Sonny’s head rises out of the sink.  
           He stares at himself in the mirror.  He is filled with 
           doubt.  Again.  But he shakes it off.

           INT. WAR ROOM - DAY

           Sonny enters.  

                                 SONNY
                        How’s my due diligence on Bo Callahan 
                        coming?  Find his weakness yet?

                                 SCOUT #4
                        Oh yeah.  Hundred percent.  He’s got a 
                        weakness for...banging hot chicks.

           Scout #3 shows Sonny his laptop.

                                 SCOUT #3
                        There’s a whole website dedicated to all 
                        the girls he’s--

                                 SONNY
                        Come on.  Someone’s gotta have something.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        He doesn’t speak French real good.  Got a 
                        C minus.

                                 SCOUT #2
                        And he used to bite his fingernails, but 
                        then, wait for it, now he doesn’t 
                        anymore.

                                 SCOUT #4
                        Hey Sonny, how many chicks you think a 
                        guy like that sleeps with, on average, 
                        per week?  I say twenty.  Minimum.
                                 SCOUT #2
                        I say ten.  That’s one and a half per 
                        day, which makes sense.  Two and a half 
                        sounds exorbitant.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Speaking as a former star quarterback in 
                        college...

                                 SCOUT #3
                                 (under breath)
                        Division One A...

                                 SCOUT #1
                        I’d say he averages three a day. 
                        Definitely doable.  He wakes up with one, 
                        has one for lunch, goes to bed with one.  
                        Maybe in the library a couple times a 
                        week he takes one back to the microfiche.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Yo, Sonny.  You see the song they made 
                        about you yet?

           Scout #3 turns his laptop to Sonny again...

           ON THE LAPTOP

           A shoddily made YouTube video.  We hear JOURNEY’S “DON’T 
           STOP BELIEVING”.  A FAT GUY with a Bills jersey sings. 

                                 FAT BILLS FAN
                                 (singing)

                        team...gonna make them take off for Los 
                        Angeles...

           The Scout fast-forwards...

                                 SCOUT #3

                                 (singing to chorus)
                        ‘...Don’t fuck up...my Bills, 
                        Sonny...just do your fucking job for

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Holy shit.  How many hits does-

           Sonny throws the laptop across the room.  It smashes 
           against the wall.  Oddly, nobody seems fazed by it.
                                 SONNY
                        I’m trying very hard to not completely 
                        lose my shit on all of you right 
                        now...but you’re not making it easy.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        So far, he’s still the best prospect 
                        we’ve ever seen, Sonny.

                                 SCOUT #3
                        We’ve been looking, Sonny.  I swear.  We 
                        couldn’t find anything before and we 
                        can’t now.  No other team could either.  
                        If Callahan can’t play football, nobody 
                        can play football.

                                 SONNY
                        C’mon.  Everyone has something, guys.  
                        Montana was too small...

           the back of his lineman’s head.

                        strength...

           receiver.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        We need to find what Bo Callahan's 
                        something is...then figure out if we can 
                        live with it.  I'm back in fifteen 
                        minutes and I want, no, I need to hear 
                        SOMETHING.  

           Sonny exits.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Walking, Sonny calls - SPLIT SCREEN - Tom Michaels, the 
           Detroit GM.  He answers in the Detroit war room.  

                                 TOM
                        Buyer’s remorse?
                                 SONNY
                        Why’d you make the deal?

                                 TOM
                        Same reason you did.  Best thing for my 
                        franchise.  

                                 SONNY
                        What knock did you find on Callahan?  

                                 TOM
                        We didn’t find anything.  Bet your guys 
                        haven’t either.  You need to trust what 
                        you see, Sonny. 

           Sonny sees Ali walking briskly down the hall with a 
           handful of files.  He motions for her to stop.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Sonny?  You there?  

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.  I’m here.  

                                 TOM
                        You feeling alright?  

                                 SONNY
                        Not even a little.  

           Sonny hangs up.  Ali approaches holding a ton of files.

                                 ALI
                        What’s wrong?  

                                 SONNY
                        Nothing.  Everything’s great.  

                                 ALI
                        That bad?

                                 SONNY
                        I thought you were quitting.  I thought 
                        you were outta here.

                                 ALI
                        I am.

                                 SONNY
                        Except you’ve got about 25 scouting 
                        reports on...
                                 (reads a file)
                        Ah!  Bo Callahan.  Doing homework?
                                 ALI
                        I’m just taking care of a few things 
                        before I go.

                                 SONNY
                        Those are yellow.  Those are old.  Who 
                        asked you for yellow reports?

                                 ALI
                        Nobody.

                                 SONNY
                        Really?

                                 ALI
                        I thought every piece of information 
                        would be useful, even scouting reports on 
                        Callahan in high school.  

           She starts to walk past him.

                                 SONNY
                        You can’t leave, can you?

           She turns back.

                                 ALI
                        What?

                                 SONNY
                        You’re too curious.  You’re too into 
                        this.  Ali, we got the NUMBER ONE PICK IN 
                        THE DRAFT!  How often does that happen?

                                 ALI
                        I’m just...

                                 SONNY
                        You’re just stalling.  Because you’re 
                        excited.  I can tell.  The day got a lot 
                        much more interesting didn’t it?

                                 ALI
                        We live in interesting times.

                                 SONNY
                        You got a pen?  

           She shows him she does.

                        I need a security check on Callahan.  Get 
                        Ralph on it, he does fuckall on draft 
                        day.  I want to know everything I don’t 
                        know.  Tell him to be ready to talk about 
                        it in an hour.

                                 SONNY
                        Callahan’s college coach.  His number 
                        should be in my contacts.  Just look 
                        under ‘Prick’.

                        Okay...

                                 SONNY
                        Callahan went to St. Edwards High School 
                        in Raymond, Kentucky.  See if you can  
                        get me his coach there too.  Then get Doc 
                        Fleischer to find Callahan’s medical 
                        records from the combines.  Have him go 
                        over them again and let me know if he 
                        sees anything new.  Oh.  Right.  I also 
                        want Doctor...

                        But I think it’s a pass, John.  

                                 JOHN MITCHELL
                        Are you looking somewhere else for number

                        I didn’t say that.

                        Who would you take instead?  A running 
                        back?  I can get you a running back!

                                 SONNY
                        Calm down John.  I don’t want you leaking-

                        I never said I needed a running back.  

                                 JOHN MITCHELL
                        Which back are you looking to draft?  Ray 
                        Banks?  Demarcus Miller?  

                                 SONNY

                        Your Dad drafted me.

                        Trust me.  I drafted you.  He wasn’t even 
                        looking at you before I told him to.  And 
                        when your knee crapped out and no one 
                        wanted you I brought you back here.  I’ve 
                        given you every chance--

                                 SONNY
                        I want you here.  I’ve always wanted you 
                        here.  

                                 BRIAN DREW
                        Then why take Callahan?  

                                 SONNY
                        You know why. 

                                 BRIAN DREW
                        Then trade me.

                                 BRIAN DREW
                        No.

                                 SONNY
                        Well get finished, and then get back to 
                        work.  If I trade you, I trade you.  If I 
                        don’t, I don’t.  Do yourself a favor and 
                        worry about Brian.  Don’t worry about Bo, 
                        and definitely, most absolutely fucking 
                        most importantly, do not bother me with

                        what we see.

                        Interesting...

                                 PETE
                        You seem surprised.  

                                 SONNY
                                 (covering)
                        Why would I be surprised?  Drew’s great.  
                        We love him here too.  I brought him here 
                        for chrissakes.  Why doesn’t anyone 
                        remember that?  

                                 PETE
                        Okay, Sonny.  You don’t need to play 
                        games with me.  What do you want for him?  
                        I’m all ears.  Let’s talk.

           Sonny suddenly stops in front of a trophy case. Sees a 
           picture of a victorious Brian Drew and his Dad walking 
           off the field, arms around each other.  

           Sonny shakes his head as if to wake himself up.

                                 SONNY
                        You know what...we’re still working out 
                        some stuff over here.  Call you back. 
           INT. RALPH’S OFFICE - DAY

           Sonny marches in and finds his big jolly Head of 
           Security, RALPH MOWRY, at his desk.  There’s a photo of

                        Sit the fuck down, Sonny.

           Sonny sits.  Ralph opens a file.  Reads.

                        Bo Ridley Callahan.  Born September 12, 
                        1988.  Columbus, Ohio.  Raised there 
                        before the family moved to Cleveland when 
                        he was fourteen so he could play for 
                        Coach Phillips at Fairfield Prep.  Only 
                        child.  Mom was a homemaker, father a 
                        medical malpractice lawyer.  Made some 
                        dough.  Pays his taxes.  Has three years 
                        left on his mortgage.  Dad got arrested 
                        for a DUI in ‘82 but doesn’t seem to have 
                        had problems since.  Mom has 
                        prescriptions for Lexapro for anxiety, 
                        propranolol for blood pressure and 
                        something called Retin-A which I think is 
                        supposed to make her look younger.  

                                 SONNY
                        Where do you get this stuff?  

                                 RALPH
                        Do you really wanna know?  

                                 SONNY
                        No I do not.  

                                 RALPH
                        Kid’s pretty vanilla.  Was in a few clubs 
                        in high school, had a walk on role in 
                        Damn Yankees, honor roll every semester 
                        from junior high through college, kept 
                        his nose clean, worked out and just, you 
                        know, threw footballs better than anyone 
                        ever has in the great states of Ohio and 
                        Michigan.  
                                 SONNY
                        But...

                                 RALPH
                        How do you know there’s a but?

                                 SONNY
                        Because you’re an unoriginal bastard, 
                        Ralph.  This is what you do.  You try and 
                        make me believe that’s it all good and 
                        then you save the bad stuff for the end.  
                        I think you think it’s dramatic rather 
                        than annoying.  But it is annoying.

                                 RALPH
                        I don’t do it every time...

                                 SONNY
                        But...

                                 RALPH
                        But last year at Michigan, Callahan and 
                        some other kids in his dorm got busted 
                        for a noise disturbance for some bash he 
                        threw for his twenty first birthday...

                                 SONNY
                        But...

                                 RALPH
                        But...they took the names of everyone at 
                        the party.  Over a thousand kids.  Musta 
                        been a great time.  

                                 SONNY
                        But...

                                 RALPH
                        Ask me who wasn't there.

                                 SONNY
                        Who wasn’t there?

                                 RALPH
                        Any of his teammates.  None of his 
                        teammates came to the poor guy’s birthday

                        You get Rick Moore’s number?  

                                 ALI
                        Yup.  Want me to call him?

                                 SONNY
                        Yup.

                                 (as he goes)

           Sonny walks in--

           Takes a seat.  His phone BUZZES.

                        That’s him!

           Sonny girds himself for this asshole, picks up the phone.

           SPLIT SCREEN - Coach Moore sits in his office at 
           University of Michigan.

                                 COACH MOORE
                        You’re about to be a very happy man.  Bo 
                        Callahan is some of my finest work.

                                 SONNY
                        What can you tell me about him?  

                                 COACH MOORE
                        I can tell you what I just told you: he’s 
                        some of my finest work.    

                                 SONNY
                        What else?

                                 COACH MOORE
                        You have the tapes.  He’s the real deal, 
                        Sonny.  Don’t overthink this like your 
                        Dad would have.  No offense.
                                 (realizing)
                        Sorry.  Look, I love Bo.

                                 COACH MOORE (CONT'D)
                        My coaches love him.  The cheerleaders 
                        love him.  The fans love him.  Everyone 
                        loves him.     

                                 SONNY
                        Then how come none of his teammates went 
                        to his birthday party?

           A beat.  

                                 COACH MOORE 
                        Are you kidding me with this?

                                 SONNY
                        Seems relevant.  

                                 COACH MOORE
                        You want to tear this kid down or what?

                                 SONNY
                        Just doing my due diligence.  You don’t 
                        think it’s odd that nobody on the team 
                        was at their beloved teammate’s twenty-
                        first birthday party?

                                 COACH MOORE
                        I don’t know, Sonny.  What do you think 
                        is more plausible?  That nobody on a 
                        sixty person squad attended a party 
                        thrown by the Captain?  Or that the cops, 
                        when they busted the party, mysteriously 
                        decided not to take down any players 
                        names because, being cops, and this being 
                        Ann Fucking Arbor, the last thing anyone 
                        here would ever want to do is imperil the 
                        Wolverine Football Squad.  Oh, no, wait, 
                        your theory seems right.  Bo 
                        Callahan...BO CALLAHAN...doesn’t have any 
                        friends.  Good luck with the draft today.  
                        Shithead.

           Click.  As Sonny lets that marinate, he gets another call 
           on his cell.  Looks at it.  Huh.  Answers.

                        Got an offer for number one.
                                 SONNY

                        corner and two number ones.

                        So make the deal.

                                 SONNY
                        You gotta give me some time.

                                 MAX
                        Time?  The draft’s in three hours, Sonny.  
                        Time is the one thing neither of us has.  
                        Make the deal.   

                                 SONNY
                        Give me one hour.

                                 MAX
                        I’ll give you half that.

                        Just got off the phone with Max Stone.

                                 PENN
                        How are things in Jacksonville?

                                 SONNY
                        Didn’t you ask when you called him behind 
                        my back?

                                 PENN
                        Fair question.  Can’t remember.
                                 SONNY
                        He offered me a very good deal for our 
                        number one.  But you already knew that.

                                 PENN
                        Listen, I’m an honest guy.  Max Stone’s 
                        an old friend.  He calls me up, 
                        congratulates me on the Callahan thing, 
                        and I tell him my opinions on the matter.

                                 SONNY
                        He called you, or you called him?

                                 PENN
                        Who remembers such things?

                                 SONNY
                        Fuck you, Vince.  I can and will fire 
                        your ass.  

                                 PENN
                        You “can” and “will” but you “can’t” and 
                        “won’t”.

                                 SONNY
                        I’d like us to work together here.

                                 PENN
                        Then let’s start doing that, Sonny.  
                        Let’s start doing that right now, huh?  

           Penn opens the war room door.

           INT. THE WAR ROOM - DAY

           Sonny and Coach Penn sit.  

                                 SONNY
                        Okay.  New deal for us to break down.  
                        Very interesting.  Jacksonville just 
                        offered...  

           As Sonny talks, his voice begins to fade as we see CLIPS 
           UPON CLIPS of various Jacksonville players as well as 
           hear THE GUYS BREAKING EACH DOWN.    

           However, the clips start coming faster and faster, and 
           the chatter becomes louder and louder, and more garbled, 
           and before long we start experiencing the same sensory 
           overload these guys must be feeling until we--

                                                               SMASH TO:
           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Dead quiet.  Sonny paces, nervous.  Doesn’t know what to 
           do.  He looks at his phone.  Scrolls through names.  
           Finds one, dials.  

           SPLIT SCREEN

           Shows the intense, paranoid, DANNY SALAZAR, GM of the 
           Seattle Seahawks, in his office.  

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        Salazar.  

                                 SONNY
                        Danny.  Sonny Weaver.  I need to bend 
                        your ear.  Off the record.  

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        You want to make a deal for Callahan?  

                                 SONNY
                        No.  

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        Someone else?  

                                 SONNY
                        No.  

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        I don’t get it.  

                                 SONNY
                        I need someone to run something by.  
                        There’s so few people who understand what 
                        we do.

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        Are you drunk?  

                                 SONNY
                        I just need an impartial party to ask a 
                        simple innocuous confidential question.  

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        Don’t fuck with me, Weaver.  I got it up 
                        to my neck today picking twenty eighth 
                        because my predecessor anally ramrodded 
                        this franchise.  

                                 SONNY
                        Jesus, Dan.  I just want to ask you 
                        something off the record.
                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        Yeah?  Great.  Go fuck yourself.  

                                 SONNY
                        What’s your problem?

                                 DANNY SALAZAR
                        You will not make a fool of me.  You fuck 
                        me, I will fuck you.  Did you hear that?  
                        I will fuck you, Sonny.  Call me back 
                        when you wanna make a deal.    

           He hangs up.  Sonny is amazed at where this all went.  

           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE AREA - DAY  

           Sonny sits on Ali’s desk.  

                                 SONNY
                        There’s a deal on the table from 
                        Jacksonville.  The number one pick for 
                        Maurice Johnson, Antonio Jennings, their 
                        first round pick this year and next.  

                                 ALI
                        What’s the war room think?

                                 SONNY
                        Split.  Penn wants me to do it.  

                                 ALI
                        But you don’t.

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t.  

                                 ALI
                        Why?  

                                 SONNY
                        It’s a good deal.  But...I don’t know...

                                 ALI
                        Why are you here, Sonny?  Isn’t this what 
                        the war room is for?

                                 SONNY
                        I can’t lie to you.

           A beat.

                                 ALI
                        Not about football.  
                                 SONNY
                        Not about football.

                                 ALI
                        What do you need to know about Callahan?

                                 SONNY
                        Remember the ‘89 Super Bowl?  The Joe 
                        Montana story?    

                                 ALI
                        Yeah, 49ers-Bengals.  Niners down by 
                        three..three twenty to play...93 yard 
                        winning drive, 10 yard pass to Taylor.

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah but before the drive...

           INSERT: REAL FOOTAGE OF THE GAME.  

                                 SONNY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Joe Montana’s in the huddle and 
                        unbelievably, somehow, spots the actor 
                        John Candy in the stands.  He points to 
                        him and asks the guys in the huddle, 
                        ‘Hey, isn’t that John Candy?’  They 
                        couldn’t believe the balls on the guy.  
                        To be that calm, at that game, at that 
                        time.  His guys instantly relaxed, they 
                        march ninety-three yards down the field, 
                        Montana throws the winning touchdown 
                        pass, Niners win the Super Bowl.  I want 
                        to know that’s what I’m getting. 

                                 ALI
                        No one gets that.  Not on draft day.

                                 SONNY
                        I know.  
                                 (beat)
                        The fact that this deal feels so right to 
                        Penn kinda scares the shit out of me.  

                                 ALI
                        Then don’t do it.  

                                 SONNY
                        But maybe I should....

                                 ALI
                        Sonny, do something or don’t do 
                        something, for Christ’s sake, but don’t 
                        wait.
                                 SONNY
                        Get Max Stone on the phone.  

                                 ALI
                        Please.  

                                 SONNY
                        Please.  

           Sonny walks into-- 

           INT. THE WAR ROOM - DAY

           Sonny rejoins his team.

                                 SONNY
                        It’s still Callahan.  I said no to 
                        Jacksonville.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Okay, Sonny.  We’re with you.    

                                 COACH PENN
                        The fuck we are.  With all due respect, I 
                        think that’s a bonehead move.

                                 SONNY
                        Well, if it helps, I don’t feel great 
                        about it either.  

                                 COACH PENN
                        It doesn’t help.  

                                 SONNY
                        Okay.  So.  We’re back on Callahan.  Do 
                        me a favor.  Let’s run the Michigan-LSU 
                        footage.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Sure thing, Sonny...

           Scout #1 looks for it on his laptop.  

                                 SCOUT #4
                        What’s up, Boss?  

                                 SONNY
                        Just doublechecking something.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Here we go...

           Scout #1 hits Play.  They all look at--
           THE VIDEO SCREEN

           It’s the start of the game.  

                                 SONNY
                        Fast forward to the first time Vontae 
                        sacks Bo.  

           Randy fast-forwards until he gets there.  When he hits 
           play, we see Vontae beat his man and burst up the middle 
           to lay a vicious hit on Bo Callahan.  

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Damn.  Bo didn’t even see him coming.  
                        His center basically waved Vontae in.  

                                 SONNY
                        Or Vontae wasn’t where the center thought 
                        he was.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Pretty impressive Bo held onto the ball 
                        after taking a hit like that.  That’s 
                        when having a brick shithouse for a QB 
                        comes in handy.  Look at him...he just 
                        popped right up.  

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Two hundred fifty pounds of tough to take 
                        down...

                                 SONNY
                        Go to the next play.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        The next sack?

                                 SONNY
                        No.  The next play after this one.  

           Randy fast-forwards to the next play.  Callahan drops 
           back to pass, jumps around in the pocket, seeming very 
           jittery...before throwing the ball...four feet over his 
           receiver’s head.  Sonny sees something.

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Not his best pass but--

                                 SONNY
                        He should never have thrown it.  Guy 
                        wasn’t open.  Can we fast forward to 
                        Vontae’s next sack?  
           Randy fast forwards again.  This time, Callahan drops 
           back and is immediately in deep shit as his linemen don’t 
           pick up the all-out blitz.  Amazingly, Callahan is able 
           to stiff-arm one guy...

                                 SCOUT #4
                        Good...

           Elude another guy...

                                 SCOUT #4 (CONT’D)
                        Nice...

           Before Vontae sacks him again.  

                                 SCOUT #4 (CONT’D)
                        Kid did all he could there.  

                                 SONNY
                        Let’s see what he does on the next play.  

           Randy fast forwards.  Bo drops back...and falls down.  
           He’s quickly tackled after.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        We watched this before, Sonny.  Barring 
                        those two plays, Callahan was brilliant.  
                        Threw fours TDS and ran for another to 
                        win it.  His last TD pass was a sixty 
                        yard bomb.

                                 SONNY
                        Can we fast forward to that, Randy?  

           Randy fast forwards.  We see Bo drop back again...and 
           again he’s under pressure.  As he does before, he stiff-
           arms a guy down to the ground to buy some time...

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Man, this kid is strong...

           Bo bounces around looking for an open man...

                                 SCOUT #4
                        He’s looking downfield...checking his 
                        progressions...staying calm...textbook...

           Bo rears back and unleashes a sixty yard bomb...that is 
           caught for a touchdown.  It’s pretty impressive. 

                                 SCOUT #1
                        See that?  The corner was draped all over 
                        him and Callahan made sure he put it on 
                        the guy’s back shoulder.

                        The only place the corner couldn’t get at 
                        it.  Who does that at this level?  Sick.  
                        Just sick.

                        Rewind it back to the start of the play.  

           Randy rewinds.  As the offense breaks out of the huddle--

                        Stop.  

           Sonny stands.  Goes up to the screen for a closer look.

                        What?  

                                 SONNY
                        What’s missing?  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        The fullback.  I know.  But Michigan runs 
                        most of their passing plays with an empty 
                        backfield.  

                                 SONNY
                        Try again.

           Everyone looks at each other.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        We give up.  

                                 SONNY
                        Where’s Vontae?  

           Sonny’s right.  Vontae’s not on the field.  

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Oh.  You know what?  I think he got 
                        ejected. 

                                 SONNY
                        He got ejected from the game?  For what?  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Yeah, after he stripped the ball from 
                        Callahan in the 3rd quarter and scored 
                        that TD.  He gave the ball to a fan.

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Bonehead move.  
                                 SONNY
                        Cue that up.

           They do.  Vontae sacks Callahan, returns the fumble for  
           a TD.  He then takes off his helmet and runs to the 
           stands, hands the ball to a WOMAN IN A HEADWRAP.

                        That’s not a fan.  That’s his sister.

           His cell chimes.  It’s a text from Ralph, the Security

                        Got a new Callahan story.  Talked to Jack 
                        Tate in Washington....

           INT. RALPH’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 RALPH
                        ....Apparently, the first thing they did 
                        when they got the number five pick was 
                        send all the guys they were looking at 
                        their playbook.  

                                 SONNY
                        Right.  We do the same thing.

                                 RALPH
                        Well they add their own little twist.  
                        They tape a hundred dollar bill to the 
                        last page.

                                 SONNY
                        Why?  

                                 RALPH
                        When they interview the guy they ask him 
                        if they read the whole playbook and all 
                        of them of course say yes.  Then half of 
                        the guys usually blush and get 
                        embarrassed and tell them they took the 
                        money.  The other half of the guys smile 
                        or laugh and just say thank you.  Ask me 
                        what your boy Bo Callahan did.  
                                 SONNY
                        I really hate playing this game with you. 

                                 RALPH
                        Ask.  

                                 SONNY
                        What did Bo Callahan do?

                                 RALPH
                        Neither.  

                                 SONNY
                        You lost me. 

                                 RALPH
                        He said yes he read it...and then said 
                        nothing.  

                                 SONNY
                        So? 

                                 RALPH
                        He had no idea about the hundred dollar 
                        bill, Sonny.  He lied.  He never read the 
                        playbook.  And when they told him about 
                        the hundred dollar bill he lied again and 
                        said something like, ‘Oh yeah, now I 
                        remember, yeah, good one’.  Jack said it 
                        was the second strangest response he had 
                        seen to the hundred dollar bill thing.  
                        Ask me what the first was.  

                                 SONNY
                        Goddammit, Ralph.  Just tell me.  

                                 RALPH
                        Bunch of years ago, he had a guy mail the 
                        money back to him once.  Put it in a card 
                        and wrote: Save this for when I win you 
                        the Super Bowl.  

                                 SONNY
                        Nice...

                                 RALPH
                        Ask me who it--

                                 SONNY

                        When I was in high school, the Bills had 
                        this placekicker, Joey Shanks.  Started 
                        out the ‘89 season, missed his first 
                        three attempts.  But Coach Weaver stood 
                        by him.  He said, ‘the kid nails em in 
                        practice. The kid kicks field goal after 
                        field goal for six straight hours in 
                        practice.’
                                 (beat)
                        I wrote Coach a letter.  I’m just this 
                        high school kid from Fairmount.  I tell 
                        him, don’t let Joey Shanks kick field 
                        goal after field goal in practice.

                        Because during actual games he stands on 
                        the sideline for 40-50 minutes at a time, 
                        and then has to come in and kick once.  
                        Make him practice that way.  Make him 
                        kick once, then have him stand to the 
                        side for 40 minutes.

                        I was just so pissed at Joey Shanks, I 
                        had to do something.  But Coach wrote 
                        back.  He offered me a job and I’ve been 
                        here ever since.

           Sonny FLUSHES.  Starts to walk out.

                                 ANDRE
                        Don’t even tell me you’re not gonna wash 
                        your hands, dude.  

           Sonny stops, turns back, washes his hands.  

           INT. THE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Sonny returns and Scout #1 hands him the phone.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Houston.

           Sonny grabs the phone.  

                                 SONNY
                        Nixon?

           SPLIT SCREEN

           Shows NATHAN NIXON, Houston’s nerdy GM, in his war room.  

                                 NIXON
                        Talk to me about Vontae Mack.

                                 SONNY
                        Why?  

                                 NIXON
                        Who cares why?

                                 SONNY
                        You’re thinking of picking him?  At 
                        fifteen?  

                                 NIXON
                        He’s got potential, no?  What else do I 
                        need to know? 

                                 SONNY
                        Uhhh...well...he’s a great kid.  

                                 NIXON
                        C’mon...

                                 SONNY
                        That’s what I know.

                                 NIXON
                        Quit being coy.  You didn’t think he was 
                        gonna fall to the second round, did you?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NIXON (CONT'D)
                        Somebody’s gonna take him, Sonny.  Tell 
                        me why that shouldn’t be me.

                                 SONNY
                        I’d never tell you how to do your job.

                                 NIXON
                        This is all you’re giving me?  What’s 
                        your problem?

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t have a problem, Nathan.  Much as 
                        you want me to, I can’t make your pick 
                        for you.

                                 NIXON
                        You find something with him?

                                 SONNY
                        I didn’t say that.  

                                 NIXON
                        You didn’t not say that.  

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not saying anymore.  He’s a great 
                        kid.  

                                 NIXON
                        Friend to a friend, Sonny, please, there 
                        an injury I don’t know about?  

           A beat.  Sonny really debates his next move.  Bites his 
           lip and...does something he finds morally questionable.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m in a tight spot here, Nate.  

                                 NIXON
                        So there is?  

                                 SONNY
                        I can’t say anything more.  Good luck 
                        tonight.

           Sonny hangs up.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        You okay, Sonny?

           Sonny walks out.  
           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Sonny comes out, bends over, hands on his knees.  He 
           doesn’t feel great about what just happened.  He kicks 
           the wall.  

                                 SONNY
                        Goddammit!

           As he takes some deep breaths, he sees...Coach Woodson?

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  What--

                                 WOODSON
                        Was just looking for you.  Your Mom’s in 
                        your office.   She needs to pow-wow.  
                        Says it’s urgent.  

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t have time for--
                                 (smells something)
                        Are you drunk?  

                                 WOODSON
                        We both are.  
                                 (beat, re: war room door)
                        That your war room? 

                                 SONNY
                        Stay out of there, Doc.

           Doc looks heartbroken.   

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.  I’m serious.   

                                 WOODSON
                        I can see that, Sonny.  

           He salutes Sonny...and walks right in. 

                                 WOODSON (CONT’D)
                                 (to war room)
                        Don’t get up, fellas!  Just here to say 
                        hi!

           We hear lusty cheers as Doc disappears into the room -- 
           he’s a living legend, everyone loves him.  Sonny thinks 
           about stopping him...takes out his cell instead.  Stares 
           at it.  Then puts it away.  Walks down the hall.    
           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Sonny enters and finds his Mom at his desk, looking 
           through the ashes from the Coach Penn fire incident.

                                 BARB
                        What happened?

                                 SONNY
                        What are you doing here?

                                 BARB
                        You look terrible.  

                                 SONNY
                        It’s draft day, Mom.  So I’ll ask you 
                        again: what are you--

                                 BARB
                        They read your Dad’s will.  And would you 
                        believe it, he wanted his ashes scattered 
                        at “his” field. 

                                 SONNY
                        The Bills practice field?  Here?

                                 BARB
                        Weaver Field.  Yes.  I’d like to do it as 
                        soon as possible.

           Barb plops a big urn on Sonny’s desk.

                                 SONNY
                        You can’t be serious. It’s...we’re making 
                        our pick in an hour.

                                 BARB
                        I won’t bother anyone.  I’m going to do 
                        exactly as he asked.   He wanted you to 
                        read this.

           She hands him a paper.

                                 BARB (CONT’D)
                        It’s a Gaelic blessing.

           Sonny looks at the paper...but doesn’t touch it.  

                                 SONNY
                        Now you’re saying?  You want to do all 
                        this now?  
                                 BARB
                        Yes.  I need to.  Right now.  So...I’m 
                        just going to walk out to the fifty yard 
                        line with you--

                                 SONNY
                        With me?  

                                 BARB
                        It’ll be quick.  We’ll just walk out 
                        together, dump his ashes and I can go 
                        home.

           Sonny kicks his desk.  He kicks it multiple times.  He’s 
           enraged and doesn’t even know why.

           He sees that Ali’s been watching him.  They stare at each 
           other, before he turns back to Barb.  Tries to calm down.

                                 SONNY
                        Tomorrow.  

                                 BARB
                        No.  

           A long beat.  

                                 SONNY
                        Mom...

                                 BARB
                                 (leaving)
                        No.

           He looks at Ali.  

                                 ALI
                        Do you want to kick that desk some more?  
                        I think it might still be alive.

                                 SONNY
                        Does anyone in this building still smoke?

                                 ALI
                        Ralph.

                                 SONNY
                        I need a cigarette.
           EXT. BEHIND THE BILLS FACILTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny and Ali sit on some stacked truck tires, probably 
           used as training weights, but now discarded behind the 
           building.  They both stare off at nothing.  Sonny smokes.

                                 SONNY
                        Whoever thought it meant that much to 
                        him.  Naming a dingy practice field 
                        WEAVER FIELD.  God, he took pride in the 
                        weirdest things.

                                 ALI
                        She’s just gonna dump the ashes and go?

                                 SONNY
                        What else are you supposed to do?

                                 ALI
                        I dunno.  Invite family and friends and 
                        stuff?

                                 SONNY
                        The memorial service was last week.  You 
                        don’t need two.

                                 ALI
                        Still.
                                 (beat)
                        Are you going to go up there?

                                 SONNY
                        No.

                                 ALI
                        Sonny, why not?

                                 SONNY
                        Everyone always gives me grief for firing 
                        my own dad.  I only did it because my Mom 
                        asked me to.  
                                 (beat)
                        More like told me to.  His doctor said 
                        stress was gonna kill him, but he 
                        wouldn’t retire.  Refused.  Mom was the 
                        fucking puppeteer.  She convinced him to 
                        get Molina to hire me as GM, then she 
                        convinced me to fire him.  

                                 ALI
                        That’s fucked up.
                                 SONNY
                        I know.  
                                 (beat)
                        Whatever.  She wants to dump his ashes, 
                        she can dump em.  With her boyfriend.  
                        But she’s not gonna walk into my facility 
                        on Draft Day and distract me, or my 
                        people.  

           Ali looking in a different direction, sees something.

                                 ALI
                        Um...that might not be the case...

           Sonny looks over.

           Everyone in the building is filing out and following Barb 
           up to Weaver Field.

                                 SONNY
                        No.  No.  No way...

           EXT. BEHIND THE BILLS FACILTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny runs up to everyone as they walk towards the field 
           as if to intercept them.

                                 SONNY
                        Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!  What’s going on here?  

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Sonny, we heard.  And we all thought...

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Look, they’re scattering Coach’s ashes, 
                        we’re gonna be there.  We loved him, 
                        Sonny.  We gotta take a moment.

                                 SONNY
                        We aren’t having a memorial service in 
                        the middle of the practice field!  How 
                        did you all even find out about this?  
                        Did Vontae Mack tweet it?

                                 WOODSON
                        Sorry, kiddo.  They asked why I was here.  

                                 SONNY
                        I told you to stay out of my War Room!

                                 BARB
                                 (sharply)
                        Sonny.  Please.
                                 SONNY
                        No!  Not PLEASE!  We have the NUMBER ONE 
                        OVERALL PICK IN THE DRAFT!  Have I lost 
                        my mind!?!

                                 SCOUT #3
                        Five minutes, Sonny?  Outta respect?

                                 SONNY
                        Fuck this.  Go.  All of you.  But I’m not 
                        going up there.  I AM NOT.  

                                 BARB
                        Stop being a child.  You need to read 
                        this.

           Sonny takes the piece of paper, and shoves it in 
           Woodson’s gut.

                                 SONNY
                        Here, big man.  You read the goddamn 
                        Gaelic Blessing.  I have a fucking job to 
                        do.

           Sonny storms off.

           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           SPLIT SCREEN:

           One half of screen is the event on the practice field, 
           the other half is Sonny at his window, staring out at 
           them.  His reflection in the window is next to the sign 
           that reads: WEAVER FIELD.

           Woodson reads the crumpled up paper.

                                 WOODSON
                        “May the road rise to meet you.  May the 
                        wind be always at your back.  May the sun 
                        shine warm upon your face.  May the rains 
                        fall soft upon your fields.  And until we 
                        meet again, may God hold you in the palm 
                        of his hand.”

           Barb scatters the ashes.  Split screen disappears.  Just 
           Sonny in his office.  

           Ali enters.  

                                 SONNY
                        Thought you were up there.
                                 ALI
                        I’m here.  You okay?

                                 SONNY
                        Who do I take?

                                 ALI
                        I don’t know.  What do you want?  Do you 
                        want to be a winner?

                                 SONNY
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        You want to win games.

                                 SONNY
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        That’s all that matters.

                                 SONNY
                        Yes.

                                 ALI
                        Then pick Callahan.

                                 SONNY
                        Right?  I should.  I should pick 
                        Callahan.

                                 ALI
                        He wins.  He wins at all costs.  He’s a 
                        winner.

                                 SONNY
                        He is a winner.

                                 ALI
                        He plays through pain.  He puts his 
                        emotions on hold.  He’s got tunnel 
                        vision.  It doesn’t matter if he’s well-
                        liked, he wins. It doesn’t matter if 
                        people love him, he wins.  It doesn’t 
                        matter what he does anywhere except in 
                        the pocket, dropping back to pass.  He 
                        wins.  He’s a winner.  

                                 SONNY
                        Get him on the phone...please.  
                                 (as she goes)
                        Wait. 
           He picks up the phone.  Dials someone.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Nate.  Sonny.

           SPLIT SCREEN

           Shows Nate, Houston GM he just got off the phone with.  

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing wrong with Vontae.  

                                 NATE
                        What?  

                                 SONNY
                        There’s nothing wrong with Vontae Mack.  

                                 NATE
                        Why are you telling me this?

                                 SONNY
                        I may have given you the impression that 
                        there was an injury there and I feel like 
                        shit about that.  Vontae’s fine.    

                                 NATE
                        You fucking with me?

                                 SONNY
                        Not at all.  

                                 NATE
                        Just tell me the truth.  

                                 SONNY
                        Helluva kid, helluva player.  

                                 NATE
                        What the fuck!

                                 SONNY
                        I’m telling you the--

                                 NATE
                        NO!  FUCK YOU!

                                 SONNY
                        Nate, I’m serious....

                                 NATE
                        We should be above this!  We should be 
                        goddamn mind games, Sonny!  Go fuck 
                        yourself!
           Sonny kicks the desk again.  Ali comes in, gives him a 
           look.

                                 SONNY
                        Go Fuck MYSELF!?  Go fuck YOURSELF, Nate!  
                        You don’t want to take Vontae Mack, fine!  
                        You will REGRET it like nothing you’ve 
                        ever regretted in your entire fucking 
                        life, you hack!  You want my unvarnished 
                        opinion?  He’s the best fucking player 
                        I’ve ever seen in my entire fucking life!  
                        So FUCK OFF, YOU HACKY FUCK!

           Sonny slams the phone down.

                                 ALI
                                 (sarcastic)
                        You’re doing great today, you know that?

                                 SONNY
                        Just get me Bo Callahan on the 
                        phone...please.

           She returns to her desk and finds, then dials a number 
           and talks to someone.  Sonny sits and suddenly goes into 
           a very calm, reflective state.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        You know who got a bad rap?  Bobby 
                        Beathard.  

                                 ALI
                                 (covering phone)
                        Who?

                                 SONNY
                        Former Chargers GM...

           INSERT: TRULY AMAZING FOOTAGE OF A TRULY AMAZING COLLEGE 
           QUARTERBACK.  

                                 SONNY (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Great football mind.  Thirty two general 
                        managers in the league in 1998 and every 
                        single one of them would have taken Ryan 
                        Leaf over Peyton Manning...

           The quarterback in the clips is RYAN LEAF, the biggest 
           draft bust ever.  We see HIM HOLDING A CHARGERS JERSEY, 
           then a QUICK HIGHLIGHT REEL OF HIM SUCKING IN NFL AND 
           BLOWING UP AT REPORTERS IN LOCKER ROOM.

           CUT BACK TO
           Ali walks back into Sonny’s office.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  Bobby Beatherd.  Poor fucking 
                        bastard, that guy.

                        Mackenmaker’s on Line One.

                                 (into phone)
                        Mackenmaker...

           SPLIT SCREEN 

           Shows Mackenmaker in a back room at Radio City with OTHER 
           AGENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS and HULKING DRAFT PICKS.  It’s 
           hectic.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Gotta tell you, we’re getting very 
                        excited over here, my friend.  

                                 SONNY
                        I wanna speak to Bo.

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        He’s a little busy at the moment, Sonny.  
                        Can I get you two on after the pick?  

                                 SONNY
                        No.  I need to speak to him now.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Is there a problem? 

                                 SONNY
                        I. Want. To.  Speak to him.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        He’s in the john.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m about to decide whether or not to 
                        give him twenty five million dollars.  
                        Tell him to wipe up and get on the phone.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Absolutely.  No problem.  

           Mackenmaker puts his hand over the phone, talks to Bo.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER (CONT’D)
                        Weaver just wants to say hi.
           Bo reluctantly takes the phone.  

                                 BO
                        This is Bo.  

                                 SONNY
                        Hey, Bo.  How you doing tonight?

                                 BO
                        Good.  

           Sonny waits for something more...that never comes.  

                                 SONNY
                        Good, good.  Try and enjoy this part if 
                        you can.  You only get drafted once.

           Shakes his head.  Can’t believe he said that again.

                                 BO
                        Okay...

                                 SONNY
                        Quick question: how important is winning 
                        to you?  

                                 BO
                        Excuse me?  

                                 SONNY
                        I’ve seen all the tape on you, talked to 
                        everyone that matters, but that’s the 
                        thing I still don’t know.  How important 
                        is winning to you?  

                                 BO
                        I’m not sure I understand the question, 
                        Mister Weaver.

                                 SONNY
                        All you guys at this level, you’re all 
                        winners, you’ve always beaten everyone 
                        else.  Of course you have.  You’re 
                        freaks.  You won the genetic lottery.  
                        You’re the most gifted football players 
                        on the planet.  But I’m not as interested 
                        in why you won right now, I’m interested 
                        in how important it is to you to keep 
                        doing it.  That’s the twenty five million 
                        dollar question.  

           Bo takes a second.  Looks at Mackenmaker who mouths, 
           “What?”.  Bo shakes him off, comes back with...  
                                 BO
                        I don’t know...very?

                                 SONNY
                        Look, feel free to take a sec and really 
                        think about--  

                                 BO
                        Hey, do you mind if we talk after you 
                        guys make the pick?  Everyone really 
                        wants me to head downstairs.  

                                 SONNY
                        Sure, Bo.  Good talking with you.  

           Sonny hangs up.  Takes a deep breath as we...  

           CUT BETWEEN THE FOLLOWING:

           1) The “Bo Callahan victory party” in the Bills parking 
           lot has doubled in size now.  They are drinking and 
           having fun.  Someone starts a ‘FUCK L.A.’ CHANT.

           2) Bo and Mackenmaker making their way to their table at 
           the draft, shaking hands and taking pictures as they go.

           3) The guys in the war room pace and try and look busy.  

           4) An OLD WOMAN being handed a glass of iced tea...by 
           Vontae as he switches on his TV to ESPN’s coverage of the 
           draft.

           5) A packed Buffalo sports bar watching the draft, high-
           fiving, doing shots, excited.   

           6) Ray Banks Jr. and his father Earl make their way to a 
           separate table at the draft.  Ray and Bo make eye contact 
           and give each other a nod.   

           7) Ali looking at herself in the mirror in the woman’s 
           bathroom.  

           8) Barb, still on the practice field, staring at nothing.  
           The lights are on.  Someone taps her.  She turns.  It’s 
           Woodson.  She smiles.    

           CUT BACK TO

           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Sonny looks - OUT HIS WINDOW - at Woodson leading his Mom 
           off the practice field.  
                                 SONNY
                        Son of a bitch...  

           Sonny picks up his phone and makes a call.

           SPLIT SCREEN 

           Shows MARVIN, the Bill’s rep at the draft (his nametag 
           tells us), in a back room at Radio City.  We hear the 
           circus outside as he picks up his cell and shuts a door 
           for privacy.  

                                 MARVIN 
                        Oh, good.  You remembered you actually 
                        had to call and tell me who you wanted?  
                        Was wondering what you were doing.  It’s 
                        almost go time, Boss.  Whose name you 
                        wanna hear the Commissioner say in five 
                        minutes?  

           Sonny takes out...the green piece of paper he wrote on at 
           the very start of the  story.  It is crumpled.  He 
           uncrumples it.  He stares at what is written there.

                                                               SMASH TO:

           INT. THE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Sonny enters holding two six-packs.  His guys are 
           watching the DRAFT ON ESPN.   

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Now’s the easy part, right Sonny?

           Sonny smiles, goes around the room delivering beers.  

                                 SCOUT #2 
                        Viva, Bo Callahan!

           As they cheer, Sonny takes a beer...and chugs it...before 
           looking--

           AT THE TV

           Just as the NFL COMMISSIONER steps up to the podium.   

                                 NFL COMMISSIONER
                        With the first pick of the 2012 NFL 
                        Draft, the Buffalo Bills select...Vontae 
                        Mack.  Linebacker.  LSU.  

           Seemingly every mouth in Radio City drops.  
           EXT. BILLS COMPOUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           There’s a LONG SHOT of the “Bo Callahan Victory Party” 
           and all we can hear is a collective...

                                 PARKING LOT FANS 
                        Nooooooooooo!

                                                               SMASH TO:

           INT. MACK RESIDENCE FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           Vontae’s grandmother’s house.  His FRIENDS, FAMILY AND 
           NEPHEWS are going BATSHIT CRAZY HERE.  Imagine thirty 
           people experiencing the best night of their life.

           Amidst the madness, we find Vontae...uncontrollably 
           sobbing on his proud GRANDMA’S shoulder.

                                                               SMASH TO:

           EXT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - NIGHT

           Bo Callahan bursts out a side door, catches his breath.  
           Mackenmaker bursts out half a beat later.  

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        You need to get back in there.  

                                 BO
                        How did this--

                                 BRIAN MACKENMAKER
                        Everything’s going to be fine.  Don’t act 
                        weird.

           He motions to the open door...and Bo marches back in.

                                                               SMASH TO:

           INT. BUFFALO SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           Bills swag and TVs everywhere.  Just as packed but the 
           exact opposite vibe of Vontae’s.  

           People screaming “No!”, pounding tables, kicking walls, 
           chugging beers in disgust, looking at Vontae’s face on 
           screen...then chugging another beer.  

                                                               SMASH TO:
           INT. SOMEWHERE IN BILLS COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Barb (and several STAFFERS) watch TV in a lounge.  

                                 BARB
                        Please tell me what I saw just happen did 
                        not just happen and my son did not just 
                        pick Vontae Mack number one.  

           Coach Woodson is beside her, smiling. 

                                 COACH WOODSON
                        Sorry, Barb.  I can not tell you that.  

                                                               SMASH TO:

           INT. THE WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON: Sonny staring into space.  The impact of what 
           he’s just done floats around him.

           We hear the dim roar of everyone questioning him, 
           swearing, gasping, whispering...

           Penn is yelling in his face, but we barely hear it.  
           Sonny doesn’t even look at him....

           Sonny gets up and calmly walks out of the room, leaving 
           the madness behind him.

           Penn looks on the table and sees the CRUMPLED GREEN PIECE 
           OF PAPER Sonny wrote on that morning.  Penn looks at 
           what’s written:

           VONTAE MACK.  NO MATTER WHAT.  

           Sonny gets a call.  Looks at his cell: VONTAE.  He picks 
           up.  

                                 SONNY
                        Congratulations, Mister Mack.  

           SPLIT SCREEN WITH

           Vontae at his Grandma’s...next to his Grandma...crying 
           uncontrollably but trying desperately to speak.  

                                 VONTAE
                        Immma...zabba...lannna...

           He breaks down crying again.  Speaking’s not gonna 
           happen.  Grandma takes the phone from him.  
                                 VONTAE’S GRANDMA
                        He’s gonna have to call you back, Mister 
                        Weaver.

           INT. SONNY’S OFFICE AREA - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Sonny returns to see Ali packing up her stuff to leave.    
           She stops, looks at him.

                                 ALI
                        Congratulations, Sonny.  

                                 SONNY
                        Where are you going?

                                 ALI
                        I’m leaving.  I’ve been trying to leave 
                        all day.  

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t do that.  I need you.  It’s been a 
                        crazy day, and it’s just going to get--

                                 ALI
                        You have nothing to worry about.  The 
                        hard part’s over.  

                                 SONNY
                        What?  I have everything to worry about.

                                 ALI
                        You’re a great GM, Sonny.  You are.  If 
                        you think Vontae is great, he’s great.  
                        You see things other people don’t see.  
                        But for whatever reason, you can’t use 
                        that talent for anything else.  You don’t 
                        see when someone loves you, or needs you, 
                        or is terrified.  And I guess, I wonder 
                        sometimes, who’s gonna scatter my ashes?  
                        Who’s gonna stand there and watch them 
                        scatter?  Who’s gonna care?
                                 (hugs him)
                        You’re a great general manager.  Just 
                        cling to that.  

           She walks off.  Sonny watches her go.  

                                 WOODSON (O.S.)
                        Tough stuff.

           Sonny turns and sees Woodson in his office.  
                                 SONNY
                        How long have you been there?

                                 WOODSON
                        Long enough.  She’s a catch, Sonny.    
                        But you never were good at catch.  You 
                        had hands like beef mittens.

                                 SONNY
                        Get out of my office.

                                 WOODSON
                        Interesting strategy you got going today.  
                        Trade four number ones DOWN to get a guy 
                        you could have traded UP to get.

                                 SONNY
                        I’m not going to say it again, Doc.

                                 WOODSON
                        I gotcha...

           He starts to leave but Sonny pushes him against the wall.

                                 SONNY
                        My Dad hated you.  I know you think he 
                        didn’t but he hated your goddamn guts.  
                        He told me you were a bastard.  

                                 WOODSON
                        He knew about your Mom and I.

                                 SONNY
                        Excuse me?  

                                 WOODSON
                        He was fine with it.  Told both of us so.  

                                 SONNY
                        Shut your goddamn mouth.  

                                 WOODSON
                        He was a great man, Sonny.  But he was 
                        terrible to her.  

                                 SONNY
                        You don’t know what you’re talking about.  

                                 WOODSON
                        You must have known about the other 
                        women...

                                 SONNY
                        I said: shut your mouth.  
                                 WOODSON
                        You’re right.  Not my place.  

           Woodson pushes away.  He starts to leave, but turns back.

                                 WOODSON (CONT’D)
                        She was right, by the way.  Your girl.  
                        She was right what she said about you 
                        being a great GM.  I’ve watched you.  

                                 SONNY
                        What?

                                 WOODSON
                        What?  You think I don’t watch you? 
                        Cheering for you, like some dumb uncle? 

                                 SONNY
                        I haven’t done anything right.  Ask 
                        anyone.

                                 WOODSON
                        Who cares what people say?  They don’t 
                        know, do they?  The world, the media, the 
                        fans, everyone?  They don’t know like we 
                        know, do they?

           Sonny doesn’t answer. 

                                 WOODSON (CONT’D)
                        Take a rational position like yours: 
                        general manager.  Someone who manages an 
                        entire organization.  Rationally.  But 
                        then, once a year, they throw you in an 
                        arena and tell you to PREDICT THE GODDAMN 
                        FUTURE.  Some people get lucky, some 
                        don’t.  And that’s where rationality and 
                        logic ends.

                        Darrell Bernard was an ASSASSIN.  How

                        I know you wanna hit me but...the day’s 
                        not over, Sonny.  You know what you’re 
                        doing.  You know.  Go do it.

           As Woodson walks off, Sonny’s cell BEEPS.  He got a text.  
           It’s from Vontae.  It just reads: U WILL NOT REGRET THIS.

           INT. WAR ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny walks through the doors.  There is a buzz in the 
           corner... everyone’s watching the draft on TV.  

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Holy shit.  Holy shit...

           Everyone is in disbelief...

                                 SONNY
                        What’s going on?

                        Picks number 2 and 3 are NOT Bo Callahan!  
                        Nobody’s picking him!

           Sonny looks--

                        have sent the entire league into a 
                        confused frenzy.   Bo Callahan remains 
                        UNPICKED.  After three picks, and going 
                        into the number four pick, many are 
                        wondering if there is some unknown issue 
                        with Bo Callahan...

                        Everyone is freaking out, Sonny.  St. 
                        Louis went with Anderson and Miami took 
                        Palmer.  

           It dawns on Sonny...that there’s opportunity here.  

                                 SONNY
                        Who’s picking fourth?

           We see a large chart with HELMETS OF EVERY TEAM in order 
           of their draft pick.  We see that next is ARIZONA, then 
           DENVER, OAKLAND and DETROIT at #7.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Arizona. 

                                 SONNY
                        Are they gonna take Callahan?

                                 SCOUT #1
                        They should.  But everyone’s off their 
                        game.  Rams and Dolphins both deviated 
                        from their expected picks, even though 
                        they were available.  Everyone’s 
                        panicking because Callahan’s still there.

                        Jesus, what if he falls to seven?  
                        Detroit’s got seven now.  What if they 
                        still ended up with Callahan?

                        Tom Michaels would be the GM of the 
                        decade.

                                 SONNY
                        Okay...Denver has five...Oakland has 
                        six...

                                 SCOUT #2
                        Denver’d never take Callahan.  They 
                        already got Herrod, he’s an All-Star.  So 
                        if Arizona balks, then Oakland’s all over 
                        him. 

                                 SONNY

           They all look at each other and smile.  They see where

                        Nothing.  We liked Vontae better.

                        Oh, well, they’re not taking Callahan, 
                        they’re taking Dearborne, the Left 
                        Tackle.  Congrats, Jeff, looks like 
                        you’re about to get Bo Callahan to

                        What’s wrong with him?  Why’s everyone 
                        passing on him?  Why did you pass on him?

                                 SONNY
                        I told you.  We liked Vontae.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Jesus, I’m about to be on the clock here!  
                        Look, please, what’s wrong with Callahan?

                                 SONNY
                        Can I be frank with you?

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Yes!  

                                 SONNY
                        I think he’s a bust.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        What?  How?  Why?

                                 SONNY
                        Gut feeling.  

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Just tell me.  If you were me who would 
                        you pick right now?

                                 SONNY
                        I’d pick Callahan.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        But you just said--
                                 SONNY
                        If you don’t, you will be the 
                        laughingstock of the league tomorrow.  
                        Everyone else has an excuse to pass on Bo 
                        Callahan.  You don’t.  

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        So I should pick him?

                                 SONNY
                        Look, I have other needs.  You want to 
                        make a trade for six right now?  Because 
                        I can hook that up.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Who are you going to pick?

                                 SONNY
                        I can’t tell you that.  The question is, 
                        do you want to make a trade?  Because if 
                        you come out of here with a handful of 
                        draft picks, then you look like a 
                        seasoned pro and everyone wonders what 
                        you’re up to next.  If you don’t, you 
                        look scared.  Give me six and I’ll give 
                        you our second round pick this year, and 
                        our second rounder next year.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Two number twos for the sixth overall?

                                 SONNY
                        I’d give you number ones, but I dealt 
                        them already.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Jesus, the clock...

                                 SONNY
                        Fine.  Take our next three number twos.  

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Your number two pick this year and the 
                        next two?

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.

           Time is ticking.  Both men look at clocks.
                                 SONNY
                        Denver hasn’t picked yet, but they will 
                        any second.  They’re just taking their 
                        time.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.

                                 SONNY
                        Final offer.  Our Number two pick this 
                        year and the next three years.  Four 
                        years worth of number two picks.  

           Everyone in Sonny’s war room perks up, listening.  Penn 
           is back, and hears this too.  He’s not happy.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Four years of second rounders?

                                 SONNY
                        For your pick right now.  And you and 
                        your guys can regroup, figure yourselves 
                        out, and relax.

                                 JEFF CARSON
                        Deal.

                                 SONNY
                        Very good, Jeff.

                        Somebody get me Tom Michaels.

                        Tell me you didn’t just do that.

                                 SONNY
                        We just got the number six pick.  

                                 PENN
                        Let me get this straight:  In the span of 
                        one day, you have burnt through our next 
                        four years of number one and two picks?

                                 SONNY
                        Yeah.

                                 PENN
                        I quit.

                                 SONNY
                        Don’t quit.
                                 PENN
                        I can’t coach a team with no future!

                                 SONNY
                        Hold on.  

           Sonny gets on his knees, begging, in front of everyone.  
           It seems either half-crazy or half-jesting...

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Just let me do this... let me work with 
                        this.  If by the end of the night you 
                        still want to quit, then quit.  Just 
                        please, don’t quit now.  See what I do 
                        from here.  It’s gonna be worth it.  

           Penn storms out of the room.

                                 PENN
                        I’ll be in my office.

                                 SCOUT #1
                        Sonny!

           When Sonny looks over, the scout points...

           ON TV

           The Commissioner approaches the podium.

                                 NFL COMMISSIONER
                        With the fifth pick of the 2012 NFL 
                        Draft, the Denver Broncos Select...Moses 
                        Dearborne, Left Tackle, Oregon.

           Whoops of disbelief as Callahan continues to drop.

           AWKWARD shots of Callahan, humiliated at Radio City, in 
           the special section reserved for expected top ten picks.

                                 SONNY
                        We’re on the clock.

                        I have Tom Michaels...

           Sonny goes and grabs the phone.

           SPLIT SCREEN - Shows Tom Michaels.  
                                 TOM
                                 (laughing)
                        Jesus Mary and Whatnot, do I owe you a 
                        thank you, Weaver.  Oakland’s on the 
                        clock.  I am one more crazy fuck up away 
                        from INSANITY.  Can you imagine?  Scoring 
                        four first round picks AND Bo Callahan?  
                        Lord God, let that infant John Carson 
                        fuck this up.

                                 SONNY
                        It’s Jeff Carson, Tom.  And he doesn’t 
                        have the pick, I do. 

                                 TOM
                        What!?!

                                 SONNY
                        I just made a trade with Oakland.  I’m on 
                        the clock. It’s me.

                                 TOM
                        Bullshit.

           A STAFFER approaches Tom and whispers just that.  

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Holy hell.  What the hell are you doing, 
                        Sonny?  What did you give them?

                                 SONNY
                        No time for that.  I’m on the clock.  I’m 
                        going to pick Bo, Tom.  Unless you want 
                        him more.  And if so, let’s make a deal.

                                 TOM
                        What is going ON, Sonny?

                                 SONNY
                        Everyone thinks something’s wrong with 
                        the kid.  But you don’t.  You did your 
                        due diligence.  You’re about to pull off 
                        the move of the century.  But you need my 
                        pick.  Make me an offer.

                                 TOM
                        You’ve gone rogue.  You’ve gone renegade.

                                 SONNY
                        Make me a deal and you get six and your 
                        boy wonder.

                                 TOM
                        What do you want?
                                 SONNY
                        I want my number ones back.  All of them.

                                 TOM
                        That’s crazy.  Why would I give them 
                        back?  

                                 SONNY
                        Because at the end of the day, no one’s 
                        the wiser.  You haven’t lost anything, 
                        and you get the quarterback messiah you 
                        wanted anyhow.

                                 TOM
                        It doesn’t make sense to do that.

                                 SONNY
                        Sure it does.  Callahan’s not worth as 
                        much now.  He’s a sixth overall pick, not 
                        first. I just saved my owner, I don’t 
                        know, what’s the difference between a #1 
                        pick and a #6?  Twenty million dollars?  
                        You’d be doing the same for your owner.  
                        So give me my picks back.

                                 TOM
                        Can’t do it.  I look like an idiot, I 
                        look like I panicked.  Nah.  You take 
                        him.  You obviously don’t want to.  I’ll 
                        keep my draft picks.

                                 SONNY
                        But you want him, don’t you Tom?  Ever 
                        since you made the trade, everyone in 
                        Detroit has been calling for your head.  
                        Isn’t that true?

           Beat.  No response.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        Doesn’t matter if you did the right 
                        thing, does it?  Detroit wants a hero.  
                        They want a sure thing.  And you denied 
                        them that.  You snag Callahan now, and 
                        they’ll name City Hall after you.

                                 TOM
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 SONNY
                        Unless you wanna give me this year’s 
                        first round pick, and your next three 
                        number twos.  You still end up with three 
                        first rounders AND Bo Callahan.
           Beat.  Tom considers.

                                 TOM
                        Next two number twos.  Not three number 
                        twos.  

                                 SONNY
                        Let’s make that third number two a number 
                        three.  So this year’s first round, next 
                        two years’ second rounders.  And next 
                        year’s third round.  For you to pick Bo 
                        Callahan now.

           Beat.

                                 TOM
                        Let’s do it.

                                 SONNY
                        Great.

           They hang up.  Sonny stands in triumph.  A quiet hush as 
           everyone waits.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        We just gave them six.  We get seven.  
                        And we got picks back.

           Everyone CHEERS.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        That means we’re picking next.  Back at 
                        seven.  Where we started.  Tom’s picking 
                        Bo.  So...who do we got?

           The scouts go to answer but are beat by--

                                 COACH PENN (O.S.)
                        Ray Fucking Banks.

           Penn has been leaning against the wall.  He walks over to 
           Sonny, offers his hand.

                                 PENN
                        Nice work.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re fired, Vince.

                                 PENN
                        What?

                                 SONNY
                        I don’t like getting pissed on.  
                                 PENN
                        You can’t fire me.  I already quit.

                                 SONNY
                        But you didn’t.

                                 PENN
                        Because you begged me not to.

                                 SONNY
                        So I could fire you now.  Nice working 
                        with you, Coach.
                                 (he turns back to his scouts)
                        Pick Banks.  He’s Buffalo Royalty.

           Sonny exits.

           INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - NIGHT

           The Commissioner’s at the podium.  

                                 NFL COMMISSIONER
                        And with the sixth pick of the 2012 NFL 
                        Draft, the Detroit Lions select... Bo 
                        Callahan, Quarterback, University of 
                        Michigan.

           Bo is shocked.  But there is finally a smile, relief.  He 
           gets up and goes to the stage.  He holds up a Lions 
           Jersey with the number 6 on it, smiles for the cameras.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Sonny walks.  He loosens his tie.  Takes it out of his 
           shirt.

           He walks through the Compound Lobby, past the trophy 
           case, and exits...

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Sonny stands outside the facility, looks around.  

           EXT. WEAVER FIELD - NIGHT

           Sonny walks to midfield.  It’s a beautiful night.  This 
           simple practice field feels like Lambeau right now.  
           There is something mystical about it.
           Sonny breathes deeply.  He looks skyward.  He lets loose 
           an exhausted but satisfied groan of relief.  

           He crouches and touches the field.  

           He looks down towards an endzone.  The goalposts sway in 
           the wind.  Sonny smiles.

           INT. WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Everyone watches...

           THE TV

           Where the Commissioner approaches the podium yet again.

                                 NFL COMMISSIONER
                        With the seventh pick of the 2012 NFL 
                        draft, the Buffalo Bill select...Ray 
                        Banks, running back, Auburn.

           INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Slow-motion as Ray Banks, in a suit, goes to his father, 
           Earl Banks, and they hug.  They are both in tears.

           EXT. WEAVER FIELD - MOMENTS LATER

           Sonny leaves the field, walking back to the parking lot, 
           makes a call.

           SPLIT SCREEN

           Shows his mother is back home.

                        Hello?

                                 SONNY
                        Hey Mom.

                                 BARB
                        Sonny.  

                                 SONNY
                        I need to tell you something.

                                 BARB
                        Sure, honey.
                                 SONNY
                        I’m gonna be a dad.

                                 BARB
                        What?

                                 SONNY
                        It’s true.

           Beat.

                                 BARB
                        Since when?

                                 SONNY
                        Since recently.

                                 BARB
                        You’re going to be a father.

                                 SONNY
                        You’re going to be a grandma.

           Beat.  Barb starts to cry.

                                 SONNY (CONT’D)
                        I wanted to tell you because...because 
                        this is a good thing and maybe we can 
                        both use a good thing right now.  

                                 BARB
                        This is such great news!
                                 (beat)
                        I wish your father--

                                 SONNY
                        I know, Ma...
                                 (they share silence, then)
                        Listen, is Doc still there?

                                 BARB
                        Yes.

                                 SONNY
                        Can I talk to him?

                                 BARB
                        Let me get him...

           She gives the phone to Doc on the couch, watching the 
           draft of course.  

                                 WOODSON
                        First rate work, kiddo.  Inspired.
                                 SONNY
                        I’m not done yet.

                                 WOODSON
                        What’s next?

                                 SONNY
                        Hiring you as head coach of the Buffalo 
                        Bills.

           Beat.

                                 WOODSON
                        I’m retired, Sonny.

                                 SONNY
                        Then get unretired.  

                                 WOODSON
                        You already have a coach.  

                                 SONNY
                        Not anymore.  I fired him.  

                                 WOODSON
                        Why?

                                 SONNY
                        Honestly?  

                                 WOODSON
                        Yeah.  

                                 SONNY
                        Hated the guy.  

                                 WOODSON
                                 (laughing)
                        What about me? 

                                 SONNY
                        Work in progress.

           A beat.  

                                 WOODSON
                        You mind if I sleep on this?

           Sonny smiles.  Knows he has him.

                                 SONNY
                        Take your time.  
           EXT. BUFFALO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Sonny parks his car, gets out.  He walks to the front 
           door of an old Victorian house.

           We watch him from a distance.  He KNOCKS.  Ali comes to 
           the door.  She comes outside.  We watch them talk, but we 
           can’t hear them.  He’s telling her a lot.

           He kisses her.  She kisses him back.  They hug.  Sonny 
           touches her belly.  He kisses it.  He puts his head 
           against her belly.  She holds him there.

           A Men’s Choir sings THE GAELIC BLESSING, acapella...  

                                 CHOIR
                        ‘May the road rise to meet you...

           EXT. STADIUM - DAY

           Angled shot of field goal uprights.  The flags at the top 
           ripple in the wind...

                                 CHOIR
                        May the wind be always at your back...

           EXT. STADIUM - DAY

           A line of Bills players, circa 60’s, stand with helmets 
           off, listening to the National Anthem.  Their faces shine 
           in the sun...

                                 CHOIR
                        May the sun shine warm upon your face...

           EXT. STADIUM - DAY

           Slow-motion, FEET at the line of scrimmage, circa 80’s, 
           tear up a muddied field as rain pours...

                                 CHOIR
                        May the rains fall soft upon your 
                        fields...

           EXT. STADIUM - DAY

           Vontae Mack, circa now, in muddied uniform, walks toward 
           the tunnel at the end of the game.  He looks like he’s 
           been through battle.  He raises a fist in triumph.
                                 CHOIR
                        And until we meet again...

           EXT. CITY OF BUFFALO - NIGHT

           The city is lit up like a jewel.  

                                 CHOIR
                        May God hold you in the palm of his 
                        hand.’

           FIREWORKS explode over the city in celebration.
