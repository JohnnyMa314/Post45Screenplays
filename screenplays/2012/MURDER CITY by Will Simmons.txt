             [Detroit is consistently ranked as the most dangerous city in 
                America, earning it the dubious moniker "MURDER CITY"]
           FADE IN:

           EXT. DETROIT SLUM - DUSK

           Heavens condemn the concrete jungle. Judgement cast in the 
           maelstrom. Rain punishing defiled tenements, once proud and 
           spotless, now stained and wretched. 

           Saddled at the curb, a pockmarked CROWN VIC endures the 
           elemental beatdown, blurred in the downpour.

           Across the way, an awning shelters a ghetto DEALER (17) 
           slinging BROWN to some strung-out JUNKIE aching for a hit. 

           INT. CROWN VIC - CONTINUOUS

           Embers burn to ash, flaking from the cancer stick. The smoker 
           grinds the nub in an old chaw tin, killing the flame...

           NEIL BRESLIN (34), a dagger-eyed bloodhound of a man, stubble 
           patched over his jaw, a METRO VICE BADGE dangling between 
           flaps of his Cabretta jacket. 

           Without the shield, you’d take him for a crook. 

           But there’s a glimmer of warmth beneath his coarse husk. 

           Passenger seat, his partner, LAZ MODELL (27), a slum survivor 
           turned cop, shivering as a chill creeps inside the idle car.

           Neil eyes the Dealer across the street as another JUNKIE 
           totters round the corner. 

                                 NEIL
                        There he goes again. How long we 
                        been on him?

                                 LAZ
                        ‘Bout three hours now.

                                 NEIL
                             (impressed)
                        Slingin’ in the rain. Boy’s got 
                        heart. 

                                 LAZ
                        That, or he’s too dumb to know any 
                        better.

           Laz suckles a cup of stale coffee, fighting the cold.
                                 NEIL
                        Hopheads gotta get their fix, rain 
                        or shine. Other dealers shut down, 
                        leave this kid reaping the harvest.

                                 LAZ
                             (impatient)
                        How much longer we gonna sit?

                                 NEIL
                        Let him pocket enough cash to be 
                        dizzied when we bust him. 

           Laz glowers, dubious.

                                 LAZ
                        That’s some twisted shit; get his 
                        hopes up on a big take before you 
                        shake him down.

                                 NEIL
                             (nods)
                        Someone’s gotta set him straight. 
                        Dose of tough love never did any 
                        harm.

                                 LAZ
                        True, but while you’re preaching 
                        that charity bullshit my damn toes 
                        are gettin’ frostbit. 

                                 NEIL
                        If it ain’t cold enough to snow 
                        then you got nuthin’ to worry 
                        ‘bout. 

           Laz shuffles through PAMPHLETS stuffed in the console.

                                 LAZ
                        You still goin’ through with the 
                        transfer?

                                 NEIL
                             (nods)
                        Lansing precinct.  

                                 LAZ
                        Outta the slums and into the burbs. 

                                 NEIL
                        That’s the plan. 
           Neil watches as the Dealer slips a hood over his dome and 
           blends into the ALLEY. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Closin’ shop. Let’s go. 

           EXT. DETROIT SLUM - CONTINUOUS

           Out the Crown Vic, Neil and Laz hotfoot toward the ALLEY, 
           percussive rain enhancing their stealth. 

           Dealer strolls crooked, swaggering down the chute, Vice on 
           his tail. He senses the heat, bucks forward, full-tilt. 

           THE CHASE -- 

           Neil freight-trains after the perp, born to hunt, Laz at his 
           side, keeping pace. 

           Dealer claws up a FENCE, straddling the crest, off-balance, 
           sprawls on the other side, jacket shredding on a link. 

           He cuts loose, downpour getting Biblical on him, coming 
           harder, stronger. Fight or flight, he pitches headlong toward 
           an offshoot as Neil and Laz hop the rail. 

           Neil ditches the route, splits sideways, shouting at Laz...

                                 NEIL
                        Herd him to the pit!

           Laz dogs the perp, nipping at his heels, closer, faster. 

           Dealer splashes a puddle, slipping, sideswiping a dumpster, 
           skinning his knees on the pavement.

           Hot-blooded, Laz bears down, shoulders squared, no fear. 

           Last stand, Dealer scampers, hurdling a gate onto...

           GRAVEL-PIT SCHOOLYARD

           Vacant. Ratty. Tire-swings and slides peppered with graffiti.

           Dealer makes for the adjacent PRESCHOOL, fireballing into...

           ABANDONED HALLWAY

           Head on a swivel, glancing back at Laz...

           WHAP! Blind-side, Neil thumps the Dealer, sending him 
           horizontal, shattering a wood cubby. 
           Shaken, Dealer flops, staggering upward, Neil stomping him 
           against the nook with the sole of his boot. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        How old are you?

                                 DEALER
                        Old enough to fuck you up. 

           Neil deflects the aggression, studying the kid...

                                 NEIL
                        ‘Looks of it, you’re pushin’ 
                        eighteen... another year and this 
                        doesn’t go down as a juvie fuck-up. 
                             (beat)
                        Empty your pockets. 

           Contempt boiling in the Dealer’s eyes as he stalls. Neil lays 
           into him, ruthless, crushing his lungs. 

                                 DEALER
                             (breathless)
                        Alright, man...

           Dealer wheezes, gasping, surrendering. Neil eases off, just a 
           bit. Laz arriving at the scene, GLOCK trained on the perp.

           Dealer flicks HEROIN BAGGIES and a wad of CASH at Neil’s 
           feet.

                                 NEIL
                        That all?

           Neil snatches the contraband, thumbing the bills, counting. 

                                 DEALER
                        You gonna rob me or book me?

                                 NEIL
                        You got any priors?

                                 DEALER
                        Naw.

                                 NEIL
                             (pause)
                        Stay off the corner. I catch you 
                        slingin’ again, I’m gonna take it 
                        personally. 

           Done deal. Neil pads away, Laz following, leaving the Dealer 
           crumpled and broke in the cubby. 
                                 LAZ
                        We ain’t gonna book him?

           Neil rips the baggies, dumping the heroin down a STORM DRAIN. 

                                 NEIL
                             (shakes his head)
                        Won’t do any good. Ups his street 
                        cred, then he’s back on the grind 
                        next day. Least this way we don’t 
                        jack his record. Kid can apply for 
                        a job without havin’ to pen the 
                        felon box.

           Neil divides the cash in two, offering half to his partner. 
           Laz vets the stack, scowling, apprehensive.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                             (insisting)
                        Take it... what’s the department 
                        gonna do with a couple hundred 
                        bucks?

                                 LAZ
                             (declining)
                        All yours.

                                 NEIL
                        You’re too clean for your own good.

           Neil pockets the drug money.

           EXT. BISHOP’S PUB - NIGHT

           The Crown Vic sallies up to the entrance, halting. Neil yanks 
           the keys and turns to Laz.

                                 NEIL
                        You coming?

           Laz peeps the speakeasy, his face tense with worry.

                                 LAZ
                        Go do your thing. 

                                 NEIL
                        Be just a minute. Keep an eye out. 

           Exiting, Neil slams the Vic’s door and strolls into...
           INT.  BISHOP’S PUB - CONTINUOUS

           A Spartan dive, fitted with scuffed decks, stools warped from 
           abuse. Type of place that caters to bare-knuckle brawlers. 
           IRISH FLAGS and MEMORABILIA splayed on the walls.

           A few nine-to-five BARFLIES stewing in their own stink. 

           Tending the bar, Neil’s wife, MOLLY BRESLIN (31), a hard-
           shelled beauty strung through life’s meat-grinder, tough 
           beyond her years. She tracks Neil with a dour-faced stare.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’re late.

           Neil cranes, looking for someone.

                                 NEIL
                        Where’s Trev?

                                 MOLLY
                        Tired of waiting. He took a cab 
                        home.

           Over the counter, Neil pecks Molly’s lips, a peace offering. 

                                 NEIL
                        Got caught up with a chase. I’ll 
                        make it up to him.

           Her mood softens with the apology. She pours him a shot of 
           Jameson. He takes it in stride. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Laz outside?

                                 NEIL
                             (nods)
                        In the cruiser. Doesn’t like 
                        mingling with the otherside. Told 
                        him he’s gotta get used to it.  

           Neil regards the scattered patrons. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Tips been good?

                                 MOLLY
                        It’ll pick up. 

           Jameson flows from Molly’s tilt. Another shot. Neil downs his 
           medicine, and slips a pad of TWENTIES under the glass. 
                                 NEIL
                        For your troubles.

           Uneasy, she thumbs the dirty money, about to question its 
           origin when Neil silences her with a KISS.

                                 MOLLY
                        You spoil me. 
                             (beat)
                        Any news ‘bout the transfer?

                                 NEIL
                             (shakes his head)
                        Gotta sit tight ‘til my turn comes 
                        ‘round. It’ll happen when the 
                        time’s right.

           A flicker of disappointment, subdued beneath Molly’s gaze.

           Neil flashes a roguish smile, laying on the charm...

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        How ‘bout I put Trev to bed before 
                        you get home -- spark a few 
                        candles, couple glasses of Jameson.

           Molly grins, relishing the affection.

                                 MOLLY
                        So it’s gonna be one of those 
                        nights.

                                 NEIL
                             (smirks)
                        Don’t fight it. 

           Excused, Neil plods away as a MAN emerges from the BACK 
           PARLOR, loitering forward with a brigand’s gait... 

           TERRENCE “BISHOP” DUNN (48), on the wrong side of ugly, a 
           “fuck you” grimace permanently etched on his face. Irish 
           prince of darkness, grim-reaper of the underworld. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Thought I heard your voice.

           Neil faces the bastard. 

                                 NEIL
                        Just leavin’. 

           Bishop mounts a stool, puffing his Marlboro, tarry breaths 
           wisping at his teeth. 
                                 BISHOP
                        Seen your pa’ round lately?

                                 NEIL
                        Few weeks ago.

           Another drag, Bishop devouring the smoke.

                                 BISHOP
                        If you cross paths, tell him I need 
                        a word. 

           Dead silence. Neil musters a respectful nod and shoves off. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Decrepit tenements in a bottom of the barrel slum. Neil parks 
           the Vic and heads inside.  

           INT. BRESLIN ROOST - MOMENTS LATER

           Door wobbles, groaning as Neil steps through. 

                                 NEIL
                        Trev? You here bud?

           Cabretta on the hanger, Neil probes the flat, finding...

           His son, TREVOR BRESLIN (11), plagued with the same shotgun-
           temper as his pa’, fixated on a shoddy tube box -- flickering 
           grain from a hoops broadcast. Lounging at his side...

           Neil’s father, GRAHAM BRESLIN (52), a whiskey-faced deadbeat 
           with a knack for tomfuckery. Ruddy complexion offsetting his 
           shock of silver hair. Cigarette dangling from his lips. 

           Neil boils at the sight of his old man.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                             (to Graham)
                        The hell are you doing here?

           Graham leans back, chafed from Neil’s tone.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Watching the game with my grandson. 
                        That allowed?

           Neil tables his discontent, killing the TV set. 
                                 NEIL
                             (to Trev)
                        Go do your work. 

                                 TREV
                        Already done. 

                                 NEIL
                        Let me see it. 

           Trev freezes, his bluff foiled. A long sigh as he sulks 
           toward the KITCHEN, Neil catching his arm...

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        If you’re gonna lie, you gotta make 
                        it convincing... look me in the eye 
                        when you say it. 

           Fear in the boy’s eyes as he meets his father’s stare. Neil 
           smirks, easing the tension.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead.

                                 TREV
                             (eyes on Neil, bluffing)
                        I wasn’t lying.

                                 NEIL
                        Atta boy.

           Neil tousles Trev’s hair, playfully shoving him away. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        What time is it?

           Neil studies Graham, gearing for a clash.

                                 NEIL
                        You got somewhere to be?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Matter of fact I do. That’s why I’m 
                        here. 

           Neil pads to the cabinet, pours himself a drink. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll give you ‘til I’m finished 
                        with this drink to get out of my 
                        sight.
           Neil’s anger cuts deep, festering. Whiskey clots the wound. 
           He takes an aggressive swig. Clock’s ticking on Graham.   

                                 GRAHAM
                        I wouldn’t come to you if it wasn’t 
                        a last resort. 
                             (beat)
                        Your brother flaked on me again, 
                        skipped town, probably nose-deep in 
                        a bender... and I got need for you.

           Another gulp. Neil’s halfway finished. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I’ll cut a fair deal. 

                                 NEIL
                        Not interested in whatever scam you 
                        got goin’. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        No scam. Just a straight-up trade.

                                 NEIL
                        Things come to you straight-up, 
                        turn sideways real quick. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Not this time. 

           Neil mouths his medicine, down the hatch.

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Hear me out. I’m offerin’ easy 
                        money. Two hours tops. We make a 
                        drop, pick up our score, and we’re 
                        back before your liver’s dried.  

                                 NEIL
                        If it’s so easy then do it 
                        yourself.

                                 GRAHAM
                        It’s a two-man job. I stroll in 
                        without backup, these guys are 
                        gonna take me for a chump. 

           Neil tightens his pace, sipping, drawing it out. 

                                 NEIL
                        Bishop know ‘bout this?
                                 GRAHAM
                             (shakes his head)
                        Runnin’ this one off the grid. 
                        Strictly outsiders. 

                                 NEIL
                        Better hope he doesn’t catch wind.
                             (beat)
                        I saw him earlier. Said he needed 
                        to get with you.

           Graham hunches, puffing his cig, nodding meekly.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m in deep with him. He’s lookin’ 
                        to settle. 

                                 NEIL
                        How much?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Hundred K. 

                                 NEIL
                        Jesus.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Points are killin’ me. He’s gonna 
                        put me under if I don’t start 
                        payin’ back the principle. 
                             (re: the job)
                        I need you for this... please. 

           Tides turning, Graham senses it, sweetens the deal. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        Fifty-fifty split. Put your half 
                        toward your boy’s college fund. 
                             (pitching)
                        This gig is as cut and dried as 
                        they come. 

                                 NEIL
                        Not gonna cross that line again.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Bullshit. You fuckin’ live on that 
                        line. Cross it once you might as 
                        well come back for another taste. 

                                 NEIL
                        It’s not in me. Can’t stray that 
                        far.
           Graham schemes another approach, playing for sympathy.

                                 GRAHAM
                        These guys I’m sellin’ to, they 
                        don’t fuck around. I show up to the 
                        meet alone and they’re gonna rip me 
                        or kill me. 

                                 NEIL
                        Then don’t show. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Not an option. I gotta have this. 
                        So, either you got my back or 
                        you’re feeding me to the wolves. 
                             (beat)
                        What’s it gonna be?

           Last taste, Neil empties the glass, staunch, unwavering. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll say a prayer for you. 

           With that, Graham swallows his plea, making for the door.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Keep towing the line and you’re 
                        gonna be squattin’ in this shithole 
                        ‘til you hit my age. Do yourself a 
                        favor, make a play while you still 
                        got enough years ahead for it to 
                        make a difference. 

           Graham departs, Neil opening the fridge, cracking a beer, his 
           eyes glued to PHOTOGRAPHS on the door -- an image of the 
           Breslin clan -- Graham, Neil and his BROTHER on a fishing 
           trip, years ago, sunburned faces stretched wide with smiles.

           Neil mouths the bottle, nostalgia on his mind. 

           He turns to his son, Trev -- at the table, hacking away at 
           his homework, trapped in this dump of an apartment.

                                 NEIL
                        What’re you studying?

                                 TREV
                        Math.

           SILENCE. Neil’s parental ineptitude glaring as he swigs the 
           beer, awkwardly chiming in...
                                 NEIL
                             (re: homework)
                        You need some help?

           Trev focuses on the page, self-sufficient, like his old man.

                                 TREV
                        No. I can do it.

           Pride welling in Neil as he watches his son study. 

                                 NEIL
                        Got somethin’ for you.

           Neil fishes the remaining wad of TWENTIES out of his pocket, 
           passing it to Trev. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Put it away in your safe spot. 

           Trev admires the money, then his father. 

           A LIGHT BULB flickers overhead, making it difficult for Trev 
           to see his text book.

                                 TREV
                             (re: light bulb)
                        We gonna get that fixed soon?

                                 NEIL
                             (lost in thought)
                        Yea.

           Suddenly, Neil ditches his badge, heading for the exit. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I want your work done by the time I 
                        get back.

                                 TREV
                        Where are you going?... Can I come 
                        with you?

                                 NEIL
                             (ignores the question)
                        Lock the door behind me. 

           Neil slips into the hallway, leaving. 

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - MOMENTS LATER

           Neil catches Graham on the street.
                                 NEIL
                        Hold up.

           Graham turns, pleased at the sight of his son. Doesn’t want 
           to ruin the moment, just nods thankfully. 

           EXT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           A seedy boarding den for dopers and tarts. Neon lights 
           pulsing in the witching hour.

           Graham’s beat-up SEVILLE staggers into the lot, grumbling 
           like a chain-smoker on a spare lung, red haze beaming through 
           the windshield as he parks. 

                                 GRAHAM
                             (re: dealers)
                        These guys are just rollin’ 
                        through, lookin’ to make a quick 
                        splash. I told ‘em this was a one-
                        time deal. 

           Glove box. Graham nabs a .38 REVOLVER and hands it to Neil.  

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        If shit turns haywire, I want you 
                        quick to the trigger. 

                                 NEIL
                        I thought you said this was a 
                        straight up trade.
                             (off look)
                        You did your homework on these 
                        guys, right?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Of course. But you know how these 
                        “meets” go... one minute you’re 
                        talkin’ friendly, the next you’re 
                        eatin’ bullets.

                                 NEIL
                             (pause)
                        Just keep it simple, alright? We 
                        make the deal, then leave -- no 
                        bullshit.

           Neil stuffs the .38 in his waistband and exits the car.
           EXT/INT. ROOM 6 - MOMENTS LATER

           Graham pounds on the door, DUFFLE in-hand, Neil at his side. 
           A shadow creeps toward the slit, knob turning, opening...

           MANNY HUNT (38), a Mexicali smuggler mining the east coast 
           for product. Delinquent beard shading his greasy face. He 
           greets Graham with a slacked handshake. 

                                 MANNY
                        Good to see you brotha. We got 
                        worried you backed out. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Minor delay. We’re all good. 

           Manny regards Neil warily.

                                 MANNY
                        What happened to Spence?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Couldn’t make it. This is my other 
                        boy. 
                             (off look)
                        That gonna be a problem?

           Manny’s eyes lock on Neil like a hawk pegging a meal too big 
           for its belly.

                                 MANNY
                             (not a problem)
                        Long as he’s not a cowboy. 

           Manny gives way, stepping aside.

           Graham and Neil breach the frame, Manny bolting the door.

           Two CARTEL GORILLAS -- CORTEZ and PANCHO -- strapped with MAC-
           10’s, guarding a BLACK BRIEFCASE on the mattress. 

           Banshee shrieks echo through the ceiling, cries of a woman 
           getting fucked in the room above. 

           Neil sticks to Graham, unsettled by the shrill howls. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get this under way. 

           Down to business, Manny flips open the briefcase, flashing 
           stacks of BENJAMINS. 
                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Show us what you got.

           Graham unzips the duffle, removing four bricks of COKE 
           wrapped in cellophane. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Four keys, like we agreed.

                                 MANNY
                        Mind if I sample?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Go ahead. 

           Manny dips into the brick with a pocket knife, tasting the 
           white, his face blank, expressionless. He dumps the remaining 
           sample into a vial of nitric acid on the bed-stand.

           Time crawls. The moment laced with tension. 

           Screams amplify overhead. Ceiling rattling from the fucking.

           Gorillas paw their heat, ready to bring the hurt. 

           Neil pats his hip, fingering the noisemaker, Graham flush and 
           clammy under the pressure.  

           Coke fizzles in the vial, tinting the nitric berry blue. 
           Manny tilts the sample under a lamp, his eyes puckered.

                                 MANNY
                             (satisfied)
                        Looks good. 

           Manny nods for the Gorillas to claim the bricks, and hands 
           the briefcase to Graham.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Listen, I know you wanted to do a 
                        one-off, but there’s alotta cash 
                        comin’ down my pipeline... ready to 
                        do bigger business if you wanna 
                        take the next step.

           Graham opens the case, handling the Benjamins. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we could arrange a meet with 
                        your supplier, see if we can come 
                        to terms. No reason for us to sever 
                        ties when we could be runnin’ the 
                        show together. 
                                 GRAHAM
                             (shakes his head)
                        Can’t do it. I don’t handle the 
                        traffick in this neck of the woods. 
                        Best not to push our luck. 

           Graham flipbooks the wad, startled to find DOLLAR BILL 
           fillers padded under the Benjamins. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is this...

           Close-quarters, Gorillas raise their Mac-10’s, Graham hurling 
           the briefcase and reaching for his chrome...

           WHAP! Manny clocks Graham, hammering him to the carpet as...

           Neil bulldozes the Gorillas, mauling and swatting their 
           weapons, knocking them off-balance.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A chorus of gunshots. Mac-10’s erupting. 
           Bullets peppering the ceiling. 

           Neil recovers, nimble, spry. He spikes Pancho’s face against 
           the bedpost, blood spurting from the gash...

           BOOM! Cortez unloads, Neil swiveling behind Pancho and 
           stripping his Mac-10, ready to kill...

           Blind-side, cold steel jabs Neil’s temple, Manny wielding the 
           piece. 

                                 MANNY
                             (re: Mac-10)
                        Drop it.

           Neil, brick-faced, still frenzied from the battle, unwilling 
           to surrender. 

           WHAP! Manny pistol-whips Neil, then hauls him next to... 

           Graham, delirious and bloodied on the ground.  

           UMPH! Face to the floor. Manny stomps Neil, pinning him next 
           to Graham and shoving a BADGE in his eye...

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        DEA motherfucker.

           Cortez and Pancho assist, manhandling and cuffing the perps.
           Neil with a mouthful of carpet, immobilized, staring at his 
           old man, scorn fuming in his eyes -- his life fucked in an 
           instant.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT/INT. HARRISON PENITENTIARY - MORNING

           TITLE: TWO YEARS LATER

           Iron bars clatter apart, Neil emerging through the gap, 
           tagged in an orange jumper, inmate number patched on his 
           chest, CORRECTIONS GUARDS escorting him down the cellblock. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           He autographs the release papers, collecting his personal 
           effects, reclaiming whatever fragments of a life he has left. 

           EXT. COUNTY PRISON - GATE - MOMENTS LATER

           GUARDS flank the exit, regarding Neil with disdain as he 
           strolls out of lockdown -- returning to the concrete jungle. 

           A TOWN CAR idles down the street. Leaning on the chassis, a 
           beanstalk MAN in a cheap suit flashes a gap-tooth grin...

           Neil’s brother, SPENCER BRESLIN (28), sleepy-eyed runt of the 
           litter, slave to the needle and bound for the gutter. His 
           relentless enthusiasm bursting as Neil approaches.  

                                 SPENCER
                             (pleased with himself)
                        Thought I’d forget, didn’t you?

           A hearty embrace, Neil reluctant, Spencer beaming -- but even 
           on his best days he can’t shake his junkie stink. 

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        You look sharp, man. Prison did you 
                        some good. Ex-cop hardened behind 
                        by bars; that’s a badass combo. Got 
                        both sides of the law runnin’ 
                        scared.

           Neil eyes the unblemished town car.

                                 NEIL
                        What’s this?

           A proud smile, Spencer strokes the waxed hood.
                                 SPENCER
                        Fuckin’ batmobile. Bishop’s got me 
                        drivin’ his collection route. Lets 
                        me take the ride whenever I need 
                        it.

           Muffled BARKING inside the car. A wet snout peeks through the 
           cracked window. 

                                 NEIL
                        Flynn in there?

           Spencer nods, heading for the driver’s seat. 

                                 SPENCER
                        Partner in crime. He’s good for 
                        backup. 

           INT. CROWN VIC - MOMENTS LATER

           Spencer’s dog, FLYNN, a gregarious full-bodied mutt, panting 
           between the seats, slobber flapping from his muzzle.

           Neil scratches the beast, Spencer at the wheel, motoring. 

                                 SPENCER
                             (re: Flynn)
                        Don’t tell Bishop that I let him in 
                        the ride. 

                                 NEIL
                             (adjusting)
                        Sure you’re alright with me 
                        crashing at your place?

                                 SPENCER
                        Of course. It’ll be like when we 
                        were kids. 

           The thought stirs memories, anguish, silence. 

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        Visited pa’ upstate the other day.

           Neil fixates on the windshield, avoiding conversation.

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        He’s not holdin’ up too well. 
                        Cancer’s spreadin’ from his lungs 
                        to his brain. Doc says he’s got a 
                        few months left.
           Eyes cold, Neil checks the dash, finds a pack of smokes, 
           lights one, not giving a fuck about his old man and the 
           cancer. 

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        Make matters worse, he’s talkin’ 
                        ‘bout cooperating with the feds. 

           Neil’s attention rapt.

                                 NEIL
                        What?

                                 SPENCER
                        Said he doesn’t wanna spend his 
                        last days in a cellblock, so he’s 
                        gonna try to cut a deal, give up 
                        some names for an early release. 

           Anxious puffs, the cigarette dwindling in Neil’s grasp.

                                 NEIL
                        Who else knows about this?

                                 SPENCER
                        In town? Just me. 

                                 NEIL
                        Has he reached out to the feds yet?

                                 SPENCER
                        Maybe. I don’t know. He got pissed 
                        when I told him to keep his mouth 
                        shut, yelled at me to “fuck off”. 
                             (dire)
                        You gotta go talk to him. Bury 
                        whatever bullshit’s unsettled. He 
                        owes you for what you did. He’ll 
                        listen to you. 

           Spencer makes an erratic turn, wheels screeching. 

                                 NEIL
                        This the right way?

                                 SPENCER
                        Bishop’s lookin’ to get with you.

                                 NEIL
                        ‘Bout what?
                                 SPENCER
                        Don’t know. Told me to bring you 
                        straight from county. 

           EXT/INT. BISHOP’S PUB - DAY

           The usual crowd of menial drunkards and half-witted skanks, 
           sucking down their afternoon dose. 

           Neil and Spencer roll through, toward the back, passing...

           Bishop’s squeeze, BLISS MURPHY (20), a nympho coke-fiend 
           trading skin for sniffs, tits popping out her tank-top as she 
           serves patrons at the bar. 

           THE BACK PARLOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Lion’s den. Windows barred and boarded. Cigar smoke choking 
           the lamplight, giving way to shadow. 

           Neil and Spencer sift through the haze, Bishop sitting on the 
           throne alongside his enforcer...

           ANGUS KILLIAN (41), an austere hitman seething with quiet 
           menace. Wiry-strong, veins spiderwebbing under his flesh. 
           Blood vessels ruptured in his eyes, staining the white with 
           lucid red. 

           Bishop gnaws on a charred porterhouse, juices spilling down 
           his chin as he motions to Spencer. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Fetch us something to drink.

                                 SPENCER
                             (nods agreeably)
                        What do you want?

                                 BISHOP
                        Bliss knows what I like. 

           Spencer hurries away, leaving Neil to fend for himself. 

           Bishop flips through a pictorial catalogue of doe-eyed 
           RUSSIAN PROSTITUTES -- pasty skin and tortured smiles. Neil 
           eyes the book, Bishop catching his gaze. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (re: girls)
                        Not bad, huh?
                             (beat)
                        Red tide is new in town. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        We’re hashing ground-rules for 
                        business. Fuckin’ territorial 
                        pissing contest. They keep sendin’ 
                        these skinbooks; leg-spreaders 
                        ferried from Soviet slums, offerin’ 
                        me test-drives as a show of good 
                        will. But you can’t trust a 
                        picture, and if you take someone at 
                        their word then you’re just a 
                        sucker waitin’ to get owned.

                                 NEIL
                        You drag me down here to look at 
                        smut?

                                 BISHOP
                             (insulted)
                        Drag? I provided you with a ride 
                        home, just like I provide your wife 
                        and brother with steady work, keep 
                        ‘em from drownin’ in the gutter. 

           Neil sits without an invitation, earning a cutthroat stare 
           from Angus. 

                                 NEIL
                        I’d say “thank you” if I thought 
                        it’d mean anything. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (pause)
                        Tough for you come back like this, 
                        isn’t it? Tail between your legs 
                        after that hard fall from grace, 
                        tryin’ to figure out which side of 
                        the law to land on. 
                             (beat)
                        I can tell you one thing, the state 
                        won’t take you in with open arms. 
                        They got nuthin’ but hate for your 
                        type, so why waste your time 
                        fightin’ against what you’ve always 
                        been.

                                 NEIL
                        And what’s that?

           A sly grin, Bishop wiping his mouth clean, setting the hook 
           in Neil.

                                 BISHOP
                        I live a comfortable lifestyle. 
                        Money’s never an issue. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BISHOP (CONT'D)
                        It’s not about making ends-meet, 
                        but figurin’ out how’ta cut to the 
                        bone, takin’ every scrap along the 
                        way. It all adds up. And I’m 
                        bettin’ you’d like to pad your 
                        pockets now that you’re back on the 
                        market. 

           Bishop tilts, getting quiet, whispering devil-breaths.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        You always swayed toward my side, 
                        and now you don’t have the badge 
                        holdin’ you back. 
                             (forceful)
                        So, you’ll come onboard for a bit, 
                        and if you don’t like the scenery 
                        then I’ll cut you loose. No bad 
                        blood. 

           A prickly proposition, Neil choosing his words wisely. 

                                 NEIL
                        Let me chew on the offer, see if I 
                        can set my mind straight. 

           Finished, Neil rises, halting... 

                                 BISHOP
                        There’s another issue to discuss.

           Bishop goes back at the porterhouse, sawing gristle off the 
           bone. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Hundred grand debt in your old 
                        man’s name. I’d put it on your 
                        brother but he can barely keep his 
                        head above water as is. And I don’t 
                        think your pa’s gonna live out his 
                        sentence. So, that leaves you to 
                        take the burden.

           Bishop chews the gristle, refusing to let it go to waste. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure we can come to terms on a 
                        payment plan. 

                                 NEIL
                        Whatever debt my father owes you, 
                        that’s between you and him.  

           The sinewy meat slinks down Bishop’s gullet. 
                                 BISHOP
                        Don’t get me wrong, I respect what 
                        he’s doing, serving his time in 
                        silence; that’s a smart move for 
                        everyone’s sake. But it doesn’t 
                        mean I can wipe the slate clean. 
                        That’s bad business. I do it once, 
                        then I’ve got an entire book full 
                        of shitheads tryin’ to renege on 
                        debt. 
                             (off look)
                        Way I see it, you got two options -- 
                        you could bait and switch with Leon 
                        and his crew on Prospect, but I’m 
                        guessin’ they’d charge at least 
                        four points, leave you chokin’ on 
                        the vig. So, best way for you to 
                        settle with me is come into the 
                        fold, do some work on my behalf and 
                        we’ll be square. 

           Bishop vultures another chunk of meat. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Take a day to think about it. 

           The wet grind of Bishop’s chewing fills the silence. Angus’s 
           eyes burning into Neil, never blinking. 

           Resistance is fatal. Neil departs with an ambiguous stare.

           THE PUB - SECONDS LATER

           Spencer leans over the bar, spitting half-assed game at Bliss 
           as she muddles cocktails on a tray. 

           Impatient, Neil grabs his brother and makes for the exit.

           EXT/INT. GHETTO SHACK - DAY

           Spencer’s nest. Dumpster-chic. Trash strewn in the wreckage. 
           Needles and elastics scattered on milk-crates. Flies amassed 
           on the walls, drifting in the putrid musk. 

           Flynn dodges through the mess, lapping grungy water from his 
           dog bowl. 

           Spencer swatting junk off the crusty sofa. Neil eyeing his 
           new home, understanding rock-bottom.
                                 SPENCER
                             (re: sofa)
                        People say this thing’s pretty 
                        comfortable to sleep on. Most times 
                        they’re passed-out wasted, but 
                        still, at least it’s a place to lay 
                        your head. Best I can offer. 

                                 NEIL
                        ‘preciate it. 

                                 SPENCER
                        You wanna head out, grab drinks?

                                 NEIL
                        Something I gotta do first. You 
                        mind if I take the ride?

                                 SPENCER
                        What’s mine is yours.

           Spencer tosses the keys to Neil.

           EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DUSK

           Parked in the town car, Neil stakes his old tenement, fixated 
           on the entryway, waiting until... 

           He spots Molly and Trev strolling toward the gate. 

           Hopping onto the street, he stalks them at a desperate pace. 

           Molly peeps him, stops and turns, her eyes bristling with 
           disdain, Trev sheltered under her wing. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 NEIL
                        Came to see you.
                             (to Trev)
                        How you doin’ boy?

                                 TREV
                        Fine. 

           Trev nods flatly, mired in that adolescence phase where moods 
           swing from nonchalance to rage with nothing in between. 

           Molly pats him toward the gate.
                                 MOLLY
                        Go inside. 

           Trev shrugs off, Molly turning her venom on Neil.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want you coming ‘round 
                        here. He doesn’t need someone like 
                        you in his life.

           Her words sting. He masks the hurt.

                                 NEIL
                        Someone like me?

                                 MOLLY
                        Setting him down the wrong path. 
                        Teaching him to cheat and steal. 

           Neil eats his comeback, stifling the anger. 

                                 NEIL
                        I wanna make it right. Just tell me 
                        what I gotta do.

                                 MOLLY
                        You’ve done enough. Stay away.

           Molly heads for the door...

                                 NEIL
                        I’m sorry...

           She stops, glancing back at Neil. 

           The apology freezes on his lips...

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Spent two years suffering and now 
                        you’re gonna shut me out?

                                 MOLLY
                             (indignant)
                        Suffering? Don’t even start with 
                        that shit. We’ve been livin’ off 
                        scraps since you bailed on us -- 
                        pullin’ double-shifts just to make 
                        rent. 

                                 NEIL
                        No matter what you think, 
                        everything I’ve done is for us.
           Molly takes a breath, solemn and spiteful. 

                                 MOLLY
                        There is no us... and you don’t get 
                        to write-off the fucked-up shit 
                        you’ve done with good intention. 

           The truth stings. Neil takes the hit, vowing...

                                 NEIL
                        I promise, I’m gonna get you and 
                        Trev outta this dump.

                                 MOLLY
                        We never needed your money or your 
                        promises.
                             (beat)
                        We needed you. 

           But not anymore. She leaves him in the cold.

           EXT. PORT - NIGHT

           Massive cranes and crates stacked on concrete slabs. A few 
           longshoremen toiling as the darkness overwhelms.

           Soaked in a brine of amber light, Bishop and Angus stand 
           alongside SAUL DUGAN (62), a potbellied union honcho, 
           scheming rackets for Bishop at the docks.

           Shielded by a vast wall of crates, they monitor three GULAG 
           HENCHMEN smashing the lock on a shipping container, their 
           progress overseen by...

           PAVEL REPNIN (43), Baltic butcher with a scarecrow face and 
           rabid temperament, Cyrillian letters inked on his knuckles.

           CLANK! Chains break on the container door. Henchmen drag a 
           BARREL DRUM from inside, its shell marked with a warning: 
           HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS.

           Unfazed, they pop the lid with a crowbar, reaching inside the 
           drum, fishing through the oily muck and retrieving a BRICK 
           sheathed in plastic, then handing it to their boss, Pavel.  

           With a switchblade, Pavel guts the package, sampling the 
           contraband; Turkish taffy, pure HEROIN. Bishop, Angus and 
           Saul hovering at Pavel’s side. 

           An icy nod, Pavel signals to his underlings, satisfied.
                                 PAVEL
                        Load it in the truck. 

           Henchmen comply, hauling the barrels into an EIGHTEEN-WHEELER 
           parked nearby.

           Pavel flings a BLACK SATCHEL to Bishop, payoff. Angus opening 
           the zip, checking the count. 

                                 PAVEL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got another shipment on 
                        Sunday.

                                 SAUL
                        We’ll clear the docks.

                                 PAVEL
                        Same rate?

                                 BISHOP
                        Cut goes up on short notice.

           Pavel scowls, displeased with the haggling.

                                 PAVEL
                        How much?

                                 BISHOP
                        Tack on an extra twenty thou’, and 
                        we’ll make sure you got no problems 
                        coming in and out. 

                                 PAVEL
                        That’s a pricey escort. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Better than gettin’ jacked by the 
                        feds. Your entire operation relies 
                        on me. I give you safe harbor, all 
                        I’m askin’ is for a fair share in 
                        return. 
                             (off look)
                        It’s worth the coin, trust me. 

           A pact among thieves, Pavel at the mercy of Bishop, rasped as 
           he extends his hand and shakes with his accomplice. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        We’ll see you on Sunday. 

           Bishop flashes a duplicitous grin as Pavel retreats toward 
           the truck. 
           Sifting the green, Bishop passes a cut to Saul, few thousand. 
           Saul pockets the take, anxious as he faces Bishop.

                                 SAUL
                        We got a problem.

                                 BISHOP
                        With Sunday?

                                 SAUL
                        No. Sunday’s good. 
                             (beat)
                        But collection from Wick’s been 
                        short the last few weeks. Think he 
                        might be fixin’ the books.

                                 BISHOP
                        You sure?

                                 SAUL
                        Heard about some high-rollers 
                        comin’ into his parlor, losin’ big 
                        on a game. Wick offers to slash 
                        their debt in half if they settle 
                        with cash. Then he rips the ticket 
                        and pockets the take like nuthin’ 
                        happened.

           Bishop volcanos in silence, Angus carrying the same hate. 

                                 BISHOP
                        We’ll take care of it.

           EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The eighteen-wheeler chugs along the winding blacktop, rock 
           slopes and weed thickets encroaching. A TAURUS leads the way, 
           guiding the truck ahead. 

           INT. TAURUS - CONTINUOUS

           Henchman at the wheel, Pavel riding shotgun, checking the 
           mirror, hawk-eyed on the eighteen-wheeler. 

           Out of the blackness, an UNMARKED CRUISER skids onto the 
           road, tailing the truck, lights flashing, siren blaring. 

           The big rig slows, relenting to the cruiser’s pursuit, 
           pulling over onto the shoulder. 

           Henchman glances in the rearview, then looks to Pavel.
                                 HENCHMAN
                        Should I stop?

           Pavel, glued to the mirror, a strobe of red and blue igniting 
           his face.

                                 PAVEL
                        Drive ‘til they’re out of sight. 

           EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dust churning as TWO AGENTS exit the cruiser, their FBI 
           WINDBREAKERS billowing in the gale. 

           They march toward the eighteen-wheeler, SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS 
           choked in their palms. 

           Inside the truck, HENCHMEN gather paperwork, stashing 
           HANDGUNS beneath the seats. 

           The Agents arrive on both sides, their demeanor steely.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Need you to step out of the truck.

                                 HENCHMAN
                        We break a law?

           Agent #1 raises his noisemaker, Agent #2 following the trend.

                                 AGENT #1
                        Get out. 

           Henchmen submit, exiting the truck, Agents herding them 
           toward the rear.

                                 AGENT #1 (CONT’D)
                        Open it. 

           They stall, resisting. Agent #2 clocks the Henchman with a 
           shotgun butt, then shoves the barrel in his face.

                                 AGENT #2
                        Do what he says.

           Cold winds gusting as the Henchmen open the hatch, revealing 
           the barrel drums filled with heroin. 

                                 AGENT #1
                        Get inside. 

           Knees raised, the Henchmen crawl into the cargo bay.
           BOOM! BOOM! Shotgun blasts erupt. Punctures gushing blood 
           from the Henchmen’s chests, their bodies slumping onto 
           barrels. 

           Slamming the hatch shut and commandeering the eighteen-
           wheeler, Agent #1...

           RUBEN BOYD (45), a second-rate lawman with a taste for greed. 

           Farther back, Agent #2...

           CALE GALLO (31), a wild-eyed bigot. His unruly hair tangled 
           in the wind as he slips inside the cruiser and stomps the gas 
           pedal, turning one-eighty, following Ruben in the truck.

           EXT/INT. ABANDONED RAIL-STATION - NIGHT

           Scourged walls. Shattered windows. Grime clogged in archaic 
           generators and industrial debris. 

           Gloom sheds from a makeshift fire-pit, flames lapping at the 
           dead-leafed basin.

           Bishop and Angus loom by the heat, watching as HEADLIGHTS 
           appear in the distance, drawing closer. 

           The eighteen-wheeler cuts through the murk, breaching the 
           rubble entrance, with the cruiser in tow. 

           Ruben and Cale emerge from the vehicles, joining the party. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Any problems?

                                 RUBEN
                        Easy pickins’, like you promised. 

           The hatch rattles open from Ruben’s push, Angus dragging the  
           dead Henchmen from the bay and onto a plastic tarp. 

           Bishop divvies two stacks of CASH for the rogue agents. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Might have some work for you on 
                        Sunday. 

                                 RUBEN
                        More of the same?

                                 BISHOP
                        Not sure. Gotta scope the cargo 
                        first. Can you be on call?
           Ruben and Cale take their split of the money -- measly 
           compared to what Bishop’s earning. 

                                 CALE
                        Whatever you need. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (to Ruben)
                        How ‘bout you?

           Ruben scrooges his haul, enamored with the green. 

                                 RUBEN
                        Yea, we’re straight.  

           The ROAR of engines in the distance, swelling like a petrol 
           riptide -- a pack of HEADLIGHTS motoring over the hill. 

                                 RUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Good doing business.

           Time to leave. Ruben and Cale pad to their cruiser, 
           accelerating away from the incoming traffic, stealth mode. 

           Bishop and Angus await their new guests; a caravan of tricked-
           out LOWRIDERS, rumbling up to the fire-pit. 

           First out, LEON TIPTON (37), ghetto legend, a hardscrabble 
           slumlord bred from violence, born to grind. Black-framed 
           eyeglasses correcting his skewed vision.  

           Chrome-strapped THUGS flank him, filtering out the caravan. 
           Among them, the DEALER that Neil busted two years back, OTIS 
           (19). 

           Bishop eyes the ghetto cadre, amused.   

                                 BISHOP
                        You bring the entire the hood?

                                 LEON
                        Just a few of my finest. Out in the 
                        boonies an’ I’m gon’ ride with some 
                        muscle, no matter who sends the 
                        invite. 

           Leon peeps the bloody henchmen on the tarp.

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Rackin’ up the killcount.

                                 BISHOP
                        Wrong place, wrong time. 
           Angus wielding an AXE, hacking the Henchmen into pieces, 
           severing their limbs and tossing them into waterproofed bags. 

                                 LEON
                        You boys are some Jeffrey-Dahmer-
                        motherfuckers, choppin’ bodies like 
                        they nuthin’ but cattle.

                                 BISHOP
                        Makes it easier to bury ‘em deep. 
                        K9’s can’t catch the smell. 

                                 LEON
                        Whatever works. 
                             (down to business)
                        So, you got some brown to sell me?

           Bishop hop-steps into the cargo bay and fishes a brick of 
           heroin from a barrel, tossing it to Leon. 

           Taste-testing, Leon dabs the brown on his tongue, then 
           switchblades grains against the hood of his ride, checking 
           for smear, dilutants. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                             (pleased)
                        Shit’s righteous. Cut to scrambled 
                        eggs and it’ll still give them 
                        hopheads the rush. 

           Leon nods to Otis, prompting him to hand a FAT DUFFLE to 
           Bishop -- heaping mounds of BENJAMINS inside. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                             (admiring Bishop)
                        Helluva game you’re playin. 
                        Gangsters eatin’ out your palm, 
                        cops thinkin’ you’re a saint. 
                        Rippin’ off the suckers, and never 
                        breakin’ a sweat. 

           Bishop counts the dough.

                                 BISHOP
                        No one gets too high or too low. 
                        Everyone plays by the rules.

                                 LEON
                             (correcting)
                        Your rules. 
                                 BISHOP
                             (smirks)
                        I’m just a middle-man. 

                                 LEON
                        That’s bullshit. But hey, I don’t 
                        give a fuck, long as you keep 
                        sellin’ to me. 

           Leon signals to his Thugs. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        Take it.

           They pile into the truck, retrieving the brown bounty. 

                                 LEON (CONT’D)
                        What about the truck?

                                 BISHOP
                        Burn it.

           Nearby, Angus still butchering the Henchmen, mutilating with 
           heartless tact, blood streaked on his face. 

           EXT/INT. BELLAMY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - MORNING

           Concrete ramparts. Fences. Watchtowers. Maximum security. 

           Neil waits in the sterile VISITATION ROOM, plexi-glass 
           separating him from “the otherside”. 

           BUZZ! Door opening, Neil’s father, Graham, hobbling toward 
           the cubicle and sitting across from Neil. Harsh fluorescents 
           glare from above, casting skeletal shadows on Graham’s face.  

           Callous, Neil regards his father’s gaunt appearance -- hollow 
           eyes ravaged by the cancer, sunken with regret.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Long-time comin’. Wasn’t sure if 
                        I’d see you again. 

           Words escape Neil, muted under the weight of the moment. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        They let you out early.

                                 NEIL
                        Good behavior.
                                 GRAHAM
                        Yea, well, your sentence was 
                        pennies compared to mine.
                             (pause)
                        How’re Molly and Trev?

                                 NEIL
                        Doesn’t matter. 

           Silence bristles with accusations unsaid.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You gonna talk to me, or you just 
                        come down here to stare?

           Neil recomposes, dropping the past, getting down to business.

                                 NEIL
                        Spence told me he came to see you.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (nods)
                        Couple days ago. Boy gets on my 
                        nerves. Doesn’t know his place. 

                                 NEIL
                        Are you talkin’ to the feds?

           Graham lurches forward, hushed.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Jesus, keep your fuckin’ voice 
                        down.
                             (beat)
                        And no. I haven’t talked to ‘em 
                        yet. But I reached out. Same DEA 
                        spic who busted us. 

                                 NEIL
                        You do this and you put all of our 
                        lives at risk. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        My name. My decision. 

                                 NEIL
                        That’s not how Bishop sees it. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Fuck ‘im. Irish prick hasn’t done 
                        shit for me behind bars. Whatever 
                        ties we had in the past, shit’s 
                        broken today. 
                                 NEIL
                        You can’t keep this a secret. If 
                        you start cooperating with the law, 
                        he’s gonna hear about it.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I don’t give a damn. I’ve got a few 
                        months tops, not wastin’ my last 
                        breaths inside this fuckin’ 
                        dungeon. 

                                 NEIL
                        Bishop has eyes in here; guards on 
                        his payroll. He finds out you’re a 
                        rat, he’s gonna set the dogs on 
                        you; die by the cancer or die by 
                        the shank; you won’t make it out of 
                        here either way.
                             (reasoning)
                        So, if you got any love left for 
                        your family outside, then you’ll 
                        keep quiet, die with your name 
                        intact. 

           Graham leans back, cocking his head like a stubborn youth. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m done laying down. Been grinding 
                        under Bishop’s thumb all these 
                        years, now it’s my turn. 

           Graham flings the talk-phone at the plexi, waddling back 
           toward the door, a nearby GUARD studying his every move.

           Neil bottles his anger, helpless as his father drifts out of 
           sight. 

           EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

           An American flag thrashing, gnarled in the winter gale. SQUAD 
           CRUISERS huddled in the lot, a minefield of black and white. 

           Exiled from the brotherhood, Neil waits outside, deflecting 
           hostile stares from OFFICERS passing by.

           Down the ramp, LAZ, Neil’s ex-partner, strolls ahead. Neil 
           perks at the sight of him, quelling his unease. 

                                 LAZ
                             (half-kidding)
                        Come to ask for your job back?
                                 NEIL
                             (shaking his head)
                        I’m not that reckless. 

           Neil offers his hand, an awkward pause before Laz shakes it. 

                                 LAZ
                        So, this is just a social call?

                                 NEIL
                        Mostly.

           Laz wears a patrol uniform, stripped of his vice badge. Guilt 
           suddenly bearing down on Neil.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        They got you workin’ rotations?

                                 LAZ
                        “Strategic demotion” is what they 
                        called it. Said my skills would be 
                        put to better use as a bricklayer. 
                        Didn’t have the right mindset for 
                        vice. 

                                 NEIL
                        You okay with it?

                                 LAZ
                             (half-hearted)
                        I’m still in one piece. 
                             (damning)
                        Tough to rise up the ranks when 
                        your partner gets busted dirty. 
                        They won’t say it, but I know they 
                        think I was on the take with you; 
                        shakin’ down dealers, playin’ 
                        kingpin with a shield. Doesn’t make 
                        me a top candidate for promotion. 

           Reality bites, Neil reeling from the disgrace. 

                                 NEIL
                        Listen, you don’t owe me anything, 
                        and I bet you got some hate for 
                        me...

                                 LAZ
                             (interrupting)
                        No hate. Just pity. 

           Neil takes his lumps.
                                 NEIL
                        I gotta ask a favor. 

                                 LAZ
                             (pause)
                        Spit it out. 

                                 NEIL
                        DEA agent who busted me, I need you 
                        to get in touch with him, set up a 
                        meet.

           Laz glowers, dubious of Neil’s intentions, fearing payback.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Relax, it’s nuthin’ like that. Just 
                        a sit-down. My old man’s lookin’ to 
                        cut a deal with him. We need to 
                        iron some things out. 

                                 LAZ
                             (sympathetic)
                        Damn. I’ll see what I can do. 

                                 NEIL
                        Thanks... Here’s my cell.

           A slip of paper, Neil passing it to Laz.

                                 LAZ
                             (dwelling)
                        If he goes through with it, you 
                        should skip town. Hit the Seventy-
                        Five, and take it ‘til you run out 
                        of road... ‘cause they’ll be 
                        gunnin’ for you. Law won’t do shit 
                        about it ‘til there’s chalk and 
                        tape. 

           Neil considers the advice, backing away, separating from Laz.

                                 NEIL
                        ‘preciate the help. 

           EXT/INT. BISHOP’S PUB - NIGHT

           Midnight hour lures the deadbeats. TOWNIES getting lit on the 
           sip and the snort. Chain-smokers burning through packs, 
           hotboxing the clusterfuck in a swampy haze. 
           Molly tends the bar, a madcap of lushes howling for her pour. 
           She takes the abuse, stuffing tips in her pouch, losing years 
           from the stress and smoke. 

           Neil bowls through the crowd, pushing to the counter. Molly 
           eyeing him, too busy to argue. 

                                 MOLLY
                        What do you want?

                                 NEIL
                        Whiskey’s fine. 

           She tilts the bottle, her face puckered as the cup floods. 
           Neil wiping the spillage, leaning close to her.  

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I want you to quit workin’ here. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why’s that?

           Opposite side, Angus glaring at Neil, his bloodshot eyes 
           swollen from the smoke. Neil holds his gaze, then turns back 
           to Molly. 

                                 NEIL
                        Things are ‘bout to go sour and 
                        you’re gonna be in the crossfire. I 
                        can’t protect you anymore.

                                 MOLLY
                             (resentful)
                        You never did. 

           With that, Molly brushes-off, down the counter, serving a 
           toothless panhandler dishing quarters for booze.

           FINGERS paw at Neil’s shoulder, Angus guiding him away from 
           the bar, baiting him into...

           THE BACK PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

           On the couch, Bishop sprawls, reveling in the deviance of the 
           previous night’s plunder, his body slicked with a carnal 
           sweat.

           Next him, Bliss Murphy, naked, dope and liquor dimming her 
           sex-crazed eyes. 

           Neil and Angus intrude, Bishop and Bliss unfazed by their 
           presence, remaining stationary.
           Bishop mouths a bottle of Jameson, regarding Neil...

                                 BISHOP
                        You had some time to think about my 
                        offer?

                                 NEIL
                             (noncommittal)
                        I did. 

           Bishop stretches, shadows slanting on his crooked face. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (disingenuous)
                        Good of you to come back on your 
                        own. Situation would’ve been 
                        unpleasant if I had to track you 
                        down. This should be something you 
                        want. No one’s forcing your hand, 
                        ya know?

           Neil, monk-like, burying his thoughts. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        I got a job for you. Hitch a ride 
                        with Angus tomorrow afternoon. I’ll 
                        wipe off a quarter your old man’s 
                        debt.
                             (clarifying)
                        That’s twenty-five thousand for a 
                        few hours work. Where else are you 
                        gonna earn like that?

           A COMMOTION outside, VOICES clamoring. 

           Quick to the trigger, Angus retrieves his .45 SEMI-AUTO, 
           blending into the shadows as...

           Pavel barges into the parlor, boiling with discontent. He 
           doesn’t even notice the .45 aimed at his head.

                                 PAVEL
                             (to Bishop)
                        I need a word with you, in private. 

           Bishop nods assuredly, Angus lowering the hardware. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (to Bliss)
                        Pack up.

           Bliss wobbles into the bathroom, Neil and Angus retreating 
           into the main bar. 
           A smug expression as Bishop swigs the bottle, barricading 
           himself in a wall of indifference. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Have a seat.

                                 PAVEL
                        This’ll be quick.

                                 BISHOP
                        Somethin’ wrong?

                                 PAVEL
                        My truck disappeared last night. 

           Bishop plays dumb, sparking a cigarette.

                                 BISHOP
                        Disappeared?

                                 PAVEL
                        Last I saw, there was cruiser 
                        chasin’ it down the highway. 
                        Shipment must’ve been seized.  

                                 BISHOP
                        That’s too bad. Pitfalls of the 
                        business we work in.  

                                 PAVEL
                        Hasn’t been reported yet. You read 
                        anything into that?

           Bishop, in his element -- orchestrating from the shadows, 
           hedging his bets and scamming the suckers. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Dark alliances between lawmen and 
                        pushers. You gotta be careful who 
                        you trust. Put too much faith in a 
                        man and he’s bound to turn against 
                        you. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ve got sources everywhere. If 
                        somethin’ unholy went down, I’ll 
                        hear about it, and you’ll be the 
                        first to know. 

           THE MAIN BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Neil watches Molly from afar, a throng of drunkards obscuring 
           his view. She commands the bar with grace, strength fostered 
           in his absence. 
           Neil weakens with a nauseating sense of dread. His worried 
           eyes shifting to Pavel as he huffs out of the pub. 

           INT. GHETTO SHACK - MORNING

           RING! Neil’s cellphone. He rests awkwardly on Spencer’s 
           couch, immersed in a bed of trash -- hard to distinguish him 
           from the junk.

           He answers the call, groggy, shaking cobwebs. 

                                 NEIL
                             (into phone)
                        Yea.

                                 LAZ (V.O.)
                             (over phone)
                        Got you a meeting. Set it out of 
                        town. You know Milton’s BBQ?

                                 NEIL
                             (into phone)
                        Sure.

                                 LAZ (V.O.)
                             (over phone)
                        Be there in an hour. 

           EXT/INT. MILTON’S BBQ PIT - MORNING

           A sleazy dump. Smoke billowing from the coal-pit. A grease-
           battered PIGMASTER searing raw cuts on the fire.  

           Neil wades through the fumes, finding Manny Hunt, the DEA 
           agent who busted him two years ago, waiting in a tight-
           quartered booth. Neil sits on the opposite side.

                                 MANNY
                        I ordered some grub for us.

                                 NEIL
                        You paying?

                                 MANNY
                             (smirks)
                        That depends. 

                                 NEIL
                        On what?
                                 MANNY
                        On what you’re bringing to the 
                        table. 

           Innuendo cuts like a knife. 

                                 NEIL
                             (redirecting)
                        You talk to my father yet?

                                 MANNY
                        Supposed to meet with him tomorrow.

                                 NEIL
                        Cancel it.

                                 MANNY
                        Why would I do that?

                                 NEIL
                        You’re gonna get him killed.

                                 MANNY
                             (undeterred)
                        Then he must know somethin’ worth 
                        hearing. 

           Negotiations begin, Neil raising his guard. 

           A WAITRESS shepherds a plate of ribs and slaw to the table. 
           Manny wastes no time, digging in, getting his hands dirty. 

                                 NEIL
                        What do you want?

                                 MANNY
                        Make an offer. I’ll tell you if I’m 
                        interested. 

           Neil’s words lump in his throat. He hesitates, then blurts it 
           out.

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll give you Bishop Dunn... but we 
                        gotta do it on my terms. 

           Manny balks at the tender. 

                                 MANNY
                        That’s a tough catch to hook. Been 
                        after him for the better part of a 
                        decade. Every time I get close, he 
                        sniffs it out.

                        Guy’s got a sixth sense when comes 
                        to heat, buck you off if he gets a 
                        whiff of your stink.  

                                 NEIL
                        I’m on-point with him later today.

                                 MANNY
                        That’s a start. 
                             (waiting for more)
                        What’s the gig? Guns? Drugs?

           Neil parries, setting his terms.

                                 NEIL
                        I need you to stay away from my 
                        father. 

                                 MANNY
                        You gotta throw me some nuggets 
                        before we deal. I’m not gonna drop 
                        a source at your word.
                             (chewing)
                        Come back to me with something 
                        real, then we can talk.

           Manny devouring the ribs, no regard for manners or courtesy. 
           It’s all part of a system that feeds his agenda. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                             (warning, re: Bishop)
                        Don’t take this guy for granted. 
                        He’s shakin’ hands with the city’s 
                        finest; feeding green to the 
                        otherside while they cover his ass; 
                        eyes wide shut, burying paperwork 
                        to save face. I’d put money that 
                        he’s got the feds in his pocket. 
                        You don’t skate prison all these 
                        years without someone watchin’ your 
                        back.  

           Neil rises, putting his stamp on the union.

                                 NEIL
                        Just hold off on cuttin’ a deal 
                        with my old man.

           Meat sticking to Manny’s gums as he grits and swallows. 

                                 MANNY
                        No guarantees. 
                             (off look)
                        I’ll give you two days.

                        Clock’s tickin’. 

           EXT. BISHOP’S PUB - DAY

           A TAXI puttering up to the curb, Neil exiting, paying the 
           driver, spotting Angus and Bishop waiting for him by a TOWN 
           CAR in the alley. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Get in.

           EXT/INT. TOWN CAR - LATER

           Spencer chauffeurs, Angus riding shotgun, Neil and Bishop in 
           the backseat. 

           Wind hisses through a cracked window, undercutting the hush. 
           Neil’s eyes meet Spencer’s in the rearview mirror, queasy and 
           restless.

           MOMENTS LATER

           ROW HOUSES sprout from the blacktop. Arthritic trees, 
           leafless in the smog and filth.   

           Spencer parks at the curb, Bishop leaning toward him. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Stay here. 

           The trunk pops, Angus fetching a WATERPROOFED DUFFLE, 
           following Bishop and Neil to a tar-papered row house.  

           Bishop hits the BUZZER, glancing at a TINY CAMERA mounted 
           above them, breathing impatiently until the DOOR OPENS...

           INT. ROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A security GOON checks them at the entrance, recognizing 
           Bishop and clearing their entry.

           Down the steps, Bishop, Neil and Angus funnel into...

           THE GAMBLING PARLOR - MOMENTS LATER

           A makeshift saloon. Plasma screens and wager tables crowded 
           on a pad of ash-smeared carpet. 
           Saul, union honcho from the docks, straddles a stool, sipping 
           on an old fashioned. Next to him...

           WICK SHELTON (36), a hyperactive bookie, sweating bullets and 
           muttering curses under his breath. He stiffens at the sight 
           of Bishop, blowing off his steam...

                                 WICK
                        What the fuck’s going on?
                             (re: Saul)
                        Fatass waddles in here barkin’ 
                        orders, tellin’ me I gotta shut 
                        down for the day. 
                             (beat)
                        Costing me a fuckload of money. And 
                        when I don’t earn, you don’t earn. 
                        This is a partnership between me 
                        and you. I can’t have butterball 
                        breathing down my neck every 
                        fuckin’ week. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Anything else?

                                 WICK
                        What’s the problem? And please 
                        don’t tell me you’re coming down to 
                        renegotiate the split. I work my 
                        fuckin’ ass off every day, and your 
                        cronies swoop in here once a week 
                        to pick up a fuckin’ envelope. 

                                 BISHOP
                        That’s gonna come to an end. 

           Wick recoils, startled by the severity of Bishop’s tone. 

           WHAP! Lightning fast, Saul hammers Wick to the floor, his 
           hand clasped on Wick’s throat, dragging him into...

           THE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tiles shatter, Wick crashing into the wall, blood streaming 
           down his face, Saul looming over him. 

           Angus unzips the duffle, removing a pair of shackles, cuffing 
           Wick to the shower bar. 

           Tongue-tied, Neil hovers in the background.  

           Bishop steps to Wick, savoring the moment.
                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been careless. Sweeping 
                        profits under the rug.

                                 WICK
                             (breathless)
                        What? What’re you talkin’ about?

                                 BISHOP
                        When you mess with my money, it 
                        makes me look weak, like you’re 
                        fuckin’ me in broad daylight.

                                 WICK
                        I didn’t...

           WHAP! Saul’s knuckles pancake Wick’s nose. Protests drowned 
           in blood. 

                                 BISHOP
                        If I let a schmuck like you steal 
                        from me, then where does it end. 

                                 WICK
                        It never happened. I swear. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (amused)
                        That’s one thing you’ve always been 
                        good at; lying to get what you 
                        wanted. Makes you unreliable. So, 
                        I’m gonna do you a favor. 

           Bishop nods, Angus wielding PLIERS and SWITCHBLADE. 

                                 WICK
                        Please. Don’t do this.
                             (shouting)
                        Help! Somebody, get me tha’ fuck 
                        outta here!

           WHAP! Saul’s fist stuns Wick. Pliers rattling against Wick’s 
           teeth as Angus yanks his tongue and lops it with the blade. 
           Blood spurts from the nub over Wick’s lips.

           Neil losing his nerve, about to cut and run when...

                                 BISHOP
                        Get over here. 

           Bishop pulls Neil front and center, Angus handing him the 
           switchblade. 
                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Finish the job. 

           Blood on Neil’s hands as he grips the hilt, his eyes pitying 
           Wick. He can’t bring himself to do it. 

           Angus brandishes his .45, aiming the barrel at Neil, urging 
           obedience.  

           Wick gargles his own blood, euphoric from the shock. Neil 
           holding strong, unbending. 

           CLICK. Angus jacks the slide, fingering the trigger, Bishop 
           losing his patience. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        This is the only way you get my 
                        trust. Rite of passage. Bury that 
                        knife in his fuckin’ throat, or 
                        I’ll put it in yours. 

           Veins throbbing on Neil’s temple. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Just imagine what I’ll do to your 
                        wife and your boy. 

           Enough. Neil bulls forward, gashing Wick’s throat, blade 
           lodging in the cartilage, blood drenching Neil’s body. 

           It’s done. Life draining from Wick’s eyes. Neil lingering, 
           his face washed in guilt and relief.  

           Angus lowers the .45, speaking to Neil for the first time...

                                 ANGUS
                        Now you’re one of us. 

           EXT. ROW HOUSE - LATER

           In the town car, Spencer waits, snorting bumps of white to 
           pass the time, riling himself into a narcotic frenzy.

           Through the window, he watches his comrades exit the row 
           house... 

           Angus carrying the duffle, encumbered by the weight of Wick’s 
           mutilated body. Neil doused in blood, accompanied by Bishop.

           They pile into the ride. Spencer lock-jawed, shaken at the 
           sight of his brother. 
           EXT. LANDFILL - DUSK

           Red sun bleeds onto the synthetic wasteland. An ocean of 
           plastic suffocating the bitter soil. Gulls circling the 
           flotsam. Dormant backhoes stationed on the outskirts...

           A fresh grave. Neil shoveling the edges, several feet deep 
           already. His body caked in a sludge of mud and sweat. 

           Angus oversees the digging, towering above Neil, three 
           duffles on the precipice, waiting to fill the hole. 

           Spent, Neil looks to Angus for relief.

                                 ANGUS
                        Deeper. 

           Exhaustion takes its toll, Neil slaving away, gouging the 
           earth, burrowing into the muddy blackness. 

           EXT/INT. BELLAMY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - MORNING

           Private visitation room. Air whispering through a ventilation 
           shaft. DEA agent, Manny Hunt, sitting at a metal desk.  

           BUZZ! Door opening, Graham entering, escorted by a GUARD. 
           Shackles clattering on Graham’s wrists and ankles as he sits. 

           The Guard lingers, standing nosily by the wall.

                                 MANNY
                        You can leave us. 

           Displeased, the Guard nods out of the room, closing the door.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Met your boy yesterday. Didn’t have 
                        much to offer, but he was tryin’ 
                        his best to keep me away from you. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Looks like you weren’t convinced.

           Manny lights a smoke, dictating the pace of conversation.

                                 MANNY
                        Before we get into this, let me 
                        explain how I operate. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not your amigo, your partner or 
                        your priest. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MANNY (CONT'D)
                        Nuthin’ you say to me is gonna 
                        pardon the shit you’ve done. Far as 
                        I’m concerned you’re a fuckin’ 
                        pariah, and the only reason you’ve 
                        got my ear is ‘cause you can lead 
                        me up the food chain. 
                             (beat)
                        So, if we do this, you gotta go all-
                        in, no holding back. Either you’re 
                        on my side or you’re against me. 
                        There’s no room for in-between. 

           Silence. Graham’s withered eyes bore into Manny.

                                 GRAHAM
                        You got an extra smoke?

           Manny passes a cigarette to Graham, sparking it. The smoke 
           agitates Graham’s lungs, hacking phlegm, a demented grin on 
           his face as he embraces the pain, dying on his own terms. 

                                 GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                        I can give you Bishop Dunn on a 
                        platter; his suppliers, stash 
                        houses, kickbacks at the docks. 
                             (setting terms)
                        I want out of here by Monday. Draft 
                        up the paperwork and I’ll tell you 
                        everything I know. 

           INT. STASH HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Bishop’s Fort Knox. Brick walls. Reinforced steel door. No 
           windows. Tables cluttered with GUNS, DRUGS, MONEY, PASSPORTS. 

           Bishop stacks his plunder on a shelf.

           RING! Cell phone. He answers the call. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (into phone)
                        What is it?

           INTERCUT - STASH HOUSE AND PRISON HALLWAY

           The Guard uses a PAYPHONE, staring menacingly at the 
           VISITATION ROOM where Graham is meeting with the DEA. 

                                 GUARD
                             (into phone)
                        You’ve got a leak.
                                 BISHOP
                        Who?

                                 GUARD
                        Graham’s in a room with the DEA. 

           Accusation knocks the wind out of Bishop, his eyes on fire. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Keep me posted. 

           END INTERCUT

           INT. GHETTO SHACK - LATER

           Cold water spurts from a showerhead. Neil scrubbing fiercely, 
           trying to wash the blood and grime from his skin. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           The mutt, Flynn, curled up next to Spencer, sleeping.

           Neil pushes into the lair, finding Spencer unconscious. A 
           belt cinched on his arm above blackened TRACK MARKS. 

           Instinct kicking in, Neil smacks life into Spencer’s face.

                                 NEIL
                        Wake up!

           A few hits and Spencer’s glassy eyes roll open.

                                 SPENCER
                             (annoyed)
                        Jesus, calm down. I’m fine. 

           Spencer fights the nausea, twisting and puking onto his cot. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Sunlight pierces a window. Bent aviators shield Spencer from 
           the rays. He quivers, pouring kibble for Flynn and a cup of 
           OJ for himself, mold bobbing in the spoiled drink. 

           Neil regarding his brother with concern. 

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        I gotta run pickups for Bishop 
                        today. You mind driving?
           EXT/INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           Cruising through the projects, Neil at the wheel, Spencer 
           riding shotgun, Flynn slobbering on the console. 

           Spencer shivers from the come down, Neil eyeing him. 

                                 NEIL
                        You gotta quit with that shit.

           Deep breaths, Spencer taming his nerves. 

                                 SPENCER
                        Plenty of worse ways to die. I’d 
                        rather fade into a dream and never 
                        wake up than get butchered on the 
                        street. 
                             (navigating)
                        Turn here and park at the corner.

           Neil swerves, halting at a spiked sidewalk. 

           EXT/INT. CUT-RATE AUTO REPAIR - MOMENTS LATER

           A nickel and dime chop shop in a crime-addled ghetto.  

           Sparks and beats jolt from the pit. Tatted GANGSTERS juicing 
           their rides with stolen parts.  

           Neil and Spencer stroll ahead, catching glares from every eye 
           in the pit -- one false move and bullets are sure to fly. 

           Through the hatchway, Spencer leads Neil to a rusted door, 
           pounding until a slot opens, eyes peeping through gap. 

                                 SPENCER
                        Here to see Leon. 

           Black “POPEYE”, a barrel-chested thug, opens the door. 

                                 POPEYE
                        Sup, man. How you been?

                                 SPENCER
                        Same ol’ shit.

                                 POPEYE
                             (re: Neil)
                        Who’s this?
                                 SPENCER
                        My brother. He’s cool. 

           Popeye lays a stare on Neil, not fucking around. 

                                 POPEYE
                        You know the routine.

           Spencer and Neil raise their arms, allowing Popeye to pat 
           them down, checking for weapons and wires.

                                 POPEYE (CONT’D)
                        Leon’s in the basement. 

           CUT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Bare-assed SKANKS cut and package heroin into baggies, Leon 
           and Otis directing the operation. 

           Neil and Spencer enter the sanctuary, drawing attention.

                                 SPENCER
                             (impressed, re: heroin)
                        Damn, you guys are flush. 

                                 LEON
                        Just keepin’ afloat. 
                             (re: collection)
                        That time of the month already?

                                 SPENCER
                        ‘Fraid so. 

                                 LEON
                        Your boss is lucky I still got 
                        respect for that old-school shit. 
                        No way I’d be payin’ his ass 
                        otherwise.  

           Leon grabs two stacks of CASH, tossing them to Spencer.

                                 SPENCER
                        Small price for peace of mind. 

           Otis scowling, fixated on Neil. 

                                 OTIS
                        I know this motherfucker.
                             (remembering)
                        Dude’s a cop. Ripped me on the 
                        corner a few years back. 

           Otis unleashes his chrome, aiming at Neil.
                                 NEIL
                        Whoa, easy. 

           WHAP! No hesitation, Otis pistol-whips Neil, drawing blood, 
           payback.

                                 SPENCE
                        Hold up. Chill. He got axed from 
                        the force, spent the last two years 
                        at county. 

                                 LEON
                             (to Neil)
                        That right?

           Neil, on his knees, shielding his face with an open palm. 

                                 NEIL
                        Been a citizen since I got out, 
                        flipped sides. I work for Bishop 
                        now. 

           Leon ponders the confession, judging Neil.

                                 LEON
                        If I hear different, I’m gon’ come 
                        find both of you.
                             (beat)
                        Now, get out my shop. 

           INT. TOWN CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Neil drives, warding off Flynn from licking his bloody nose. 
           Spencer offers a crumpled fast food wrapper to plug the cut.

                                 SPENCER
                        You alright?

           Neil stuffs his nostril and stares at his reflection -- the 
           mistakes of his past coming back to haunt him. 

                                 NEIL
                             (beat)
                        Where to next?

           EXT. BACK HARBOR - DAY

           Nameless brick warehouses corroded in the briny mist. Mangled 
           parking meters on the potholed street. 
           Neil and Spencer pace toward a set of copper double-doors, 
           tapping the buzzer and glancing at the security cam. 

           A hollow thud as the entrance sways open, Neil and Spencer 
           stepping inside, two GULAG HENCHMEN patting them down. 

           INT. SOVIET SEX DUNGEON - MOMENTS LATER

           A perverse haunt. Red lights emitting a sinister gloom. A 
           choral mash of sex cries muffled through curtains and mortar. 

           Neil and Spencer weave through a melange of underaged SEX 
           SLAVES -- doped-up and strewn on grungy furniture. 

           Pavel holds court in a BACK ROOM, anorexic tramps groveling 
           for his attention. He strips their hard-earned cash, 
           pocketing the bulk and tossing them the scraps. 

           His eyes shift to Neil and Spencer as they approach. 

                                 PAVEL
                        There something I can do for you?

                                 SPENCER
                        Here to collect for Bishop.

                                 PAVEL
                             (annoyed)
                        Didn’t I pay you a few weeks ago?

                                 SPENCER
                        That was last month’s dues. 

           Pavel grins bullishly, groping a matchstick harlot onto his 
           lap. 

                                 PAVEL
                        Tell your boss that I’ll pay him at 
                        the docks on Sunday. 

           Spencer eyes the money in Pavel’s hand. 

                                 SPENCER
                             (feisty)
                        Looks like you have enough to pay 
                        right now. 

                                 PAVEL
                        He’s gonna have to wait. If that’s 
                        a problem, he can come down here 
                        and see me himself. 
           Neil regards the harem with mixture of repulsion and sorrow. 

                                 PAVEL (CONT’D)
                             (re: sex slaves)
                        Take your pick. I’ll give you a 
                        first-time discount. 

                                 NEIL
                             (disconcerted)
                        I’ll pass.
                             (to Spencer)
                        Let’s go. 

           Neil retreats, dragging his brother with him. 

           EXT. GATED CEMETERY - NIGHT

           A gnarled forest insulates the sprawling graveyard. Vines 
           strangling headstones under the dull moonlight. 

           Bishop and Angus wait in a trough, sequestered from the 
           entrance as a SEDAN meanders toward them. 

           Their FBI conspirators exit the vehicle, Ruben and Cale. 

                                 RUBEN
                        What’s the emergency?

                                 BISHOP
                             (beat)
                        One of our guys inside is talkin’ 
                        to the DEA.

                                 RUBEN
                        How much does he know?

                                 BISHOP
                        Enough to hurt us. 
                             (beat)
                        I need you to go upstate. Make him 
                        think you’re there to cut a deal, 
                        and find out how much he’s spilled. 

                                 RUBEN
                        Then what?

                                 BISHOP
                        I’ll take care of the rest.

                                 CALE
                             (beat)
                        We still on for Sunday?
                                 BISHOP
                             (nods)
                        Same routine.

           INT. TOWN CAR - NIGHT

           Alone, Neil rummages through the glove box, swiping a chunk 
           of CASH from the day’s extortion pickups. 

           INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - LATER

           THUD! Neil pounds on the door to his old pad, Molly 
           answering, irritated by Neil’s presence. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m not in the mood for this. 
                        There’s nuthin’ for us to talk 
                        about.

           Neil wedges his foot in the door. 

                                 NEIL
                        Gimme five minutes, then I’ll 
                        leave... I promise. 

           Molly hesitates, straddling the frame. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Can I come inside?

                                 MOLLY
                        No. Say your peace right here.  

           Trev creeps behind Molly, peeking through the half-shut door. 

                                 NEIL
                        I won’t apologize, ‘cause I know 
                        you don’t wanna hear it.
                             (beat)
                        Hate me, blame me; I can take the 
                        hits, probably deserve ‘em. If you 
                        wanna cut me out of your life, 
                        fine; but don’t expect me to roll 
                        over when harm’s coming your way. 

                                 MOLLY
                        If we’re in danger it’s just more 
                        of the same. Coped for two years 
                        without you, haven’t missed a beat. 
                                 NEIL
                             (conceding)
                        I’m not arguing. You’re right. I 
                        don’t deserve your trust... but 
                        that’s not gonna stop me from 
                        tryin’ to earn it back.

           Neil hands the wad of stolen CASH to Molly.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Are you workin’ this weekend?

                                 MOLLY
                        I’m off ‘til Monday.

                                 NEIL
                        It’ll be over by then.

                                 MOLLY
                        What’re you talking about? 
                             (re: cash)
                        Where’d you get this?

                                 NEIL
                        Just stay away from Bishop. Shack 
                        up in a motel outside town. I’ll 
                        come for you when it’s safe.

                                 MOLLY
                        Why can’t we stay here?

                                 NEIL
                             (beat)
                        You’re gonna have to trust me.

           INT. BELLAMY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - MORNING

           Private visitation room. A Guard escorts Graham into the 
           sterile cube, Ruben and Cale waiting by the desk. They warm 
           to Graham with wolfish smiles. 

                                 RUBEN
                        Mr. Breslin, my name’s Ruben Boyd, 
                        and this is my partner Cale Gallo. 
                        We’re from the FBI. 

           Ruben and Cale flash their FBI BADGES. 

                                 RUBEN (CONT’D)
                        I understand you’ve been talking to 
                        the DEA about an upcoming case... 
                                 GRAHAM
                             (stunned)
                        How’d you know that?

                                 CALE
                        DEA’s a leaky ship.

                                 RUBEN
                        We have reason to believe there’s a 
                        corrupt faction within the DEA. 
                        Good chance someone in their midst 
                        is in league with Bishop Dunn.

                                 CALE
                        You gotta be careful who you talk 
                        to.

                                 RUBEN
                        We’d like for you to deal with us 
                        exclusively from now on. Otherwise, 
                        we can’t ensure your safety. 

           Graham shakes his head skeptically. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        Guy I’m dealin’ with busted me two 
                        years back... no way he’s dirty. 

                                 CALE
                        May not be him, but it could be 
                        someone he’s workin’ with. 

                                 RUBEN
                        We’re in a better position to get 
                        you out of here. So, we need to 
                        know exactly what you told him. Did 
                        you sign any paperwork?

                                 GRAHAM
                        No. 
                             (reflective)
                        You’re sure about the leak?

                                 RUBEN
                        Unfortunately, yes.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Then you gotta get a message to my 
                        boy. Tell him to steer clear of the 
                        DEA.

           An alarming revelation, Ruben and Cale share a worried 
           glance.
                                 RUBEN
                        Your son is working with the DEA?

                                 GRAHAM
                        I don’t know, but he’s met with 
                        ‘em. Figure it’s best he cuts ties 
                        before they tip off Bishop. 
                             (beat)
                        Can you get in touch with him?

           Graham stirs in his chair, unaware that he’s just authorized 
           his son’s death warrant. 

                                 RUBEN
                             (pause)
                        Yea, we’ll find him right away. 

           INT. BISHOP’S PUB - MORNING

           A runny egg yolk leaks across a plate, Bishop shredding the 
           yellow bulb, slopping it into his mouth. Coffee and 
           cigarettes accompany the meal, along with the morning paper. 

           At the bar, Angus cleans glasses under a jet of hot water.

           Neil enters, carrying an envelope with the extortion payoffs.

                                 BISHOP
                        Where’s your brother?

           Neil slides the envelope across the counter.

                                 NEIL
                        Sleepin’ in. 

           Bishop scans the newspaper.

                                 BISHOP
                        You read the paper?

                                 NEIL
                        Not much.

                                 BISHOP
                        Hard to tell which of these stories 
                        you can trust. Buncha reporters 
                        stamping bullshit in ink, hoping it 
                        sticks. For all I know, every 
                        single word could be a lie.
                             (pause)
                        See your pa’ recently?
                                 NEIL
                        I haven’t.

           A disingenuous frown on Bishop’s face. 

                                 BISHOP
                        I hear he’s not doing so well. Wish 
                        him my best next time you visit.

                                 NEIL
                        I will. 
                             (beat)
                        Listen, if you got any extra work, 
                        I’m lookin’ to earn. I can’t be 
                        treadin’ water with you for the 
                        next year. Put me on somethin’ big 
                        enough so I can payback my father’s 
                        debt and start makin’ on my own. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Why the sudden change of heart?

                                 NEIL
                        What else am I gonna do? Like you 
                        said, this is where I’m supposed to 
                        be. 

           RING! Bishop’s phone chimes. He answers the call. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (into phone)
                        Yea.

           He listens... nodding until suddenly his eyes widen, trained 
           on Neil, a subtle menace in his voice...

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        That’s disappointing to hear. I was 
                        hoping things would turn out 
                        differently. 

           His grip tightens on the phone.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        I’m in the middle of something. 
                        I’ll call you back. 

           Bishop ends the call, his eyes still zeroed on Neil. 
                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Don’t have any work for you right 
                        now, but there might be somethin’ 
                        comin’ up. I’ll get to you when the 
                        time’s right. 

                                 NEIL
                        Sure. 

           Neil exits, Bishop and Angus eyeing him to the door. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (to Angus)
                        Follow him. 

           EXT. OLYMPUS GARAGE - DAY

           Abandoned. Desolate. Satanic graffiti emblazoned on the 
           ramps. Squatting nests and refuse littered throughout.

           Neil steers up the spiral, turning the car in knots until he 
           arrives at the TOP PLATFORM, finding... 

           Manny Hunt, basking in the wintry gloom, a STORM on the 
           horizon. 

           Neil strolls to Manny, leaning against the rail. 

                                 MANNY
                        When I was a kid, I used to sit on 
                        the porch, watching storms roll 
                        through, tryin’ to figure which way 
                        they were gonna turn. 
                             (beat)
                        After a while I stopped guessing. 
                        I’d run straight into ‘em, rain and 
                        snow belting me ‘til I was numb... 
                        my mother acted like I’d lost my 
                        mind... I told her, I’d rather get 
                        hit on my own terms than wait for 
                        beatdown. 
                             (turns to Neil)
                        So, what’s it gonna be for you?

                                 NEIL
                        I need you to get my family into 
                        witness protection. 

                                 MANNY
                        You’re jumping the gun. I can’t 
                        just snap my fingers and make it 
                        rain. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MANNY (CONT'D)
                        There’s a shitload of red tape 
                        cloggin’ up WitPro, and I gotta 
                        make sure you’re the real deal 
                        before I even bring this to my 
                        bosses. So, please, tell me you’ve 
                        got somethin’ to trade. 

                                 NEIL
                        Not today. I’m gonna pull through 
                        for you, but I need a show of good 
                        faith. Help my wife and my kid, and 
                        I’ll do whatever you ask.  

           Manny balks at Neil’s demand, marching toward his Pontiac. 

                                 MANNY
                        Don’t come to me with that guilt-
                        trip bullshit. You wanna keep your 
                        family safe?... then buy a gun and 
                        sit by the door. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m not in the babysitting 
                        business, and I’ve already got your 
                        old man on the hook, so I’m gonna 
                        squeeze him for everything he’s 
                        got, which is a helluva lot more 
                        than you can offer. 

           VROOM! An engine flares from the ramp below, intensifying as 
           a gunmetal MUSTANG revs onto the top platform. 

           Standoff. The Mustang idles at the ramp mouth, bullying Neil 
           and Manny, blocking their exit. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        The hell is this?

           Distant thunder booms over the Mustang’s rackety growl. 
           Windows gliding open, Neil backing toward the rail, Manny 
           drawing his PISTOL.  

           VROOOOM! Burning rubber, the Mustang lurches forward, ANGUS 
           at the wheel, muscling his TEC-9 out the window. 

           Neil and Manny scatter, ducking for cover behind their cars.

           BOOM! A swarm of bullets. Glass shattering. Metal imploding. 

           WHOMP! The Mustang plows into the Pontiac, squashing Manny 
           against the rail, his scream swallowed in the impact.  

           Tires squeal, reversing, the Mustang revving onto its 
           haunches, Angus unleashing hell from his Tec-9.
           Neil dives into the fray, dragging Manny from under the 
           sandwiched Pontiac. Sparks slashing, copper haymakers pelting 
           the cement as he dodges and grabs Manny’s pistol. 

           WHOMP! Battering ram, the Mustang smashes the two cars like 
           candlepins, knocking them apart.  

           Manny flops into the open, hobbled, crawling for his life -- 
           the stairwell within reach... 

           The Mustang skids around a curve, bulldozing Manny, smearing 
           him onto the asphalt.

           A pulp of shredded flesh and bone, Manny hanging by a thread, 
           his body twisted into pieces. 

           VROOM! The Mustang spins one-eighty, Angus hanging out the 
           window, ventilating Manny’s body with the TEC-9.

           BOOM! Neil retaliates, popping rounds from Manny’s pistol. 

           Angus races toward him, gunning with his streetsweeper. 

           Slugs pockmark the town car, Neil shielded by the fender, 
           chugging air as sparks nip at his face. 

           The Mustang veers around the edge, whirling, gearing for 
           another bull-rush. 

           Neil bolts inside the town car, stomping the gas...

           Down the ramp, on a collision course, hellbent on inflicting 
           pain. Neil jerks the wheel sideways, then rips it back, nose-
           diving into the Mustang. 

           WHOMP! An eruption of metal and smoke. Hoods crumpling. Glass 
           everywhere. Neil and Angus bloodied from the crash. 

           Fleeting silence, then...

           Angus punches the accelerator, pounding Neil’s car into a 
           pillar. Neil teeters from the whiplash. Angus snatching his 
           TEC-9, spraying the town car with bullets. 

           Shattering chaos. Neil turtles under the window, wrenching 
           the wheel and hitting the gas. 

           SCREECH! The town car bustles from the Mustang’s pinch, 
           slithering down the strip. 

           Rubber melting as the Mustang pursues, careening around sharp 
           corners, descending at a breakneck pace.
           Neil works the handbrake, fishtailing at the switchbacks and 
           thrashing along the straightaways. 

           THWACK! The Mustang bucks Neil’s fender, jittering along the 
           guardrail, sideswiping cinder blocks until...

           Angus pulls alongside, hammering Neil toward the ledge...

           WHOMP! Neil yanks the handbrake, clipping the Mustang’s tail 
           and sending Angus headfirst into the switchback wall. 

           SILENCE.

           Breathless, Neil glares at the demolished Mustang, startled 
           as Angus spills from the door, stumbling to his feet, firing 
           the TEC-9. 

           BOOM! Wayward shots pummel Neil’s car. He dips below the 
           dashboard, speeding down the ramp and out the exit.

           INT. BELLAMY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - DAY

           MAIN VISITATION ROOM. Cubicles with plexi-glass separating 
           visitors from the inmates. 

           Bishop simmers on a chair as Graham waddles toward him. They 
           stare in silence, a lifetime’s distrust boiling over.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (surly)
                        Nice of you to come and visit. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Strange how things work out, isn’t 
                        it? 

                                 GRAHAM
                        How so?

                                 BISHOP
                        You and I cut our teeth together. 
                        Same neighborhood. Same upbringing. 
                        Two kids scrapin’ the bottom of the 
                        barrel, tryin’ to climb out of the 
                        muck. But you never made it.

                                 GRAHAM
                        That’s ‘cause you closed the lid on 
                        me. 
                                 BISHOP
                        I did everything I could for you.
                             (beat)
                        You just never had the stomach for 
                        this life. Always makin’ the easy 
                        choice, settlin’ for a quick fix. 

                                 GRAHAM
                        You come down here to lecture a 
                        dying man?

                                 BISHOP
                             (menacing)
                        No, you’re already dead. And I 
                        wanted you to hear it from me.  
                             (beat)
                        I know about your deal with the 
                        feds; runnin’ your mouth like a 
                        faggot. A man like that doesn’t 
                        deserve to breathe; he needs to be 
                        silenced.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Then why don’t you climb over the 
                        glass and we can settle this right 
                        now.

                                 BISHOP
                        I don’t think you’re hearing me. 
                        It’s already done. I’m just holdin’ 
                        off so I can tell you this... 
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna bury your entire fuckin’ 
                        bloodline; your boys, grandson, his 
                        cunt mother... they’re gonna feel 
                        the same pain that was meant for 
                        you. Then I’m gonna burn their 
                        bodies until there’s no trace of 
                        you left. 

           Bishop lowers the talk-phone, letting his threat sink in, 
           then walking away as Graham thrashes the plexi, screaming, 
           hacking phlegm, belligerent as the GUARDS subdue him. 

           EXT/INT. GHETTO SHACK - LATER

           Spencer’s place. Neil launches the mangled town car onto the 
           curb, hustling inside...

                                 NEIL
                        Spence! 
                                 SPENCER (O.S.)
                        Yea, I’m in here.

           Lounging, Spencer chomps on a bowl of cereal, watching TV, 
           Neil entering, bloodied from mayhem in the garage.

                                 SPENCER (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit... what happened to you?

                                 NEIL
                        Get up. We gotta go. 

           Urgency in Neil’s tone stuns Spencer.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Spencer stumbles upright. 

                                 SPENCER
                        Where are we going?

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll explain on the way. 

           Spencer’s voice quivering as he shouts into the bedroom...

                                 SPENCER
                        Flynn!... come on boy.

           The mutt veers toward a window, growling at SHADOWS arcing 
           through the blinds, INTRUDERS casing the exterior. 

           Teeth bared, Flynn snarls, tracking the shadows until they 
           disappear... 

           Neil shoves Spencer, flush against a wall, signaling for him 
           to be quiet. 

           FOOTFALLS patter outside, circling the perimeter.

           Neil creeps toward the blinds, pulling them shut, listening.

           DEAD SILENCE.

           WHOMP! The door caves, CALE bursting inside, wearing an FBI 
           windbreaker, AR-15 propped against his shoulder.

           Spencer hurdles the couch, ducking for cover. 

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Bullets erupt, a flurry of stuffing and 
           feathers. Spencer cowering, fetal, trapped.
           Neil slinks behind the wall, out of sight, Cale strafing 
           ahead, bullets spitting from his rifle...

           WHAP! Blind-side, Neil mauls Cale, snapping his arm and 
           burying his head in the plaster.

           A crater of blood spurting from Cale’s skull. He pile-drives 
           Neil into the floorboards, beating the hell out of his face. 

           Spencer rallies, tearing Cale off his brother, Flynn gnawing 
           Cale’s broken arm.

           BOOM! Glass shattering, RUBEN breaching the window, unloading 
           his GLOCK 22.

           Bullets tattoo Spencer’s back. He crumples as Neil swipes the 
           AR-15, hammering the trigger.

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Slugs aerate the walls, Ruben lunging into 
           the bedroom, hunkered by the frame, plaster splintering.   

           Cale boots the rifle from Neil’s grasp, reaching for it... 

           THWACK! Rage fuming in Neil. He stomps Cale, ripping and 
           fracturing his neck, bones gutting the flesh, paralyzing Cale 
           -- bleeding-out on the floor. 

           Neil gropes the AR-15, laying fire on the bedroom while Ruben 
           pops shots through the door-frame. 

           Clothes slicked with blood, Spencer gasps, Neil swooping him 
           away from the gunfire and slinging him upright. 

           BOOM! Cover shots blasting from the rifle as Neil staggers 
           with Spencer out the door...

           EXT. GHETTO SHACK - CONTINUOUS

           Scampering across the gravel and into the town car, Flynn 
           chasing behind them, leaping into the backseat.

           Neil peels off the curb, smearing the asphalt, smoke 
           billowing under the hood as he races down the strip.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Spencer, soaked in blood, anemic, choking on his own breaths. 

                                 NEIL
                        Hold on, Spence. C’mon! 
           Neil muscles the car ahead, cranking the wheel, enamel 
           grinding from his clenched teeth. 

           SMOKE erupts from the engine, thicker, blacker, pouring over 
           the windshield. The demolished car limping to halt. Dead. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Fuck!

           EXT. GHETTO - CONTINUOUS

           Neil hops over the hood, yanking Spencer onto his shoulders, 
           hauling him down the vacant qhetto strip, Flynn devotedly at 
           his side.   

                                 NEIL
                        Somebody help!

           Neil barrels ahead, grunting, relentless, denial breaking his 
           grip on reality, Spencer dying in his arms. 

           The blood keeps coming, drenching Neil, streaming down his 
           legs. 

           Spencer’s already dead but it doesn’t matter... Neil surges 
           forward, manic, carrying his brother, refusing to let go. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Somebody fuckin’ help me!

           His voice cracks, blood and snot frothing at his nostrils. He 
           trembles, reality crashing down on him. 

           His knees buckle as he eases Spencer onto the cold cement, 
           crouching beside him. 

           A meek, lifeless stare frozen on Spencer’s face. Neil can’t 
           hold back anymore, the tears come hard, bawling curses in his 
           brother’s name, pounding the blacktop ‘til his knuckles 
           split.

           Flynn wags alongside, licking Spencer’s face, whining softly. 
           A sullen pout as he paws his master, urging him to wake from 
           an endless sleep. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Neil places his brother’s corpse in the car-trunk, locking it 
           and heading down the ghetto strip on foot, with Flynn 
           trailing close behind. 
           INT. BELLAMY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - NIGHT

           Cellblock. Graham stews on a cot, shaken over his dustup with 
           Bishop, staring at a creased PHOTOGRAPH of his boys, 
           wondering if things could’ve been different, better. 

           The Guard opens his door, leaning inside. 

                                 GUARD
                        FBI is here to see you again. 

           EMPTY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           From behind, the Guard ushers Graham ahead, no one in sight. 
           A SHANK slips from the Guard’s sleeve, clutched in his gloved 
           palm. 

           Graham dawdles ahead, oblivious...

           WHAP! The Guard mutilates Graham’s neck, gashing the vein, 
           blood spraying onto the sterile floor.

           Graham’s body in a heap, convulsing as the Guard hurries 
           away. 

           INT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Night brings the chill. Neon lights blooming in the wintry 
           gust. Mist wafting from Neil’s breaths, Flynn tagging along 
           at his heels. 

           ROOM 202 - MOMENTS LATER

           THUD. Neil pounds the door, waiting until Molly opens -- 
           distraught at the sight of Neil’s bloody appearance.  

                                 MOLLY
                        What the hell happened?... Come 
                        inside. 

           Flynn scurries through leg wickets, warming to Trev by the 
           bed. Molly shoulders Neil inside and closes the door.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Are you hurt?

                                 NEIL
                        The blood’s not mine.

                                 MOLLY
                        Whose is it?
           Trev regards his father with a petrified stare. 

                                 NEIL
                        Spence... He’s gone.

                                 MOLLY
                        What are you talking about? What 
                        happened? Did you call the police?

                                 NEIL
                             (pause)
                        They’re the ones who did it. 

           Delirious, Neil wobbles, crestfallen, gazing at his son. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Let’s get you cleaned up.

                                 NEIL
                        No, I just need to close my eyes. 

           Neil eases onto the bed, Molly propping a pillow under his 
           neck. He breathes softly, motioning for Trev to lay beside 
           him. The boy hesitates... 

                                 MOLLY
                        It’s okay.

           She nods assuredly, compassion renewed in her eyes.

           Trev crawls under his father’s wing, sheltered, safe. Molly 
           nestles beside them, clinging to their warm bodies. 

           The three of them huddle in the custard glow of a lamplight. 
           Neil wearing his brother’s blood, succumbing to the lure of 
           sleep...

           DAWN

           Neil REAWAKENS. His phone RINGING. He answers the call...

                                 NEIL
                        Yea.

           Brow knit as he listens to the caller...

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right there. 
                             (beat)
                        Do me a favor; bring an extra 
                        shirt. 

           He hangs up. Molly rolls over, sleepy eyed. 
                                 MOLLY
                        Where are you going?

           Neil lingers beside her, not wanting to leave.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s just get in the car and 
                        drive... put as many miles between 
                        us and this city as we can. 

           Neil ponders her solution, fleeting mirth dissolving into the 
           bleak reality.

                                 NEIL
                        It won’t matter... wherever we go, 
                        they’ll come for us. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Why? What do they want?

           Neil glances at Trev -- dreaming restfully. 

                                 NEIL
                        Peace of mind.

           Neil sways to Molly with a deep, aching kiss, blood still 
           caked on his face. Hope in his eyes as he cups her cheeks.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t leave this room.

           He drifts away, holding her worried stare, then exiting with 
           haste.

           EXT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Molly’s rusted STATION WAGON. Neil fires the engine, shifting 
           into gear, then glancing at...

           Trev, making his way down the steps, into the lot.

           Neil leaves the engine running, stepping out and bracing 
           against the hood as Trev approaches. 

                                 NEIL
                        Didn’t mean to wake you up. 

                                 TREV
                             (worried)
                        Where are you going?
                                 NEIL
                        A few errands I gotta take care of.

           The boy longing for his father’s approval.

                                 TREV
                        Can I help?

                                 NEIL
                             (beat)
                        Maybe next time.

           Peril in the hours ahead burdens Neil.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        There’s alotta things you and I 
                        never got to do together. 
                             (somber)
                        Wish I’d had more time to give you. 
                        Do me a favor... don’t ever take 
                        anyone’s word as gospel, no matter 
                        how many times they swear it’s the 
                        truth... trust your instinct, it’s 
                        better than mine.

           The boy nods, sensing the moment’s frailty.

                                 TREV
                        Are you coming back?

                                 NEIL
                        Of course...

           False promise lingers, unresolved...

           Neil cuts the bullshit, preparing his son for the worst...

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        But if I don’t, then I need you to 
                        look after your mother. 
                             (pause)
                        Can you do that for me?

           Fierceness in the boy’s eyes, meeting his father’s stare with 
           conviction. 

                                 TREV
                        Yea... I’ll be there for her. 

           The pledge claims Trev’s innocence, no longer a spectator.

                                 NEIL
                        Good man. 
           Neil pats Trev’s shoulder and nudges him back toward the 
           motel, a grim smile as he watches his son disappear inside.  

           EXT/INT. FORTUNE CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY

           Neil glides into the oriental eatery, finding his old 
           partner, Laz, at a booth, PLASTIC BAG on the table.

           A disconcerting scowl as Laz eyes Neil’s grubby appearance.

                                 NEIL
                             (re: plastic bag)
                        These for me?

                                 LAZ
                        Yea.

           Neil strips off his bloody shirt, rummaging through the bag 
           of clothes.

                                 LAZ (CONT’D)
                        You gonna tell me what happened?

                                 NEIL
                        Won’t do any good. 

           Neil finds an old T-SHIRT -- stained yellow with sweat, a 
           police academy logo faded from wear and tear. Neil smirks... 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        Gave one of these to my old man 
                        after I graduated from the academy.

                                 LAZ
                             (bluntly)
                        It’s his.
                             (confessing)
                        I was scanning the reports this 
                        morning, noticed a murder at 
                        Bellamy; name matched your father, 
                        so I checked it out... 

           Laz doesn’t need to say the rest. Neil nods regrettably.

                                 LAZ (CONT’D)
                             (re: plastic bag)
                        These are his things. 

                                 NEIL
                        How’d they get him?
                                 LAZ
                        Shank to the neck. He bled out on 
                        the floor. 

           Laz gives Neil a moment to settle.

                                 LAZ (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what you got yourself 
                        into, but I can help. There’s some 
                        good people in the Major Case 
                        Squad. Let me reach out to ‘em...

                                 NEIL
                        No, this’ll snag on someone dirty, 
                        guaranteed; meat-eaters pullin’ the 
                        wool over your eyes, waitin’ to 
                        chew you up and spit you out. 

                                 LAZ
                        You got somethin’ better, I’m all 
                        ears, but I don’t see any other 
                        doors openin’ for you. This is the 
                        only way you get out in one piece. 
                        You need the law on your side.

                                 NEIL
                        I watched the law gun down my 
                        brother yesterday. 
                             (beat)
                        There are no sides. That badge on 
                        your chest is just scrap metal. 
                        You’re no different from me or the 
                        guys you put in cuffs. And all that 
                        bullshit they feed you about 
                        cleanin’ up the streets, serving 
                        justice; it’s just white noise 
                        fuckin’ with your head, keepin’ you 
                        blind while your bosses fleece the 
                        nobodies.   
                             (beat)
                        In the end, it’s you against 
                        everyone else, and that’s the only 
                        thing that matters. ‘Cause no one 
                        gives a shit if your guts are 
                        spilled on the street, long as they 
                        don’t have to clean up the mess.

                                 LAZ
                             (annoyed)
                        So, that’s it? You’re gonna roam 
                        the ghetto with your own brand of 
                        justice, crackin’ skulls whenever 
                        you see fit?
                                 NEIL
                        If I’m not, someone else will. 

                                 LAZ
                        Be honest... you can’t take these 
                        guys on your own. 

                                 NEIL
                        They all got enemies, even Bishop.  

                                 LAZ
                        So, you pit ‘em against each other, 
                        big fuckin’ massacre, then what?

                                 NEIL
                        Then I leave. Clean slate. 

                                 LAZ
                        Or you split now, save yourself the 
                        trouble.

                                 NEIL
                             (shakes his head)
                        I’m not sleepin’ with one eye open 
                        for the rest of my life.

           Laz sighs, giving in, submitting to Neil’s will. 

                                 LAZ
                        What about Molly and Trev?

                                 NEIL
                        Got ‘em stashed in a motel.

                                 LAZ
                        You left ‘em alone? The hell’s 
                        wrong with you?

                                 NEIL
                        They’re fine.

                                 LAZ
                        Where they at?

                                 NEIL
                        Borderline motel, you know it?

                                 LAZ
                        Let me stake it out while you’re 
                        gone... just in case.
                             (off look)
                        I’ll do it solo. No one else’ll 
                        know I’m there.
           Several booths away, OTIS, Leon’s ghetto lieutenant, the same 
           kid Neil busted years ago, watches Neil and Laz, hawk-eyed, 
           his suspicions of Neil’s duplicity confirmed.  

           Neil and Laz pad toward the exit, Otis keeping his head down, 
           avoiding eye contact, then following them outside...

           EXT. CHINATOWN - MOMENTS LATER

           The bustle and grime of Chinatown. Streets teeming with 
           vendors and lackeys. 

           Otis weaves through the chaos, shoving tourists aside, 
           struggling to keep pace with Neil and Laz. 

           Bodies crosscutting in front of him, and suddenly, Neil’s 
           gone. Otis spins wildly, searching for his mark, can’t find 
           him. He sticks to Laz, following him toward an intersection.

           Laz hops in a CRUISER, Otis rushing to his LOWRIDER and 
           tailing Laz through the traffic-clogged roads. 

           EXT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - LATER

           From afar, Otis watches Laz -- exiting his cruiser, hiking up 
           to ROOM 202, knocking and entering.

           ROOM 202 - MOMENTS LATER

           Blinds cracked, Otis peeks through a window, eyeing Molly and 
           Trev conversing with Laz. He ducks out, back to his Lowrider. 

           INT. BISHOP’S PUB - BACK PARLOR - LATER

           Ruben paces anxiously, a bluster of hotheaded ramblings, 
           Bishop and Angus weathering the storm. 

                                 RUBEN
                             (re: Neil)
                        He saw my face... We gotta hunt 
                        this motherfucker, put him in the 
                        ground tonight.

                                 BISHOP
                             (belittling)
                        What’re you gonna do? Send out an 
                        APB and chance him gettin’ picked 
                        up before you put him to bed?
                                 RUBEN
                        I’m not gonna just sit and wait for 
                        him to make the first move.

                                 BISHOP
                             (rationalizing)
                        He’s an ex-cop with a shit 
                        reputation. He’s only got two plays 
                        to make, and neither of ‘em involve 
                        testifying against you. So, calm 
                        tha’ fuck down. 
                             (beat)
                        Personally, I hope he’s dumb enough 
                        to stick around and come after us.

           The CHIME of a door opening in the MAIN BAR. Bishop checks 
           the security monitor... 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (to Ruben)
                        Stay here. 

           MAIN BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Leon and Otis hang by the bar, Bliss serving them a drink. 
           Bishop steps to them...

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Unexpected visit.

                                 LEON
                        Got a tip for you. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Could’ve called me.

                                 LEON
                        Naw, this is a face-to-face thing.

           Bishop waits for Leon to continue...

                                 BISHOP
                        You gonna make me beg?

                                 LEON
                        Shit ain’t free... But if you don’t 
                        buy it from me now, it’ll bite you 
                        in the ass. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (sighs)
                        What do you want?
                                 LEON
                        Lay somethin’ on the table, then we 
                        can negotiate.

           An unfriendly stare as Bishop devises an offer.

                                 BISHOP
                        There’s a shipment comin’ off the 
                        docks tonight. I’ll give you the 
                        truck route... you and your boys 
                        can take it down, keep the loot for 
                        yourselves.

                                 LEON
                        What’re they carryin’?

                                 BISHOP
                        Last time it was brown, this time 
                        who knows. These guys don’t fuck 
                        around with small-time bootleggin’, 
                        so whatever’s in the truck, it’ll 
                        be worth the score. 

           Leon nods agreeably.

                                 LEON
                        You got an informant in your crew. 
                        Otis saw him talkin’ friendly with 
                        five-oh in Chinatown, followed the 
                        cruiser to a motel where they’re 
                        hidin’ his wife and kid.

                                 BISHOP
                        What’s his name?

                                 LEON
                        No idea. He’s new. Came by for a 
                        pickup the other day. Used to be a 
                        cop.

           Bishop’s eyes light up.

                                 BISHOP
                        Where’s the motel?

           INT. SOVIET SEX DUNGEON - DAY

           Red haze. Sex cries. Mortar and curtains.

           Neil snakes through the den of narcotic-laced prostitutes, 
           encountering Pavel in the BACK ROOM. 
                                 PAVEL
                             (recognizing Neil)
                        I don’t like to be pestered.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m not here about your dues.

                                 PAVEL
                        Then you’re a customer.

                                 NEIL
                        Not interested in that either. 
                             (beat)
                        Last time we met, I got the 
                        impression you were unhappy about 
                        your arrangement with Bishop.

                                 PAVEL
                        What makes you say that?

                                 NEIL
                        Refusing payment; not something he 
                        takes lightly. So far, he’s been 
                        too distracted to notice... 

                                 PAVEL
                        Your boss profits from doing 
                        nothing... he’s a fuckin’ leech. 
                        I’ve got no patience for his kind.

                                 NEIL
                        I’m here to tell you he’s not my 
                        boss anymore.

                                 PAVEL
                        Then who do you work for?

                                 NEIL
                        No one. But I was hoping maybe you 
                        and I could find some common 
                        ground. 

                                 PAVEL
                        And where exactly is that?

                                 NEIL
                        Bring him to me. And I’ll make sure 
                        you never have to pay him again. 

           Pavel considers the proposal, studying Neil. 
                                 PAVEL
                             (re: Bishop)
                        ‘Much as I’d like him gone, he 
                        serves a purpose. I need his 
                        connection at the port. 

                                 NEIL
                        You seem like a smart guy. Bet you 
                        can figure out a way to bypass the 
                        docks. Everyone in this city can be 
                        bought for a price.

                                 PAVEL
                             (beat)
                        What’s yours?

                                 NEIL
                        I already told you. Give me Bishop 
                        and we’re square.

                                 PAVEL
                        If I wanted him dead, I’d do it 
                        myself.

                                 NEIL
                        Tougher than he looks. Got the feds 
                        in his pocket. If you swing and 
                        miss, he’ll stick the law on you, 
                        cripple your business before you 
                        see it comin’. 
                             (off look)
                        Keep him around, and sooner or 
                        later he’s gonna bleed you dry. I’m 
                        offerin’ my help at no cost to you. 

           EXT/INT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Howling winds rustle the weeds. Not a soul in sight. 

           ROOM 202 

           On MUTE, a retro TV flickers with the evening news, 
           chronicling the death of FBI AGENT, CALE GALLO. 

           Anxiety weighs on Molly’s face, Trev staring at the tube, Laz 
           peeking through the blinds, scanning for danger. 

                                 MOLLY
                             (re: Neil)
                        He didn’t say where he was going? 
                                 LAZ
                        He’s tying-up a few loose ends.
                             (beat)
                        There’s nuthin’ to worry ‘bout. 

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why are you here?

                                 LAZ
                        Just a precaution.

           Flynn whines by the door, scratching.

                                 TREV
                        He needs to go out. Let me take him 
                        for a walk. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea...

                                 LAZ
                        I’ll go with him. It’ll be fine. 

           OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Flynn waggles down the steps, Trev and Laz following him to 
           an expanse of marshland buffering the motel.  

           Flynn totters ahead, peeing on shrubs, then suddenly bolting, 
           chasing a critter through the weeds. 

                                 TREV
                        Flynn!... Come back!

           Trev pursues, darting after the mutt.

                                 LAZ
                        Wait. Trev... Hold up! 

           Laz has no choice but to follow, drifting farther away from 
           the motel. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           A SEDAN chugs into the lot -- Bishop, Angus and Ruben exiting 
           and marching up the steps to...

           ROOM 202 

           Unlocked. The intruders breach the frame, confronting Molly -- 
           fear gleaming her eyes... she hides it well.
                                 MOLLY
                        Get tha’ fuck out of my room. I 
                        swear I’ll scream.

                                 BISHOP
                        No one’s gonna care sweetheart. 

           Angus checks the bathroom -- no sign of Neil. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (soothing)
                        We just wanna know where your 
                        lesser half is, then we’ll leave.

                                 MOLLY
                        Haven’t seen him.

                                 BISHOP
                             (beat)
                        Is he comin’ back?

           Molly, disinterested, aloof...

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t know. Don’t care.

                                 BISHOP
                        You’d be doin’ yourself a favor if 
                        you helped us. I promise no harm 
                        will come to you.

                                 MOLLY
                        I got nuthin’ to say. Now get out 
                        of my room before I call the cops.

           Bishop smirks, unfazed by Molly’s threat.  

                                 BISHOP
                        You’ve always been a little rough 
                        around the edges... how ‘bout we 
                        soften you up a bit?

           WHAP! Bishop knuckles Molly’s face, splitting her lip. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        This’ll get outta’ hand real quick 
                        unless you start talkin’. 

           Lips sealed, Molly swallows her own blood, bound to silence. 

           Suddenly, Bishop drags her into the BATHROOM. She kicks and 
           SCREAMS...
           WHAP! Bishop thumps her face, crushing bones, drawing blood. 

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        Scream again and I’ll rip out your 
                        tongue. 

           Dazed from the hit, Molly slumps, limp, feeble. 

           Angus takes over, bending Molly over the bathtub and clamping 
           her neck against the rim.

           She chokes, veins throbbing, Angus wielding a SWITCHBLADE, 
           slicing clothes off her quivering body. 

           Ruben grimaces, unsure he can condone the killing of a woman.

                                 RUBEN
                        How far are you gonna take this?

                                 BISHOP
                             (ruthless)
                        Shut your fuckin’ mouth and watch 
                        the door.

           Ruben backs away, averting his eyes.

           Bishop kneels beside Molly, wiping hair from her face.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                             (re: Neil)
                        Where is he?

           Tears streaming down her cheeks.

                                 MOLLY
                        I don’t know. 

           UMPH! Angus stabs the blade in her side, twisting and 
           thrusting his knee into her crotch. 

           She rasps, wailing meekly. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Tell us before it’s too late. 

           Drool flapping from her mouth as she struggles to breath. Her 
           face washed in blood and misery. 

                                 MOLLY
                        I can’t...

           Angus drags the knife up her armpit, unzipping her flesh. She 
           yelps, about to give up...
                                 RUBEN (O.C.)
                        Someone’s coming.

           Head on a swivel, Bishop rushes to the window, beside Ruben, 
           spying through the blinds...

           OUTSIDE 

           Laz, Trev and Flynn tread up the staircase, toward ROOM 202. 
           The mutt, wet and bedraggled from his jaunt. 

           Laz twists the doorknob. LOCKED. He glances through the 
           window. BLINDS DRAWN. 

                                 LAZ
                        Molly.

           The door wobbles from his KNOCK. 

           ROOM 202 

           Bishop and Ruben brandish their HEAT, aiming at the door.

                                 BISHOP
                             (to Ruben, hushed)
                        Let him in. 

           Ruben pads to the frame, twisting the knob, opening slowly.

           Bathroom, Molly wriggles from Angus’s grasp, screaming...

                                 MOLLY
                        Stay away!

           WHAP! Angus buries the dagger in Molly’s heart and smothers 
           her last breaths.

           Panicked, Bishop and Ruben unload...

           OUTSIDE

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! A fusillade of bullets, ventilating the 
           door, Laz diving evasively, shielding Trev. 

           BOOM! Shards exploding as Bishop fires out the window.

           Laz and Trev flee, out of range, breaking into ANOTHER ROOM.  

                                 LAZ
                             (to Trev)
                        Don’t move. 
           Trev clutches Flynn, motionless as Laz slinks back toward 
           Room 202, against the wall, drawing his GLOCK. 

           Glass BREAKING inside the room, voices drifting FARTHER AWAY. 

           WHAP! Laz barrels through the door, tumbling inside...

           ROOM 202

           BOOM! Ruben fires from the opposite wall as Bishop and Angus 
           jump out the BACK WINDOW. 

           Laz sprawls next to the bed, bullets eviscerating the 
           mattress, coils bursting. 

           Squatting, Laz bucks upward, flipping the bed-frame and 
           ramming it into the opposite wall. 

           Ruben wilts from the impact, doubling over, Bishop and Angus 
           already through the window and out of sight. 

           Laz stings Ruben with a vicious punch, beating him against 
           the floor. 

           BOOM! Ruben fires wayward shots, losing the gun and gashing 
           Laz’s shoulder with a broken shard. 

           Laz fights through the pain, belting Ruben’s face and 
           unloading a BULLET into his gut. 

           Ruben squeals, writhing on the floor, Laz hovering, Glock in 
           hand.

           Desperate, Ruben pulls out his FBI BADGE, imploring Laz...

                                 RUBEN
                        I’m FBI... You need to call this 
                        in. We can work things out.

                                 LAZ
                        Where’s Molly?

           Laz catches Ruben glancing at the bathroom. He backtracks, 
           keeping the gun on Ruben, viewing...

           Molly, pale, lifeless, her blood pooling on the tiles.

           Guilt wrecks Laz. He trembles, despair written on his face, 
           melting into a hideous glare as he returns to Ruben. 

                                 RUBEN
                        I didn’t touch her... I swear.
           Laz twitches the trigger, his conscience holding him back.  

                                 RUBEN (CONT’D)
                        Be reasonable... Don’t do anything 
                        you’re gonna regret. 

           BOOM! A cold glaze on Laz’s face as he executes Ruben. 
           Killshot through the skull -- bone and brain splattering. 

           Laz stands silently in the aftermath of his decision.

           EXT. BORDERLINE MOTEL - LATER

           A swarm of red and blue lights. POLICE CRUISERS and 
           AMBULANCES quarantining the crime scene. 

           Neil drives Molly’s STATION WAGON toward the ruckus. Dread 
           lumping in his throat as he exits and spots Laz nearby.

           Head hanging, Laz shuffles to Neil, his eyes dim and rueful. 
           His expression tells the tale. 

           Neil, wrought with emotion, anger corroding his sanity, his 
           greatest fear confirmed, in disbelief... 

                                 NEIL
                        No... Please... No.
                             (re: family)
                        Both of ‘em?

           Guilt eats at Laz.

                                 LAZ
                        Molly.
                             (explaining)
                        I slipped out for a minute, and 
                        when I came back...

           Neil paces, furious, unraveling. 

           PARAMEDICS roll a gurney into the Ambulance, Molly’s corpse. 
           Neil can’t bear the sight of her, it’ll break him. 

                                 NEIL
                             (re: Bishop and Angus)
                        You let ‘em get away?

                                 LAZ
                        I didn’t have a shot at Bishop or 
                        Angus. But I can ID ‘em...  
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LAZ (CONT'D)
                        We can get these guys the right 
                        way... but if you gotta do this on 
                        your own, I’m not gonna hold you 
                        back anymore.

           Neil, huffing, inconsolable, looking over at...

           Trev, shaken but unbroken, huddled next to an ambulance, 
           Flynn nestled at his side, comforting the boy.

           Tears welling in Neil’s eyes. He stifles his sorrow, clinging 
           to the anger -- it’s the only thing keeping him going.

                                 NEIL
                             (to Laz, curt)
                        Keep my boy safe.

                                 LAZ
                        I won’t leave his side. 

           Neil storms away, into the station wagon, screeching out of 
           the lot. 

           EXT. PORT - MIDNIGHT

           Mist. Amber lights. A labyrinth of crates. Pavel’s HENCHMEN 
           unload a SHIPMENT -- cargo boxes filled with AR-15 RIFLES and 
           AMMUNITION BOXES. 

           Bishop, Angus and Saul watch as Pavel inspects one of the 
           weapons. Satisfied, he turns to the Henchmen...

                                 PAVEL
                        Load ‘em up. 

           Henchmen pack the boxes into a nearby TRUCK. 

                                 BISHOP
                        Everything’s in order? 

                                 PAVEL
                        Appears so. 

                                 BISHOP
                        And our payment?

           Pavel saunters to Bishop, propositioning...

                                 PAVEL
                        I could give you the money, but I 
                        I’ve got something else you might 
                        be more interested in.
                                 BISHOP
                        This isn’t a negotiation. 

           Angus preemptively retrieves his .45, primed for violence. 

                                 PAVEL
                        I’ve got one of your men. He came 
                        to me with a proposition, trying to 
                        buy my allegiance, spitting on your 
                        name. But I told him that you and I 
                        have a partnership; a bond not 
                        easily broken...

                                 BISHOP
                        Where is he?

                                 PAVEL
                             (countering)
                        Do we have a deal?

                                 BISHOP
                             (conceding)
                        Bring me to him and I’ll forget 
                        about your debt. 

           Across the way, passenger’s seat of the TRUCK, Neil glares at 
           Bishop in the side mirror, hidden from view.

           EXT. DESOLATE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           A lonely stretch of asphalt. Weed thickets and rock slopes at 
           the edges -- wilderness abound, blanketed in darkness.  

           A caravan blazes along the blacktop -- TRUCK leading the way 
           with Bishop’s SEDAN trailing behind. 

           TRUCK

           In the cargo bay, Neil loads bullets into an AR-15, readying 
           to assault Bishop and Angus.

           TWO Henchmen sit up front, manning the wheel and navigating. 

           SEDAN

           Angus drives, Pavel riding shotgun, Bishop in the backseat 
           alongside one of Pavel’s Henchman. 

                                 PAVEL
                        Generous of you to offer the front. 
                                 BISHOP
                        I don’t let anyone sit behind me.
                             (re: Neil)
                        How far away is he?

                                 PAVEL
                        Not far. 

                                 BISHOP
                             (anxious)
                        Are we staying with the truck?

                                 PAVEL
                             (nods)
                        Make sure there are no mishaps this 
                        time. That a problem?

                                 BISHOP
                        No.

           Bishop reaches for his CELL PHONE, sending a TEXT MESSAGE.

           HIGHWAY

           Around the bend, Leon, Otis and two THUGS lurk in the 
           shadows, spotting the caravan barreling toward them.  

                                 LEON
                        Strap up. 

           They check their MAC-10’s, boarding a Caddy LOWRIDER and a 
           custom IMPALA -- equipped to hijack the incoming truck. 

           Leon’s phone BUZZES -- a text message from Bishop -- ABORT. 

                                 OTIS
                        What is it?

                                 LEON
                             (ignoring the warning)
                        Nuthin’. Let’s do this. 

           TRUCK

           Neil leans into the cab, directing the two Henchmen. 

                                 NEIL
                        Turn left here. 

           Henchman eases onto the brake, turning the wheel. 

           HIGHWAY
           Prepping for the ambush, Leon and his Thugs watch as the 
           truck makes an unexpected turn -- veering onto a DIRT ROAD. 

                                 LEON
                        Tha’ hell are they going?
                             (pause)
                        Follow ‘em. Lights off. 

           Stealth mode, Impala and Lowrider spin one-eighty, racing 
           toward the truck, Leon and Otis leaning out the windows with 
           MAC-10’s.

           DIRT ROAD

           Truck headlights cut through the night. Wheels kicking muck 
           off the potholed trail. 

           TRUCK

           FREEZING RAIN pelts the windshield, drizzling, then 
           intensifying, coming harder, faster -- slicking the road. 

           DIRT ROAD

           The caravan rumbles ahead, enveloped in the downpour. 

           Lowrider and Impala creeping from behind, gaining ground, 
           barely visible in the encompassing darkness.

           Up ahead, the ABANDONED RAIL STATION. 

           TRUCK

           Neil anchors in the cargo bay, struggling to stay upright as 
           the truck wobbles. Deep breaths. He grips the AR-15, staring 
           at the back hatch, impatient to slaughter Bishop and Angus. 

           DIRT ROAD

           Attack mode, Leon’s crew swerves off the track, motors 
           growling, highbeams FLASHING ON.

           SEDAN

           Lights flare in the mirrors, Angus stomping the gas, Pavel 
           and Bishop spinning around, viewing the ambush...

           DIRT ROAD

           Lowrider and Impala slingshot forward, motoring alongside the 
           caravan, seesawing on the uneven terrain. Leon and Otis 
           leaning out the windows, unleashing their MAC-10’s... 
           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Muzzle flashes bursting, an implosion of 
           metal and glass, clattering nonstop.

           The truck shudders and fishtails, churning the sludge.

           The sedan swerves behind the truck, using it as a shield. 

           Hijackers scream ahead, bullets spewing from the MAC-10’s.

           TRUCK

           BOOM! Slugs pierce the cab, killing the Henchmen, bodies 
           shredded by the gunfire, releasing the wheel. 

           In the cargo bay, Neil hunkers, bracing for impact... 

           DIRT ROAD

           WHOMP! The truck swerves, out of control, SMASHING into a 
           ditch, LAUNCHING, AIRBORNE... 

           FLIPPING over the sedan and CRASHING onto its side. Fumes 
           swirling in its wake.

           The sedan whips through the wreckage, trying to outrun the 
           Impala.

           SEDAN

           Getaway speed, Angus motors, rain hammering the windshield, 
           blades working overtime. 

           BOOM! Bishop caps the Henchman, then aims at Pavel.

                                 BISHOP
                             (to Pavel, re: Neil)
                        Where is he?

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! From behind, a firestorm of bullets, the 
           Impala in pursuit. Bishop, Angus and Pavel ducking for cover. 

           DIRT ROAD 

           Farther back, the Lowrider parks next to the toppled truck. 
           Otis and his Partner case the wreck, peeping the gutted 
           Henchmen inside the cab.

           Bloodied from the crash, Neil stumbles out the back hatch, 
           clutching the AR-15, sneaking around the edge...

           BOOM! He slaughters the Thug, training the rifle on Otis, 
           hesitating... 
                                 NEIL
                             (re: Otis’s gun)
                        Drop it. 

           Otis clutches the chrome, not in his nature to surrender.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                             (disappointed)
                        Don’t do this.

                                 OTIS
                        Can’t have it both ways.

           Suddenly, Otis flinches, raising his gun...

           BOOM! Neil caps Otis, putting him down. 

           A momentary pause, Neil gathering his composure, then surging 
           ahead, on a dead-sprint toward the other cars...

           ABANDONED RAIL-STATION

           The sedan jets through a rubble entrance, Impala hot on its 
           tail, pumping slugs into the sedan’s fender. 

           Sparks flying as the sedan slaloms through the industrial 
           debris. Rain gushing through shattered skylights.

           Impala gaining momentum, rocketing toward the...

           Sedan...

           WHOMP! Wheels rut in a CEMENT TRENCH, crippling as the sedan 
           tilts, lopsided, RAMMING into a cluster of RUSTED GENERATORS. 

           Smoke explodes from the hood, deformed, scrapped.

           Impala skids to a halt, Leon lighting up the sedan as...

           Bishop, Angus and Pavel scatter, hiding behind machinery. 

           A blur of gunfire. Muzzle flashes blinding the combatants. 
           Slugs pockmarking the urban decay. Battlefield chaos.  

           DIRT ROAD

           Neil stampedes toward the rail station, his face ridden with 
           madness, no longer a man but a savage, muddy and numb in the 
           freezing rain. 

           ABANDONED RAIL-STATION

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Bullets slashing, crosscutting. 
           Behind the generators -- Bishop, Angus and Pavel drift apart, 
           flanking Leon on either side. 

           At the entrance...

           BOOM! AR-15, Neil bolts into the scrum, massacring Leon and 
           his Thug -- bullet-riddled, dropping to the ground.

           Separated, Bishop and Angus target...

           Neil, squinting in the dim light, ziz-zagging and dodging 
           gunfire as he slides into... 

           CEMENT TRENCH

           Knee deep water. Footfalls echo from all sides. Faceless 
           bodies scurrying through the darkness. 

           Neil whirls, disoriented, shooting at anything that moves.

           PING! Neil ducks, bullets whizzing past him... 

           THWACK! Blind-side, Angus wallops Neil, dunking his head in 
           the trench.

           Limbs tangled, flailing in mucky water, bodies pinballing 
           against the narrow walls.

           WHAP! Neil bucks Angus, spearing him into muck, rain pouring 
           from the skylights above.

           BEHIND THEM

           BOOM! Gunfire erupts, Bishop and Pavel firing at each other 
           from opposite sides.

           CEMENT TRENCH 

           Angus gargles, Neil fighting to keep him submerged...

           PING! A stray bullet ricochets next to Neil’s face. He 
           sprawls, losing grip on Angus, falling backward. 

           Angus thrashes, drubbing Neil and vaulting out of the trench, 
           their bodies crashing through the debris.

           THWACK! Angus slams Neil against generator, whiplash, Neil’s 
           body keeling from the blow. 

           BEHIND THEM 

           Bishop outmaneuvers Pavel, stalking in the shadows...
           BOOM! He fires a killshot into Pavel’s chest, then several 
           more for good measure.  

           GENERATORS

           Body hits, Angus pummeling Neil, dismantling him, ribs 
           cracking, jaw shattering. Neil’s a bloody mess, wilting, 
           heaped on the floor. 

           Angus whips out his SWITCHBLADE and thrusts downward...

           A blur. Neil dodges, rolling to his feet, bare-knuckling 
           Angus’s face and gutting him on the metal framework. 

           A broken rod impaling Angus’s bowels. He wheezes, gasping as 
           Neil slashes his throat with the switchblade...

           BOOM! BOOM! Bishop returns with a vengeance, targeting Neil.

           Muck splashing as Neil plunges into the trench, groping for 
           his AR-15 -- lost in the water. 

           WHAM! Bullets like locusts, raining down on Neil. 

           He scrambles, finding the AR-15 and lurching upward...

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Neil unloads, tattooing the Impala as 
           Bishop twists behind it...

           Glass and metal exploding, AR-15 jackhammering against Neil’s 
           shoulder.

           Bishop, pinned down, weathering the assault. He winces, 
           glancing down at...

           BLOOD, soaking his shirt from a flesh-wound. Then suddenly...

           SILENCE. 

           Neil bounds out of the trench, strafing sideways, trying to 
           get an angle on...

           Bishop, slinking into the battered Impala, popping the clutch 
           and yanking the wheel.

           VROOM! The car whips around, bouncing off a generator, drag- 
           racing toward the rubble entrance, away from...

           Neil, in pursuit, muzzle flashes igniting his face...

           BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Shots glance off the Impala -- plowing 
           through the storm, drifting farther away from...
           Neil, chasing, losing ground, Bishop slipping away.

           DIRT ROAD

           Sheets of rain, falling like there’s no tomorrow, lashing 
           at...

           Neil, sucking wind, fighting the numbness as he mounts the 
           abandoned Lowrider near the truck. 

           LOWRIDER

           Flicking the ignition and stomping the accelerator...

           The cruiser wobbles and swerves, a hellfire mud-wreck, 
           hauling-ass, engine roaring with menace. 

           Shocks absorbing the choppy terrain as Neil blazes toward...

           HIGHWAY

           Bishop skids onto the blacktop, rubbernecking back at...

           Neil, in the distance, hundreds of yards away.

           DIRT ROAD

           Far behind, Neil drives on pure adrenaline, his eyes static, 
           locked on...

           HIGHWAY

           Bishop pushes the Impala to its limit, speedometer maxing-out 
           as he glances in the MIRROR...

           Neil smear-turns onto the asphalt, still far away, but 
           gaining ground. 

           LOWRIDER

           Tires sputtering on the slick road, Neil tames the whip, 
           cutting corners, veering into the oncoming lanes.

           HIGHWAY

           Bishop and Neil careen toward the city lights -- miles away.

           SHARP TURN

           Bishop hits the brakes, tail-lights pulsing as he skids 
           around the bend.

           LOWRIDER
           Full throttle, Neil accelerating to a suicide-speed, banking 
           at the CORNER, rubber gyrating against the asphalt, gripping 
           for traction, about to smash into a rock slope...

           Neil wrenches the wheel, muscling the Lowrider onto an even 
           keel, sideswiping the gradient and spurting onto the flat. 

           FARTHER AHEAD

           Bishop, sweating bricks, clamping his wound, skin wan and 
           eyes frantic. He checks the mirror...

           Neil’s closing the gap, less than a hundred yards away.

           CITY OUTSKIRTS

           Scattered traffic, VEHICLES coasting, oblivious as...

           WHOMP! Neil thumps Bishop’s fender, swerving around traffic. 

           Bishop jams the brakes and pitches onto an EXIT RAMP, Neil 
           following, a bit behind.

           BACK ROADS 

           Slums. Condemned buildings. Fleabag shanties. 

           Bishop drives with purpose, a destination in mind. Neil keeps 
           pace, riding Bishop’s tail.

           INTERSECTION

           STOP LIGHT. RED. Bishop speeds through it, cross-traffic 
           pounding their HORNS, maneuvering to avoid collisions. 

           Neil swerves, ricocheting off another car and onto the 
           sidewalk. 

           He harnesses the momentum, redirecting the wheel and jolting 
           forward, back onto the road...

           Bishop’s tail-lights in the distance...

           STASH HOUSE

           Cinder bulwark camouflaged amongst the urban decay, secluded 
           on the city’s outskirts. 

           Bishop screeches up to the entrance, staggering out of the 
           car and into...
           INT. STASH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Blood draining down his side as he limps through the hallway.

           EXT. STASH HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Neil rips the handbrake, grinding to a stop, hotfooting 
           into...

           INT. STASH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Following the trail of blood to an OPEN DOOR, he peeks around 
           the edge...

           MONEY and GUNS stockpiled in the fortress. 

           Bishop hunkers behind a table, brandishing a sawed-off 
           SHOTGUN. 

           BOOM! He fires at the door, mortar erupting, Neil twisting 
           out of sight, weaponless. 

           Anxious breaths. Neil inches toward the opening...

           BOOM! Another blast. Neil spills sideways, drooping against 
           the wall, his mind racing. 

           INTERCUT - NEIL IN THE HALLWAY AND BISHOP IN THE DEN

                                 BISHOP 
                        I got enough guns and ammo in here 
                        to last all night.

           Neil’s hands are empty.

                                 BISHOP (CONT’D)
                        You armed?

                                 NEIL
                             (lies)
                        Yea.

                                 BISHOP
                        Bullshit. You would’ve taken a shot 
                        already.

                                 NEIL
                        Why don’t you come out here and see 
                        for yourself. 
                                 BISHOP
                        Not happening. Step inside and 
                        let’s put an end to this.

           Neil jitters, weighing his options, scheming...

                                 NEIL
                        Toss me some cash.

           Bishop frowns, surprised by the offer. 

                                 BISHOP
                        What?

                                 NEIL
                             (persuading)
                        Both of us can walk away. 

           Neil catches Bishop’s reflection in the steel door, watching 
           him intently. 

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                        I’m not leavin’ empty-handed. 

           Stacks of CASH are out of Bishop’s reach. He’ll have to move 
           to grab them. 

                                 BISHOP
                        How much do you want?

                                 NEIL
                        Hundred thousand.

                                 BISHOP
                             (considering)
                        I’ll give you fifty.

                                 NEIL
                             (unwavering)
                        Fuck that. Hundred grand or else 
                        I’m stayin’ here ‘til you rot.

           Fixated on Bishop’s reflection, Neil slips off his shoes, 
           waiting as...

           Bishop pads to the shelf, grabbing money, taking his eyes off 
           the door. 

           Lightning fast, Neil funnels into the den, bull-rushing 
           Bishop.

           BOOM! Shotgun blast, Neil slamming Bishop into the shelf, 
           grappling, bills scattering from the impact.
           A melee of fists and elbows. Bishop straddles Neil, clocking 
           his face, reaching for the shotgun...

           UMPH! Neil snaps upward, mauling Bishop, booting him against 
           the table. 

           Bishop recovers, scrambling for a HANDGUN.

           BOOM! On his back, Neil unloads the shotgun. The blast rips a 
           chunk out of Bishop’s gut. 

           Bishop slumps, blood spilling from the wound, drenching the 
           bed of money littered beneath him.

           Neil RISES, stepping to Bishop, looming over his body. 

           Bishop raises a hand, pleading for mercy, choking on his 
           words.

           BOOM!! The shot echoes, fading into an eerie quiet. Bishop’s 
           neck mangled from the twelve-gauge bullet. 

           Neil lingers, his eyes boring into Bishop’s corpse, then 
           turning to... 

           The MONEY, enough to last a lifetime. Neil grabs a clump of 
           blood-stained bills -- the FUTURE in his hands.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           EXT. GATED CEMETERY - DAWN

           HEADSTONES for Molly, Spencer and Graham. 

           Neil puts his wife, brother and father to rest. GRAVEKEEPERS 
           lowering the caskets into the ground. 

           Trev stands with Neil, sullen as he observes the burial, 
           Flynn panting and nuzzling the boy’s palm. 

           Neil turns to his son, sentiments of comfort escaping him. He 
           nods assuredly, patting Trev’s back, instilling confidence in 
           the boy.

           Across the graveyard, Laz sulks toward Neil, guilt-ridden 
           over Molly’s death. 

           Neil leans to Trev...

                                 NEIL
                        Wait by the car. I’ll be there in a 
                        minute. 
           Trev nods obediently, shooing Flynn toward the decrepit 
           STATION WAGON that Molly left behind. 

           Neil shuffles to Laz, meeting him halfway...

                                 LAZ
                        I don’t know what to say. 

           Tension mounting as they stand face to face.

           Neil reaches into his pocket, handing Laz a set of KEYS and a 
           NOTE.

           Laz checks the ADDRESS on the note, baffled.

                                 LAZ (CONT’D)
                        What’s this?

                                 NEIL
                        Parting gift.

           Laz frowns, still confused.

                                 NEIL (CONT’D)
                             (assuring)
                        You’ll understand when you see it.

           Neil offers his hand. Laz takes it, shaking. 

                                 LAZ
                        What about you? 

                                 NEIL
                        I’ll find my own way. 

           Neil releases Laz and departs, heading toward the station 
           wagon. 

           Curious, Laz checks the address on the note again...

           INT. STASH HOUSE - LATER

           KEYS jangle, Laz using them to open the reinforced steel 
           door, his eyes wide with shock as he views...

           The DEN. Untouched. Everything where Neil left it. Nothing 
           taken. Bishop’s corpse sprawled on the floor, engulfed in 
           blood-money. 
           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Neil drives the station wagon, Trev sitting beside him, Flynn 
           drooling on the handbrake. 

           The city dwindles, a tangle of smokestacks belching over the 
           crooked skyline, fading into the background.

           INT. STASH HOUSE - DAY

           POLICE and FORENSICS OFFICERS investigate the crime scene, 
           bagging evidence -- MONEY, GUNS, DRUGS, PASSPORTS.  

           A veteran COP with STARS on his uniform shakes Laz’s hand, 
           commending him. Laz smiles, thinking about his friend, Neil. 

           EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

           The city is gone. Pastures flank the road. Endless blankets 
           of green under the warmth of the southern sun. 

           Neil cruises in the slow lane, content in this moment.

           He rolls down the windows. Fresh breeze funneling into the 
           car. He breathes it in, scratching the mutt and glancing at 
           his son. 

           The three of them, dirt poor, but together and running free. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                                THE END
