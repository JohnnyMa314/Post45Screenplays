           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- NIGHT

           In a non-descript room, GEOFF HARPER, 59, sits solitary - as 
           pale as a lost child - staring into one of the very first 
           HOME VIDEO CAMERAS.  He takes a deep breath and begins.

                                 HARPER
                        Everyone in Australia knows who the 
                        Beaumonts are. Or were. If you were 
                        a kid in the sixties you were 
                        taught to fear the tall, blonde man 
                        the same way the Americans feared 
                        the commies. They ruined it for 
                        everyone.  You couldn’t go anywhere 
                        on your own anymore.  Not without 
                        your parents.
                              (beat)
                        Not without being taken.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- MORNING, 1966

           A quaint picture of suburbia.  The lawn freshly mown, the 
           garden tended to, the windows spotless...

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        It was January at the time; 
                        Australia Day. But it was Adelaide.
                              (beat)
                        And it was hot.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN -- SAME

           Nancy Beaumont’s face looms large as she yells up the stairs:

                                 NANCY
                        Get a move on, kids!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She takes a seat next to her husband, JIM. On her left, 
           ARNNA, 9, continues talking, upset at being interrupted.

                                 ARNNA
                        --An’ she said her mum said she 
                        could keep it!

                                 NANCY
                        Her mum’s lettin’ her keep a ‘Roo 
                        in the house?

                                 ARNNA
                        It’s a baby!

                                 NANCY
                        It’s gonna ruin her car.

           JANE, 10, trots down the steps and into a seat as Arnna keeps 
           going.

                                 ARNNA
                        So can I?

                                 NANCY
                        Can you what?

                                 ARNNA
                        Can I have one?

                                 NANCY
                        Oh, I don’t think so!

           Arnna starts sulking.

                                 ARNNA
                        I never get anything I want!

           Jane shoots her a look.

                                 JANE
                        Mom said “no,” so cool it.

                                 ARNNA
                        No one asked you, Jane!

           Nancy leans over to Jim.  He’s reading the paper.

                                 NANCY
                        So you’re goin’ in?

                                 JIM
                        Might as well--

           GRANT, their seven year old, races down the stairs in an 
           oversized collared shirt.  Jim takes one look at the boy:

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh no mista, you’re not wearin’ one 
                        of my shirts again - it looks like 
                        a dress on you!

                                 GRANT
                        Men can wear dresses!

                                 JIM
                        Yeah - poof-tahs!

           Nancy elbows him, smiling.

                                 NANCY
                        What daddy means is people usually 
                        dress down at the beach.

                                 GRANT
                        I have bathers on unda’neath.

           He lifts his shirt up to show them.

                                 JIM
                        Thanks Grant, we coulda imagined 
                        ‘em.  Now go change.

                                 GRANT
                        I will not.  There will be severe 
                        reaper-cushions if you make me!

                                 JIM
                        Grant, do not do what I think 
                        you’re gonna do.  We had a meetin’
                        at school about this.  Rememba’
                        what Ms. Kelly said--

                                 GRANT
                        I’m not in school...

                                 JIM
                        We talked about this – it’s 
                        inappropriate.

                                 GRANT
                        You’re forcin’ me!

                                 JIM
                        Grant! Cease and desist right now--

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 GRANT
                        --You ass’ed for it!

           He leans over and shakes his rear, laughing like it’s the 
           height of sophistication. It’s too ridiculous.  Jim and Nancy 
           both break down laughing.

           Jane and Arnna shake their heads.  They’ve seen it too many 
           times before. Jim takes a cue from them.

                                 JIM
                        No! It’s not funny.  Look Grant, 
                        I’m not watching! I can’t even see 
                        what you’re doing!

           Jane gets up and with much sisterly-wrenching forces Grant to 
           sit down.  She takes her seat back and blows the hair out of 
           her face, exhausted.

                                 JANE
                        Phew... kids!

           Nancy grins at her.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- HALF HOUR LATER

           Jim Beaumont backs his car out into the street.  From the 
           front stoop, Nancy prods the kids out the door.

                                 NANCY
                        Say bye to daddy!

           They do; cheerfully out-of-tune.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        Back on the Noon bus, ‘kay?

           Bogged down by BEACH CHAIRS and TOTE BAGS with TOWELS in 
           them, the kids make their way down the drive.  Before 
           rounding the corner, Grant turns and waves.

                                 GRANT
                        Bye, mum!

           She waves back as they walk out of sight:

                                 NANCY
                        Bye loves!

           EXT. CORNER; HARDING & PETERSON STREETS –- 10:10 A.M.

           Jane, Arnna, and Grant stand on the roadside waiting for the 
           10 o’clock bus.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 JANE
                        It’s late.

                                 GRANT
                        How d’you know?

           She points above the treetops at a partially-obscured CLOCK 
           TOWER.

                                 JANE
                        Glenelg Tower. It’s near the beach.

           Grant tries to look; stands on his tip-toes.

                                 GRANT
                        I can’t see it!

                                 ARNNA
                        That’s because you’re short.

           The bus slowly approaches from just a dot on the horizon.  
           They climb on, dragging their belongings with them.

           Jane’s the last, seeing the younger two safely up the steps.  
           She pulls herself up, almost losing her copy of LITTLE WOMEN 
           in the process.

           INT. ADELAIDE BUS-LINES -- CONTINUOUS

           The kids find a spot to sit as the BUS DRIVER watches them 
           go.  When they’re clear of the landing he swings the doors 
           shut and pulls away from the curb.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The Driver, a Mr. I.D. Monroe, 
                        recalled seeing the Beaumonts on 
                        his morning route as did a female 
                        witness who later came forward...

           The children find a seat across from a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.  
           Jane goes right back to reading her book, practically burying 
           her face in it. It makes the woman smile.

           Lacking space, Arnna shoves Grant over.

                                 ARNNA
                        Move!

                                 GRANT
                        Now I don’t have any room!

                                 ARNNA
                        Tough.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 GRANT
                        You’re just mad ‘cause Mum loves me 
                        more.

                                 ARNNA
                        No she doesn’t.  If she loves 
                        anybody more, it’s me.
                              (bitter)
                        Or Jane.

           Jane speaks without looking up from her book.

                                 JANE
                        You were BOTH mistakes.  I was the 
                        only one they planned for.

                                 GRANT
                        You just think you’re better than 
                        me cause you can read!

                                 ARNNA
                        No Grant, she is better than you 
                        because she can read.

                                 GRANT
                        Who cares about books?  I’m the 
                        handsome one.

           EXT. ADELAIDE BUS -- CONTINUOUS

           The Bus continues along passing STREET SIGNS illustrating the 
           way:

           Down a hill along DIAGONAL WAY,

           through a light at BRIGHTON ROAD,

           left on JETTY WHARF,

           finally stopping on MOSELY STREET.

           EXT. COLLEY RESERVE –- CONTINUOUS

           The children shuffle off the bus dragging their beach-things 
           behind them.  Their sun-shocked brows carry the brunt of the 
           load. Behind them, GLENELG TOWER tells the time.

                                 HARPER (V.O)
                        They arrived at Glenelg Beach no 
                        later than 10:15 a.m. Not much is 
                        known about how they spent the next 
                        forty-five minutes - it’s assumed 
                        they went for a swim...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Jane ushers the other two across the street and onto the not 
           yet crowded BEACH.

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH –- MOMENTS LATER

           Coming out from behind the CHANGING ROOMS, the threesome 
           throw their TOWELS, BAGS, and CHAIRS onto a patch of 
           unoccupied sand and make for the surf.

                                 HARPER (V.O)
                        ...but at some point in there it’s 
                        certain they met the man in 
                        question.

           EXT. JETTY -- SECONDS LATER

           Grant and Jane reach the water first and dive right in.  
           Arnna, lagging behind, is about to follow when:

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Well, hello there!

           Arnna whirls around to see a gaunt, yellow-haired MAN dressed 
           in a pair of blue swimming briefs and an open, silk button-
           up.

           SCRIPT NOTE: The man is shot from chest down, or behind; his 
           face never, ever on display.

                                 ARNNA
                        Hello.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        You’re Arnna, right? You’ve seen me 
                        on the pier befor’. I had my 
                        shepherd collie a few weeks back.  
                        Rememba? My name’s Victor.

           She looks up at him, shielding her face from the sun in her 
           eyes.

                                 ARNNA
                              (somewhat timid)
                        Yeah...

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Now see you’re very smart.  You’re 
                        not supposed to talk to strangers 
                        unless they’re good and you know 
                        them.  And you know me so there’s 
                        nothin' to be afraid of.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           She smiles a little, slowly being won over.  Behind her Jane 
           emerges from the water and sees her sister talking to a 
           stranger.  She slogs her way out to Arnna.

                                 JANE
                        Arnna, come swim...

                                 ARNNA
                        This is my friend, Victa’.

           The tall, blonde Man looks into the sun and smiles.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Where your parents at on this fine, 
                        fine day?

           He winks at Arnna.  Jane isn’t having it.

                                 JANE
                        Daddy’s upcountry with clients.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                              (as Grant joins them)
                        Well then, I’d hardly be a 
                        gentleman if I didn’t look out for 
                        you three.  I know a crackerjack 
                        hidin’ spot if you’re playin’ hide 
                        and seek.

           Jane takes Arnna by the arm.

                                 JANE
                        Let’s go, Arnie, we gotta be home 
                        soon--

           Arnna wrings her arm free.

                                 ARNNA
                        No! He’s my friend! If you wanna go 
                        and do somethin’ else that’s fine! 
                        You’re just jealous a grown-up 
                        wants to spend time with me and not 
                        you!

                                 GRANT
                        Yeah, you’re always tryin’ to boss 
                        us around. I’m sick of it!

           They walk off. Jane hesitates a minute, then follows.

                                 JANE
                        Hey, wait up!
           EXT. HOLDFAST SAILING CLUB –- 11:00 A.M.

           A Seventy-four year old Woman sits on a bench outside the 
           doors of the Sailing Club.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        They weren’t seen again until 11:00 
                        a.m. when the first of our three 
                        witnesses saw them playing on the 
                        Lawn of the Colley Reserve...

           The Woman lowers her sunglasses to see:

           EXT. COLLEY RESERVE, LAWN –- CONTINUOUS

           The Man lays on his stomach, his back to her, smiling as he 
           watches the children frolic in the SPRINKLER. Even Jane.  
           They’re laughing as he runs a hand through his sun-dappled 
           hair.

           Grant cups some water and splashes it on the Man’s back.  He 
           bites the lure, getting up to chase them around.

           They retaliate, flicking him with their wet towels.

           EXT. MILK BAR –- 11:45 A.M.

           The Man waits outside, against the shacks’ wall, unseen, as 
           the children step up to the head of the Snack Bar line...

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        ...The second witness didn’t recall 
                        seeing the children until 11:45 
                        a.m. Mrs. Beaumont is adamant she 
                        let the children leave with only 
                        six shillings.  Yet they showed up 
                        with a one-pound note, buying 
                        enough candy and pastries for all 
                        three of them and most curiously...
                              (beat)
                        A meat pie.

           Jane hands the Man his MEAT PIE and he goes to work on it.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Thank you...

           It’s gone in three bites.
           EXT. BENCH QUEUE –- CONTINUOUS

           The Man walks over to a nearby bench as he shoves the last of 
           the Pie into his mouth.  His pile of clothes is there.  He 
           digs through the pockets and comes out unsatisfied.

           He turns to the people sitting on the bench next to him. 
           There’s a FORTY-YEAR OLD WOMAN and an ELDERLY COUPLE with 
           their GRANDDAUGHTER, watching her eat an ICE CREAM CONE.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Did anyone touch my stuff? Did you 
                        see anyone riflin’ around in the 
                        pockets?!

           They look where he’s pointing, but shake their heads “no.”

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Witnesses Two and Three, both 
                        female, were on a bench near the 
                        Man's clothes.  He questioned them, 
                        but didn’t get what he wanted...

           The Man stalks away as if they were to blame. Then turns 
           back, justifying it:

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        There was money in there...

           He grabs Jane by the wrist and drags her to him.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on, we have to go.

                                 JANE
                              (wrenches free)
                        Oww, you’re hurting me!

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        We need to get changed.

           He takes down her bathers and rifles through Jane’s bag for 
           her dry clothes.

           The 2nd witness, the Younger Woman, looks on warily.

           INT. LIVING ROOM OF MISS PATTI DANIELS –- PRESENT DAY

           The YOUNGER WOMAN from the bench is now ELDERLY; hooked up to 
           an OXYGEN MACHINE.  She speaks straight into the Camera, 
           Documentary-style...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 PATTI DANIELS
                        I remember thinking at the time 
                        that the little girl was perfectly 
                        capable of dressing herself.

           She fumbles with some HAND-WRITTEN NOTES in her lap.

                                 PATTI DANIELS (CONT’D)
                        I wrote all this down a few years 
                        back when they started asking me 
                        about it regularly.
                              (beat)
                        My brain isn’t what it used to be.

           A WOMAN'S VOICE asks:

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        And you’re sure they were the 
                        Beaumonts?

           She answers without hesitation:

                                 PATTI DANIELS
                        There’s not a doubt in my mind.

           EXT. BENCH QUEUE –- BACK TO SCENE

           Jane yanks the clothes back from the Man.

                                 JANE
                        I can do it myself!

           He looks at her pale flesh... blind to everything else.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        ...We don’t have time.

                                 JANE
                        Time for what?

           He shakes the thoughts in his head away.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Nothing...
                              (beat)
                        Let’s go.

           He gets up, off his knees, and is about to leave when he 
           notices Jane’s SHIRT TAG sticking out. He quickly, lovingly 
           tucks it back in.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Grabbing his clothes off the bench, he guides Grant and Arnna 
           towards the CHANGING ROOMS.  Jane hurries to catch up, only 
           mildly embarrassed at being naked in public.

           EXT. FOOTPATH –- 1:45 P.M.

           A balding, overweight GENTLEMAN walking down towards the 
           beach moves sideways to let the Blonde Man and the Beaumont 
           Children pass him.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        They’re not seen for another hour 
                        and a half if the Man from Broken 
                        Hill is to be believed.  At the 
                        time, I was of another opinion.  I 
                        thought it was more than likely 
                        that the perpetrator’s weird 
                        behavior on the beach spooked the 
                        kids and they gave him the slip--

           EXT. CHANGING ROOMS –- 12:15 P.M.

           The tall, blonde Man tries to grab Jane by the arm, but she 
           shakes him off and takes Grant and Arnna by the hands and 
           leads them away.

           EXT. MOSELY STREET –- 1:45 P.M.

           The children jog down the street towards the Jetty Wharf. 
           They see their MAIL MAN down the way and yell happily.

                                 GRANT
                        Hey, it’s the postie!

           They run towards him as he smiles and waves back.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The last person to see the 
                        Beaumonts alive was their Mail Man, 
                        a Mr. T. Patterson.

           INT. CONCRETE ROOM –- PRESENT DAY

           Harper, again talking into the camera:

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        What initially hindered the 
                        investigation was the Postman’s 
                        statement.  He testified that he 
                        saw the Beaumonts at the tail end 
                        of his route.
           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- 1966, DAYS LATER

           Patterson sits sweating under heavy lights in an 
           Interrogation Room surrounded by Cops.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        What eventually came out was that 
                        he had crossed paths with the 
                        Beaumonts earlier in the day - as 
                        they were on their way to the 
                        Beach.
                              (beat)
                        So if he was wrong... and the Man 
                        from Broken Hill was wrong... 
                        then...

           EXT. CHANGING ROOMS -- 12:15 P.M.

           Back to when Jane ripped her arm out of the Man’s grasp.

           He turns angry, pulling her into his arms and seizing the 
           other kids; marching up the same FOOTPATH, but no ‘Man from 
           Broken Hill’ is present.

           Grant beats at the only part of the Man he can get to: the 
           Upper Thigh.  The tall, blonde Man now has a single WHITE 
           STRIPE going down both legs of his BATHERS.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        What we missed, and what went 
                        undiscovered for almost twenty 
                        years was the White Stripe on the 
                        bathin' suit the Man was wearing.  
                        Had we known - had anyone known - 
                        the Police would have realized that 
                        the colors belonged to members of 
                        the “Henley Beach Lifesaving Club.” 
                        When this finally came out it was 
                        with an extra shock, as the Henley 
                        Beach Club would burn down just one 
                        month after the Beaumonts went 
                        missing.
                              (beat)
                        With all their records left inside.

                                                       FADE TO:

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE –- AFTERNOON

           Nancy sits at the LIVING ROOM table, having tea with a 
           friend, MEREDITH CRAIG.  She chatters on as Nancy checks the 
           time on her watch: 2:09 p.m.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Somethin' wrong?

                                 NANCY
                        Kids were supposed to be home by 
                        noon.  Thought they missed the bus 
                        and took the 2 o’clock...

                                 MEREDITH
                        You wanna go look for them?

                                 NANCY
                        No, it’s okay.  Jane’s with them. 
                        I’m sure they’re fine. Besides we’d 
                        probably miss ‘em - they take a 
                        different way back everyday.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE –- LATER

           Nancy waves goodbye to Meredith as Jim pulls into the 
           driveway.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Tell me when they get home, kay?

                                 NANCY
                        Absolutely.

           Jim passes Meredith on the way up the drive.

                                 JIM
                        Bye Mere’.

                                 MEREDITH
                        See ya, Jim.

           Nancy leans in through the Driver's side window.

                                 NANCY
                        You’re back early.

                                 JIM
                        I rang, they weren’t in.

                                 NANCY
                        Kids aren’t back yet.

                                 JIM
                        Eh, no worries. Grant’s probably 
                        dragged them someplace. You want me 
                        to look for 'em?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NANCY
                        Could you?

                                 JIM
                        Yeah, you stay here – ‘case they 
                        come back.

           He pulls back out into the street and takes off.

           EXT. ADELAIDE STREETS –- DUSK

           Jim drives through the suburbs looking down quiet, vacant 
           streets. He calls out their names one-by-one:

                                 JIM
                        Grant?!
                              (no answer)
                        Arnna?!
                              (still silent)
                        Jane?!

           No response, save the sounds of the crickets coming out...

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH –- LATER

           Jim gets out and wanders the Beach for a while. No one’s 
           there; the population having gone home for the evening.

           He looks this way and that, getting worried.

           EXT. MOSELY STREET SHOPS –- NIGHT

           Dusk has given way into full-blown night. Jim’s head darts 
           back and forth, scanning ALLEYWAYS and STREET CORNERS.

           The harsh, electric streetlights cast seedy shadows over 
           everything...

           EXT. GLENELG TOWER –- VARIOUS

           The CLOCK TOWER lapses from late night to early dawn.  And at 
           the first signs of the world stirring again, Jim Beaumont 
           returns home.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE –- MORNING LIGHT

           Jim makes his way out of the car and into the house.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        I met the Beaumonts that first 
                        morning, having drawn an unlucky 
                        night shift.  It was the last call 
                        I was going to make.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN –- 6:45 a.m.

           Jim walks in the side door to find Geoff Harper, age 25, 
           sitting next to his wife at the Kitchen Counter.

                                 NANCY
                        Any luck?

           Jim shakes his head.  Harper manages a half-smile.

                                 HARPER
                        Hello, Mr. Beaumont.

                                 NANCY
                        Jim, this is Inspector Harper. He 
                        was just asking me something.

                                 HARPER
                        I said, ‘can you think of any 
                        reason your children would want to 
                        run away?’

                                 NANCY
                        No.  They were happy.

                                 HARPER
                        Think really hard, Mrs. Beaumont.  
                        If it is a kidnapping, nine times 
                        out of ten it’s someone the victim 
                        knows.  And if it is, we’ve got a 
                        really good shot of catching this 
                        guy.

                                 NANCY
                        And what about the other ten 
                        percent?

                                 HARPER
                        You don’t wanna know, ma’am.

                                 NANCY
                        Humor me, Inspector.

           Harper looks up at Jim, as if he’ll step in and save him.  
           He’s leaning against the fridge, arms crossed; listening, but 
           somewhere else entirely.

                                 HARPER
                        They’re taken by a sicko. For them 
                        it’s random.

           Nancy takes this in. Thinks about it.  She slowly turns to 
           Jim.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 NANCY
                        This is your fault.

           It takes him a moment to realize she’s talking to him.

                                 JIM
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        Now there’s no cause to blame each 
                        other--

           Nancy plows right past him.

                                 NANCY
                        --you did this. You allowed it to 
                        happen. You let the kids run around 
                        the neighborhood with no regard as 
                        to what they might be doing--

                                 JIM
                        How can you say that?

                                 NANCY
                        --You let them jump on the beds 
                        when I’m not here – don’t think I 
                        don’t know! You let Grant wear 
                        clothes he’s already worn days 
                        before; you have no concern for 
                        their health, their well-being,

                        Yeah?  Well, who let ‘em go to the 
                        beach?!

           Her words choke in her throat. So do his--

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Answer me that.

           She says nothing and Jim retreats up the stairs.

           INT. THE CHILDREN’S ROOM –- CONTINUOUS

           Jim marches straight in and begins looking...

                                 JIM
                        Come on kids, this isn’t funny. 
                        Stop playing!

           He flings open CLOSETS, pushing the CLOTHES aside to see if 
           they’re hiding.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He looks in TRUNKS, deep down into their tiniest crevices. 
           Sifts through piles of DIRTY LAUNDRY...

           He moves aside BUREAUS, CURTAINS, even tosses off all their 
           BED COVERS.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Come out!  Please come out!

           The room’s a mess, but he carries on. Lying down on his side, 
           he looks under each one of their beds.

           Jane's...

           Arnna's...

           Finally, he gets to Grant's.  He lifts the trim up. There’s 
           nothing there.

           He lies with his face pressed flush against the hardwood 
           floors. Panting hard.

           Defeated.

                                                       FADE TO:

           EXT. ADELAIDE COAST –- MORNING

           AGENTS on GLENELG BEACH and OFFICERS in SMALL DINGHIES and 
           MOTOR PATROL BOATS explore the coast.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The next morning when the Beaumonts 
                        were officially declared missing, 
                        the coast was searched for several 
                        kilometers along the city of 
                        Adelaide.

           EXT. PATAWALONGA BOAT HAVEN –- NOON

           The Harbors WOODEN GATE is locked shut as divers go to work 
           exploring the area.

                        On Thursday, February the third, at 
                        low tide, the Patawalonga Boat 
                        Haven was closed to search for 
                        their bodies...

           A line of POLICE CADETS wade their way through waist-deep 
           mud, using LONG, DULLED PITCHFORKS to plumb the sandy depths.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           One of the men discovers a discarded TOILET SEAT and lifts it 
           high above his head.

                        They found nothing.

           INT. CONCRETE ROOM –- PRESENT DAY

           Harper COUGHS and pauses to catch his breath.  He takes a sip 
           of water from the stool next to him.

           The Woman that’s been interviewing him, LIDDY TOURNEAU, takes 
           advantage of the silence to ask a question:

                                 LIDDY
                        So you’re not in the camp that 
                        believed they drowned?

                                 HARPER
                        I mean, use your head.  Even if it 
                        was possible that three children 
                        could be swept out to sea on one of 
                        the most popular beach days of the 
                        year – what happened to their 
                        stuff? Towels, chairs, a book... 
                        was all this drowned with them?

           He COUGHS again into his hand.

                                 LIDDY
                        Hair of the dog?

                                 HARPER
                        Excuse me?

                                 LIDDY
                        The cough, the blotchy 
                        complexion... just how many years 
                        have you been drinking for?

                                 HARPER
                        It'd be easier to ask how long I've 
                        been breathing for.

                                 LIDDY
                        I'm serious.

                                 HARPER
                        So am I.  What does it matter.

                                 LIDDY
                        Drunks make poor sources.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Who said I was a drunk? I've been 
                        honest and forthcoming. And if you 
                        ask me, I've about had it up to 
                        here with the attitude.  

                                 LIDDY
                        Oh please, you can spare me.

                                 HARPER
                        Spare you?  You know, you should be 
                        so lucky as to have me--

                                 LIDDY
                        --I know about the book, Mr. 
                        Harper.  Know you've been shopping 
                        a book about the crimes and that 
                        interest has waned.  So let's just 
                        drop this, "I'm lucky to have you" 
                        routine.  We're in the same boat, 
                        you and I.

           She watches as he sits there, stewing.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        Can we continue?

           He huffs.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, alright.
                              (beat)
                        Anyhow, back at the house Mrs. 
                        Beaumont was kept under sedation.

                                 LIDDY
                        Why sedation?

                                 HARPER
                        Because without it... she’d just 
                        scream.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM –- FEBRUARY 3RD, 1966

           Nancy Beaumont cries out from the couch she’s on, convulsing, 
           as her friends, Meredith among them, try fruitlessly to hold 
           her down.  She keens for her children, inconsolably.

           Relatives hurry around trying to make themselves useful as 
           POLICE OFFICERS circulate freely through the house.

           OFFICER NGUYEN, 22, is about to shut the back door when 
           Harper walks in. He smiles.

                        That’s not funny – my mum’s in a 
                        wheelchair.

                                 HARPER
                        Must be why we got on all the rides 
                        for free.

           Nguyen LAUGHS, but hearing Nancy’s screams wipes the smile 
           off both their faces.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN –- CONTINUOUS

           Jim listens to his wife’s shrieks from the other room, his 
           face the pallor of white rice. He smokes an endless string of 
           cigarettes as the Police install a telephone.

           Harper's partner DEAN DAWSON, 38, walks over to him.

                                 DAWSON
                        Mr. Beaumont, we’ve put in a phone 
                        so that if you need us or we need 
                        you, either one of us can be 
                        reached.

                                 JIM
                        We can’t afford a phone...

                                 DAWSON
                        This one’s on the Police 
                        Department, sir.

           Jim muffles a quick:

                                 JIM
                        Thank you.

           He takes a look around; sees the frenetic pace of those 
           around him.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Do me a favor?

                                 DAWSON
                        What is it?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Make these people leave?

                                 DAWSON
                        ‘Scuse me?

                                 JIM
                        You’re the police.  Can you make 
                        'em leave?
                              (beat)
                        I don’t need these strangers in my 
                        house.

                                 DAWSON
                        Whatever you say, Mr. Beaumont.

           Dawson YELLS out:

                                 DAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Alright gents, pack it in! Family 
                        and friends only!

           On his way out, Harper catches up to Dawson.

                                 HARPER
                        I think he meant everybody. Even 
                        family.

                                 DAWSON
                        And what makes you so smart?

                                 HARPER
                        I think if you’d ask him he’d tell 
                        you that.

                                 DAWSON
                        And I say that this man and his 
                        wife need family right now. The 
                        second I start listening to a cadet 
                        is the day I retire.

                                 HARPER
                        I passed the service exam--

                                 DAWSON
                        So you keep tellin’ me.

           He walks out of the room.
           INT. CHANNEL 9 NEWS ROOM –- NIGHT

           Jim Beaumont sits in a chair behind a NEWS DESK.  Behind him 
           the stations CALL NUMBERS are illustrated in LIGHT BROWN and 
           YELLOW FELT.  He’s seated next to ROB KELVIN, the local 
           Newsman.

           A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT comes over to speak quietly to Mr. 
           Beaumont.

                                 P.A.
                        Do you need anything before we 
                        start, Mr. Beaumont?

                                 JIM
                        No.

           As she walks off the set, the P.A. starts the countdown:

                                 P.A.
                        On in 5, 4, 3...

           She goes silent and cues Rob, who puts down the mirror he’s 
           using to fix his hair. He smiles wide.

                                 ROB KELVIN
                        In the past five days no story has 
                        captured our imagination and 
                        sympathy like that of the 
                        disappearance of the Beaumont 
                        Children.  In our studio tonight, 
                        we have a special message from 
                        their father, Jim Beaumont.  Jim?

           He turns to face Mr. Beaumont. Jim just sits there staring at 
           Kelvin.

                                 ROB KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        Go on, Mr. Beaumont...

           He slowly revolves to face the camera.  And takes a hard 
           breath.

                                 JIM
                        Whoever...

           He trails off, his face swelling.  He tries again.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Whoever has my children, please...

           His gaze drops from the TELEPROMPTER.  If there’s a script – 
           he’s off it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Grants blood sugar might be low and 
                        Jane doesn’t deal well with new

           He’s unable to finish, choking out the words--

                        --Give 'em back.

                        It’s okay Mr. Beaumont.

           Jim sits back in his chair. Kelvin happily takes over.

                        The local police have asked the 
                        assistance of every citizen in 
                        Adelaide to search their homes 
                        through and through. That means 
                        backyards, sheds, basements, crawl 
                        spaces – anywhere small children 
                        may be prone to hiding.

           MONTAGE:

           CLOSE on the flicking gears and fluttering paper of a PRESS 
           moving at full speed.  FLYERS with the Beaumont Children’s 
           faces on them land in a pile underneath the machine.

                        And people searched...

           A set of hands scoops the pile out and boxes them.

                        If you ask me what I remembered 
                        from looking for the Beaumonts all 
                        that summer: it would have to be 
                        that song...

           INT. FAMILY DEN -- MORNING

           A YOUNG GIRL turns on her radio and happily hears Tommy James 
           and the Shondells singing “Crimson and Clover.”

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        It was everywhere. We’d long since 
                        had an unwritten agreement with the 
                        Brits and the Yanks regarding a 
                        culture exchange – they sent over 
                        art, films, and music...
                              (beat)
                        ...and in return, didn’t listen to 
                        a word of ours.

           CLOSE on the radio as Tommy James sings in a high falsetto:

                                 RADIO (V.O.)

           EXT. ADELAIDE –- VARIOUS

           The Adelaide Community is out in droves, searching anywhere 
           they can think of. Families turn their homes upside down, in 
           hopes of finding something...

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The search became the biggest ever 
                        mounted in Southern Australia.

           Harper and Dawson go door-to-door around the neighborhood.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Hundreds of calls were received 
                        from people believing they’d seen 
                        the Beaumonts. Each one was 
                        investigated.

           INT. SUBURBAN TAXI SERVICE GARAGE –- DAY

           TAXI DRIVERS take to their cars.

                        Beaumont used to be a driver – 
                        found out it was his kids that had 
                        gone missing they volunteered to 
                        help.

           EXT. ADELAIDE HILLS -- NIGHT

           VOLUNTEERS and DEPUTIES explore shrub-laden desolate hills 
           with FLASHLIGHTS.

                        inside and out, to no avail.

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH -- DAY

           Cleared of swimmers for the afternoon, a mass of people crowd 
           GLENELG BEACH.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The day they searched the dunes, a 
                        thousand people showed up.

           They fan out, digging through the sand with the sides of 
           their shoes and their hands. 

           Nearly every inch is covered... nearly...

           Behind them, the sand falls down an embankment towards a 
           GRILL-COVERED STORM DRAIN.

           Looking through the bars we see... a copy of LITTLE WOMEN, 
           soaking wet and covered in SEA MOSS and ALGAE.

                                                       END OF MONTAGE

           EXT. BEAUMONT GARDEN -- AFTERNOON

           The Beaumont's side door opens.  Meredith stands arm-in-arm 
           with Nancy, helping her down the stairs.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Whoever it was who decided Mrs.

                        Garden Press Conference, I’ll never 
                        know.  She was brought out, half in 
                        the bag...
                              (beat)
                        I don’t even think she remembers 
                        what she said.

           As they emerge, the line-up of PRESS AGENTS at the back fence 
           comes through and into the Beaumont’s backyard, crowding for 
           an exclusive. Meredith and Nancy stand next to CHIEF of 
           POLICE, DREW BILLIS, 63.

                                 CHIEF BILLIS
                        Mrs. Beaumont will answer a few 
                        brief questions and then we’d 
                        kindly like all of you to leave her 
                        yard.

           Rob Kelvin elbows his way to the front.

                        going to the beach with your 
                        children?

           She pulls her sweater tighter, as if protecting herself.

                                 NANCY
                        What kind of a question is that?

                        What do you say in response to the 
                        reports that the Stranger stopped 
                        and dressed your oldest, Jane?

                        I’m surprised... Jane is a very shy 
                        child.  I can’t believe she’d let 
                        anyone dress her.

           Nancy cups a hand over her mouth. The other Reporters clamor

                                 KELVIN
                        --If you had it to do over again do

                        Not one second.

           Chief Billis sees the reaction this causes in Nancy.

                                 CHIEF BILLIS
                        That’s it – get him out of here!

           An OFFICER pushes through the crowd.

           He takes Kelvin by the shoulders and pulls him back.

                                 KELVIN
                        Okay, okay – I’ll go! You don’t 
                        have to touch me.

           The Cop lets him be.  Kelvin smooths his suit back down and 
           walks out of the garden.

           EXT. ERWIN’S GARAGE -- DAY

           A car rolls onto the oil-stained cement drive, bleating like 
           a dying calf.  The mechanic, ERWIN GROSSER, 31, hears the 
           noise and comes over, wiping his hands. The DRIVER steps out 
           to meet him.

                                 DRIVER
                        Need some petrol.

                                 GROSSER
                        Sure, but there’s something wrong 
                        with your carbie’.

                                 DRIVER
                        I said, fill it up...

           He lifts up his shirt to reveal a pistol wedged in his belt. 
           Erwin’s mouth drops open.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- LATER

           The frightened Mechanic sits talking to Dawson in a side 
           room.  When Dawson walks out to get some coffee, Harper joins 
           him.

                                 HARPER
                        You think he’s telling the truth?

                        Only lead we got to go on. ‘Said 
                        they were headed to Nuriootpa. You

                        problem anymore.

                        charge him with falsifying a police 
                        report.

           He starts to walk away.  Harper yells after him.

                                 HARPER
                        You know these fake tips are gonna

                        And just what did you have in mind?

           INT. VAN CZAR RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

           A drunk, stumbling man, PETER VAN CZAR, retires to bed.  He 
           kicks off his slippers and falls back, pulling the sheets out 
           from under him.

           When he’s finally comfortable, the PHONE RINGS.

                                 VAN CZAR
                        Oh, what the fuck!

           He fumbles around until he finds the switch for the bedside 
           lamp, then gropes for the RECEIVER.

                                 VAN CZAR (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           He listens for a moment.

                                 VAN CZAR (CONT’D)
                        I just laid down.
                              (beat)
                        Dammit! Fine!

           Van Czar tosses the covers off and shoves his feet back into 
           his slippers.  He stomps away to get dressed.

           EXT. HYATT REGENCY, PERTH -- PRESENT DAY

           Van Czar, many years older, sits at the Hotel’s lavish 
           Swimming Pool Bar.

                        “identikit.” The night I got the

           INT. ADELAIDE OBSERVER BUILDING -- LATE NIGHT: FEB. 7th, 1966

           Van Czar marches into his office, shrugging off his coat, 
           annoyed.  His EDITOR meets him at the door.

                                 VAN CZAR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gotten me out of bed - now 
                        what’s all this about?!

           He sees a somber-looking WOMAN waiting on a bench down the 
           hall.  It’s the FIRST WITNESS from the beach -- the one with 
           the SUNGLASSES.

           INT. ADELAIDE OBSERVER, EDITOR’S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER

           The Witness describes the Tall, Blonde Man to Van Czar. He 
           makes notes on a portfolio; drawing and erasing, editing and 
           undoing.

                                 VAN CZAR (V.O.)
                        Had they told me they were holding 
                        the front page for this, I mighta
                        spent a bit more time on it.  But 
                        as it stood, every time you used 
                        association with the woman, the 
                        whole thing would fall apart.  What 
                        she remembered was a skinny man 
                        with sandy blonde hair – the color 
                        of “grain” she said.  Parted on the 
                        side.  And the face was gaunt – 
                        gaunt as could be – as if someone 
                        had taken an ice cream scoop to the 
                        man’s cheeks.

           He adds some final details, then puts his pencil down.  He 
           turns the pad around and holds it up.

           The Woman clutches her chest.

                                 WITNESS #1
                        My God...

           She visibly shudders.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- THE NEXT MORNING

           Nancy opens the door and shields her face from the sun.  She 
           steps out to get the paper.

           On the front page, as promised, is the POLICE SKETCH.  She 
           lets out a gasp.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATER

           Nancy busies herself with the dishes, trying to keep her mind 
           occupied.  

           Her hands are moving so fast in the soapy water it isn't a 
           surprise when she nicks her finger on something.  

           She wrenches her arm out then goes back in to find the 
           culprit.  It's a small PARING KNIFE.  

           She stares at it in her hand, then holds it up to where she 
           got sliced.  

           Out of nowhere, she begins to cut herself again, trying to 
           make the wound deeper.  She grimaces, but swallows back tears 
           in an attempt to work something out.  

           Finally, she cries out in pain.  

           Hurling the knife, she slaps wildly at the sink water, 
           screaming. 

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN -- LATE NIGHT

           Nancy sits in the dark at the Kitchen table. Her hand is 
           wrapped up in a dish towel to staunch the flow of blood.  
           She’s found her husband's cigarettes and has taken up the 
           habit.

           The NEWSPAPER lies crumbled in the middle of the counter.  
           Jim walks in; a bathrobe on, the beginnings of a beard.  He 
           sees the paper between him and his wife.  

                                 JIM
                        So you’ve seen...

           Nancy takes a long drag off her cigarette.  She appears not 
           to have noticed him.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        You want the lights on?

           She doesn’t answer.  He starts to go.

                        What...

                                 JIM
                        Do you want the light on?

                                 NANCY
                        Not really.

           He pauses, wanting to say something, but decides against it.  
           He moves to leave finally when she turns to him, a bitterness 
           in her face that wasn’t there a moment ago.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        I just can’t shake this feeling...

                        What feeling?

                                 NANCY
                        Like I’ve forgotten something...
                              (beat)
                        Like I’ve left the back door wide 
                        open.

           She holds her head in her hands.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        If I could rememba’ one thing I’d 
                        know where they are – I just know 
                        it.

           He almost goes to her then, but she's returned to her dazed 
           state.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- MORNING

           Harper sits at his desk looking at MUG SHOTS.  The front door 
           opens and KAREN JONES, 18, a young girl of aboriginal descent 
           enters.  

           She looks around, asking the first person she sees for 
           directions.  They point her to Harper and she walks over.

                                 KAREN JONES

                        something?

           He motions to a desk chair directly across from him. She sits 
           down -- and immediately starts crying.

                                 KAREN JONES
                        I’m so sorry! I shoulda said 
                        something a week ago, but I 
                        couldn’t and now it’s probably too 
                        late--

           He hands her a tissue.  She blots her eyes and blows her 
           nose.

                        I want to apologize. I shoulda come 
                        earlier. I shoulda!  Now there’s 
                        probably nothing you can do!

                                 HARPER
                        Let me be the judge of that.  Just 
                        calm down--

                                 HARPER
                        Sounds like a nice guy.

                                 KAREN JONES
                        He's a prick.  Anyhow, I’m down in 
                        the West Torrens and it’s the 
                        middle of the night and I see this 
                        boy just walking by himself.

           Harper digs through the PHOTOS on his desk.  He finds a 
           PICTURE of GRANT taken on holiday a year before and hands it 
           to Karen.

                                 HARPER
                        Is this the boy you saw?

                                 KAREN JONES
                        Yes...
                              (beat)
                        But he was different.  He was 
                        messed up.  He looked... drunk...

           EXT. MORPHETT RD. -- JANUARY 26TH, LATE NIGHT

           Karen, wearing a revealing dress and looking a bit man-
           handled, tries to manage the precarious, broken sidewalk in 
           the heels she has on. She hears a TRASH CAN topple over and 
           follows the noise to its source.

           Across the street, Grant trips his way down the sidewalk, 
           barely standing, but somehow still walking.  

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           His direction isn’t clear, but he’s definitely moving away 
           from something. He slips and almost falls, but manages to 
           regain his footing.  

           He continues on a few more steps when suddenly a TALL, BLONDE 
           FELLOW swoops in and savagely seizes him up.

           The Man looks around, making sure he wasn't seen.  Karen 
           quickly ducks behind a car, terrified.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- BACK TO SCENE

           Fat tears roll down her face.

                                 KAREN JONES
                        I should have done something for 
                        that little boy!

                                 HARPER
                        You are now.  That's what counts.  
                        And you’re sure this is what you 
                        saw?

           She nods.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What time was this?

                                 KAREN JONES
                        About one, one-thirty--

           She’s cut off as the whole station starts buzzing with 
           activity: Officers throw on their jackets, walkie-talkies 
           sound off -- almost everyone makes for the door.

           Harper stands and flags down Nguyen.

                                 HARPER
                        What happened?!

                                 NGUYEN
                        What happened? We caught the guy 
                        that’s ‘what happened?!’

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

           The Beaumonts sit on opposite sides of their couch across 
           from Harper and Dawson.

                                 HARPER
                        There’s been a development...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAWSON
                        That’s putting it lightly! We 
                        caught the man that took your kids 
                        Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont!

           Jim and Nancy look at each other, hope in their eyes for the 
           first time in months.  Harper glares at his partner.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not so sure...

                                 JIM
                        Please, just tell us what happened.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you sure you and your wife want 
                        to hear about this?

                                 NANCY
                        If it has anythin' to do with my 
                        kids, tell me right now.

           Harper sighs.

                                 HARPER
                        It seems... well, it seems there 
                        was an attempted kidnapping 
                        yesterday and the circumstances 
                        under which they happened lead some 
                        people to believe they were 
                        committed by the same person who 
                        abducted your children.

           EXT. WARNEET BEACH WHARF -- THE DAY BEFORE

           SHANE SPILLER and his best friend, YVONNE TUOHY, both 11, 
           wander down the beach playing. In his belt loop, the boy 
           carries a colorful, toy TOMAHAWK.

                                 SHANE SPILLER
                        Okay, I’m Lionel Rose and you're 
                        Fightin' Harada.

                                 YVONNE TUOHY
                        I don't wanna play boxing--

                                 SHANE SPILLER
                        --come on, it'll be fun!

                                 YVONNE TUOHY
                        Why do I always gotta lose?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SHANE SPILLER
                        Because I'm the male. 

           The two of them suddenly find themselves covered in the 
           shadow of a man who has appeared out of nowhere.  DEREK 
           EARNEST PERCY, 21, scoops up Yvonne, placing a knife to her 
           throat and drawing some blood.

                                 PERCY
                        Come along now, boy...

           He pulls Yvonne tighter and goes after Shane.  The boy 
           quickly plucks the tomahawk from his belt and furiously back 
           pedals wailing away with it.  

           Percy runs flat out at him, trying to avoid the blade. Shane 
           somehow manages to slice the man's forearm. Percy tears the 
           appendage back, cupping the blood that’s spurting out.

           He hears shrieks behind him.  People have started to notice 
           Yvonne’s SCREAMS.  

           Percy takes one last look at Shane then high-tails it into 
           the darkness under the pier.

           Shane sits in the sand watching him go, covered in Yvonne’s 
           blood and suffering from deep, white shock.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- BACK TO SCENE

           Nancy stifles a cry as Jim stares straight ahead.

                                 JIM
                        Where‘s he now?

           Dawson takes out his notepad.

                                 DAWSON
                        Good news there - as Percy fled a 
                        witness got a good look at his car.  
                        It had badges on it.  Turns out 
                        Derek was a naval rating.  We found 
                        him three hours later, where his 
                        ship was docked on weekend leave...

           INT. H.M.A.S. CERBERUS -- THE DAY BEFORE, DUSK

           The Police kick in the door to Percy’s BED CHAMBERS.  He 
           whirls around, caught red-handed -- bloody shirt in hand.

           The dirty bar of soap he was using to clean its stains falls 
           aimlessly to the floor... next to Yvonne's lifeless body.
           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- BACK TO SCENE

           Mrs. Beaumont leans forward.

                                 NANCY
                        Could it have been him?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s possible. He admits to being 
                        in Adelaide last January. But the 
                        Witness on Glenelg Beach said the 
                        man looked to be in his late 
                        thirties, early forties...

                                 DAWSON
                        That doesn’t mean anything. I had a 
                        cousin who when he turned nineteen, 
                        looked like he was forty-two.

           Harper impatiently waits for Dawson to finish. When he does, 
           he nods to Mrs. Beaumont:

                                 HARPER
                        We’ll keep our ears open.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- MOMENTS LATER

           Harper and Dawson make their way to the Squad Car.

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe you in there!

                                 DAWSON
                        What did I do?

                                 HARPER
                        Doesn’t matter who, doesn’t matter 
                        where – just as long as we catch 
                        somebody, am I right?

                                 DAWSON
                        That's right.

                        Look, you've put in the years - I 
                        got it.  But sittin' on your fat 
                        ass for two decades doesn't qualify 
                        you to draw a pension.  Not on my 
                        watch.

                                 DAWSON
                        You act so confident.  But you have 
                        no idea what's out there.

                        Yes.  Make no mistake, Dawson, he 
                        is brilliant.  He'd have to be.  
                        And I know what you're thinkin' - 
                        if the people searching for him are 
                        only half as smart as you are, then 
                        we're fucked.  But rest assured, 
                        some of them are like me.

                                 DAWSON
                        You think because ya' went to Uni
                        that makes you smart?

                                 HARPER
                        It certainly puts me at an 
                        advantage.

                                 DAWSON
                        It makes you unprepared for the 
                        job.  You're as green as they come.  
                        And until you put some kilos on the 
                        engine - I don't trust you.

                                 HARPER
                        How will I sleep at night?

                                 DAWSON
                        Let me tell you somethin' about 
                        pedophiles – they’ll get off 
                        whenever and wherever they please.  
                        The only question is: when are we 
                        gonna catch ‘em? And do me a favor: 
                        don't ever second guess me in front 
                        of other people again. I don’t need 
                        to take etiquette lessons from some 
                        piece of shit, fresh off the boat!

                                 HARPER
                        That might mean something if I 
                        actually listened to a fat fuck 
                        like you!

           Dawson makes a mad dash for him, but Harper's ready.  He 
           takes his revolver by the service end and pistol whips Dawson 
           across the temple. Dawson goes straight down as Harper stands 
           over him, fist-cocked.

                        and I don’t care who you screw

                        your ass that the cock-back'll kill 
                        you!

           Harper goes to get in the car as Dawson YELLS at him from the 
           ground.

                        for you, Sergeant.

           He peels away and leaves Dawson there, bleeding in the 
           street.  Dawson CALLS after the quickly fading car:

           Operator JIM THATCHER, 32, pulls off his HEADSET and 
           stretches.

                                 THATCHER
                        Thank God, I’m fam-ished!

           He hands the headset over and the Constable takes his seat. 
           Wallace pulls out the lead wire and, going down the 
           checklist, examines each FREQUENCY.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Hearing nothing, he moves on -- until he comes across a 
           hushed conversation a MAN and a WOMEN are having.

           The feed BUZZES IN and OUT...

                                 WOMAN
                        ...they’re brats... the lot of 
                        ‘em...

                                 MAN
                        ...comin’ or goin?

                                 WOMAN
                        ...they’re leavin’...gotta be 
                        moved...

           Wallace frowns, puzzled. He’s about to move the wire again, 
           when:

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        ...he’ll run again... you give him 
                        the chance...

                                 MAN
                        ...beaumonts... a tricky bunch.

           Wallace's mouth drops open with the find of a century. He 
           scrambles back to slot number one; the main SWITCHBOARD 
           OPERATOR:

                                 WALLACE
                        Lydia! Incoming from circuit--

           He struggles to read the board.

                                 WALLACE (CONT’D)
                        --Numba’ one-thirty-seven.  I need 
                        you to find where it’s coming from.
                              (he waits, listens)
                        Whaddya mean you can’t say exactly? 
                        Then give me the town!

           INT. BASEMENT -- NIGHT

           “Crimson and Clover” wafts across the room from a corner 
           RECORD PLAYER. A person, cut off at the chest, carries the 
           morning paper inside. He throws it on a table.

           The byline reads "Crossed Wires a True Find," with a subtitle 
           revealing Jim Beaumont on his way to Kaniva, Victoria.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Man goes back to his task: folding a child’s laundry. He 
           gets to a weathered, bleached LONG-SLEEVED SHIRT. He folds it 
           and lays it atop a pile of other neatly folded clothes.

           Only then does he notice the TAG sticking out of the shirt. 
           He plucks it off.

           Picking up the rest of clothes, he walks back towards the 
           door – but something stops him...

           Backtracking, he lays the clothes down on the table. His 
           lithe, spotless hands reach for the paper. Under his nails 
           lie thick clumps of dirt.

           He reads the photo excerpt:

           “Senior Officer Stan Swaine and Jim Beaumont (pictured, far 
           left) travel from the Beaumont's Home at 109 Harding Street, 
           Somerton Park, to follow a lead in Kaniva.”

           The Man's clutching grasp relaxes and he lets the paper drop 
           to the table...

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, FRONT STOOP -- DAY

           Meredith comes outside to grab the mail.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The Kaniva lead turned out to be 
                        anything but; just some couple, 
                        gossiping. But it led to so much 
                        more...

           She arrives at the mailbox and looks at the day's letters 
           quickly: Junk Mail and Bills.

           She’s about to go back inside when one catches her eye.  It’s 
           addressed to “Mommy and Daddy.”

           The other letters fall by the wayside.

           Meredith's mouth drops open.  Behind her, Jim's at the open 
           front door.  He sees her reaction.

                                 JIM
                        What is it, Mere?

           She holds the letter up, speechless.
           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- LATER

           Dawson, Harper, and several other Officers convene in the 
           Beaumont’s Living Room. Jim and Nancy wait eagerly on the 
           couch.

           After FORENSICS finishes dusting the letter, a LAB TECH hands 
           it over to Harper.

                                 TECH AGENT
                        No prints.

                                 HARPER
                        None?

           The Tech shakes his head.  Harper turns to Nancy and hands 
           her the letter.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Mrs. Beaumont – whenever 
                        you’re ready.

           She takes it tentatively and reads the heading.

                                 NANCY
                        It says it’s from Jane... but it’s 
                        not her handwriting.

           She turns the note over, looking at the back.

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s not any of theirs.

           Jim reads over her shoulder.

                                 JIM
                        And they’ve spelled Arnna’s name 
                        wrong.

           Nancy shakes her head.

                                 NANCY
                        I can’t read this--

           Harper puts a hand on her back and takes the letter.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s okay, you don’t have to.

           He quickly gives it a once-over.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It says he’s tired of them... wants 
                        to give 'em back... says if you’re 
                        in Dandenong on the 26th, he’d be 
                        happy to be rid of them.

           Nancy looks up smiling.

                                 NANCY
                        They’re alive?!

           Harper nods, allowing himself to smile too.

                                 HARPER
                        Seems like it...

           Nancy turns to her husband and hugs him as hard as she can.

           EXT. DANDENONG SQUARE -- EVENING, FEBRUARY 25TH, 1968

           An unmarked Van pulls under a HOTEL OVERHANG.  The Beaumonts 
           duck their way inside.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The Beaumonts were ferried into 
                        Dandenong early that weekend, as 
                        the letter warned that if any 
                        police were involved they wouldn’t 
                        see their children again.

           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- MORNING OF THE TWENTY-SIXTH

           Jim stands on the landing of the stairs in front of the Post 
           Office.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The letter demanded Mr. Beaumont be 
                        in front of the Post Office at 9:00 
                        a.m. wearing a pair of white 
                        trousers and a dark coat.

           He waits, nervously, as no one comes.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The whole thing was a mess; botched 
                        before we left the state.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, KITCHEN -- THE DAY BEFORE

           Meredith covertly picks up the newly-installed phone’s 
           receiver.  She glances over her shoulder before dialing.

           After a moment, a MALE VOICE answers and she speaks:

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MEREDITH
                        You still offering money for leads?

           INT. CHANNEL 9 NEWSROOM, EDITING BAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           PETER LEWELL, Executive Producer of the Channel 9 Evening 
           News, hangs up the phone after talking to Meredith.

           He sees Rob Kelvin eating a cruller and reading over his 
           script for the night.

                                 PETER LEWELL
                        Kelvin, guess what – you’re goin’
                        to Dandenong!

           Kelvin answers; his mouth full--

                                 KELVIN
                        Pete, I'm eating here, I don’t 
                        wanna go to Melbourne--

                                 PETER LEWELL
                        --Rob, the Beaumonts are on the 
                        move.

           Kelvin's face immediately brightens. Smelling a lead, he 
           drops his pastry in the trash, grabs his coat, and heads for 
           the door.

           EXT. DANDENONG -- THE NEXT DAY

           Jim Beaumont stands where he’s been told to stand.  He looks 
           this way and that for anything to happen. People walk past, 
           motorists drive by. To the untrained eye, nothing remains out 
           of the ordinary...

           EXT. HOTEL BALCONY -- SAME TIME

           High above the city, an OLDER BOY stands watching Mr. 
           Beaumont wait.

           Behind him a MAN with spotless hands places one of them on 
           the BOY'S SHOULDER.

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                        Come on, let’s go.

           The Boy turns and follows him inside.
           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- SAME TIME

           An elderly Secretary, Miss ALICE PARKER, comes outside and 
           carefully descends the many stairs.  She makes her way to Mr. 
           Beaumont.

                                 ALICE PARKER
                        Are you Jim?

                                 JIM
                        Yes.

           She hands him a folded up piece of paper.

                                 ALICE PARKER
                        Message for you.  The person said – 
                        and I hope I’m getting this right  
                        – that ‘Grant isn’t feeling well 
                        and we won’t be able to come until 
                        after lunch.’

                                 JIM
                        Thank you.

                                 ALICE PARKER
                        Welcome.

           She turns and stares at the ominous predicament the stairs 
           present. Jim reads the handwritten note anyway. Before the 
           woman is out of range, she says to no one in particular:

                                 SECRETARY
                        That looked like Jim Beaumont!

           INT. GARVIN’S PUB -- NOON

           Jim accompanied by Harper, in plain clothes, finds a dark, 
           unpopulated corner in which to sit, eat lunch, and drink.

                                 HARPER
                        Can I see the note?

           Jim fishes it out of his pocket.

                                 JIM
                        Yeah, it’s in the old bird’s script 
                        though.

           He’s about to hand it over when he sees a familiar face: Rob 
           Kelvin at the bar, ordering a drink.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Jesus, no...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           All the air seems to go out of him.  Harper follows his gaze 
           as Kelvin walks up to them.

                                 KELVIN
                        Hello, mates! Oh, Mr. Beaumont! 
                        What are you doing in Dandenong?!

           Harper stares at him.

                                 HARPER
                        The question, Kelvin, is ‘what're
                        you doing here?’ You know journos
                        aren’t allowed in private 
                        businesses.

                                 KELVIN
                        Who me? I’m just gettin' a drink...

           Jim speaks through gritted teeth.

                                 JIM
                        If you’re the reason I can’t see my 
                        children again--

           Kelvin cuts him off with a pitying:

                                 KELVIN
                        Ohhh...

           He smiles.

                                 KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        You still think you’re getting your 
                        kids back?

                                 HARPER
                        Kelvin, leave now!

                                 KELVIN
                        What is it they say in the states?

           He puts a finger on his chin, mugging for all around.

                                 KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        Ah, yes...
                              (beat)
                        It’s a free country.

                                 HARPER
                        Rob, I’m warning you--

           Kelvin turns on him abruptly.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 KELVIN
                        And what are you warning me about?
                        You’re not in Glenelg anymore.  You 
                        have no jurisdiction here.  I’m 
                        just trying to ask Mr. Beaumont 
                        here a couple questions...

           Jim leans forward in his chair, urgently keeping his voice 
           down--

                                 JIM
                        Stop saying my name!

           It’s no use; Kelvin continues -- his tirade aimed at Harper.

                                 KELVIN
                        --I don’t need to be accosted just 
                        because Jim Beaumont happens to be 
                        newsworthy!

           People have started to notice...

                                 JIM
                        Lower your voice!

           Kelvin finally rounds on Jim, his voice practically a YELL.

                                 KELVIN
                        And just how would you like me to 
                        act, Mr. Beaumont?!

           It’s all Jim needs to hear.  He launches himself over the 
           table tackling Kelvin to the ground.  He pummels the man 
           channeling all the aggression of the last two years.

           INT. GARVIN’S PUB, PARLOR ROOM -- CONTINOUS

           A DRUNK flies through a side door into an ADJOINING ROOM to 
           alert everyone --

                                 DRUNK
                        It’s on for young and old!

           An old BARFLY sits up in his stool.

                                 BARFLY
                        Who’s fightin’?

                                 DRUNK
                        Jim Beaumont and that asshole from 
                        the news, Rob Kelvin – ya’ know, 
                        the one with the hair!

           CONTINUED:

           The few local attendants scramble to their feet to see--

           INT. GARVIN’S PUB -- CONTINUOUS

           Harper tries hopelessly to pull Mr. Beaumont off Rob Kelvin. 
           But Jim continues to rain down punches.

                                 JIM
                        You son of a bitch! You cost me my 
                        kids!

           Kelvin SCREAMS out through beaten teeth:

                                 KELVIN
                        Someone! Get this man off me!

           Harper, with the help of the BARTENDER, finally manages to do 
           just that. Kelvin continues SCREAMING, unabated:

                                 KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna sue you, Beaumont!

           Jim tries to scramble back over to Kelvin but Harper holds 
           him back.

           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           Jim Beaumont waits for anything to happen.  A PRESS AREA has 
           been cordoned off and members of the MELBOURNE HERALD, the 
           ADELAIDE OBSERVER, and various TV NETWORKS crowd the sidewalk 
           across from him.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Mr. Beaumont returned that 
                        afternoon to wait.
                              (beat)
                        No one showed.

           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- THE NEXT DAY

           Jim waits again.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The same was true of the next 
                        day...

           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- THE THIRD DAY

           Jim, resigned, remains where he is.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        ...and the next day.
           EXT. DANDENONG POST OFFICE -- DUSK, THE THIRD DAY

           The sun finally floats below the horizon.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        At Dusk, on the third day, he went 
                        home.

                                                       FADE TO:

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- MONDAY

           Jim and Nancy once again sit on opposite sides of the couch.  
           Harper stands, holding a brand new letter addressed to just 
           “Daddy.” He reads:

                                 HARPER
                        You have crossed me for the last 
                        time. You won't see your kids 
                        again.  I can promise you that. I 
                        have no choice but to keep them.

           Nancy dissolves into tears once again.  Jim’s lost somewhere 
           in his own head.  Harper tries to finish...

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It’s signed - “Arthur Friend.”

           Meredith’s the only one who can find words.

                                 MEREDITH
                        So what’s next?

                                 HARPER
                        In a manner of speaking...
                              (beat)
                        Nothing.

                                 NANCY
                        Nothing?

                                 HARPER
                        With all due respect, we have zero 
                        to go on. A negro girl who says she 
                        saw Grant in the West Torrens is 
                        the last person to have seen one of 
                        your kids, Mrs. Beaumont. And she’s 
                        not coming forward any time soon.  
                        Unless this letter turns up 
                        something – and it severely looks 
                        like it won’t - then we have 
                        nothing to go on at all.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He takes a moment, avoiding the hard part.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        There’s only so long we can keep 
                        our best men on this...

           Nancy sits straight up in her seat.

                                 NANCY
                        Wait, you’re giving up?

                                 HARPER
                        No, Mrs. Beaumont. Just taking a 
                        breatha’. I can promise you – if 
                        one more spec of evidence turns up 
                        this whole station’ll be looking 
                        for your kids--

           She stubs out her cigarette.

                                 NANCY
                        --This is ridiculous. My children 
                        are out there somewhere – alive. 
                        You said it yourself. They’re 
                        alive! And Meredith asks you what 
                        you can do for 'em and you say 
                        nothing?! Well, fuck you! I’ll find 
                        my own damn kids!

           She stalks out of the room as Harper calls after her:

                                 HARPER
                        Mrs. Beaumont!

           But she ignores him.

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

           Harper, now an old man, exhales deeply.

                                 HARPER
                        ...and that brings us to the night 
                        of the second kidnapping.

           Liddy stands and stretches.

                                 LIDDY
                        A good a time as any to quit for 
                        the day.  We’ll pick this up 
                        tomorrow if you don’t mind. I do 
                        appreciate you doing this.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Oh, my pleasure! Keeps my mind 
                        sharp remembering this stuff.

           She takes off his MIC.

                                 LIDDY
                        I’ll walk you out...

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH FRONT -- MINUTES LATER

           Harper and Liddy make their way side-by-side towards Harper’s 
           car.

                                 HARPER
                        I'm sorry about earlier.

                                 LIDDY
                        Oh, don't mention it. People have 
                        rough edges. I learned that a long 
                        time ago.

                                 HARPER
                        I guess I'm just wondering why 
                        you're making this documentary.

                                 LIDDY
                        To some day – with all the evidence 
                        that’s still out there – to find 
                        the kidnapper.

                                 HARPER
                        You think you’re gonna find some 
                        scrap of evidence we didn’t?

           Liddy smiles.

                                 LIDDY
                        You know, most people think you’re 
                        obsessed.  That your preoccupation 
                        with the Beaumonts has gone to your 
                        head. What’s your interest in their 
                        case? What’s made it so important 
                        that you’ve given up forty years of 
                        your life?

                                 HARPER
                        I like a good mystery. What about 
                        you? We know why I’m here.  Your 
                        “Fisherman” documentary the only 
                        reason you’re here?

                        Hey, James O’Neill is a legitimate 
                        suspect in the Beaumont and 
                        Adelaide Oval kidnappings.

                                 HARPER
                        I never said he wasn’t.  But he's 
                        not your guy.

                                 LIDDY
                        How can you be so sure? He was in 
                        Adelaide at the time the Beaumonts 
                        went missing and the pattern of his 
                        crimes match what happened on 
                        Glenelg Beach.

                                 HARPER
                        Not if you look closely.  O’Neill 
                        was prone to random fits of 
                        violence. All his crimes seem to 
                        show him succumbing to some deep, 
                        carnal wish. They’re immediate, 
                        spur-of-the-moment...
                              (beat)
                        Our guy romances his victims.

           Liddy tries to refute it, but can’t.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Besides, you’re not asking the 
                        right questions – you’re not 
                        looking in the right places.

                                 LIDDY
                        And where should I look?

                                 HARPER
                        The Postie, let’s start there.  
                        First he says he saw the kids 
                        around three in the arvo, then 
                        after questioning it seems more 
                        like 10 a.m. as they were walking 
                        to the bus...

           EXT. MOSELY STREET -- JANUARY 26TH, 1966

           The Postman, quite paranoid by now, crosses the street after 
           looking over his shoulder for anyone following him. 

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH, PARKING LOT -- PRESENT DAY

           Liddy and Harper have reached his car.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        missing from the suspects pants?

                                 HARPER
                        We haven't gotten to that yet.

                                 LIDDY
                        So you know?! Not one of my sources 
                        could tell me!  Who took it?!

                                 HARPER
                        We'll get to that...

           He smiles sidelong at her.

                        How’s that? Paranoid all the time?

           He LAUGHS.

                                 HARPER
                        Maybe...

           He catches himself staring at her.

                        Listen maybe I’m bad at this, but 
                        do you wanna get a drink or 
                        something?

           She grins.

                                 LIDDY
                        It’s that “or something” that gets 
                        people in trouble, isn’t it?
                              (laughs)
                        I would really, but I have to meet 
                        my dad for dinner and--

           She looks at her watch--

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        --Oh, and I’m late! We’ll pick this 
                        up tomorrow, kay?

           She turns to her car and pulls out her keys. Over her 
           shoulder:

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Bout three, yeah?

           Harper smiles thinly, a little disappointed.

                                 HARPER
                        You bet.

           INT. HARPER'S HOUSE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Harper enters with a bag of groceries.  Setting them on the 
           counter, he grabs a beer from the fridge and drains it.  

           Instead of putting the food away, he fishes another beer out 
           and collapses into his living room recliner.

           There's hardly any room to move in the house: the halls, 
           floors, and walls are lined with boxes upon boxes of evidence 
           from the Beaumont Case.

                                                       FADE OUT:

           FADE IN:

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- DAY TWO

           Both Liddy and Harper settle into their chairs.

                                 LIDDY
                        Yesterday we left off at the night 
                        of the Adelaide Oval kidnapping.

                                 HARPER
                        You just don’t think that these 
                        horrible people can be so bold.  I 
                        mean, to take two young girls in 
                        plain sight of 3,000 screaming 
                        fans?  It requires a certain type 
                        of person, doesn’t it?

                                 LIDDY
                        Do you remember the girls?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s hard to forget them...
                              (beat)
                        Their name's are burned in my 
                        memory.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, BLEACHERS -- EVENING, AUGUST 25TH, 1973

           A bored looking four-year-old, KIRSTE GORDON, sits next to 
           JOANNE RATCLIFFE, 11.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Kirste’s there with her grandmother. Both the old woman and 
           Joanne’s parents watch the match, enthralled.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Kirste was four and Joanne, eleven.  
                        Their families were seated next to 
                        each other in the stands.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, PLAYING GREEN -- CONTINUOUS

           North Adelaide’s Football Team, wearing the proud red and 
           white, are making easy work of the Norwood Club they’re 
           pitted against.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        It was the night North Adelaide 
                        trounced the ‘red-legs’ seven-nil.

           On the field, North Adelaide draws a free kick and scores 
           handily.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, BLEACHERS -- CONTINUOUS

           Joanne’s parents cheer with the rest of their section.  
           Joanne leans towards her MOTHER and yells over the clamor:

                                 JOANNE
                        I’ve got to go to the toilet--

           Her mother waves her past.  As Joanne gets up to leave, 
           Kirste’s GRANDMOTHER grabs ahold of her arm.

                                 MRS. GORDON
                        Did you say you’re going to the 
                        toilet? Can you take Kirste with 
                        you?

           Joanne looks at the chubby little child next to the Woman.

                                 JOANNE
                        Sure.

           She takes Kirste by the hand and leads her down the stairs.

           INT. ADELAIDE OVAL, MAIN GATE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hand-in-hand they make their way towards the bathrooms.

           Some ways behind them, a man in a PLAID JACKET and FEDORA, 
           discreetly follows.

           He has a familiar tuft of blonde hair jutting out the back of 
           his neck.
           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, BLEACHERS -- LATER

           North Adelaide scores again and the roar is deafening.  When 
           it finally dies down, Joanne’s Mother looks to her side... to 
           Joanne’s empty seat.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Some twenty minutes later, Joanne’s 
                        mother noticed that her daughter 
                        had not returned.  She became 
                        visibly worried.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, GROUNDS -- LATER

           The Man in the Plaid Jacket carries Kirste over his shoulder.  
           Joanne follows, concerned.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        Over the next ninety minutes, no 
                        less than thirteen witnesses saw 
                        the girls with a tall, blonde Man; 
                        each assuming they’d seen a father 
                        with his two unruly children.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS

           A young girl, SYLVIA WOHLING, 11, walks with her tail-gating 
           FATHER back towards the Oval. He turns away from her and 
           starts to urinate.

                                 SYLVIA
                        Daddy!

                                 MR. WOHLING
                        Gotta piss, sweetheart! Keep a look-
                        out!

           She rolls her eyes, but does as she’s told.  It’s a second or 
           two before she sees the Man and the girls coming out of the 
           shadows. The Man’s stumbling gait makes him stick out...

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        He walked with a lean, like he was 
                        drunk...

           She stares at his appearance; his hat, in particular:

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        His hat had a wide brim... very 
                        Queensland Country, I remember.  I 
                        don’t think anyone’s mentioned that 
                        yet.
           INT. WOHLING RESIDENCE, NORWOOD -- PRESENT DAY

           Sylvia Wohling, now many years older, sits in a comfortable 
           armchair by her glassed-in patio.

                                 SYLVIA
                        I told my father what I had seen 
                        and he thought what most parents 
                        thought: you know ‘spare the rod,’ 
                        and such... but it bothered me for 
                        days after and even more so when I 
                        made the connection in my twenties.  
                        I knew I’d seen what I’d seen. So I 
                        kept at my fiancé about what 
                        happened that night. He finally 
                        told me to just come in and give my 
                        statement.

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, BACK LAWN -- NIGHT, 1973

           Sylvia watches as they disappear back into the night.  Joanne 
           beats the Man’s legs as hard as she can; an effort to get him 
           to let go of Kirste.

                                 SYLVIA (V.O.)
                        The Parents of that girl should be 
                        proud.  She did everything she 
                        could to save her little friend.
                              (beat)
                        Sometimes it’s never enough.

           EXT. SERVICE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS

           The Man drags Kirste, with Joanne in tow, towards the BACK 
           ROADS.

           A NORWOOD FAN sees the tussle and pulls over some ways down 
           the street.  He gets out of his car.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        A Man driving past the Oval was the 
                        last person to see the girls. He 
                        stopped and almost said 
                        something...

           The Fan shakes his head and gets back in his car.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        ...but in the end, decided it was 
                        none of his business.

           He drives off, leaving a cloud of dust, as the tall, blonde 
           Man rounds the corner and walks headlong into the woods.
           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- THE NEXT DAY

           Chief Billis slams the morning paper down onto a table.

                                 BILLIS
                        Soak it in, boys – we look like 
                        idiots!

           Every available member of the station house crowds forward to 
           see.  The headline reads, “The Pied Piper of Adelaide.”

                                 NGUYEN
                        The Pied Piper? What’s a pied 
                        piper?

           Harper takes a break from reading the article.

                                 HARPER
                        In folklore, he’s a traveling 
                        musician who comes to a town 
                        overrun with rats.  He makes a deal 
                        to play his pipe and lure the rats 
                        away.  When he does though, the 
                        townspeople, having been freed of 
                        the rats, decide not to pay him. So 
                        he turns to using his talents on 
                        the townspeople’s children.

                                 NGUYEN
                        What happened to the kids?

                                 HARPER
                        He made them drown themselves.

           Newspaper in hand, Nguyen shakes his head.

                                 NGUYEN
                        This is in horrible taste.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM –- AFTERNOON

           Jim finds himself alone for the time being.  He walks around 
           aimlessly, looking at the countless PICTURE FRAMES of his 
           children.  They seem to be laughing at him...

           He makes up his mind about something.  Leaving the room, he 
           comes back with a box and starts loading any and all photos 
           of the kids into it.

           When he's done, he carries the lot of them out back.
           EXT. BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Crossing the grass, he finds a spot for the box on a shelf in 
           the open GARAGE.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- SAME TIME

           A toilet FLUSHES and moments later, Nancy walks in drying her 
           hands.  She immediately sees the BARE WALLS and EMPTY CABINET 
           TOPS.  

           Looking around horrified, she sees Jim through the window, 
           walking to get the mail.

           She hurries out the back door.

           EXT. BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS

           Nancy finds the box all too quickly.  She brings it back 
           inside. 

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           As she walks in with the box, Jim enters with the mail.  She 
           holds the contents out to him.

                                 NANCY
                        What the hell is this?

           He sees what she's carrying.

                                 JIM
                        You know exactly what it is.

                                 NANCY
                        Why?

                                 JIM
                        You can't look at a picture of 
                        their's without losing it.  Each 
                        time you do it's like you're gone 
                        again.  And I'm here alone.

                                 NANCY
                        Is it so easy to forget them?  I'm 
                        sorry Jim if I'm just not ready to 
                        yet!

                                 JIM
                        How can you say that to me?

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NANCY
                        Because they mean more to me than 
                        they do you!

                                 JIM
                        That is not true!

                                 NANCY
                        Then why aren't you angrier?!

                                 JIM
                        What good does it do? I see you 
                        getting loud.  I see you making 
                        noise.  And it's all to make you 
                        feel better!  Every time I walked 
                        out that door I did it for you and 
                        the kids - I didn't know I shoulda'
                        been home watching them!  I didn't 
                        know I had to be there--

                                 NANCY
                        --That's what a parent does!

                                 JIM
                        Then, why weren't you watching 
                        them!

           His words have shaken her.  She begins to cry once again.  
           But the tears don't seem to affect him this time.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m goin’ for a walkabout.  
                              (beat)
                        I'll be back later.

           He turns and leaves.  He’s out the door by the time she 
           whispers:

                                 NANCY
                        Take me with you.

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, FRONT STOOP -- CONTINUOUS

           Jim closes the door behind him and walks down the front steps 
           to his truck.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        What most people don’t know and the 
                        news never picked up on was that 
                        Jim left his home every night after 
                        work and searched for those kids – 
                        like they’d simply taken the wrong 
                        way and gotten lost on their trip 
                        home.

           INT. JIM’S BUICK -- MINUTES LATER

           Jim pulls over to let his children into the car.

                                 JIM
                        Hey kids, climb on in...

           They crowd into the backseat.  He drives off, grinning.

                                 JANE
                        Hey, daddy!

                                 GRANT
                        Hi, dad!

           Arnna doesn’t say anything, but smiles a wide, apologetic 
           smile as if she’s taking the blame for everything. Jim fixes 
           his rearview mirror and smiles back at her.

                                 JIM
                        You’ve missed so much, kids...
                              (beat)
                        But there’s nothing we can’t get 
                        back.  Everything’s gonna be right 
                        as rain...

           He looks at them again in the rearview and smiles a wistful 
           smile.

           And then, just like that, they’re gone; a product of his 
           fevered mind...

           He drives on, silently.

           EXT. ADELAIDE REC. HALL -- LATER

           Jim pulls into the parking lot, crowded for a Thursday night.  
           The sign outside, lit up in dull-neon reads, “Games Center.”

           INT. ADELAIDE REC. HALL -- A HALF HOUR LATER

           Jim sits on a bench in the FOOD COURT drinking a soda. Behind 
           him, PINBALL MACHINES, SHOOTING GALLERIES, and BALL TOSSES 
           fight for floor space.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He watches families as they pass.  Seeming blissfully happy.

           He sees a TOWNIE hitting on a WAITRESS. She twirls her hair, 
           receptively.

           The Man’s SON plays with a yellow, TOY TRUCK; racing it along 
           the railing that separates the ARCADE from the DANCE FLOOR.

           Jim gives the boy a small smile and waves.  The kid doesn’t 
           notice him.  He keeps running with his truck.  Too far in 
           fact -- he quickly disappears into a crowd of people.

                                 JIM
                        Hey, kid!

           Jim looks over at the Father. He’s busy making out with the 
           Waitress. Jim gets up and races through the crowd.

           He looks left and right; the boy is nowhere to be found.

           Finally, he comes across him by the front exits.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Hey kiddo, you can’t go runnin’ off 
                        like that!

           Hearing Jim’s voice makes the boy realize he’s alone.  He 
           starts to cry.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, don’t worry! I know just where 
                        your daddy is!

           Jim gives the boy a hug and grabs his hand.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go find him...

           And as he tucks the tag sticking out of the boy’s shirt back 
           in, the child's father comes running up. 

                                 TOWNIE
                        Hey buddy, whattaya doin’?!

                                 JIM
                        I was just helping him find his 
                        parents.

                                 TOWNIE
                        Oh, I bet you were!

           He takes his son viciously back from Jim.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 JIM
                        Easy now, you’ll hurt him!

           He puts a hand of warning on the Man’s arm. The Man rips it 
           back, violently.

                                 TOWNIE
                        Get the fuck off me!

           He whirls around and punches Jim in the jaw. Jim lands amid 
           the flashing lights of the Arcade as the Townie stalks away 
           with his child.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- EARLY MORNING

           Jim Beaumont sits on a bench outside the booking area, 
           waiting.

           Nancy eventually comes in.  She takes the seat next to him.

           They sit there, silently. After a minute, she places a hand 
           on his knee. 

           He stares at it, blankly.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, FRONT DESK -- CONTINUOUS

           Harper stands watching them through the glass of the 
           Interrogation Room.  Dawson walks past.  He sees the 
           Beaumonts.

                                 DAWSON
                        What’a they doin’ here? Anything 
                        new happen?

           Harper shakes his head, resigned.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        A month later they were divorced.  
                        Mr. Beaumont moved out shortly 
                        after that.

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- PRESENT, DAY 2

           Harper recounts this part of the story with no obvious 
           relish.

                                 HARPER
                        I once asked Mrs. Beaumont why she 
                        never moved. Why she didn’t pick up 
                        and leave; just get out of town.  
                        You know what she said to me? She 
                        said--
           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- DAY, 1970'S

           Mrs. Beaumont sits on her couch talking to Harper in the 
           early years after the kidnapping. Harper’s words are her own:

                                 NANCY
                        What if they come home? What if 
                        they come home and we’re not there 
                        anymore?  Imagine how scared they’d 
                        be...

           EXT. HARDING STREET -- SOMEDAY

           Jane, Grant, and Arnna walk down the street.  They haven’t 
           aged a day...

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        ...like one day they’d round the 
                        corner of Harding Street and 
                        there’d be Jane with Grant and 
                        Arnna holding her hands so 
                        tightly...

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- BACK TO SCENE, DAY 2

           Harper continues, uninterrupted.

                                 HARPER
                        I didn’t understand it until years 
                        later...

           He tries to find the right words...

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        ...it is their unique tragedy that 
                        drives us to find the person 
                        responsible.  To make them pay.  
                              (beat)
                        To make them pay, dearly.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- AFTERNOON

           Harper sits by himself in the middle of an office party.  He 
           has a stupid hat on his head that reads, “Congratulations!”

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        In the fall, Billis stepped down 
                        and Dawson made Chief.

                        We had a party for him.

           By the punch bowl, a young, blonde-haired Cadet named CHASE 
           EBBING asks Nguyen for directions.  Nguyen points him towards 
           Harper.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        I got a new partner, a rookie by 
                        the name of Ebbing.

           Ebbing makes his way to Harper.

                                 EBBING
                        I am meeting a lot of new people 
                        and... boy!  They do not like you!

                                 HARPER
                        It’s mostly just one person, but he 
                        gets around.

                                 EBBING
                        Who is it?

           Harper takes a large sip of his drink.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re at his party.

                                 EBBING
                        Oh.
                              (gets it)
                        Ohhh! Well, I just wanna tell you 
                        I’m coming into this with my mind 
                        open.

           He looks around, then leans in.

                                 EBBING (CONT’D)
                        They told me you’re mostly 
                        interested in this one case... the 
                        Beaumonts.  You wanna tell me a 
                        little about it?

                                 HARPER
                        Look, I get that you’re eager and 
                        it’s good to have someone in my 
                        corna’ for once, but police work’s 
                        not what you see on television.  
                        Your generation got sold a bad bill 
                        of goods.  Proper police work’s in 
                        the details.  Rememba' that.

           Ebbing takes out his notepad and starts jotting. Harper 
           shakes his head, laughing, and walks away.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to write it down.

           Across the room, Dawson LAUGHS with a mouth full of cake and 
           beer. He’s surrounded by supporters.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        The years began to pass...  
                              (beat)
                        And for the better part of a 
                        decade, the leads stopped coming 
                        in.

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- DAY 2

           Liddy’s about to move on to her next question, but can’t.

                                 LIDDY
                        I noticed that dip in the timeline
                        too.  What do you think accounts 
                        for it?

                                 HARPER
                        Beats me...

                                 LIDDY
                        So, there was nothing... concrete
                        in all those years?  Nothing at 
                        all?

           Harper thinks about it.

                                 HARPER
                        Well, there was one thing...

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

           A middle-aged Man is crying. His name is DOUG RODGERS. Harper 
           and Ebbing uncomfortably watch him weep.

                                 DOUG
                        It was me - okay?!

                                 EBBING
                        It was you, what?

                                 DOUG
                        I was only thirteen at the time, 
                        but I take full responsibility.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Again... for what?

           He looks up at them, horrified at having to say it.

                                 DOUG
                        It was me who wrote the Beaumonts 
                        those letters.  The ones that told 
                        them to go to Dandenong...

           Harper’s half-smirk disappears. He explodes:

                                 HARPER
                        You what?!

           Doug holds up his hands, in case Harper decides to attack 
           him.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m so sorry! I have three kids of 
                        my own now and if anybody...

           He dissolves into sobs again. Harper SCREAMS at the top of 
           his lungs.

                                 HARPER
                        Do you have any idea what you’ve 
                        done?!

           He knocks over a chair and tears out of the room.

           INT. CHIEF’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Harper, having told Dawson, stands in front of the man's desk 
           waiting for a decision.

                                 HARPER
                        I think we should go to the press.

                        And why’s that?

                                 HARPER
                        Because we can now only account for 
                        the Beaumonts whereabouts until one 
                        a.m. the night after the 
                        kidnapping.

                        Says who? The nigger-bitch?

                        Yes Dawson, the black woman who saw 
                        Grant get grabbed.

                                 DAWSON
                        So what you’re saying is that there 
                        are no witnesses who saw the 
                        Beaumonts after nightfall?

                                 HARPER
                        I just told you – Karen Jones was 
                        walking home when--

           Dawson cuts him off with a wave of his fingers.  He's 
           thinking about something.

                                 DAWSON
                        You’re not gonna tell anyone about 
                        the thirteen year old.

                                 HARPER
                        What?! Why not?

                                 DAWSON
                        It gives people hope.  What makes 
                        people feel better: that the 
                        Beaumonts went missing that first 
                        day, or that their father left the 
                        state in a heroic quest to save 
                        them?

                                 HARPER
                        A matter of opinion really. I 
                        wouldn’t want to be lied to.

                                 DAWSON
                        Anyway, that’s the end of it.

                                 HARPER
                        Fine.  Alright if I go do my job 
                        now?

           He reaches for the doorknob.

                                 DAWSON
                        Yeah, about that... major crimes 
                        bureau is bursting as it is and

           He’s about to leave--

                        Oh, and Harper?

           He turns around.

                        What is it?

           Harper leaves, but not before slamming the door behind him.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- LATER

           Harper sits at his desk, fuming. Across the room, he sees 
           Ebbing leave Dawson’s office and waves him over.

                                 HARPER
                        What were you doing in there?

                                 EBBING
                        I told him I wasn’t goin’ anywhere 
                        without my partner.  Thought it was 
                        kind’a chivalrous of me. Anyway, 
                        thanks for the pay cut, asshole!

                                 HARPER
                        You just walked in and told him 
                        that?

                                 EBBING
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 HARPER
                        Nothing... I just would have loved 
                        to have seen his face.

                                 EBBING
                        He was livid.

           Harper grins.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re lucky you weren’t fired!

                                 EBBING
                        Not really.  My father’s on the 
                        town council.

           Harper puts a hand over his face and laughs so hard that 
           Dawson has to stick his head out of his office to see what 
           the commotion's about.

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH FRONT -- PRESENT, DAY 2

           It’s the afternoon after the second day of interviews. Liddy 
           again walks with Harper towards their cars.

           He does his best not to flirt with her.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        say that something’s off limits and 
                        you won’t use it, right?

                                 LIDDY
                        Of course.

                                 HARPER
                        Then just because I know you’re 
                        looking for the whole story... 
                        there’s something I think you 
                        should know.

                                 LIDDY
                        And what’s that?

                                 HARPER
                        I never really told anybody this, 
                        but when I was twelve I was 
                        kidnapped. I didn’t see my parents 
                        for sixteen weeks.

           Liddy slows down to a walk, eventually stopping altogether.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I finally escaped through a storm 
                        cellar vent.  Wandered for days... 
                        never could lead Police back to 
                        where I’d been.

           They arrive at the parking lot and lean against the wooden 
           railing separating beach and asphalt. Harper’s face turns 
           graver than it was before.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I think they’re still out there 
                        sometimes.
                              (beat)
                        Maybe that’s why I became a cop.

           He smiles a sad sort of smile.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Christ, I’m almost an old man and 
                        it still bothers me.

           He draws a hard breath and Liddy smirks, sympathetically.

                                 LIDDY
                        Tell you what – you still want that 
                        drink after all the interviews are 
                        over, I’d be glad to go.

           She nods.

                        Then it’s a date.

                                 LIDDY
                        You’re so old, no one says that 
                        anymore!

           Laughing, she gets in her car. He watches her drive off.

           EXT. WEST TORRENS RUBBISH DUMP -- AFTERNOON

           At the Southern boundary of ADELAIDE AIRPORT, single engine 
           aircrafts take off and land. Opposite the fence, at the end 
           of MORPHETT ROAD sits the West Torrens Rubbish Dump.

           In the first dumpster after the entrance, TIM ARNETT, a local 
           garbage man sifts through trash. Outside, another trash man, 
           NEIL LONSDALE, supports him by smoking a cigarette.

           Tim lifts what he’s been trying to pry free: an old, brown 
           SUITCASE.

                                 TIM
                        God, there’s tons of these – ten to 
                        one says they didn’t get permission 
                        to dump here.

           He heaves the briefcase out onto the ground.  It lands 
           several yards away – it's lock broken.

           With the top off, the contents, HUNDREDS of NEWSPAPER 
           CLIPPINGS, start blowing in the wind.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

           Harper and Ebbing dump the cutouts onto the table.  The ones 
           sent alight, flutter to the ground.  Every single article 
           pertains to the Beaumonts.  And each has been commented on in 
           RED INK by its former owner.

                                 EBBING
                        Jesus Christ...

           They go through them one-by-one. Harper’s the first to grab. 
           Over a byline that reads:  Beaumont Children; people hunt in 
           sandhills, someone has written “not in sandhills...”

           Ebbing’s next. The one he’s holding, featuring a picture of 
           Mrs. Beaumont on her way to the police station, has the words 
           “I understand” painted over it.

           They come fast and furious now: an article on the Dandenong
           Drop reads, “What a joke.”

           There’s a portrait of the kids taken a few weeks before the 
           kidnapping.  Over Jane’s picture: “She used to comb my 
           hair...”

           And when a Reporter quotes Nancy Beaumont as saying “I 
           believe I will see them again” the red writing responds with 
           a “no, no, no...”

           EXT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- DAY, 1986

           The once beautiful home has fallen into disrepair.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        At the same time across town, Mrs. 
                        Beaumont was vacuuming in the home 
                        the neighborhood kids had taken to 
                        calling "The Murder House."
           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Nancy, much worse for the wear, busies herself with spring 
           cleaning.

           In the background, the television’s turned on just for the 
           noise. She doesn’t notice when the News starts featuring an 
           “Anniversary Special” on the Beaumont kidnapping.

           Something gets caught in the VACUUM CLEANER.  She turns it 
           off to investigate, in time to hear a VOICE on her television 
           say--

                                 JILL NICHOLS (O.S.)
                        --It's been twenty long years since 
                        the Beaumont children went missing--

           Nancy twirls around and drops the Vacuum Cleaner. She hurries 
           to turn the set off.

           But when she gets there something stops her: they’re showing 
           an old picture of Jim from years earlier.  She smiles and 
           reaches for him, but the scene changes.

           Now it’s B-roll of the search of the Dunes.  JILL NICHOLS 
           speaks over it.

                                 JILL NICHOLS (V.O.)
                        Two decades ago, this beach front 
                        community showed up in droves to 
                        search for the Beaumont Children.  
                        Today their legend has fallen into 
                        the annals of folklore with parents 
                        warning their kids to be careful of 
                        strangers lest they end up like the 
                        Beaumonts--

           Nancy’s about to switch it off when, among the searchers, she 
           spots a mound of yellow hair.

                                 NANCY
                        Oh my God...

           Tears spring to her eyes. On the fringes of the crowd stands 
           a middle-aged Man.

           Gaunt. Tall. Blonde.

           His face is obscured by the poor quality film, but the 
           resemblance to Van Czar's SKETCH is uncanny.

           The feed from her television cuts seamlessly with--
           INT. CHANNEL 9 NEWSROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Rob Kelvin, with more than a little grey hair by now, reads 
           the Evening News.

                                 KELVIN
                        ...Thank you Jill, for that 
                        remarkable look back down memory 
                        lane. Coming up this hour: pet 
                        grooming tips and a North Adelaide 
                        teen is kidnapped within a mile of 
                        his own home--

           Kelvin falters.  His eyes have caught the IN-STUDIO MONITORS: 
           they’re focused on a house he knows all too well.  He trails 
           off...

                                 KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        Fuckin’ Christ...

           The STAGE DIRECTOR looks up from his clipboard when he hears 
           Kelvin curse. He follows Kelvin’s line of sight and sees the 
           Residence on display.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Oh God--
                              (waves to an underling)
                        Cut to a commercial! Cut to a 
                        commercial!

           He rushes to the news desk.

                                 KELVIN
                        Why is my house up there?! Can 
                        someone tell me that? Where’s 
                        Richard?!

           The Stage Director enters the television frame, trying to 
           assuage him--

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Rob, now calm down--

                                 KELVIN
                        --I’m not gonna calm down! Someone 
                        needs to tell me where the fuck my 
                        son is--

           They cut transmission.
           EXT. KELVIN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           POLICE UNITS and NEWS VANS cover the front lawn and clog the 
           street.  Rob Kelvin frantically runs towards his home, 
           shouting--

                                 KELVIN
                        Richie! Richie, come out!

           He gets as far as the POLICE LINE. He’s stopped by a SERGEANT 
           who calls for help. Kelvin still tries to push through.

           His wife hears him and runs out of the house.  He yells to 
           her--

                                 KELVIN (CONT’D)
                        Marcy! Where is he?!!

                                 MRS. KELVIN
                        He’s not here, Rob!

           Kelvin collapses against the Officer, refusing to accept it.

                                 KELVIN
                        Tell him to come out! Tell him his 
                        dad says come out!

           Marcy finally reaches her husband.  She takes him from the 
           Cop.  Once Rob's in her arms, he loses all composure.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE OFFICE, BRIEFING ROOM -- DAY

           CLOSE on a PIXILATED GLOSSY of the Beaumont suspect. Dawson 
           passes it around.

                                 DAWSON
                        This was messenger’d over this 
                        morning.

                        What am I looking at?

                        I’ll tell you what you’re lookin’
                        at – that woman found something we 
                        all missed.

                                 HARPER
                        This is what Mrs. Beaumont saw?!

                        clear as they can get it.

           Harper eyes it up and down. Dawson turns to Nguyen.

                                 DAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Anything new in the Kelvin case?

                                 NGUYEN
                        Witnesses saw the kid with two men 
                        late Saturday night – one 
                        unidentified, the other known 
                        around town as Bevan Spencer Von 
                        Einem.

           Harper perks up.

                                 HARPER
                        Von Einem?

                                 NGUYEN
                        Yeah, you know him?

                                 HARPER
                        He’s been in here before.  Almost 
                        positive.  Real creepy guy.

                                 DAWSON
                        Well, let’s bring him in and see 
                        how creepy he really is.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- LATER

           The Station House's officers, secretaries, and operators are 
           hard at work, everyone going about their business.

           Then the front doors open and everything comes to a stand-
           still as...

           Nguyen leads a clean-cut suspect inside. The man is dressed 
           to the nines in a new tuxedo.  He's skinny with dirty blonde 
           hair.

                                 HARPER (V.O.)
                        When Von Einem was brought in, I 
                        thought, ‘this is it... we caught 
                        him.’

           VON EINEM glides through the station like a ghost. Nguyen 
           steers him towards a holding room.

           They pass Harper and for the briefest of seconds Von Einem 
           and he lock eyes.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        He was the absolute most dangerous 
                        man I had ever seen in a bow tie.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM -- MINUTES LATER

           Across the hall, Von Einem waits in the Interrogation Room, 
           hands folded.  People keep sneaking looks at him.  He doesn’t 
           seem to notice.

                                 EBBING
                        Why’s he all dressed up?

                                 NGUYEN
                        Cruisa’ picked him up at his house. 
                        Get this: he was throwin’ a Ball.  
                        Richest people in Adelaide were 
                        there.  Cooper even said he saw the 
                        Mayor!

                                 EBBING
                        What’s a guy like that doin' in a 
                        place like this?

                                 NGUYEN
                        Apparently, Harper was right. This 
                        isn’t the first time he’s been 
                        here.

           EXT. GAJ-A-ROO DANCE HALL -- LATE NIGHT, 1972

           An effeminate young male gets slapped around by two middle-
           aged Country-types.

                                 NGUYEN (V.O.)
                        1972. He sees two men beatin' up a 
                        homo outside a dance hall, who they 
                        then throw off a bridge.

           Von Einem sees them from across the street and calls out:

                                 VON EINEM
                        Hey!  What are you doin?!

           He realizes they’re about to heave the boy off the ledge and 
           books it across the street.

           By the time he reaches them, the victim has been tossed and 
           the perps have run away.  

           Without wasting a moment, Von Einem goes in after the boy.
           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM -- BACK TO SCENE

           Nguyen motions to the Interrogation Room.

                                 NGUYEN
                        Von Einem there jumps in to save 
                        the boy!  Or at least tries – kid 
                        drowned. Swept out to sea.

                                 HARPER
                        Nguyen, let me ask you something – 
                        they ever find those two men?

           Nguyen scans the case file.

                                 NGUYEN
                        No, somethin’ about a partial on a 
                        getaway car but... no, nothing.  
                        Why?  What are you thinking?

           Harper leans back in his chair.

           EXT. GAJ-A-ROO DANCE HALL -- SAME NIGHT, 1972

           Von Einem flirts heavily with the same boy.  The kid keeps 
           refusing his advances.  Von Einem tugs on his jeans.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Come on, don't pretend you weren't 
                        eyein' me in there...

           The boy pushes him off--

                                 BOY
                        Are you deaf, old man? I said quit 
                        it!

                                 VON EINEM
                        Hey, be nice...

                                 BOY
                        You don't read signs real well. You 
                        make me sick - who would wanna fuck 
                        you?!

           He turns around to leave as Von Einem’s smile fades. He 
           fishes a leather BILLYCLUB out of his pocket and whacks the 
           boy where skull meets spine.  He collapses. 

           Von Einem hitches him up and over the bridge and watches as 
           the body falls into the sea.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Then, hearing concerned voices from down the street, he makes 
           a split decision -- and jumps in after the boy.

           Harper answers Nguyen’s question.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m thinking someone like that 
                        doesn’t hear “no” very often.

                                 EBBING
                        But why would he save the boy?

                        His alibi was good enough for the 
                        cops back in ’72.  How come you 
                        gotta read into everything? Create 
                        new crimes?

                                 HARPER
                        You really wanna know?

                                 NGUYEN
                        Yeah.

                        Not particularly, why?

           Harper throws Mrs. Beaumont's PIXILATED PHOTO across the 
           table. Nguyen takes one look at it.

                                 NGUYEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’s a stretch!

           Ebbing takes the photo from him.

                                 EBBING
                        Wow! I don’t know – I think it’s 
                        pretty spot-on!

                        Look, it’s fine with me. But if

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- MINUTES LATER

           Harper joins Nguyen inside.  Nguyen nervously looks around 
           for Dawson as Harper lowers the blinds.

           Von Einem thinks it’s an intimidation ploy.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Nice touch.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, we haven’t even started yet.

           He pulls out a leather-bound BOOK.  It’s just been made; 
           containing LAMINATED COPIES of the suitcase cut-out ARTICLES. 

           He shows it to Von Einem.  The Man with dirty-blonde hair 
           flips through it with mild interest.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Someone loves to scrapbook...

           His voice is cold.  Emotionless.  Slightly electric.

           Harper watches him turn the pages.  His hands are smooth and 
           dainty, yet under each nail lies a string of dirt.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you familiar with Rob Kelvin?

                                 VON EINEM
                        The man from my television?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes.  His son is missing.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you aware that Richard Kelvin 
                        was a member of the homosexual 
                        community?

                                 VON EINEM
                        You don’t say...

                                 HARPER
                        We’ve been told you were in his 
                        company the night before last.

                                 VON EINEM
                        I’m afraid you’ll have to be more 
                        specific, I’m in a lot of people’s 
                        company... so to speak.

                                 HARPER
                        It would have been a twenty-two 
                        year old white male with brown 
                        hair.

           Von Einem raises his eyebrow.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Bit young, don’t you think?

                                 HARPER
                        Not for some people, I suppose.

                                 VON EINEM
                        I don’t go out much anymore, 
                        Inspector.  People tend to come to 
                        me.  I’m quite popular like that.  
                        I used to be real, real good 
                        looking when I was younger.  My 
                        hair used to be blonde and full.  
                        It’s... kind of dulled with age.  
                        But there’s a sort of dignity to 
                        that, wouldn’t you agree?

                                 HARPER
                        So you’re saying you weren’t out on 
                        Saturday Night?

                        No.

           Harper leans in.

                                 HARPER
                        Do the names Grant, Arnna, and Jane

                        They sound like old names.  As if 
                        the people they belong to are dead.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Harper and Ebbing argue in the hallway.

                                 HARPER
                        We have nothing – just hearsay.  We 
                        gotta cut him loose.

                                 EBBING
                        You can’t just let him go! He’s 
                        gonna go out and do it again! Maybe 
                        this time it’ll be somebody you 
                        care about!

                                 HARPER
                        That's not fair!

                                 EBBING
                        Come on, Harper!  The West Torrens 
                        Police even make him for three 
                        unsolved kidnappings!

                                 HARPER
                        Look! No one thinks he’s guiltier 
                        than me. But I watched Dawson act 
                        with reckless abandon for fifteen 
                        years and I did nothing.  When I 
                        catch this guy, it’ll be legal and 
                        it’ll stick.

           They’re interrupted by a bald, middle-aged man standing right 
           next to them.

                                 HARPER
                        Can I help you?

                        You are holding a Mr. Von Einem

                        And what’s that?

                                 MR. B
                        He’s a very dangerous man.

           INT. HOLDING ROOM -- SOON AFTER

           MR. B sits across from Harper and Ebbing.

                                 MR. B
                        I never took part in anything.  I 
                        want that clear right now. I knew 
                        Von Einem, but we weren’t friends.  
                        We just happen to have... similar 
                        interests.

                                 EBBING
                        We don’t need to hear about that.

                                 MR. B
                        It’s relevant.  One night he starts 
                        tellin' me he’s the one who 
                        kidnapped the Beaumonts; 
                                 (MORE)

                        that he did some brilliant surgery 
                        on them and connected 'em up.  And 
                        that one of them had died. He used 
                        to brag a lot, but I believed this.  
                        He knew... too much.

                                 EBBING
                        Why should we believe you?

                                 MR. B
                        Because I was with him when he 
                        kidnapped Richard Kelvin.

           INT. DISCO TROPIC -- LAST SATURDAY, LATE NIGHT

           RICHARD KELVIN, 22, sits drugged, propped up between two 
           questionable men; the thudding electric forbears of early 
           disco moaning in the background.

                                 MR. B
                        Our friend is falling asleep...

           Von Einem drags a dirty fingernail across the boy’s cheek.

                        Wake up, little prince!

           INT. HOLDING ROOM -- BACK TO SCENE

           Harper shakes his head, unconvinced.

                                 HARPER
                        My partner’s right.  Why should we 
                        believe you?

                                 MR. B
                        He also said he picked up two kids 
                        at the Oval.

                                 HARPER
                        He what?!

                        Come on, Harper – let’s go.  He’s 
                        probably some derro who wandered in 
                        off the street; read a newspaper 
                        and thinks he’s god’s gift or 
                        something!

                        that he's your man, then I’d say 
                        you weren’t far off.

           Out in the hallway, Harper sees Dawson coming.

                                 HARPER
                        Please! Do you have anything else 
                        that might help us?!

           Mr. B takes the longest of pauses.  Finally he opens his 
           mouth.

                                 MR. B
                        He said he dumped the bodies in the 
                        Myponga.

           EXT. MYPONGA RESERVOIR -- DAY

           High up on a walkway: Harper, Rob Kelvin and a MOBILE COMMAND 
           UNIT watch as down below SPECIAL TASK AND RESCUE Officers 
           drag the bottom of the lake.

           EXT. MYPONGA RESERVOIR (UNDERWATER) -- CONTINUOUS

           Beneath the PATROL BOATS a DIVER excavates for any signs of 
           past life.  He brushes silt and debris from the base of the 
           dam floor.  It sends little dust clouds up into the murky 
           water.

           Finally, his brush catches on something: a handle.  He digs 
           deeper and finds it’s attached to a METAL SUITCASE.

           The Diver pulls it out and tries to lift it.  But it proves 
           too heavy.  He lets go and surfaces.

           EXT. MYPONGA RESERVOIR -- CONTINUOUS

           The Diver tears his face mask off and CALLS UP to the Mobile 
           Command Unit:

                                 DIVER
                        I found something! Lower the 
                        pulley!

           Next to Harper, a TOW TRUCK backs up to the railing's edge 
           and begins to lower its high-tensile wire.

           When it reaches the bottom, the Diver hooks the clasp onto 
           the Suitcase's Metal Handle.  He signals for them to retract 
           the pulley and they do.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The Case lifts free of the water and bangs against the dam 
           wall on its way up. It makes a horrible scraping noise.

           But the weight is too much for the waterlogged case and the 
           lock snaps...

           The BODY of a dead 22-YEAR-OLD is suspended in mid-air for 
           the briefest of seconds.

           Rob Kelvin breaks for the railing to get a better look.  He 
           sees unhealed surgery scars and sloppy stitch-work.

           The body almost looks like it’s in one piece, but then 
           gravity takes over and the separated limbs each go in a 
           different direction; falling into the depths below.

           Kelvin drops to his knees, trying desperately to catch his 
           breath.

           EXT. BANK OF THE MYPONGA -- MUCH LATER

           Special Task and Rescue have found and reassembled the 
           various body parts pulled from the water.  They now lie under 
           a blanket on the sandy bank of the Reservoir.

           Harper leads Kelvin towards it.

                                 HARPER
                        I know this is horrible, but we 
                        need you to identify your son.  If 
                        you do it now you won’t have to 
                        come back and do it later. I 
                        promise.  And we really do need to 
                        know.  They’re only going to show 
                        you the face, okay?

           Kelvin doesn’t make a noise, just stares at the sheet that 
           separates him from the corpse.  Harper takes his silence as 
           compliance.  He motions for the MEDICAL EXAMINER to lift the 
           sheet.

           Rob Kelvin looks at his son.  Sees the blood from deeper down 
           under the sheet... sees the dent in the back of his head...

                                 KELVIN
                        Oh my God...

           He vomits into the sand.
           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, HARPER’S DESK -- AFTERNOON

           Harper stares at all the accrued EVIDENCE of the BEAUMONT 
           KIDNAPPING, ADELAIDE OVAL ABDUCTION, and RICHARD KELVIN 
           MURDER piled on his desk.  

           He almost falls asleep when Ebbing rushes over excited.

                                 EBBING
                        You’re gonna love me!

                                 HARPER
                        What happened?

                                 EBBING
                        I had a feeling, so I checked it 
                        out.  Guess what Nguyen just told 
                        me?

                                 HARPER
                        Ebbing you're givin' me a nervous 
                        disorder - what is it?

                                 EBBING
                        At the time the Beaumonts went 
                        missing, Von Einem was windin' his 
                        way up through Adelaide.

           Harper runs a hand through his hair, exhausted.

                                 HARPER
                        Jesus, that puts three of the worst 
                        criminal sociopaths Australia’s 
                        ever seen – in or around the 
                        Adelaide area at the time the 
                        Beaumonts went missing.

                                 EBBING
                        Must’a been a convention...

                                 HARPER
                        You’re not funny. Look, I wanna go 
                        back – recheck everything.  What 
                        did our mystery witness say? There 
                        was more than one person involved? 
                        Run down the suspects.

                                 EBBING
                        You know its Von Einem! He--

           They’re interrupted.  Dawson storms in waving a folder.

                        On the cut-outs? We catch a break?

                                 DAWSON
                        The majority of them belong to 
                        Hazel Abbey, 83. She lives in the 
                        West Torrens.

                                 HARPER
                        Majority?  There are others?

                                 DAWSON
                        You mean besides yours and Ebbings?

                        Oh, don’t even start with that!

                                 DAWSON
                        It would make a lot of sense...

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, and pigs may fly and you 
                        might get a date--

                                 DAWSON
                        --I’m serious!

                                 HARPER
                        So am I!

                                 DAWSON
                        Then you should have thought about 
                        proper procedure!

                                 HARPER
                        Like you have?  You know exactly 
                        what you’re doing, Dawson!

           Ebbing, dazed, stares at the cutouts on Harper’s desk.

                                 EBBING
                        How can they dust all of these?

           Dawson throws the file at him.

                                 DAWSON
                        It’s called police work.  You’d 
                        know if you were any fuckin’ good 
                        at your job!

                        I’ve told you so many times – it’s 
                        little shit like this that makes a 
                        case.  The details!

           Dawson walks out in a huff.  Hearing Harper’s own words 
           thrown back at him by Dawson, Ebbing starts to smile.

                                 HARPER
                              (to Ebbing)
                        Don’t you even dare!

           Ebbing wipes the smirk off his face and looks at the case 
           file Dawson threw at him.

                                 EBBING
                        It’s worth exploring this Hazel 
                        woman: she lives only a couple 
                        blocks from where Karen Jones saw 
                        Grant get grabbed.

           EXT. HAZEL ABBEY RESIDENCE -- NIGHT

           Harper and Ebbing walk up the front path to Hazel’s house.  
           They're met by her daughter, WANDA, 49.

                                 WANDA
                        Officers...

                                 EBBING
                        Are you the daughter?  Mrs. Abbey?

                                 WANDA
                        It’s Mayhew, actually, I got 
                        married.  I’m sorry you had to come 
                        all the way out here.  My husband 
                        and I were trying to clean up for 
                        her.  We had no idea what was in 
                        those briefcases.

                                 HARPER
                        That's alright.  May we talk to 
                        your mother?

                                 WANDA
                        Absolutely, she’s in the den.

           Wanda leads them inside.

           INT. HAZEL ABBEY RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS

           HAZEL sits watching Jeopardy with the PATROL OFFICERS that 
           got there before Harper.  He waves them off.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        Thanks, boys.  We’ve got it from 
                        here.

           They look a little disappointed to go. One even leans in to 
           shake her hand.

                                 OFFICER
                        Alright Hazel, we’re gonna go now.  
                        You take care and I’ll make sure I 
                        give my wife that Apple Crumble 
                        recipe.

                                 HAZEL
                        Good, my best to the kids!

           The Officer smiles and he and his partner leave.  On their 
           way out they glare at Harper.  They're Dawson's Men. 

           Harper and Ebbing take their place. Wanda grabs a seat next 
           to her mother.

                                 HARPER
                        Mrs. Abbey, my name is Inspector 
                        Harper and this is my partner, 
                        Constable Ebbing – do you mind if 
                        we ask you a couple questions?

                                 HAZEL
                        I know why you’re here! Now, can I 
                        have my suitcases back?

                                 EBBING
                        Can you have your suitcases back?!

                                 HAZEL
                        Yes, they’re mine and I want them 
                        back!

                                 EBBING
                        Ma'am, do you have any idea how 
                        much trouble you’ve caused this 
                        department just by doodlin’ on your 
                        clippings?

                                 HAZEL
                        Oh, those aren’t mine.  They’re my 
                        tenants.  Lived downstairs, noisy 
                        fella – up all hours of the night.

           Wanda puts a comforting hand on her mother’s arm.

                        about, she’s lived alone for the 
                        past twenty years.

                                 HARPER
                        And before that?

                                 HAZEL
                              (to Wanda)
                        It was while you were in college – 
                        just for a few months, just to get 
                        some spendin’ money.  I had bills, 
                        unfair bills, and I’m not sorry.

           Harper already has his notepad out.

                                 HARPER
                        And this was in January of ’66?

                                 WANDA
                        If it was my first year at Uni it’d 
                        have to be.
                              (then, to Hazel)
                        Mother, are you sure about this?

                                 HAZEL
                        I’m not stupid!  I got cataracts 
                        and a fake hip, but I’m not stupid. 
                        He kept the door locked mostly, not 
                        that I climbed down those stairs 
                        often. But he seemed to like his 
                        privacy and I left him to it.

           EXT. HAZEL ABBEY RESIDENCE -- MINUTES LATER

           Harper and Ebbing take a moment outside.

                                 EBBING
                        Why would moneybags back at the 
                        station rent a downstairs flat from 
                        an old lady in one of the poorest 
                        districts in South Australia? It 
                        doesn’t add up.

                                 HARPER
                        Sure it does – privacy.

                                 EBBING
                        You’re thinking it’s a kill room?

                                 HARPER
                        Would make sense...

                        Let’s let ‘em loose; they never get 
                        a chance to play.

           INT. ABBEY RESIDENCE, BASEMENT -- LATER

           The number of officers at the house has increased 
           exponentially. 

           Members of the FORENSICS TEAM have camped out in the 
           Basement. They search, dusting handrails and flat surfaces 
           looking for latent prints.

           To one side a LAB RAT black-lights for any signs of semen or 
           blood splatter.

           Harper flags one of them down.

                                 HARPER
                        Any luck?

                        Nothing yet.  Just a couple 
                        cocktail napkins.  Shirt tags.

                                 HARPER
                        You think you're gonna find

                        Depends.

                                 HARPER
                        On what?

                        Surfaces... on a nonporous, dry 
                        surface a print can last for years. 
                        But who knows...

                                 HARPER
                        Alright, let me know if something 
                        comes up.

           INT. ADELAIDE AIRPORT -- MORNING

           Nancy waits anxiously for a plane to arrive.  She cranes to 
           see the face of every person who walks through the terminal.  
           They’re not him.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Finally, she sees who she's looking for.  It's Jim, his face 
           haggard and long.  When he catches sight of her he smiles, 
           then just as suddenly, the smile fades.

           Nancy waves and runs to him, but stops about five feet away.

                                 NANCY
                        Hi...

                                 JIM
                        Hi.

                                 NANCY
                        Long flight?

                                 JIM
                        The time flew by.

           They hug.  Nancy closes her eyes. Jim drops his bag to hold 
           her tighter.

           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE -- LATER

           An all too familiar scene, though it’s been years: Harper 
           sits in front of the Beaumonts on their couch.

                                 HARPER
                        You don’t know how good it is to 
                        see you two again.
                              (beat)
                        I just wish it was under betta' 
                        circumstances...

           His words seem to hang in the air.

                                 JIM
                        So we’re here... both of us.  What 
                        did you have to say?

           They steal themselves for bad news.

                                 HARPER
                        Rob Kelvin’s son was kidnapped.

                                 NANCY
                        I saw on the news.

                                 HARPER
                        We had a witness who said a man 
                        named Bevan Von Einem was the last 
                        one to be seen with him.  Two days 
                        ago we found Richard Kelvin in the 
                        Myponga.  His body was...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Harper hates that he started this.

                                 JIM
                        His body was what?

                                 HARPER
                        The body was cut open and...

           He chickens out again. Nancy blurts out:

                                 NANCY
                        Just fucking say it!

                                 HARPER
                        It was operated on.  Cut open and 
                        sewn back together.

                                 JIM
                        And what does this have to do with 
                        us?

                                 HARPER
                        The witness said that Von Einem 
                        also bragged about taking your 
                        kids... and that he did the same to 
                        them.

           Jim and Nancy meet the news with silence.  Harper continues, 
           just trying to fill the space.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        ...and it’s my belief that he’s 
                        telling the truth.  That Von 
                        Einem’s our man.

                                 JIM
                        Who’s it that told you this?

                                 HARPER
                        He only came forward on the 
                        condition he remain anonymous.

                                 JIM
                        Well, how much do you really know 
                        about this witness – I mean, he 
                        could be the guy you’re lookin’
                        for, for all you know!

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t think so.  You know me – I 
                        would never come to you if I wasn’t 
                        almost a hundred percent sure.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 NANCY
                        Well, thank you.

           She gets up and leads him to the door.

                                 HARPER
                        Goodbye, you two. He'll be 
                        arraigned next Thursday, if you'd 
                        like to come.

                                 NANCY
                        Will your partner be there?  I 
                        never did like him...

                                 HARPER
                        No one does, ma'am.  I got a new 
                        partner actually.  You can meet him 
                        if you like.

                                 NANCY
                        I would like that.  It was good to 
                        see you, Geoffrey.

           She kisses him on the cheek.  Harper blushes.  He leaves and 
           Nancy closes the door behind him.  She leans against it. 
           Jim's still seated, his fists in front of his mouth.

                                 JIM
                        So that’s it...

                                 NANCY
                        You know it’s not him.

                                 JIM
                        How do I know that?

                                 NANCY
                        Because I still feel the way I do – 
                        something would change... I’m never 
                        gonna feel right again, but I can 
                        feel just and that’s seemin’ more 
                        and more like it’s never gonna 
                        happen!

           She furiously starts to shake her head--

                                 NANCY (CONT’D)
                        It’s never gonna be over, Jim!

           She storms out of the room.  Jim tries to grab her hand, but 
           she yanks it away.
           INT. BEAUMONT HOUSE, BEDROOM -- LATER

           Jim looks around to see if Nancy’s nearby.  She’s not.

           He opens the CLOSET DOORS and kneels down.  Leaning forward, 
           he pulls a SHOEBOX out from deep in the back.  He takes the 
           top off.

           Inside, there’s a REVOLVER with STRAY BULLETS lining the 
           bottom. They bang around haphazardly against the sides.

           Jim loads the gun and hides it in his belt.  He pulls his 
           shirt down over it and shuts the closet doors.

           EXT. HEMINGHILL APARTMENTS -- MORNING

           It’s raining out as Harper leaves his apartment building. He 
           goes to pop his trench coat collar when he’s suddenly 
           inundated by a horde of REPORTERS.

                                 JILL NICHOLS
                        Inspector Harper, what’s your 
                        comment about “The Family Murders?”

                                 HARPER
                        The what?

                                 REPORTER # 1
                        How long have you known there was 
                        more than one suspect?

                                 HARPER
                        Who told you that?

                                 REPORTER # 2
                        Is it true?

                                 HARPER
                        No comment -- now make a hole!

           He pushes his way through them to get to his car.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM -- LATER

           Dawson is incensed--

                                 DAWSON
                        The family murders?  Well,

           CONTINUED:
                                 DAWSON (CONT'D)
                        Now every ‘Joe Bloggs’ on the 
                        street’s gonna think that all the 
                        serial killers in Oz are operatin’
                        within a secret, well-funded 
                        organization – that they know each 
                        other and have tea and shit!

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t know what to say, Dawson. 
                        It was one angle we were lookin’
                        at.  I have no idea how they found 
                        out.

                                 DAWSON
                        I do.  Someone in your department 
                        thought he’d make a quick buck and 
                        give the press a jump on a story--

                                 HARPER
                        --Look, no one – no one! – in
                        ‘special cases’ would do that!

                                 DAWSON
                        Get a hold of your department 
                        Harper or I’ll find someone who 
                        can! In the meantime, I wouldn’t 
                        buy any new furniture – you 
                        probably won’t be around much 
                        longer to enjoy it.

           He slams the door. Harper YELLS after him:

                                 HARPER
                        Asshole!

           He turns to Ebbing.  There's a grave look on his face.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You alright?

                                 EBBING
                        I think... I think this is all my 
                        fault.

                                 HARPER
                        What?

                                 EBBING
                        I might have told my father what we 
                        were workin' on.

                                 HARPER
                        Why would you do that?!

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        He’s interested in my life – he 
                        checks up on me!

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t believe you didn’t tell me 
                        this! I mean, with Dawson in the 
                        room?! I lied right to his face!

                                 EBBING
                        I’m sorry.

                        I vouched for you!  Fuck--  

           He stands up and furiously kicks his chair across the room.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You will make this better.

                                 EBBING
                        Absolutely.

                                 HARPER
                        You can start by digging up 
                        anything you can on Von Einem’s 
                        past.  He goes to trial tomorrow 
                        and he is not walking.  Do you hear 
                        me?!  The barrister’s office needs 
                        all the help they can get.

           He steps in close to Ebbing.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Look, you fucked us.  You know 
                        that.  But work hard.  Work fast.  
                        If I know Dawson he’s trying to pin 
                        this on us right now. If you’re 
                        quick you might be able to clear us 
                        both.

           INT. PURNELL’S PUB ON LEFEVRE -- THURSDAY, MID-MORNING

           Jim drinks hard, trying to psych himself up.  The patrons 
           give him a wide berth.  They know who he is.

           He orders another drink and is joined by an unexpected 
           visitor: Rob Kelvin timidly sits down.

           Beaumont stares at him.  Kelvin looks just as old and as 
           tired as he does.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           So Jim goes back to his beer as Kelvin orders one for 
           himself.

           And they sit there.  The grieving... waiting...

           EXT. ADELAIDE COURTHOUSE -- NOON

           Harper stands at a PAY-TELEPHONE KIOSK.  He dials a number.  
           After a second of ringing, Ebbing answers.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m at the courthouse.  They’re 
                        bringing Von Einem in right now.

           Behind him a POLICE GUARD escorts Von Einem up the Courthouse 
           steps.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Where are you? You were supposed to 
                        be here an hour ago...

                                 EBBING
                        You told me to make it right and 
                        that’s what I’m doing. I went back 
                        to Von Einem’s house and looked 
                        around a bit. Somethin' was 
                        bothering me and I think I was 
                        right. I got a contact from his 
                        rolodex that’s got no heading.  
                        It’s in the West Torrens, near the 
                        airport.  It might be nothing, but 
                        then again it might be something.

                                 HARPER
                        No that’s good, follow up on that.

                                 EBBING
                        I will.  What are you doin’?

           Harper turns and watches Von Einem scale the stairs.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m tyin' up loose ends.

           INT. ADELAIDE COURTHOUSE, LOBBY -- LATER

           Jim and Nancy walk in the front door of the Lobby.  

           At the SECURITY CHECKPOINT the Officer seems to recognize 
           them.  He barely pats them down, bowing his head shamefully 
           the entire time. He lets them pass.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Nancy walks towards the Courtroom only to notice Jim’s not 
           with her.  She turns around.  He’s five feet away, acting 
           strange.

                                 JIM
                        I’m gonna use the toilet.

                                 NANCY
                        Okay. I’ll be in there.

           He nods and goes into the bathroom.

           INT. ADELAIDE COURTHOUSE, BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Jim walks in and stares hard into the mirror above the sinks. 
           After a moment, he unbuttons his shirt and rips the REVOLVER 
           out of its hiding spot: taped in his armpit.

           He peels the rest of the tape off the gun, then shoves it 
           into his jacket pocket.

           Buttoning his shirt back up, he splashes cold water on his 
           face.

           INT. ADELAIDE COURTHOUSE, HOLDING ROOM -- MINUTES LATER

           Von Einem is placed in a cage.  Nearby, a door leads straight 
           into the COURTROOM.  Harper enters through it.  He shows his 
           credentials to the GUARDS on duty.

                                 HARPER
                        I have a couple questions for the 
                        detainee.

                                 GUARD
                        Feel free.  He’s not goin’
                        anywhere.

           Harper pulls up a chair.

                                 HARPER
                        You know why I’m here.

                                 VON EINEM
                        I’ve said all I have to say about 
                        the Kelvin boy.

                                 HARPER
                        This is about the Beaumonts.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Oh... them.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 HARPER
                        Yes, them.  Let’s cut to it.  
                        You’re already going to jail--

                                 VON EINEM
                        --That’s not what my barrister 
                        says...

                                 HARPER
                        You’re not on trial for something 
                        you did back in ’66.  No one even 
                        remembers that far back, do they? 
                        They don’t even care...
                              (beat)
                        But I gotta know.  I’ve put too 
                        many hours into this not to.

                                 VON EINEM
                        And I talk and you go and tell the 
                        judge just what I’ve said.

                                 HARPER
                        It would be my word against yours.  
                        And if that’s all it took, I’d lie 
                        right now; say you poured your 
                        heart out to me. But no matter what 
                        your defender says, you are going 
                        to jail today.  Probably for the 
                        rest of your life.
                              (beat)
                        So what it comes down to is two 
                        parents have an itch they can’t 
                        scratch.  An itch that only goes 
                        away with the satisfaction of truly 
                        knowing what happened to their 
                        kids.  And then there’s me... who’s 
                        just dying to find out if I was 
                        right.

           Harper leans in.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        So was I?

           Von Einem smiles slightly.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Think about all the attention you’d 
                        get.  They’ll write about you for 
                        years.  They won’t be able to 
                        mention the Beaumont name without 
                        saying “kidnapped by Bevan Von 
                        Einem” after it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Bevan nods, grimly.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Murdered by...

           Harper hides the surprise well.

                                 HARPER
                        They all dead?

                                 VON EINEM
                        I did my best.
                              (beat)
                        It took quite a while.

           Harper masks a small tremor in his throat.

                                 HARPER
                        And it was you who took them from 
                        Glenelg?

           Von Einem smiles again.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Who else would it have been?

           Harper leans back. The truth, finally...

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you.

           He gets up and walks away; a sad look of accomplishment on 
           his face.  Von Einem calls after him:

                                 VON EINEM
                        Yeah, but I didn’t tell you how I 
                        did it!  Don’t you wanna hear about 
                        that?

           Harper keeps walking.

                                 VON EINEM (CONT’D)
                        How I watched them for weeks... how 
                        I got ‘em off the beach?!
                              (beat)
                        What I did back at my apartment?!

           Harper’s almost out the door.

                                 VON EINEM (CONT’D)
                        ...how I sent their parents letters 
                        about it?!

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

           Harper stops in his tracks. He turns around and walks quickly 
           back to the cage.

                                 HARPER
                        What did you say?

                                 VON EINEM
                        Letters.  I sent them letters 
                        detailing every horrible thing I 
                        ever did to their children--

                                 HARPER
                        --I don't believe it.  You lied? 
                        You lied about everything?

                                 VON EINEM
                        No. I took them.

           Von Einem's panicked.  Harper fights off exhausted tears.

                                 HARPER
                        If these bars weren’t here, you’d 
                        be dead already.

           He sets off walking back towards the Courtroom.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Is that a threat? I’m sure my 
                        counsel would love to hear about 
                        that!

           He motions at the Guards.

                                 VON EINEM (CONT’D)
                        And there are witnesses here, too!

           One of the Guards looks up from his Newspaper.

                                 GUARD
                        I didn’t hear shit.

           INT. ADELAIDE COURTHOUSE, LOBBY -- DAY

           Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont wait with everyone else for the trial 
           to begin. 

           Jim’s hand is in his pocket, clutching the revolver...

           The sound of anticipation in the courtroom is near deafening.  
           Harper comes over to tell them of Von Einem’s innocence.

           We can’t hear a word of it.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Once Harper says what he came to say, Mrs. Beaumont crumples 
           against her ex-husband. To catch her, Jim takes his hand out 
           of his pocket.

           Gunless.

           There, in the middle of the all those people - cradling the 
           only piece left of his ruined life –- he finally cries.

           EXT. DELANCEY STREET, WEST TORRENS -- SAME TIME

           Ebbing KNOCKS on the door of an abandoned house.  It looks 
           like no one’s lived there in years.

           Thus, no one answers. He cups his hands and looks in through 
           the dusty windows.  Still nothing.

           He KNOCKS AGAIN. More of the same.

           He looks around the back and side, leaning over the chipped-
           paint picket fence.  He’s determined to find something...

           So determined, he doesn’t even notice when Meredith rounds 
           the corner behind him with a bag of groceries.  When she sees 
           Ebbing, she slinks back behind a nearby hedge.

           Fed up, he calls out one last time:

                                 EBBING
                        Hello?!

           There's no answer as unbeknownst to him the trunk door of his 
           HATCHBACK opens.  The tail end of a person crawls in and the 
           door silently closes behind them.

           Ebbing gets tired of looking.  He takes one final appraisal 
           of the House, then gets into his car and drives off.

           Some ways down the road, the car skids to a stop and swerves 
           across the road.

           A moment passes.  And someone gets out.  

           It’s too far away to see who it is.

           EXT. WEST TORRENS, ROADSIDE -- LATER

           Harper screeches up in his Squad Car.  He jumps out and runs 
           to where his fellow OFFICERS are milling around Ebbing's CAR 
           ACCIDENT.  One of the Officers sees him and tries to hold him 
           off-- 

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 OFFICER
                        --No, Harper you don't wanna see 
                        this--

           But it's too late. He catches sight of Ebbing, dead against 
           the steering wheel, his throat slit. Harper immediately 
           throws a hand up to cover his face. It takes him a minute to 
           find words...

                                 HARPER
                        What happened?

           Dawson answers.  He walks up behind Harper.

                                 DAWSON
                        Someone was waiting for him.  In 
                        the car.  The superficial wounds 
                        are from the crash.
                              (beat)
                        What's he doing in the West 
                        Torrens, Harper?

                                 HARPER
                        I asked him... he was tracking down 
                        a lead for me.  I thought it was 
                        nothing...

                                 DAWSON
                        Yeah?  Well you were right for once 
                        in your pathetic life.  A neighbor 
                        saw him pulling away from the white 
                        house on the corner.  County 
                        records say the house belongs to 
                        Meredith Craig.  That name ring a 
                        bell?

           Harper's mouth goes slack as Dawson steps up to speak in his 
           ear.

                                 DAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Let me ask - where do you get off 
                        sending an agent out of district to 
                        check up on a lead?

                                 HARPER
                        It wasn't supposed to be dangerous.

                                 DAWSON
                        Yeah, they'll put that on your 
                        tombstone.  You always manage to 
                        fuck everything up, don't you?

           Dawson shakes his head and moves to walk away.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        That's what happens when you go 
                        "above and beyond."

           Harper lunges at Dawson, clipping his lip.  The other 
           OFFICERS have to pull him off.  Dawson staggers to his feet 
           wiping the blood from his face--

                                 DAWSON (CONT’D)
                        Get him outta here!  You're 
                        finished, Harper!  You're fired!

           Harper pulls free and throws himself into his car.  He speeds 
           off down the street.

           INT. ADELAIDE POLICE STATION -- MINUTES LATER

           Harper tears into the Station and heads straight for the 
           FILES ROOM.  Nguyen spots him before he can get there.

                                 NGUYEN
                        Nu-uh, Harper.  Dawson already 
                        radio'd.  I'm not even allowed to 
                        let you in the building.

                                 HARPER
                        Get out of my way, Nguyen.

                                 NGUYEN
                        Look I'm real sorry about Ebbing 
                        but I just can't do it.

                                 HARPER
                        I'm not asking you to.  All you 
                        have to do is look the other way.

                                 NGUYEN
                        Just go home, mate.

                                 HARPER
                        It'd be a shame to have to pull a 
                        gun on you.

           Nguyen appraises him quickly.

                                 NGUYEN
                        You're serious...  
                              (beat)
                        I guess it's true what they say 
                        about you - you just use people 
                        until you can't use them anymore.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

           He sighs and lets his arm drop.  Harper moves past him, 
           rifling through STACKS of FILES.

                                 NGUYEN (CONT’D)
                        What are you even looking for?

                                 HARPER
                              (while scanning)
                        Ebbing's accident - it took place 
                        on Meredith Craig's block.

           He pulls a dusty, old FOLDER from the cabinet.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        --My logs from '65 to '68.

           Nguyen watches as Harper frantically digs through his back 
           logs.

                                 NGUYEN
                        What a sad, old man you've become.

           He shakes his head and walks to the door.  As he's about to 
           leave, Harper glances at him.

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you, Nguyen.  You were always 
                        there for me.

           Nguyen smiles despite himself.

                                 NGUYEN
                        I'll make sure they don't throw any 
                        of your shit out.

           Harper goes back to the file.  Nguyen moves to close the 
           door, when Harper's head shoots up.

                                 HARPER
                        Hold up.

                                 NGUYEN
                        What is it?

           Curiosity gets the better of him and he hurries to Harper's 
           side.  Harper reads aloud from his notes:

                                 HARPER
                        I asked who she was married to.  
                        She responded, "no - not married, 
                        just hopelessly engaged."

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 NGUYEN
                        To who?

                                 HARPER
                        Mike Berman, a bartender.  We need 
                        to check his background.

           He looks expectantly at Nguyen, who rolls his eyes.

                                 NGUYEN
                        Jesus Christ!

           Nguyen wrenches open a cabinet drawer at the opposite side of 
           the room and begins furiously searching...

                                 HARPER
                        Odds are he was one of the other 
                        men on the bridge in '72.

                                 NGUYEN
                        I don't know about that, but I have 
                        a Michael Jerome Berman from Sutter
                        Place in the Torrens.

           Harper slams his drawer shut and joins Nguyen.

                                 HARPER
                        He have priors?

                                 NGUYEN
                        I can do you one better--

           He turns the binder around for Harper to see.  There's a row 
           of BOOKING SHOTS done in portrait.  Harper spots Berman, 
           where Nguyen points, front row left -- and instantly 
           recognizes him as Mr. B.

                                 HARPER
                        Son of a bitch...

           INT. ADELAIDE REGIONAL DETENTION FACILITY -- LATER

           Harper takes a seat at a glassed in queue of the VISITING 
           ROOM.  Soon enough, various INMATES are filed in.  Von Einem 
           takes a seat across from Harper, with only the glass to 
           separate them.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks for meeting with me.

                                 VON EINEM
                        It was this or read a book.

                                 HARPER
                        Why did you lie to me before? 

                                 VON EINEM
                        I didn't lie to you.

                                 HARPER
                        I know Mike Berman was the other 
                        man on the bridge that night in 
                        '72.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Just let it go...

                                 HARPER
                        I was about to walk from this.  
                        After everything that happened. I 
                        threw my life away in the pursuit 
                        of something there probably isn't 
                        an answer for.  So I think you owe 
                        me this.

                                 VON EINEM
                        I don't owe you shit.

           He groans and puts his head in his hands.

                        What's the difference now... 
                        they're long gone.

                                 HARPER
                        Who is?  Berman?  Meredith?

           Von Einem LAUGHS, mockingly.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Is that what she told you her name 
                        was?

                                 HARPER
                        Berman said you guys had a 
                        partnership?

                                 VON EINEM
                        He would say that... if one of us 
                        needed a driver, if things got 
                        messy, the other would be there.  
                              (beat)
                        We cleaned up each others messes...
           EXT. HENLEY BEACH LIFESAVING CLUB -- LATE NIGHT, 1966

           No one's around. It's silent outside, except for the flapping 
           of a BLUE FLAG with a WHITE STRIPE running down the middle. 

           Von Einem lights a match and tosses it down onto a trail of 
           gasoline.  He watches as the fire races into the building and 
           quickly envelopes the bottom floor...

           Von Einem continues telling his story behind glass...

                                 VON EINEM
                        And yet, there was still fun to be 
                        had. We played games with each 
                        other.  Small pranks to fuck the 
                        other person up.  Berman used to 
                        keep candies in his pocket for the 
                        kids.  Only he wouldn't say he'd 
                        dipped 'em in crushed sleepin'
                        pills.  You see, it helped... 
                        facilitate things. We drugged the 
                        kids so they were easier to deal 
                        with--

           Grant stumbles, drugged, down a sidewalk as Karen Jones 
           watches from behind a parked car...

           Von Einem leans in towards the divider, smiling.

           Von Einem turns gravely serious...

                        When he got back with the kids he 
                        was in a right state. He accused me 
                        of going too far.  We had it out 
                        then and there...
           INT. HAZEL ABBEY RESIDENCE, BASEMENT APARTMENT -- EVENING

           The Children cry as Berman chews Von Einem out right in front 
           of them.

                                 BERMAN
                        --I coulda' been caught!

                        But you weren't!

           Grant cups his hands over his ears trying hopelessly to block 
           out the noise.  With everyone's backs turned, he escapes out 
           a screen door.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        It was too much for Grant.  In the 
                        confusion he slipped out.  
                              (beat)
                        Mike had to go get him...

           EXT. MORPHETT ROAD -- LATE NIGHT, 1966

           Berman comes out of nowhere to snatch Grant up.  Across the 
           street, Karen Jones slaps a hand over her mouth to keep from 
           making a sound.

           INT. HAZEL ABBEY RESIDENCE, BASEMENT APARTMENT –- LATE NIGHT

           Berman escorts the kids over to the corner where a large pile 
           of used CHILDREN'S CLOTHES waits.

                        Every time he took a kid the

                        back to the apartment... change 
                        their clothes...

           Berman starts handing clothes to the Beaumonts.  Every 
           article of clothing seems to be missing its TAG.

                        You don't have children, do you?

           Harper shakes his head.

                        If you did, you'd know. What's the

                        she sends her kid out in new 
                        clothes?

           It seems so simple when it finally comes to Harper.

                        ...write their names in it.

                        Exactly. And that seemed to be his 
                        only safeguard.  I don't think he 
                        expected the press that came with 
                        taking the Beaumonts.  He became 
                        paranoid... started collecting...

           Berman cuts out pertinent ARTICLES from various CITY

                        She upped the rent and when Berman 
                        couldn't pay, she locked him out.  
                        Had some of the neighba'hood boys 
                        box his things up and put 'em 
                        outside.

                        He tried to get 'em back, but come 
                        spring Hazel's children had 
                        returned from school and there 
                        always seemed to be someone home.

           Berman pulls a CROWBAR out of his jacket.  When he moves to 
           jimmy a window, a LIGHT from inside comes on.  He quickly 
           flees.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        Unable to find other arrangements, 
                        he moved in to Meredith's place.

                        I know you think me a monster, 
                        Inspector.  But the truth is, you 
                        have no idea what he put those kids 
                        through.  The manipulation.  He 
                        laid it out.  Told 'em their 
                        parents were dead.  Meredith - as 
                        you know her - was the key.  The 
                        last vestige of their old life.  
                        They trusted her... 
                              (beat)
                        And they shouldn't have.

           INT. MEREDITH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTERNOON

           Weeks have passed. The children are no longer crying, but 
           have taken to watching CARTOONS silently. 

           Coming in the front door, Berman presents a BOUQUET of 
           PANSIES to Jane and for the first time since losing her 
           parents, she smiles.

           From the kitchen, Meredith stares jealously at the two of 
           them together.  She violently returns to chopping vegetables.

           INT. MEREDITH'S HOUSE, BATHROOM -- THAT NIGHT

           Meredith washes Jane's hair in the bathtub.  She's rough 
           about it, and Jane seems to sense that something's amiss.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Tilt your head back.

           Jane warily obliges and Meredith starts rinsing the shampoo 
           out. A little too vigorously...

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        You think you're so pretty.  Well 
                        let me tell you, your looks will 
                        fade.  I had what you had.

                                 JANE
                        I'm not even pretty...

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 MEREDITH
                        That's right, sweetheart.  
                              (beat)
                        You're not.

           She shoves Jane's head underwater.  The little girl fights 
           for the surface but it's all for naught.  

           After a few tense moments, she goes limp.

           EXT. MEREDITH'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- AFTER MIDNIGHT

           The last house Ebbing ever stood out front of is now younger 
           and cleaner.  As if someone could have lived there at some 
           point or another.

           From outside, we see Berman yelling at Meredith through the 
           windows.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        When he got off work that night, 
                        she told him all about it.  
                              (beat)
                        I had never seem him so upset...

           INT. MEREDITH'S HOUSE -- LATER

           Berman carries Jane's dripping wet, lifeless body from the 
           BATHTUB to his BEDROOM.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        It seems he had been saving her for 
                        a special occasion... 

           Before he slams the bedroom door, he glares at Meredith as 
           she stands down the hallway, crying. 

           INT. ADELAIDE REGIONAL DETENTION FACILITY -- RETURN TO SCENE

           Von Einem shakes his head, vehemently--

                                 VON EINEM
                        I never liked her.  And I finally 
                        got up the courage to tell him so 
                        after he got off work one night. We 
                        were to meet alone on the bridge.

           EXT. GAJ-A-ROO DANCE HALL -- LATE NIGHT, 1972

           Von Einem arrives at the meeting point only to see Berman 
           walking up with a now thirteen-year-old Grant.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                        But he had brought the boy along.

           Berman steps up, balding now. He and Von Einem share a few 
           choice words.  That's when the shoving begins.  It's Berman 
           who throws the first punch.  

           Prepared, Von Einem pulls out a collapsible METAL ROD and 
           cracks Berman across the knee with it.  Bone shatters.  Blood 
           spurts.  

           Berman SCREAMS in agony but throws his weight into Von Einem.  
           As Bevan slips backwards, he collides with Grant who's sent 
           over the railing.  

           Von Einem tries to catch the child, but it's too late. Berman 
           sees what's happened and quickly hobbles away.  Von Einem's 
           left there as people respond to the cries.  

           He YELLS out all he can: 

                                 VON EINEM
                        I need some help over here! 

           Lifting himself over the railing, he dives in after Grant.

           EXT. RIVERBANK -- MOMENTS LATER 

           Heaving for breath, Von Einem makes it to shore.  But without 
           Grant.  He looks up at the PEDESTRIANS on the BRIDGE.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        I couldn't save him.  I tried.  By 
                        the time I reached the bank of the 
                        river, people had arrived.  They'd 
                        seen Mike and I, but not our fight.  

           EXT. BRIDGE -- LATER

           Von Einem sits in the back of an AMBULANCE with a blanket 
           wrapped around him as a PARAMEDIC attends to a nasty forehead 
           wound he sustained on the way down.

           Berman stands several meters away talking with a POLICE 
           OFFICER.

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        Before the Police arrived we 
                        fabricated the tale of the 
                        homosexual gettin' roughed up.  We 
                        even gave the cops a partial on a 
                        registration plate we had seen.

                        I thought about telling them 
                        everything right then and there. 
                        But I couldn't tattle on Mike.  He 
                        had just as much on me as I did on 
                        him.
                              (beat)
                        After that, we went our separate 
                        ways.  And Mike got sloppier... and 
                        drunker...

           EXT. ADELAIDE OVAL, GROUNDS -- THE NEXT YEAR

           Berman walks out of the shadows, limping with his new injury, 
           carrying Kriste Gordon in his arms with Joanne Ratcliffe
           following close behind...

                                 VON EINEM (V.O.)
                        I always knew when one of his deeds 
                        made the papers.  And always, there 
                        you were, just two steps behind.  
                        But you never did catch up to him, 
                        did you?  
                              (beat)
                        So I waited, stuck in a 
                        stalemate...  

           INT. ADELAIDE REGIONAL DETENTION FACILITY -- BACK TO SCENE

           Von Einem finishes up, briskly.

                                 VON EINEM
                        Until one day he walks into your 
                        office and sees fit to push 
                        everything on me.

                                 HARPER
                        And you weren't with him the night 
                        Kelvin was kidnapped? 

                                 VON EINEM
                        I hadn't seen Berman in over a 
                        decade.  Guess he thought that 
                        since I was in for one crime, I 
                        should be in for all of them.  If I 
                        were him I don't know if I'da done 
                        much different.  Kill two birds 
                        with one stone.  Get me outta the 
                        picture and silence Kelvin, who if 
                        I'm not mistaken was just about to 
                        launch a twentieth anniversary 
                        special on the kidnappings.

                        Why wouldn't you tell me this 
                        earlier?  Back when I could do 
                        something about it!  Why did you 
                        cop to the whole thing?

                                 VON EINEM
                        They had me on my own crimes. I 
                        wasn't gettin' out. Besides, what's 
                        a few more years on a life 
                        sentence?

                                 HARPER
                        You could have ended it all if you 
                        just spoke up.

                        But you see, I couldn't.  There are 
                        still people who could be hurt by 
                        all of this.

                        Who's left?

           Harper searches Bevan's face for the answer.  He's surprised 
           to see tears appear in the man's eyes.

                                 VON EINEM (CONT’D)
                        He said he'd hurt her... 

           Harper pictures Arnna standing awkwardly as Berman flatters 
           Jane with the flowers.

                                 VON EINEM (CONT’D)

                        I just can't let anything happen to 
                        her.

           The bell for visiting hour sounds and the inmates start 
           saying their good-byes.  A pair of GUARDS arrive to put Von 
           Einem's RESTRAINTS back on. 

                                 HARPER
                        Bevan, what happened to Arnna?

                        You wouldn't believe me if I told 
                        you.

                        Please Bevan...

           When Von Einem finally answers, he's too far away for Harper 
           to hear --

                        What?!

           Harper pounds on the glass with both hands--

                        Bevan, I can't hear you!

           INT. CEMENT ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

           Harper finishes up his story with a broken voice.

                                 HARPER
                        When I went back the next week it 
                        was only to find out that he'd 
                        killed himself the night before.  
                        Hung in his cell.

           He continues on, a little brusque...

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I don't know whether to believe the 
                        man or not. I go back and forth. 
                        Did he speak the truth or was his 
                        story the stuff sociopaths are made 
                        of; so detailed and believable that 
                        even I was fooled. I wasn't the 
                        first to suggest that Berman 
                        mighta' kidnapped Kelvin simply to 
                        blame it on Von Einem.  It doesn't 
                        matter though. I tried to report my 
                        findings, but no one would listen.  
                        I'd become the drunken monster I'd 
                        always feared I would.

                        Maybe they died that very first 
                        night.  All we know is... no one 
                        ever saw them again.

                                 LIDDY
                        Doesn’t it bother you? Not knowing?

                                 HARPER
                        When I was younger it did.  I’ve 
                        learned to relax.  I lived the life 
                        I was meant to live.
                              (beat)
                        You can’t be upset with the hand 
                        you're dealt.

           She nods and turns the camera off.

                                 LIDDY
                        I think I’m gonna end with that.

           She gets up and crosses to him.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        I want to thank you once again for 
                        talkin' with me.  You didn’t have 
                        to.

                                 HARPER
                        No worries.

                                 LIDDY
                        I’ll take your mic if you’ll be 
                        happy to be rid of it.

           He LAUGHS.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, it’s a bit limiting, in’it?

           She ducks in close to him to remove it.  He lifts his arms to 
           help her.  They’re awkward together.  She blurts out the 
           first thing she can think of.

                                 LIDDY
                        So, you still want that drink?

           He LAUGHS again, though it’s clear the story has taken its 
           toll...

                                 HARPER
                        Actually, I’m gonna ask for a rain 
                        check. If that’s alright?

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                 LIDDY
                        Of course.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m sure you were just pitying an 
                        old man, anyway.

                                 LIDDY
                        No.  I would have gone.

           He smiles.

                                 HARPER
                        Thanks.
                              (beat)
                        You just made my life.

           She’s done with the mic.

                                 LIDDY
                        Well, goodbye I guess...

                                 HARPER
                        Don’t worry, I’ll stay in touch.

           She leads him out the door.

           EXT. BEACH FRONT -- DUSK

           Liddy holds the front door for him and Harper thanks her. He 
           waves and sets off down the beach. He’s unsure on his feet; 
           stumbling, other things on his mind. 

           Liddy watches him go, pity in her eyes.

           SUPER: South Australia Police still receive leads on a weekly 
           basis and still have an officer assigned to the case.

           Then the SCENE FADES to when Liddy was younger... to when she 
           was Arnna.

           EXT. GLENELG BEACH, WATERFRONT -- JANUARY 26TH, 1966

           That fateful day: Arnna’s about to follow her brother and 
           sister into the surf when she hears:

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Why, hello there!

                                 ARNNA
                        Hello.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        You’re Arnna, right? You’ve seen me 
                        on the pier befor’. I had my 
                        shepherd collie a couple weeks 
                        back.  Rememba? My name’s Victor.

           She looks up at him, shielding her face from the sun in her 
           eyes. He’s still anonymous...

                                 ARNNA
                              (somewhat timid)
                        Yeah...

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Now see you’re very smart.  You’re 
                        not supposed to talk to strangers 
                        unless they’re good and you know 
                        them.  And you know me so there’s 
                        nothing to be afraid of. Besides – 
                        you’re safe.
                              (beat)
                        You’re talkin’ to a Police Officer.

           She smiles a little, slowly being won over.  Behind her Jane 
           slogs her way out to Arnna.

                                 JANE
                        Arnna, come swim...

                                 ARNNA
                        This is my friend, Victa’.

           We whirl around to see who they’re talking to: it’s Harper, 
           age 25. He’s young, skinny, and blonde. He looks into the sun 
           and smiles.

                                 HARPER
                        Where your parents at on this fine, 
                        fine day?

           He winks at Arnna.

                                                       CUT TO BLACK:

           Super: Present, Three Months Later

           FADE IN:

           EXT. HARPER’S HOUSE, BEACHSIDE -- DUSK

           Harper carries a FISHING KIT up the stairs to his front door.  
           He fumbles with the keys.

                                                                (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           His house is in the middle of nowhere.  Solitary.

           He gets the lock open and is about to go inside when he sees 
           a PACKAGE jutting out of his mailbox.  He juggles the keys 
           and the fishing gear and manages to grab it.  Fumbling with 
           everything else, he goes inside.

           INT. HARPER’S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           He throws the gear in the corner and grabs a beer.  He opens 
           the package.  It’s a VHS: a copy of Liddy’s movie. He pops it 
           into the machine.

           Liddy’s voice is the first thing he hears...

                                 LIDDY
                        Everyone in Australia remembers 
                        where they were when the Beaumonts 
                        got kidnapped.  It was a cultural 
                        event; a milestone.  
                              (beat)
                        I was on a beach in Glenelg.

           Harper drops his beer. The video continues...

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        Not much was ever known about the 
                        identity of the Beaumont 
                        kidnapper... until now.

           A STILL PHOTOGRAPH taken of HARPER at a crime scene is posted 
           up on the screen.

           Harper grabs the television like it’s some kind of sick joke.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        When the Beaumonts first went 
                        missing, Geoff Harper was coming 
                        off two weeks of paid vacation.  
                        He'd just made Inspector and his 
                        habit of going on “fishing trips” 
                        always seemed to coincide with some 
                        horrible local crime.  But why 
                        would a cop commit such a heinous 
                        violation of his duties?

           Harper watches breathlessly -- aghast.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        The answer may surprise some of 
                        you. As a child, Geoff Harper was 
                        kidnapped.

           CONTINUED:
                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        He spent weeks deprived of his 
                        mother and father and eventually 
                        began to sympathize with his 
                        captors.

           Harper gets to his feet, looking around, positive he’s being 
           watched.

                                 LIDDY (CONT’D)
                        Still not convinced? The scrawlings
                        on the cut-outs found in a 
                        discarded suitcase in a Warneet
                        Rubbish Dump were of a very 
                        specific special-order red-ink pen.  
                        One of hundreds found in Harper’s 
                        own home.

           Harper gets up and tears open drawers and closets.  Flowing 
           out of each are thousands upon thousands of RED PENS.

           A VOICE comes from behind him:

                                 ARNNA (O.S.)
                        You like it?

           He whirls around, wide-eyed and crazed.

                                 ARNNA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It’s justa first cut, but it should 
                        do nicely, don’t you think?

           Harper squints into the darkness of his hallway.

                                 HARPER
                        Liddy?

           She raises a GUN high above her head.  Harper throws his 
           hands up.

                                 ARNNA
                        Let's not pretend that's my name.

                                 HARPER
                        Arnna... don’t... 

                                 ARNNA
                        They told me you'd try and get out 
                        of it. I guess I didn't realize how 
                        deeply you believed your own 
                        lies...

                                 HARPER
                        Please, you're confused--

           CONTINUED: (2)

           She fires once.  His hand shatters. He falls, SCREAMING to 
           the ground:

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t me!

           Arnna LAUGHS sickly...

                                 ARNNA
                        That’s what they all say.

           She raises the gun again and empties the clip into him.

           EXT. HARPER’S HOUSE -- LATER

           With much difficulty, Arnna drags two bulging TRASH BAGS down 
           the back staircase.

           At the base of them sits a car idling. A Man steps out of the 
           driver side to help her.  

           He has been known by many names.  Mike Berman.  Mr. B.  And 
           finally, and most recently, as The Tall, Blonde Man.

           Taking the bags from her, he puts them in the trunk.

                                 ARNNA
                        It’s all done.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN
                        Almost.

           He wraps her in a hug.

                                 THE TALL, BLONDE MAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re the best daughter a man 
                        could ask for...

           After fixing the tag sticking out of her shirt, they get in 
           the car and drive off.

           And in the darkness, coming from their radio, the sound of 
           “Crimson and Clover” fades away...

                                                       CUT TO BLACK:

           THE END
