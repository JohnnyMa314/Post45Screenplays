                           I heard that you're settled down
                    That you found a girl and you're married now.
                         I heard that your dreams came true.
                   Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you.
                     I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
                    But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it.
               I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded
                              That for me it isn't over.

                             - Adele, "Someone Like You"
           FADE IN:

           INT - SUBURBAN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HOME - DAY - 1990

           An adorable five-year old boy with COPPER hair, a 
           GHOSTBUSTERS T-shirt and GLASSES - MILES - kneels on the 
           kitchen counter with a gorgeous five-year old GIRL with DARK 
           BROWN HAIR - MEREDITH. Both have COOKIE DOUGH smiles on their 
           faces. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        My first encounter with a woman 
                        took place in 1990. I was exactly 
                        five years old.  
                             (pause)
                        No, really. It was somewhat 
                        unrequited with Meredith Sherman.  
                        After weeks of pleading during nap 
                        time, she finally agreed to a 
                        playdate at my house. We baked 
                        cookies and I tried to get her to 
                        laugh by making funny faces with my 
                        hands, covering up the tiny eyes 
                        hidden behind my thick royal-blue 
                        glasses.

           Miles sticks his FINGERS in his MOUTH to make a FISHY FACE. 
           Meredith giggles in delight.

           CU MEREDITH’S NOSE: Snot central. Gnarly! 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        I had been besotted with her until 
                        I noticed the green 11's advancing 
                        from her upper lip just moments 
                        later. 

           A MOTHERLY SET OF HANDS enters frame with a wad of paper 
           towels.

                        My Mom had to wipe Mer’s nose. I 
                        was so turned off. I've never eaten 
                        Toll House Chocolate Chip cookies 
                        again.  
           EXT. SUBURBAN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HOME - LATER

           MOM -- STEFF, (late 30’s) -- and Meredith stand at the front 
           door. Meredith wears her pink CARE BEARS BACKPACK, holding a 
           turqoise MY LITTLE PONY lunchpail. Mom holds a fresh tupper-
           ware container of chocolate chip cookies for Meredith to take 
           home. 

           A 1989 Volvo Station Wagon pulls up the DRIVEWAY. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        And just like that, I was through 
                        with Meredith. I mean, shit, she 
                        couldn't even blow her own nose. 
                        Her mom came to get her just after 
                        the cookies were done. 

           Meredith’s Mom, PATTI, late 30’s, Jane Fonda outfit, walks up 
           to thank STEFF, picking up Meredith in her arms. Pleasantries 
           exchanged. Patti and Meredith head back down to the car.

           CU: PATTI’S ASS in her BLACK WORK-OUT TIGHTS. 

                                 ADULT V.O. (CONT’D)
                        I remember them walking down our 
                        red brick path to their car.

           Miles WAVES. 

                                 ADULT V.O. (CONT’D)
                        Meredith's mom had a really fine 
                        ass. And it was here, at this 
                        moment, when I first realized the 
                        power of woman. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - LUNCH TIME, 1997

           PRE-TEENS of all types with braces, boys with 311 and Rage 
           Against The Machine t-shirts, girls with Kate Spade bags, 
           BACKPACKS, BINDERS, and BAD HAIR shuffle around the locker 
           area, futzing with 3-NUMBER-COMBO BLACK MASTER LOCKS. 

           MILES, now 13, wears thick ROYAL BLUE glasses, stands with a 
           BLACK SKATER KID in a Shorty’s hat, ALAN, 13, going to town 
           on a Blow-Pop AS --  

           THREE GORGEOUS THIRTEEN/FOURTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS WALK BY in 
           Dickie’s Overalls and Adidas sneakers -- all matching, each 
           one wearing a different color combination. 

           We land on the THE GIRL ON THE FAR LEFT. 
           This is BLAIR, 13. She has gorgeous BROWN HAIR, cut short at 
           her shoulders, an enormous smile, freckles, and HAZEL colored 
           EYES. She looks at MILES and smiles, walking off with the 
           girls. 

                                 ADULT V.O. (PRE-LAP)
                        I met my best friend, my soul-mate, 
                        the love of my life, when I was 
                        thirteen years old. Blair. I had it 
                        bad. I was in love, completely 
                        smitten. But I didn't know how to 
                        deal with it at first.

           ANGLE ON: MILES, RETARDED IN LOVE, EYES WIDE.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           INT. JUNIOR HIGH SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER CLASS, 1997 

           A BELL RINGS and students scurry, already late for their next 
           class. Blair stands up too fast, and an N’SYNC CD falls to 
           the floor from within her BINDER.

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        So I was an asshole...

           Miles picks it up, handing it to Blair.

                                 MILES
                        You like the Backstreet Boys?? 

           Blair SMILES, thinking Mile’s is taking an interest.

                                 BLAIR
                        You mean N’Sync? Yeah. Justin 
                        Timberlake mainly. So hot. He’s the 
                        only one that’ll last.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, right. Whatever. They’re all 
                        fags. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Asshole. 

           Blair STORMS OFF.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER AREA - CHRISTMAS - 1998

           It’s the last day before Winter Break. They’re now fourteen. 
           Blair wears a RED sweater and BLACK Converse slide SANDALS 
           (very hip that year). Miles wears CARGO PANTS and a Beastie 
           Boys hoody. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        Then I started being really nice to 
                        her. 

           Miles hands Blair a box from Fred Segal. 

                                 MILES
                        Merry Christmas, Blair.

                                 BLAIR
                        But we’re Jewish. My last name is 
                        Baumstein! Hello....?

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, but you love Christmas.

                                 BLAIR
                        And Ryan Phillippe in Cruel 
                        Intentions. Juicy sweatpants. 
                        Nintendo. Kobe Bryant. All of the 
                        Lakers, actually. Oh, and black 
                        babies. They’re so cute. Like you.

           Blair KISSES Miles on the CHEEK and he turns the color of a 
           USED TAMPON. 

                                 ADULT V.O. (PRE-LAP)
                        See why I loved her? 

           INT. GCC MOVIE THEATER - SHERMAN OAKS - SUMMER, 1998

           Can’t Hardly Wait plays on the MOVIE SCREEN. We find BLAIR 
           and MILES in the back of the theater, in the dark, staring at 
           each other, giggling, moments before going at it. 

           Okay, now they’re going at it -- tongues and spit and the 
           stuff that fourteen year old legends are made of.

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        We ended up making out one summer 
                        day before starting high school. I 
                        liked it.

           Blair takes Miles’ HAND and places it on her BOOB, over her 
           sweater. 
                                 ADULT V.O. (CONT’D)
                        Come to think of it. I fucking 
                        loved every second of it. 
                             (pause)
                        We were best friends with benefits, 
                        long before Matt Kemp and Rihanna, 
                        or even Bill Clinton and Monica 
                        Lewinsky. 

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Miles dunks his fingers into a melted box of MILK DUDS, licks 
           them, now going for the holy-grail.

           ANGLE ON: MILES’ TWO CHOCOLATEY FINGERS INCHING TOWARDS 
           BLAIR’S CROTCH. 

           Blair immediately closes her THIGHS, jumpy, swatting his hand 
           away.

                                 BLAIR
                        Miles!

                                 MILES
                        They melt in your bush, not your 
                        hand.

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s M&M’s! And I don’t have a 
                        bush, Romeo.

           Miles and Blair are SHUSHED by the row behind them. They go 
           at it again, lost in their own world.

                        ...That was until I introduced her 
                        to my best friend, Drew, the 
                        Pythagorus of Pussy.

           The patio of Miles’ parents home. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        Drew was three years older than us, 
                        sure, but I didn’t think much of it 
                        when I introduced the two of them. 
                        They were my best friends. 
           REVEAL: Drew, (17), handsome, older, little facial hair, 
           wearing a GUNS N’ ROSES T-shirt under a COLLARED SHIRT and 
           cargo pants, teaching Miles and Blair, (14) how to smoke a 
           JOINT. 

                                 DREW
                        Blair, hold the joint between two 
                        fingers, suck in some smoke, then 
                        suck in air. Hold it in like Snoop. 

           Blair follows his instructions, COUGHS all over the place. 
           Passes the JOINT to Miles. 

                                 ADULT V.O. (PRE-LAP)
                        I figured we’d all have fun hanging 
                        out together. 
                             (beat)
                        Little did I know just HOW much fun 
                        they’d have together.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MILES BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Miles, now STONED, stands guard by his bedroom door in the 
           DARK as Drew and Blair go at it under the covers of Miles’ 
           bed. 

           Blair HOWLS at the moon in sexual ecstasy. God only knows 
           what they’re doing.

                                 BLAIR (O.C.)
                             (from under covers)
                        Holy. Fucking. Christ. I’m 
                        coming!!!!

           EXT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY - SUMMER - 2001

           Students on students on students hanging out, studying, 
           playing frisbee-golf on an immaculately manicured lawn at the 
           prestigious university. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        Summer before our Junior year, I 
                        went to Oxford for a three month 
                        long writing program.

           Miles (now 16) sits on some set of historic steps with a 
           DISCMAN and a post-card from Blair. “Miss you. Miss you. 
           Can’t wait to kiss you. Drew says hi.’ 

           Miles SMILES.
                                 ADULT V.O. (CONT’D)  
                        Blair and I would talk every few 
                        days or so. I missed her. 

           INT. OXFORD UNIVERSITY - WOLFSON WEST HALL - PHONE BOOTH 

           Miles stands at the phone, sticking coins in the machine, 
           dialing. RING. RING. Weird English Ring. 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

                                 MILES
                        Blair!!!

                                 BLAIR
                        Miles! Hi!!! How are you? How’s 
                        Radiohead? You know they live 
                        there?...how’s Oxford, babe?! 

                                 MILES
                        It’s amazing. Doing a lot of cool 
                        writing. Yesterday we had our three 
                        hour class in the park, which was 
                        awesome. What’s new with you?

                             (choked)
                        So, you know Drew and I have been 
                        hanging out, he’s here for an 
                        internship at Fox Sports.

                                 MILES
                        Yeah. I got your postcard. Kinda 
                        weird, no?

                                 BLAIR
                        Miles, I...I want to tell you 
                        something.

           AWKWARD SILENCE.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (can hardly contain 
                              herself)
                        Drew and I had sex. I’m not a 
                        virgin anymore!!!

           CU: MILES CHEST: HIS HEART BEATING THROUGH HIS T-SHIRT.
                                 ADULT V.O.
                        I sort of always knew it was going 
                        to happen; can’t say I was that 
                        surprised. I was in serious denial. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BLAIR’S BEDROOM PATIO - END OF SAME SUMMER - 2001 

           It’s a gorgeous, sunny LA day, one of the last in August. 
           Blair wears denim shorts, a white T, barefoot. She looks 
           gorgeous. Miles is in a Lacoste shirt and skater shorts. 

           They share a JOINT, no longer coughing, baking in the sun.

                                 BLAIR
                        Miles. I missed you so much.

           Blair puts her HAND on Miles’ HAND. 

                                 MILES
                        I missed you, too. 
                             (pause)
                        But what about Drew? Are you guys 
                        like, together? 

                                 BLAIR
                        What about him? He’s back in Philly 
                        at college. We can still all be 
                        friends. Hang out when he comes to 
                        visit, I guess. 

                                 MILES
                        But you guys slept together. Don’t 
                        you miss him? Do you like him? 

           Blair’s obviously nervous about the following words.

                                 BLAIR
                        It was fun...A summer fling. Ugh. 
                             (pause)
                        I liked him, yeah...but it’s not 
                        what I have with you. I’m so sorry. 
                        I hope you’re not mad. 

                                 MILES
                        What was it like?

                                 BLAIR
                        First time sex was nerve-racking. 
                        Honestly, I just wanted to get it 
                        over with. 
                                 MILES
                        I’m not mad. It’s. It’s just. I 
                        donno...I wanted to share that 
                        special bond with you. I have 
                        feelings for you that I’ve never 
                        felt for anyone else on the planet. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I know, I have those feelings for 
                        you, too. 

           Blair REACHES FOR MILES HAND, INTERLOCKS HER FINGERS.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I know I was selfish. I realized it 
                        after it was too late. 

                                 MILES
                        What do you mean?

           BEAT.

                                 BLAIR
                        The second I realized you’d be 
                        coming back, I woke up every 
                        morning with butterflies in my 
                        stomach. I couldn’t sleep. Barely 
                        ate. You’re all I thought about. My 
                        nerves. I was so excited to see 
                        you...
                             (quick pause)
                        And that’s when I realized -- 

           MILES just STARES, listening -- 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I’m in love with you, Miles. I’ve 
                        had butterfly feelings for you 
                        since the eighth grade, and I tried 
                        to deny it because I was afraid it 
                        would ruin our friendship. 

                                 MILES
                             (resentful but OK with it)
                        So you boned Drew instead of me?! 
                        You total slut. What do you want me 
                        to say?

                                 BLAIR
                        That you still have feelings for 
                        me. I know you do. I know you love 
                        me back.
                                 MILES
                             (insecure)
                        Has Drew’s DNA finished seeping out 
                        of you yet??

           Blair SLUGS Miles in the shoulder. They both laugh. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I love you, Miles. I really do.

           Blair KISSES Miles on the MOUTH, with TONS OF TONGUE. He 
           can’t resist.  

                                 ADULT V.O. (PRE-LAP)
                        We were inseparable, boyfriend and 
                        girlfriend from this day forward 
                        until the day we left for college 
                        in 2003. 

           ANGLE ON: INTERLOCKED FINGERS, TWISTED TONGUES.

           INT. BLAIR’S HOUSE - DECEMBER, 2002

           Blair blows out a BIRTHDAY CAKE (Happy 18th!) with all her 
           girlfriends. Miles stands next to her, holding her hand, 
           kissing her for the cameras.

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - VALENTINE’S DAY, 2003

           Blair and Miles eat heart-shaped ravioli, pretending to be 
           adults having a fancy dinner, clinking wine glasses.

           EXT. STAPLES CENTER - POST LAKERS GAME, 2003

           Blair and Miles exit the game with throngs of fans arm in 
           arm. Blair wears a Purple Lakers hat and a Kobe24 jersey. 

           INT. MILES BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT, 2003

           Miles and Blair have sex to “Miss Jackson” by OutKast (also 
           very hot that year). 

                                 BLAIR
                             (panting)
                        Talk dirty to me.
                                 MILES
                             (struggling)
                        I’m...I’m....I’m in you!!!

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL LOCKERS, SPRING 2003

           Blair sits in Miles lap, studying for the SATs, going over 
           flashcards, surrounded by backpacks and college guide books.

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        Soon, we were applying to colleges. 
                        Blair wanted to go to a Big 10 
                        school, go to football games, join 
                        a sorority, have school spirit. I 
                        wanted to be in a bustling city 
                        campus college with all night 
                        diners, clubs, a film/video 
                        program, and decent drugs.  

           INT. MILES’ HOME - KITCHEN, 2003 

           Miles (also now 18) stands with his family (late 40’s STEFF & 
           JERE, 16 year old brother, JOSH) and Blair at the kitchen 
           table, opening a package from Boston University.

           Miles looks at them and SMILES before HIGH-FIVING them.

                                 MILES
                        I did it! Early decision. What 
                        what?!?!

                                 MOM
                        Congratulations, Mi!!

                                 DAD
                        We’re so proud of you.

                                 JOSH
                        It’s not like he got into Harvard 
                        or M.I.T. It’s B.U. Jesus Christ. 

                                 BLAIR
                        We’ll I’m impressed.

           Blair KISSES Miles. 

                                 JOSH
                        Ugh. Get a dorm. 
           EXT. BLAIR’S DRIVEWAY - AUGUST, 2003

           Blair stands with her family and FOUR DOGS in the driveway, 
           packed and ready to go to the U of M for college. 

           Miles HUGS Blair with every ounce of his heart, body and 
           soul. Blair BURSTS into tears into his shoulder, sobbing into 
           his sweatshirt. Miles wipes his EYES. 

           Miles takes off his SWEATSHIRT and hands it to Blair.

                                 MILES
                             (choked)
                        I want you to have this. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (balling)
                        Mi, I have thirty of your 
                        sweatshirts. I could open a store. 
                        I love you love you love you to 
                        pieces. I’m gonna miss you more 
                        than anything. What am I going to 
                        ever do without you? You’re my 
                        everything.

                                 MILES
                        Me too. I don’t want it to end. 
                        It’s going to be really hard. But 
                        we’ll call each other. You’ll come 
                        visit. I’ll come to some football 
                        games. We’ll make it work. 

                                 BLAIR
                        I don’t want it to end either, but 
                        I know that we need to experience 
                        other people. Go to college. Really 
                        go. Be young in order to grow up. 

           Miles and Blair HUG AND KISS a magical fire/ice fireworks 
           GOODBYE KISS that only happens in the Twilight movies. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        This was the beginning of the end. 
                        The last waltz, so to speak.

           EXT. BOSTON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS, COMM AVE. - 2005

           Miles and a brunette girl with GLASSES walk hand in hand into 
           a pub filled with their friends. Both wear NORTH FACE 
           jackets. It’s FREEZING, SNOW ON THE GROUND.  
                                 ADULT V.O.
                        Things changed. Time passed. We did 
                        visit. We sent each other e-mails, 
                        and presents on our birthdays, but 
                        we ultimately grew apart. Started 
                        seeing other people.

           EXT. U OF M FRAT PARTY - DELTA SIG - 2006

           Bros and Hos mill around a keg as someone’s Gym Playlist 
           plays on the shitty speaker system. Blair MAKES OUT with some 
           steakhead wearing a backwards NY Yankees hat. 

           INT - MICHIGAN STADIUM, U OF M - 2007

           Graduation for Blair. She walks with a group of her sorority 
           sisters amongst thousands of other students. Family CHEER 
           from all angles. Blair shakes the DEAN’S HAND, stops for a 
           photo opp. 

                                 ADULT V.O.
                             (sullen)
                        By the time we graduated, Blair had 
                        a serious boyfriend. Or so I read 
                        on Facebook. 

           ANGLE ON: BLAIR’S FAMILY: MOM, DAD, OLDER BROTHER, and 
           GENERIC BOYFRIEND, taking a picture, clapping, cheering. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL REUNION PARTY - SUMMER, 2007

           Solo cups, kegs, ping pong. Familiar faces from high school. 
           It’s random. Awkward. Everyone is version 2.0 of their 
           previous selves. An iPod plays Kanye and H.O.V.A. 

           Miles STANDS with a few kids he was friendly with back in the 
           day, sharing crappy memories. 

           ...AND AS IF HELEN OF TROY WALKED RIGHT INTO THE PARTY, BLAIR 
           APPEARS, standing in front of Miles. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Hi. Remember me?

           Miles nearly drops his beer.

                                 MILES
                        Blair something right?

                                 BLAIR
                        Uh huh...
                                 MILES
                        Did we fuck?

                                 BLAIR
                        Shut up! Miles! How are you?! 

           Blair nearly jumps into his arms, throwing her weight on him.

                                 MILES
                        How are you?! What’s new? Aren’t 
                        you supposed to be in New York? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Ugh. I moved all my stuff out of my 
                        parents’ house in Palm Springs. I 
                        can’t be there anymore. It’s too 
                        depressing. My Dad’s lost his mind. 
                             (pause)
                        I’m staying at Hilary’s in Sherman 
                        Oaks until I go back.

                                 MILES
                        You got a job?

                                 BLAIR
                        Eesh. Working on that. Gonna figure 
                        that out. In the meantime, I’ll 
                        probably work at Urban Outfitters. 
                        Michael and I just found a nice 
                        place in Brooklyn. He’s finishing 
                        law school.

                                 MILES
                        Michael? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh, yeah. I thought I told you. I’m 
                        dating a great guy. 

                                 MILES
                        I haven’t seen or talked to you in 
                        over a year. So no, you didn’t tell 
                        me. I mean, I heard you had a dude 
                        or something. But moving in 
                        together? Across the country? 
                        That’s serious. Super serious. Like 
                        bone marrow disease or Darfur. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What about you? No girls, Mi? 
                        That’s not like you.
                                 MILES
                        There were a few here and there. 
                        Good candidates, but none of them 
                        nailed the audition for wife of the 
                        year. 

           BEAT.

                                 BLAIR
                        So...

                                 MILES
                        So...

                                 ADULT V.O.
                        That was the last time I saw her. 
                        We hugged and kissed, had a few 
                        beers. Shared some laughs. She left 
                        with her friend Hilary and I went 
                        home to jerk off. 

           WIDE OF BLAIR AND MILES as they walk off in different 
           directions -- 

           EXT./INT. - MILES CAR - 10 FREEWAY - PRESENT DAY - 2012

           Miles (now 26), GLASSES, BRILLO PAD HAIR, just as we know 
           him, drives back to his two bedroom apartment in Los Feliz. 
           Traffic. Music. Windows down. 

           EXT. THE TOWER APARTMENTS - CONTINUOUS

           Establishing. Miles’ parks in front, grabs his messenger bag 
           from the backseat. 

           INT. MILES APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Keys in the door. It’s unlocked. Miles flips on the light, 
           throws his keys and wallet down. Ikea and West Elm chic. 

                                 DREW (O.S.)
                        Yooo! Honey, is that you?!

                                 MILES
                        Yo! Sup my dawg? 

           Drew SLIDES into the room like Tom Cruise in Risky Business. 
           He’s now 28, but not a day over fifteen. 
                                 DREW
                        Nothin’ much. Mail’s on your bed. 
                        Predator’s on Showtime.

                                 MILES
                             (a-la Arnold)
                        “Bennett, get in the chopper! Get 
                        down! Goooo!”

                                 DREW
                        Wanna go out tonight?

                                 MILES
                        Meh. Not really. Anything good?

                                 DREW
                        Some party in the hills. Models and 
                        bottles, you want to come with? 

                                 MILES
                        Only if you promise to stop quoting 
                        Swingers.

                                 DREW
                        You’re so money, and you don’t even 
                        know it.  

                                 MILES
                        I don’t know, dude.

                                 DREW
                        Miles. Don’t even go there. Not 
                        now. Let’s just have a good time 
                        tonight. 

                                 MILES
                        I can’t help it. It’s all I think 
                        about. I keep looking at pictures 
                        of her, of us. Old letters. 
                        Valentines. The yearbook...

                                 DREW
                             (not again)
                        Here we go...

                                 MILES
                             (losing it)
                        Every day something pops up on my 
                        God damn Newsfeed about her job, or 
                        her dogs, or that Michael boyfriend 
                        guy passing the bar, and I want to 
                        die.  
                                 DREW
                        Get. Over. Her. Dude. Let it go. 
                        She has. What happened to that 
                        Courtney girl you were schtupping? 
                        She was nice? 

                                 MILES
                        Courtney? From Valencia? The 
                        teacher I met on OK Cupid? I’ve 
                        seen better legs on furniture. I’d 
                        rather fuck fruit. 
                             (pause)
                        I can’t do this dating thing 
                        forever, man. Everyone sucks. It’s 
                        boring. Sex is rad, but I sort of 
                        miss the pillow talk these days. 
                        Reading in bed. Hangin’ out. 
                        Playing Wii. Going to concerts. 
                        Eating Twizzlers in the nude...all 
                        these things I did with Blair.  

           BEAT.

                                 DREW
                        Miles, just take it easy. You’re 
                        only twenty-six. And they didn’t 
                        have Wii when you dated Blair. 

                                 MILES
                        That’s not the point! We’re getting 
                        older, and the older I get, the 
                        more I want what I had when I was 
                        seventeen...I want a best friend 
                        that loves me for me...the good, 
                        the bad, the ugly. I want a 
                        partner, a sidekick. I want a wife. 
                        Or at least to know she’s out 
                        there. And Blair...
                             (breathes)
                        Blair was the Lilo to my Stitch in 
                        the form of a hot Jewish girl that 
                        I loved fellating. 
                             (ugh)
                        I miss her. I need her.  

                                 DREW
                        You still takin’ your Zoloft?

           Miles NODS. 

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Good.
                             (quick; then)
                        When was the last time you spoke? 
                                 MILES
                        She texted me on New Year’s. The 
                        first person to call me on my 
                        birthday. We Facebooked each other 
                        on Passover; I wanted to know where 
                        she hid the Afikomen. 

                                 DREW
                        I love you to pieces, but get it 
                        together. Move on. It’s affecting 
                        your ability to meet other people 
                        and she probably thinks you’re a 
                        creep! You Facebook each other? 
                        Listen to yourself, Zuckberger. 

                                 MILES
                        It’s Zuckerberg.

                                 DREW
                        Whatever. You sound insane. Miles, 
                        we have this conversation twice a 
                        week. It’s killing you, and me. 
                        You’re stuck in the past. Stop 
                        thinking about a future with Blair. 
                        Just be present.

                                 MILES
                        Be present. Live in the moment. 
                        Yeah, sure. No problem, Ferris. 

                                 DREW
                        You need a drink. You need to 
                        chill. You need a night on the 
                        town. We’re going out to meet some 
                        girls. 

           MILES CONSIDERS THIS --

                                 MILES
                        None of them are Blair. 

                                 DREW
                        Exactly.

           EXT. BEACHWOOD CANYON HOUSE PARTY - ESTABLISHING - LATER

           Cars putt putt up the windy hills to a gigantic monstrosity 
           adorned with Christmas lights. We can hear the music from the 
           street. It very well may be Amy Winehouse (big ups). 
           INT. BEACHWOOD CANYON HOUSE PARTY - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew fight for free booze at a kitchen counter with 
           a bunch of hipsters, wannabees, actors and agents. TWO DUDES 
           in fedoras knock into Miles. 

                                 MILES
                             (shouting)
                        This really sucks. Like Sasha Grey 
                        sucks. 

                                 DREW
                        There’s a ton of girls here. What’s 
                        the matter, dude? 

           Miles pulls out his iPhone. 

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Give me that. You’re not Tweeting, 
                        Texting, checking ‘the Book’ or 
                        GRINDRing with all these babe-or-
                        tunities right in front of you.

                                 MILES
                             (matter of fact)
                        GRINDR’s an app for gay dudes.

                                 DREW
                        Exactly. Quit being such a dong-
                        huffer with all these pretty girls 
                        walking around.

           THREE GIRLS WALK BY: One looks like Emma Stone’s uglier twin, 
           a second is Bar Rafaeli with a bad nose job, the third is 
           bleach-blonde, wearing a tube-top and press-on nails. This 
           chick makes Tara Reid look hot. Yikes. 

                                 MILES
                        This isn’t a who’s who, Drew. It’s 
                        a who gives a fuck.

                                 DREW
                             (defeated)
                        Here. Relax. 

           Hands Miles a JOINT.

                                 MILES
                        I snort it, right?...I’ll be on the 
                        balcony. Entertain yourself. 
           EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           Miles stands a few feet from a couple kissing, lighting the 
           joint, peering out over Los Angeles and all its twinkly-lit 
           glory. Taking a moment to himself. 

           A brief moment. A LEGGY BLONDE approaches. 

                                 LEGGY BLONDE
                        Do you share?

                                 MILES
                        Yup. Everything I need to know I 
                        learned in Kindergarten.

                                 LEGGY BLONDE
                        That a line?

                                 MILES
                        No, it’s a joint. You want some?

           LEGGY laughs, taking the joint from Miles.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?

                                 LEGGY BLONDE
                        Adele.

                                 MILES
                        Like the singer?

                                 ADELE
                        That husky bitch ruined my life 
                        with one song.

                                 MILES
                             (singing)
                        “We could have had it 
                        all....rolling in the deep. You had 
                        my heart and sooooouuuuuulllll....”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MILES BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 

           Your average twenty-something bedroom. A framed Guns N’ Roses 
           poster from “Appetite for Destruction.” Framed pictures on a 
           nightstand. A desk with a Macbook. A bookshelf. 

           Miles and Adele go at it, collapsing on his Queen size bed. 
           She pulls off her undies. He unbuttons his pants. 
                                 ADELE
                        Do you have something?

                                 MILES
                        You on the pill? 

                                 ADELE
                        I just met you. Get a condom, 
                        dingus. 

           Miles grabs a CONDOM from the nightstand to his left. They 
           charge each other sexually, drunkenly attacking each other. 

           Adele ROLLS OVER ONTO THE MAIL on the comforter, causing it 
           to crumple, sliding onto the floor at the foot of Miles’ bed. 

           REVEAL: A large, thick, square shaped ENVELOPE addressed to 
           Miles. The return address reads New York City in fancy black 
           calligraphy. 

           INT. MILES BEDROOM - MORNING - THE NEXT DAY

           The morning after. Awkward. An ALARM CLOCK reads 7:37 AM.

           Adele quickly dresses next to Miles, still asleep in BED. Her 
           CLOTHES are in clumps on the floor next to condom wrappers 
           and a medicine bottle full of weed.

           Miles opens a crusty eye.

                                 MILES
                        Where you going so fast?

                                 ADELE
                        Little place called work.

                                 MILES
                        It’s not even eight o’clock yet. 
                        You a bus driver? Get back here. 

           Adele STEPS on the ENVELOPE.

                                 ADELE
                        You got some mail.

           She tosses it to him.

                                 ADELE (CONT’D)
                        Who’s getting married?

                                 MILES
                        Other than you and I? No idea.
                                 ADELE
                        I’m gonna be late. Last night was 
                        fun. I put my number in your phone. 

           Adele kisses him on the cheek, grabbing her bag from next to 
           the bed.

           Miles is distracted, opening the ENVELOPE.

           And she’s gone. 

           Miles CAN’T BELIEVE THE WORDS HE READS. His heart nearly 
           STOPS, his world crumbling before him. 

                                 MILES
                             (at the top of his lungs, 
                              trying to breathe)
                        Drew!!!!! 

           No response.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Drew! Get the fuck in here! 

           Nothing.

           Miles gets up and DARTS into Drew’s room.

           INT. DREW’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miles JUMPS INTO bed with Drew, shaking him awake. A Calder 
           hangs above his bed. A signed picture of SLASH is pinned to a 
           bulletin board next to a DESK.

                                 MILES
                        DUDE! WAKE THE FUCK UP! 

                                 DREW
                             (one eye open)
                        How’d it go with Estelle?

                                 MILES
                        Adele, and I didn’t finish. 

           Miles SHAKES Drew by his shoulders, screaming in his face. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        WAKE UP, ASSHOLE! 

                                 DREW
                             (sits up)
                        What?! It’s not even eight. Steve 
                        Jobs die again?
                                 MILES
                        Bigger.

                                 DREW
                        Terrorist attack?

                                 MILES
                        Worse.

                                 DREW
                             (intrigued)
                        ...Go on.

                                 MILES
                             (deadpan)
                        Blair’s getting married. 

                                 DREW
                        Shut. Up. 
                             (pause)
                        To who?!

                                 MILES
                        What’dya mean, who? That fucking 
                        Michael guy. Invite came in the 
                        mail.

                                 DREW
                        The douche nozel with the anvil-
                        face? The one you showed me?

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, him. The lawyer from New 
                        York.

                                 DREW
                        Oof. I’ve seen better faces on 
                        cash. 

                                 MILES
                        Blair didn’t even give me the 
                        chance to fight for her, or say 
                        something, anything. How am I 
                        supposed to get her back now? 
                        Married? I’m her husband, Drew! 
                        This is so fucked. 

                                 DREW
                        Whoa. Slow down, sweet chariot. 

                                 MILES
                        Homegirl is Mia Wallace, Margot 
                        Tenenbaum and Elaine Robinson 
                        rolled into one. And boom. Gone.
                                 DREW
                        Where’s the wedding?

                                 MILES
                        Napa. Six hours north of L.A.

                                 DREW
                        Let me see the invitation.

           Miles does as he’s told. Drew examines the invite.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Well. The invite is modern, 
                        tasteful, and a the off-white cream 
                        color of the stationary really 
                        accentuates the Bodoni typeface. 
                        I’m impressed. 
                             (quick beat)
                        She gave you a + 1. You gotta go. 
                        You gotta bring a date. 

                                 MILES
                        Are you crazy? I’m not going. 

                                 DREW
                        Listen, Miles, in all seriousness, 
                        do you plan to tell her how you 
                        feel? 

                                 MILES
                        I mean. I can’t let her go without 
                        a fight. What’s appropriate in this 
                        situation? Facebook? Text? Phone? 
                        Should I just RSVP “no” with a 
                        witty note about why I love her?

                                 DREW
                        Wrong! Go to the wedding and 
                        fucking get your girl, Benjamin 
                        Braddick! 

                                 MILES
                        Drew, I love this girl more than 
                        life itself. I can’t stand to see 
                        her get married to another guy. But 
                        I also can’t ruin her wedding. 

                                 DREW
                        Seriously? Miles. This is your 
                        moment. You want to say something? 
                        To stand up and party for your 
                        right to fight? You want your shot? 
                        You’re looking at it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DREW (CONT'D)
                        This is your one opportunity to get 
                        the girl before you lose her 
                        forever. She’s giving you the 
                        opportunity to say something. This 
                        invitation proves it. Fuck. I’ll go 
                        with you. Who better to accompany 
                        you than the guy who took her 
                        virginity?

                                 MILES
                        Don’t remind me. 
                             (pause)
                        I’m not going. 

                                 DREW
                        We’re going.

           Miles pulls a JOINT and LIGHTER from his BRIEFS, LIGHTS it...

           INT. THE BOWERY BAR - A MONTH OR SO LATER

           Miles and Drew sit in a BOOTH with MICHELLE (29), a rich, 
           gorgeous chick from Santa Barbara with BROWN HAIR and a BLACK 
           AMEX. A gigantic iceberg of an ENGAGEMENT RING is on her 
           wedding finger. 

           It’s Drew’s 29th birthday. Not exactly a raging affair. 

                                 MILES
                        I’m not going.

                                 DREW
                             (to Michelle)
                        He’s going. Tell him, Mich.  

                                 MICHELLE
                        When’s the wedding?

                                 MILES
                        June.

                                 DREW
                        I have exactly three weeks to get 
                        you in the best shape of your life.
                             (to a passing waitress)
                        ‘nother Jameson, please. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        You two are insane. 
                                 DREW
                        Says you, the bride-to-be whose 
                        penchant for eating Vicodin and 
                        schtupping me hasn’t ceased to 
                        exist since said engagement...

                                 MICHELLE
                        I know. I know. I’m having an 
                        existential crisis. 

                                 MILES
                        Yeah, Michelle. Not that I’m in any 
                        place to ask, but what the hell are 
                        you doing getting married? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Support. Freedom. Relief. I’m tired 
                        of the husband search. I just don’t 
                        care anymore. We’re not meant to be 
                        with one person for eternity 
                        anyway, so I’ll bite the bullet and 
                        get it over with. Everyone knows 
                        the second husband is the one. The 
                        first is just a placeholder. I’m 
                        really holding out for Drew. 

                                 MILES
                        I can relate to that. So by your 
                        account, I still have a shot with 
                        Blair?

                                 MICHELLE
                        It’s never over, Miles. Not until 
                        you say so. 

           Michelle GRABS Drew’S HAND AND PLACES IT IN HERS, turns to 
           him, cutting out Miles in the process.

           CLOSE ON MICHELLE AND DREW

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                             (genuine)
                        Save me.

                                 DREW
                             (drunk)
                        Michelle, what are you even saying? 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I love you, Drew. 

                                 DREW
                        You love having sex with me.
                                 MICHELLE
                        I love that you know how to make me 
                        laugh without even trying. 

                                 DREW
                        Michelle, you’re my closest friend 
                        on planet Earth, it’s you and the 
                        four-eyed kid. That’s all I got. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Exactly! You get me. You got me. So 
                        be with me. Save me from my 
                        marriage...and divorce. I don’t 
                        love Jake. He just fits the bill. 
                        My parents like him. 

           BEAT.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I should be marrying you!

           MILES IS WATCHING THIS UNFOLD BEFORE HIS VERY EYES. He wishes 
           he was having this exact conversation with Blair. 

                                 DREW
                        Michelle. I have three hundred 
                        dollars in my checking account and 
                        my Dad’s old Benz. I work as a 
                        personal assistant to a fucking 
                        trainer. I’m not exactly killing 
                        it.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Money isn’t real.

                                 DREW
                        Really? Love fades. Money doesn’t. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        I want to spend the rest of my life 
                        with you. For richer or poorer. In 
                        sickness and in health. For better 
                        or worse. ‘Til death do us part. 

           Michelle’s HAND pushes an ICONIC TURQUOISE TIFFANY’S BOX with 
           a WHITE RIBBON AROUND IT to Drew across the table, leaving it 
           at his drink. Drew is dumbfounded. He opens it. 

           Drew looks down at the BOX. 

           Drew looks at Michelle.

           Drew looks back at the BOX, looks at Miles. 
                                 DREW
                             (to Michelle)
                        What the fuck is this?  

                                 MICHELLE
                        Happy Birthday, drewbee-doo.

           REVEAL: It’s two pills of Ecstasy with J.D. Salinger on them. 

           She places one of the pills in Drew’s mouth. He shakes his 
           head, swallowing it down with his drink. 

                                 DREW
                        You’re the worst thing to ever 
                        happen to me.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Right back atcha. Love you, mean 
                        it. 

           Michelle takes the other pill and gulps it down with a shot. 

           Drew shoots Michelle a look that says “I’m going to kill 
           you,” to which Michelle replies with her own set of eyes, 
           “not if I fuck your brains out first.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MILES/DREWS APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Remnants of last night’s pre-game. A couple empty bottles, 
           Chick-Fil-A wrappers, weed crumbs and a rolled up $20. Sunday 
           Football plays MUTED on the wall-mounted TV in the den. 

           Miles sits outside on the balcony, smoking a cigarette in his 
           pajamas, listening to “All I Want” by Joni Mitchell. 

           INT. DREW’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Michelle gathers her belongings. Drew is dead asleep in bed. 
           Michelle walks over to him, moves the HAIR FROM HIS BROW, 
           kisses his FOREHEAD.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Love you.

           Drew STIRS in bed. Not really awake yet. 

                                                       BEGIN QUICK TIME

           EXT. - THE BALCONY - MILES’ APARTMENT 

           Multiple mornings and nights. Each day begins and ends with 
           Miles SMOKING cigarettes outside on the BALCONY in different 
           pajama pants and T-shirts. On some mornings, MICHELLE comes 
           and goes from Drew’s bedroom, kissing Miles ‘goodbye’ outside 
           before EXITING. 

                                                         END TIME LAPSE 
                                                           AND BACK TO:

           EXT. MILES/DREWS’ APARTMENT - THE DRIVEWAY 

           It’s June. Visibly hot as balls in Los Angeles. 

           Drew tosses a DUFFEL into the backseat of his father’s 1995 
           Mercedes SL 500 CONVERTIBLE, cigarette dangling from his lip. 
           He wears vintage Oliver People sunglasses. The top is DOWN. 

           Within moments, Miles appears, wearing a BACKPACK, PAJAMA 
           BOTTOMS, a Stussy hat from the Clinton administration. 
           Sunglasses on CROAKIES around his neck. 

                                 MILES
                        I’m not going.

                                 DREW
                        Get in the car, Miles. I’m not 
                        asking you. I’m telling you. 

                                 MILES
                        I don’t even have on the proper 
                        attire. I’m wearing your PJ’s from 
                        sleepaway camp.

                                 DREW
                        Thought I recognized those. 
                             (points)
                        Lotta jizz stains. Here.

           Drew UNZIPS the duffel and tosses him a pair of Levi’s.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        My Levi’s. Take ‘em. 

           Mile’s STRIPS IN THE STREET, dropping his pants and putting 
           on the Jeans. He’s wearing HI-LIGHTER ORANGE AMERICAN APPAREL 
           TIGHTY-WHITEYS.  

                                 MILES
                        Thanks. 
                             (zips up)
                        I’m just worried.

                        Can’t stop thinking about it. Why 
                        would she invite me? Why now? All 
                        of a sudden. I didn’t even get a 
                        save-the-date. It just doesn’t make 
                        sense. 

                                 DREW
                        Who knows, man. Girls are fucking 
                        weird. On the pill. Off the pill. 
                        Bleeding for three days and not

                        watching American Idol and lining 
                        up for Twilight movies. They’re N-U-
                        T-S. Nuts. Your guess is as good as 
                        mine. You’re just going to have to 
                        take that leap of faith. 
                             (losing his patience)
                        Now get in the fucking car, before 
                        I embarrass you in front of the 
                        neighbors. It’s already three. 
                        We’re never gonna make it tonight. 

                                 MILES
                        Just tell me you packed the Tums.

                                 DREW
                        Get in the car, Rain Man. 

           Drew SHOOTS MILES A LOOK: the friendship/I’ve known you 
           thirty years, of course I have Tums, get in the motherfucking 
           car look. 

           Miles literally LEAPS into the car, over the door, without 
           ever opening it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Drew and Miles enjoying the ride, cruising. If they were a 
           gay couple this would be the moment Miles would put his hand 
           on Drew’s, resting on the gear-shifter. 

                                 MILES
                        I made a mix.

                                 DREW
                        Of course you did. You could be 
                        overly sentimental and nostalgic 
                        over a tuna melt.

                        Don’t you knock it ‘til you rock 
                        it.

           Miles puts in the CD-R labeled, “Penis Town Vol.1”

                        Let’s Cruise like Tom. 

           Without a moment of hesitation, ANNIE LENNOX “Walking On 
           Broken Glass” tears ass through the 8-speaker system of the 
           SL 

           and THEY’RE OFF...

           Drew EXITS the freeway, headed for a tiny DIRT ROAD that 
           leads to a GAS STATION DINER.

           INT. GAS SATION DINER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Drew and Miles sit on opposites of a booth. Miles is dumping 
           way too much Tobasco sauce on an omelet. Drew dunks a few 
           french fries into a saucer of ketchup. 

           “Gimme Danger” by The Stooges plays on a shitty jukebox. 

                                 DREW
                        So, do you have some sort of plan 
                        here?

                                 MILES
                        You’re joking, right. This was your 
                        genius idea. I didn’t even want to 
                        come! I’m just gonna say what I 
                        feel, say what I mean, and mean 
                        what I say. But I was hoping you 
                        had the plan...

                                 DREW
                        I booked us a room at a nice little

                        road from where everyone else is 
                        staying for the reception. Thought 
                        you might appreciate some space, 
                        also it’ll be fun.

                        and stakeout the bridesmaids from 
                        our room. I made sure it has a nice 
                        view.

                        Last time I checked your name 
                        wasn’t Bon Iver, and furthermore,

                        Ugh, Brooklyn. Blair and Michael 
                        live in Brooklyn. I wonder if he 
                        has a beard.

           Drew pumps gas as the numbers tick upwards. Miles sits in the

                        Blair, dude. Michelle’s not my 
                        soulmate. She’s my BFF fuck-buddy. 
                        There’s a difference. 

                                 MILES
                        Newsflash, that’s how it started 
                        with Blair. And it evolved, as 
                        relationships often do. Didn’t you 
                        see No Strings Attached?

                                 DREW
                        No. I saw Friends with Benefits 
                        instead. Mila has the hottest 
                        Kunis. And who knew Timberlake 
                        could act? 

                                 MILES
                        Blair...in the seventh grade. 
                             (pause)
                        Listen, Drew, in all seriousness, 
                        Michelle cares about you. She wants 
                        you. She’s there for you. She loves 
                        the you, you love. 

                                 DREW
                        Pipe down, Carrie Bradshaw. You 
                        love Blair and it just isn’t 
                        enough...

           The NOZZLE CLICKS and Drew holsters the gas gun. 

           EXT. THE 5 FWY - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew tear ass down the 5 Freeway, pot-smoke 
           BILLOWING out of the front seat. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JOLLY ROGER MOTEL AND BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The Two-Seater SL pulls into a dirt parking lot, in front of 
           a flashing sign that reads VACANCIES.

                                 MILES
                        Jesus, Drew. The Bates Motel was 
                        booked up? What the fuck is this 
                        place?

                                 DREW
                        The Jolly Roger Inn. 

                                 MILES
                        I need a drink. 

                                 DREW
                        Your wish is my command.  

           INT. JOLLY ROGER BAR - LATER

           Pool tables and bar stools. Thirtysomething and Forty-nothing 
           WAITRESSES carrying DRINK TRAYS. A few TRUCK DRIVERS sit in a 
           booth, drinking coffee.

           Miles and Drew play EIGHT BALL at a nearby POOL TABLE. Miles 
           completely biffs, missing his shot. 

           TWO GORGEOUS, OUT OF PLACE BRUNETTE GIRLS enter the bar, and 
           just about everyone including the DYKE working the fryer 
           takes notice. 

                                 GIRL #1
                        Lolz. What is this place, Jen?

           MOMENTS LATER

                                 DREW
                             (re: the girls)
                        Dinner is served. 

           INT. JOLLY ROGER INN - ROOM 125 - LATER

           Drew and Miles drink cans of Budweiser on their beds with 
           JEN, 28 -- great rack, denim, black boots -- and DAYNA, 27,  
           bomb body, now wearing a flannel, sweatpants and Uggs. 

           Drew and DAYNA on one bed. 

           MILES and JEN on the other.
                                 JEN
                        So you guys are really connoisseurs 
                        from Wine Spectator magazine? 

           Dayna explodes in hysterics, ripping hits from a little 
           travel PIPE. 

                                 MILES
                             (deadpan)
                        No. No. No. Drew was being 
                        sarcastic. We’re on our way to 
                        break up a wedding and steal the 
                        bride.

           Now Jen is laughing, too, flirtatiously tugging on Drew’s T-
           shirt with each cackle. 

                                 DAYNA
                        You’re too much. 

                                 MILES
                             (as if he were going to 
                              deliver a speech)
                        Blair...

                                 DREW
                             (shut it, Miles)
                        Yeah, he really is too much, isn’t 
                        he?
                             (ah hem cough at Miles)
                        Who wants to play a game?

           Miles CRACKS another beer.

                                 JEN
                        Oooh, ooh, I do. I do. 

                                 DAYNA
                             (singing)
                        Mi mi mi mi mi mi....

                                 DREW
                        It’s called last one to cum loses. 
                        Ready go! 

           Drew CLAPS and the lights GO OUT. 

                                 DAYNA (O.C.)
                             (cracks up over black)
                        Oh my god. I. Am. Stoned. 

           The girls CRACK UP and off their laughter we 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. JOLLY ROGER INN - ROOM 125 - FIVE MINUTES LATER

           Miles fumbles to put Drew’s Levi’s back on, closing the door 
           behind him, tripping over his shoes, flushed. Jen CHASES 
           after him, barefoot as she tries to get her boots back on, 
           all while still drinking a Bud. 

                                 JEN
                             (stoned, laughing)
                        Milhouse, hold up. 

                                 MILES
                        It’s okay, I can’t do this, and you 
                        don’t have to. I’m gonna go for a 
                        walk. Clear my head. 

                                 JEN
                        Can I walk with you?

           Miles doesn’t say yes or no, he simply slows to a pace where 
           she can catch up. 

           EXT. JOLLY ROGER IN - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Continuation of the prior scene. Walking. Talking. 

                                 MILES
                        Jen, you’re fly as hell, and fun, 
                        and I’d totally love to “Bangarang 
                        Rufio”, but I just can’t right now. 
                        I’m too in my own head. 

                                 JEN
                        I understand. Big day tomorrow from 
                        what I gather. You weren’t kidding, 
                        huh?

                                 MILES
                        Sadly, I am not. 

                                 JEN
                        She must be pretty special. Good 
                        thing you have Drew there as a 
                        backup for when the shit hits the 
                        fan. And Blanche? What’s with her 
                        and the wedding? Is there some 
                        logic explanation to this road 
                        trip, or are you acting solely on 
                        emotional impulses?

                                 MILES
                        It’s Blair. And you really wanna 
                        know?
                                 JEN
                        I asked...

                                 MILES (PRE-LAP)
                        Blair was my high school 
                        sweetheart. Naturally, we grew up 
                        and went to different colleges. 
                        Blair’s father eventually lost his 
                        job, and ended up moving the family 
                        to Palm Springs during our senior 
                        year due to financial issues.

                                                       BEGIN FLASHBACK:

           EXT. BARREN DESERT - PALM SPRINGS - FLASHBACK

           The middle of nowhere. Picture that scene with Cary Grant and 
           the plane in North by Northwest. 

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Last I heard, her Dad was giving 
                        flying lessons out of a prop plane.

           ANGLE ON: A PROP PLANE WHIZZES BY OVERHEAD...

           INT. PROP PLANE - UP IN THE SKY - CONTINUOUS

           Single engine Sessena. Three men cramped like three balls in 
           one sack.  

           Blair’s DAD, DEL, (late 40’s), think Phil Jackson with hidden 
           arm TATTOOS and a gun under the passenger seat of his SUV, 
           teaches TWO LATINOS in work clothes and Cartel cowboy hats 
           how to fly a plane. Javier sits NEXT to Del. Esquiviez sits 
           BEHIND them. 

                                 DEL
                             (into airplane mic)
                        Pay attention, Javier!

                                 MILES (V.O.)
                        Or maybe he was using the plane to 
                        sell weed. Either way. It was bad. 

           DEL tosses a BRICK OF WEED to Esquiviez, sitting in the jump 
           seat behind him.

                                 ESQUIVIEZ
                        Gracias, señor Delroy. 
           OFF the PROP PLANE careening right, dipping, we’re 

                                                               BACK TO:

           EXT. JOLLY ROGER IN - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Same as before. Miles pouring his heart out, Jen listening, 
           loving every second of this. She’s actually in hysterics. 
           It’s probably the weed, but still. 

                                 MILES
                        So, yeah, I’m gonna tell her she 
                        should leave all that behind and be 
                        with me. Start fresh. 

                                 JEN
                             (finishes laughing)
                        You’re funny. Crazy. But funny. 
                        I’ve had to pee in my pants since 
                        we met. That’s a good thing.   
                             (serious)
                        I think it’s great what you’re 
                        doing.

                                 MILES
                        I’m stuck in the past. 

                                 JEN
                        You’re a man who goes after what he 
                        wants. You’re in touch with your 
                        emotions. But I can tell...you have 
                        balls. It’s what grown women want. 
                             (pause)
                        And if you weren’t balls deep in 
                        your own head right now, you 
                        might’ve been balls deep in me 
                        because of it.

                                 MILES
                             (smiles)
                        I appreciate the direct candor with 
                        which you speak. Where you from? 
                        What are you doing out here? Who 
                        are you?

                                 JEN
                        Come on. 
                             (kisses Miles on the 
                              cheek)
                        Let’s go to bed, and I’ll tell ya’. 

           BEAT.
                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        And by bed I mean sleep. Deal?

                                 MILES
                        Deal. 

           Jen takes Miles arm and loops hers through it. It’s strange 
           how easy it is to tell strangers your deepest, darkest 
           secrets. 

           Miles and Jen head back towards the room, fast friends. 

           EXT. JOLLY ROGER INN - ROOM 125 - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Dayna and Jen EXIT the guys’ room and hop in their Prius, 
           parked right outside. It’s 7:30 AM, maybe. 

           INT. JOLLY ROGER INN - ROOM 125 - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew HIGH FIVE from BED TO BED. 

                                 DREW
                        Nothing like pre-marital sex to put 
                        you in the mood for a marital 
                        occasion. 

                                 MILES
                        I need coffee and nicotine and 
                        marijuana and bagels immediately. 

           EXT. JOLLY ROGER MOTEL AND BAR - AN HOUR LATER

           Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. 

           INT./EXT. DREW’S MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew, wearing slight variations on yesterday’s 
           outfits, DRIVE OUT of the parking lot, both smoking 
           cigarettes, sipping coffee, careening back onto the highway. 

           EXT. CALIFORNIA 5 HIGHWAY

           Establishing distance. The Mercedes FLIES down the highway in 
           a blaze of glory and thick POT-SMOKE. 
           INT./EXT. DREW’S MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE - LATER

           The car exits the highway...in the middle of nowhere, Napa 
           Valley, CA. 

           INT./EXT. DREW’S MERCEDES - LATER - SUNSET

           Drew swings the two-seater past a faded wooden gate, down a 
           nice pebbled driveway. There are TONS OF OTHER CARS of all 
           shapes and sizes parked, mainly a shit-ton of Priuses 
           (Priii?) and BMWs. 

           Drew drives up a bit to where there are a group of guests 
           mingling, GROOMSMEN. 

                                 MILES
                        What are you doing?

                                 DREW
                        It’s called recon. 

           Drew puts the car in PARK. 

           Out of nowhere, a BUTLER type appears.

                                 BUTLER
                        Are you guests of the 
                        Mendel/Baumstein wedding this 
                        weekend?

                                 DREW
                        Yes, my good man, we are. We’re 
                        staying just next door, but don’t 
                        want to miss the rehearsal dinner. 
                        Are we late? 

                                 BUTLER
                        Good show. It’s not ‘til half past 
                        seven. You have some time to wash 
                        up if you’d like. 

           Miles checks his iPhone -- they have 90 minutes. 

                                 DREW
                        You know what, let’s shower up and 
                        come back before we make our grand 
                        entrance. What did you say your 
                        name was?

                                 BUTLER
                        Alfred. And you gents are?...
                                 DREW
                        Call me Bruce. 
                             (turns to Miles)
                        This is my friend, Wayne. 

                                 MILES
                        We’ll be back.

           EXT. THE GRAPES OF WRATH INN - MINUTES LATER

           Drew past a sign that says FRONT DESK. It’s a quaint, fun bed 
           and breakfast, decorated light blue and purple with all 
           things winery related: plaques of the best years, bottles, 
           pictures of the yield, etc. 

           Miles takes pictures on his iPhone. 

           INT. GRAPES OF WRATH INN - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew stand at a makeshift CONCIERGE desk, ringing 
           the little BELL on the counter. Moments later, a lanky stoner-
           wino in a stained shirt and vest, TEDDY (31) greets them.

                                 TEDDY
                        Gentleman. Welcome to the Wrath. 
                        I’m Teddy. I’ll be your concierge. 
                        If you need anything, just press 
                        the 0 button on your in-room 
                        telephone. Last name?

           We notice his TEETH are stained purple. 

                                 MILES
                        Leibler. Party of two. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Ah, yes. I can do simple math. 

                                 DREW
                        Good to know. 

                                 TEDDY
                        Staying with us two nights, as part 
                        of the wedding next door, correct? 

                                 MILES
                        Yes. 

                                 DREW
                        I specified on the phone.
                                 TEDDY
                        Great. I’ve got you in a deluxe 
                        suite overlooking the vineyard, as 
                        well as the area where the wedding 
                        reception will be taking place. 
                        Perfect for spying, as you 
                        requested.

           Miles shoots Drew a look.

                                 TEDDY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll make up two keys. 

           Teddy disappears as HILARY PARKER (27, BLONDE, GREAT RACK) 
           appears, wine glass in hand, wearing “boyfriend” jeans, a 
           cute top and matching shoes. 

                                 HILARY
                        Miles...

                                 MILES
                             (hesitant)
                        Hil?! Hiya. Wow. You look great. 

                                 HILARY
                             (ecstatic)
                        Oh. Em. Hashem. Miles Leibler!! How 
                        long’s it been?

                                 MILES
                             (struggling)
                        Little over a year...what’s new?

                                 HILARY
                             (top of her lungs)
                        Surprise!

           Hilary holds up her HAND to show off a GIGANTIC DIAMOND 
           ENGAGEMENT RING.

                                 MILES
                        He went to Jared? 

                                 DREW
                        Looks more like Skip and Steve for 
                        Aaron Brothers if you ask me. 

                                 MILES
                        This is my friend, Drew. Drew, this 
                        is Hilary. 

                                 DREW
                        You know what, I remember you.
                                 HILARY
                        You do?

                                 DREW
                        Yeah. From Miles’ Bar Mitzvah. You 
                        were there, right? 1997? You gave a 
                        little speech with a group of girls 
                        if memory serves correct. I think 
                        it was a poem, actually. 

                                 HILARY
                        Yeah, I was thirteen. Cray.

                                 DREW
                        Yes. In the cadence of Kanye, that 
                        shit is certainly cray. 

                                 MILES
                        Who’s the lucky guy?

                                 DREW
                        Do we get to meet him?

                                 HILARY
                        Yes. Derek. He’s upstairs 
                        unpacking. I came down to drink 
                        with some of my girlfriends. 

           Immediately an iPhone RINGS. Hilary reaches for her back 
           pocket.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                             (to Miles and Drew)
                        Sorry...

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hi honey. Be right there. Just ran 
                        into some old friends.

           She HANGS UP the call, heading in another direction, but 
           turns around.

                                 HILARY (CONT’D)
                        Miles. Room Syrah 323. Let’s catch 
                        up.

           Miles just nods as Teddy returns with the KEYS.

                                 TEDDY
                        Here you are, boys. Merlot 421.

           Drew grabs the KEYS from Teddy, nearly swiping them from his 
           hands like Houdini. 
           INT. WRATH INN HALLWAY - FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Drew lug their overnight duffels and backpacks to 
           their room. Drew’s SUNGLASSES are back on. 

                                 DREW
                        She totally wants to fuck you, 
                        dude.

                                 MILES
                        You’re crazy, man. She’s engaged! 

                                 DREW
                        She’s a bridesmaid, you clown. She 
                        wants to get plowed like fresh 
                        Aspen powder. It’s what they do. 

                                 MILES
                        Drew. Her husband’s here!!

                                 DREW
                        Fiancé! It’s not official yet. You 
                        know, kinda like why you’re here: 
                        to save the bride from a life of 
                        institutionalized bullshit with 
                        that ding-dong Mendel before she 
                        MARRIES him. 

                                 MILES
                             (re: Michael)
                        Fucking dipshit. 

                                 DREW
                             (imitating Hilary)
                        ‘Syrah 323. Let’s catch up.’ 
                             (back to voice)
                        ie “lets sit on each other’s faces 
                        and see who cries ‘uncle’ first. 
                        Jesus, Ray Charles. Read the 
                        fucking signs. 

           A SIGN reads Rooms 400-425 --> 

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        This way.

           The boys turn the corner, arriving at their destination. 

           Drew puts the KEY in the door and turns. 
           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 - CONTINUOUS

           Drew FLIPS ON the lights. It’s quaint and comfy, the type of 
           place a forty-year old gay couple would really appreciate 
           spending a long weekend. 

           Miles drops his bag immediately, turning into the bathroom.

           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Lights AUTO ON. Sink. Shower. Toilet. Nice soaps and 
           towelettes. 

           Miles stands, PISSING into the toilet. 

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY BETWEEN BATH/BEDROOM: 

                                 MILES
                             (hollering)
                        What are you gonna wear tonight? 

                                 DREW (O.C.)
                        I was thinking my black Theory 
                        slacks with the Gucci loafers.

                                 MILES
                        For someone without a real job you 
                        have very expensive taste. 

                                 DREW (O.C.)
                             (yelling back)
                        I stole the pants when I worked at 
                        Bloomingdale’s. The shoes -- 
                        they’re my Dad’s. 

                                 MILES
                        You wanna shower first? 

                                 DREW (O.C.) 
                        Naw. You go first, I’m gonna shut 
                        my eyes for fifteen. 

           CU: We see Andrew texting Michelle on his iPhone. Cute Emoji 
           icons, and other pleasantries. “Wedding’s dope. lookin’ fly. 
           Miss U. Wish you were here. XO.” 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Miles begins to undress, turning ON the SHOWER next to him. 
           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 - LATER

           Miles and Drew IN TOWELS, so fresh and so clean. They look 
           good, ready to attack. Miles pushes PLAY on an iPod dock as 
           “In Motion” by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross begins.(It’s 
           from the Social Network, immediately recognizable -- Google 
           it.)

           QUICK CUTS:

           1. Miles powdering his hands/balls with GOLD BOND like an 
           Olympic gymnast. 

           2. Drew putting on swanky multi-colored SOCKS you might find 
           at Paul Smith.

           3. Miles spraying RIGHT GUARD in slo-mo under his arms in the 
           mirror. REVEAL: Drew clapping next to him, pumping him up.

           4. Miles unzipping a bifold that reads “BARNEY’S, NEW YORK.”

           5. Drew sprays cologne into the air and JUMPS into it. 

           6. Miles adjusts a TIE in the mirror, dapper as fuck. 

           7. Drew dusts off his Dad’s Gucci loafers with a shoe-mitt, 
           stamped “The Grapes of Wrath” embroidered with a W. 

           8. Drew pulls out a small bottle of Johnny Walker Black.

           9. The boys each down 2 SHOTS.

           10. The boys EXIT THE ROOM, SUITED AND BOOTED, slamming the 
           door behind them. 

                                                        END MONTAGE AND 
                                                               CUT TO: 

           EXT. THE REHEARSAL DINNER COCKTAIL PARTY - 7:27 PM

           Guests mix and mingle in their fabulous cocktail attire on a 
           lush green GRASS illuminated by dangling TWINKLY LIGHTS and 
           CHINESE LANTERNS. Lot of summer colors mixed in with navy 
           blues, blacks and whites. 

           We can see that behind magnificent WHITE CURTAINS, there is a 
           TENT where dinner will be later served. 

           It’s warm out. Miles is visibly SWEATING. 
                                 MILES
                        This is such a bad idea. Let’s 
                        abort. 

                                 DREW
                        No choice, pro-choice. Just follow 
                        my lead. You’re great at making 
                        shit up. 

                                 MILES
                        Why can’t I just be myself?

                                 DREW
                        You can. You know what I mean. Have 
                        a little fun. 

           A BLONDE BABE CATERER (20’s) walks by with a tray of 
           champagne. Drew takes two, hands one to Miles.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                             (to the babe)
                        Gracias. 

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Here here. To us. To you. To Blair. 
                        To life. Cheers. 

                                 MILES
                        L’chaim. 

           They CLINK glasses. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. THE REHEARSAL DINNER TENT - LATER

           CLINKING glasses for Blair and Michael, a cheers for their 
           guests as Michael finishes his welcome toast, playing it up 
           for his audience. 

           Michael rocks a BEARD with a sweater worn over a collared 
           shirt and tie with chinos, your average geek stink-breath 
           holding a MICROPHONE. 

           Blair, on the other hand, is effortlessly stunning, as per 
           usual. Why she’s with him is anybody’s guess. 

           Seated next to them at the TABLE are Blair and Michael’s 
           parents DEL and BARB, and siblings, (MATT, Blair’s 33 year 
           old brother, and his wife, ANNIE, also 33), grandparents, 
           cousins and the like. 
                                 MICHAEL
                             (into the mic)
                        We are so lucky to have you all 
                        here with us, tonight and tomorrow, 
                        as we celebrate the first day of 
                        the rest of our lives. I just 
                        wanted to say, Blair, I love you. 
                        You’re the best thing that ever 
                        happened to me. 

           We find Drew and Miles, at the very back of the room, at a 
           rogue table with the family outcasts. 

                                 DREW
                        Think that applies to us? The bit 
                        about how lucky he is that we’re 
                        here for him?

                                 MILES
                        Pass the olive oil, fool. 

                                 DREW
                        I’m just curious if he has any clue 
                        that we’re here to ruin his 
                        wedding, and his life in general.

                                 MILES
                             (dipping his bread)
                        I don’t think he does, no. 

           INT. THE REHEARSAL DINNER TENT - DESSERT - LATER

           Miles has his tie undone. Drew is flirting with some 
           BRIDESMAID next to him, twirling her hair. Everyone looks 
           good and feels great. 

           Miles RISES, places his hand on Drew’s shoulder. 

                                 MILES
                        I’m going in. 

                                 DREW
                        Godspeed, You Black Emperor. 

                                 MILES
                        Huh?

                                 DREW
                        Obscure Indie band reference. I’m 
                        drunk. May the Schwartz be with 
                        you. Better? 
                                 MILES
                        Star Wars and a play on my mother’s 
                        maiden name? Now, THAT I can get 
                        behind.

                                 DREW
                        Get your girl, Luke. It’s why we 
                        came. Be brave. Clenched fists. 
                        I’ll be here, flirting with Stacey 
                        until the Millenium Falcon is ready 
                        to fly again. 

                                 BRIDESMAID
                        It’s Macy.  

                                 DREW
                             (to Macy)
                        Right. And you can call me Lando 
                        Calrissian. 

           And with that, Miles is OFF. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Miles walks over to Blair, standing with some older relative 
           types, laughing and hugging. No sign of Michael or her 
           father, not to mention Hilary. The coast looks clear. Miles 
           approaches her. He seems calm and collected, or just full of 
           drunken courage. 

           Blair looks over, doing the DOUBLE TAKE OF THE CENTURY, her 
           heart beating X 1,000. It’s as if she can’t believe her eyes. 
           Even worse, she can. And she does. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (whispering)
                        Miles. What are you doing here? 

                                 MILES
                        Jesus, Blair. You look amazing. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Seriously! What are you doing?!

                                 MILES
                        I just finished the tiramisu. It 
                        was divine. Robust. Rich. Subtle 
                        almond undertone. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (laughing, sort of)
                        No, really. Quit joking. What are 
                        you doing in Napa?
                                 MILES
                             (too much)
                        I’m here to watch you walk down the 
                        aisle. To get married. Without me.

           Blair looks around, as if she needs to take a deep breathe 
           before she goes on a tirade of verbal soliloquy. Luckily, she 
           doesn’t have to. 

           Suddenly, a BEARDED pair of LIPS enters frame, kissing Blair 
           on the cheeks before a peck on the mouth. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Michael, this is Miles. He’s an old 
                        friend of mine from high school. He 
                        was my first boyfriend, actually. 

           Michael extends his hand. In the other Michael holds a FLUTE 
           of champagne. Miles reluctantly offers his own for a shake. 

                                 MILES
                             (this sucks)
                        Pleasure to meet you. 
                        Congratulations. Blair’s the best.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (dick)
                        Miles. Yes, I’ve heard so little 
                        about you. Pleasure’s all mine. 
                        Nice to finally meet you. 

           A WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER turns their way and begins snapping 
           PHOTOS of the awkward trio. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Guys, get together. This is great. 
                        How do you all know each other?!

                          MICHAEL
                                                          MILES
           Old Friends.
                                              He stole my wife.   

           POV OF PHOTOGRAPHER THROUGH THE CAMERA VIEWFINDER: MICHAEL, 
           BLAIR, MILES. AWKWARD AS FUCK.  

           And that’s when Drew arrives, just in the knick of time, 
           holding a half-empty GLASS of Scotch. 

                                 DREW
                             (interrupting)
                        Hi. Nice to meet you, I’m Drew. 

           Blair’s eyes open wider than WE BOUGHT A ZOO. 
           What. The. Fuck? She looks as if she could go into cardiac 
           arrest at any moment. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        And how do you know Blair?

                                 DREW
                        I took her virginity. 

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                             (unaware)
                        Okay, everybody together, one more 
                        time!!

           POV OF PHOTOGRAPHER THROUGH THE CAMERA VIEWFINDER: DREW GRABS 
           HIS CROTCH AND GIVES THE MIDDLE FINGER LIKE JOHNNY CASH. 
           BLAIR LOOK LIKE SHE’S DYING INSIDE, MILES MORE SO. MICHAEL’S 
           SIMPLY CONFUSED. 

           BULB FLASHES AS:

           BLAIR’S FATHER, DEL (50), comes out of left field, SEEING 
           Miles.

                                 DEL
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Miles, what the hell do you think 
                        you’re doing!??!? 

           Michael JUMPS IN with his two cents, as if to prove his worth 
           to Del -- 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (tough guy routine)
                        I got this, Del. I can fight my own 
                        battles... 

                                 MILES
                        I know you can fight. But it’s our 
                        wits that make us men.

                                 DEL
                        Did you just quote Braveheart?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Miles)
                        Enough already. Play time’s over. 
                        I’m gonna end your life. 
                                 DREW
                             (Scottish accent)
                        Many years from now, would you be 
                        willin' to trade ALL the days, from 
                        this day to that, for one chance, 
                        just one chance, to come back here 
                        and tell our enemies that they may 
                        take our wives, but they'll never 
                        take... OUR FREEDOM!  

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Miles)
                        Come at me, bro! 

           And he does --

           BOOM! Michael SWINGS, connecting his fist to Miles’ nose, 
           COLD-COCKING him TO THE FLOOR. 

           POV OF PHOTOGRAPHER THROUGH THE CAMERA VIEWFINDER: MILES ON 
           THE FLOOR, NOSE-BLEEDING, BLAIR RUNNING OFF, MICHAEL CHASING 
           AFTER HER, DREW BEING HELD BACK FROM MICHAEL BY DEL. ALL HELL 
           HAS BROKEN LOOSE. 

           SNAP. FLASHBULB. SNAP. SNAP. 

           REVEAL: The videographer, (30’s, BOW-TIE) got the whole 
           thing, too. 

                                 VIDEOGRAPHER
                             (to photographer)
                        We got the shot! 

           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 - LATER

           Miles sits in an oversized LOVE SEAT with his head held back 
           towards the sky, a WAD OF KLEENEX pressed close to his BLOODY 
           NOSE. He looks like shit, his shirt is thrashed with BLOOD 
           and DIRT, HIS EYES are puffy, most likely from crying. 

           Miles docks his iPhone into the little speaker unit and 
           presses PLAY. “Someone Like You” by Adele plays. It’s 
           hilariously pathetic. 

           “Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you. I wish nothing but 
           the best for you. Don’t forget me, I beg. I remember you 
           said, sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts 
           instead.”

           Drew puffs from yet another JOINT, pouring each of them a 
           healthy dose of Black Label.
                                 DREW
                        Everything’s going to be fine, 
                        Miles. I know it looks like the 
                        worst day of your life, but dude, 
                        this is what it’s all about. This 
                        is life. And life is dudes. 

           Miles removes the KLEENEX from his NOSE long enough to speak. 

                                 MILES
                             (fed up, nasal)
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about, Drew? It’s over. I just 
                        ruined Blair’s wedding. Michael 
                        just knocked me unconscious. You 
                        just told him that you’re the first 
                        man to ever put his penis in his 
                        wife! 

                                 DREW
                        Wayne Gretzky says you miss 100% of 
                        the shots you don’t take. 

                                 MILES
                        I wanna go home. 

                                 DREW
                        Quit your bitching! One day you and 
                        Blair are gonna run away together, 
                        have babies, fight over who’s 
                        taking the kids to soccer practice 
                        and you’ll live happily ever after. 
                        I can feel it.  

                                 MILES
                        Oh, cut the shit. I should’ve never 
                        come here. I’m going for a walk. 

           Miles goes for the DOOR when just then, there’s a LOUD KNOCK. 

           Drew SHRUGS his shoulders. Miles opens it -- 

           INT. WRATH INN HALLWAY - OUTSIDE ROOM 421 - CONTINUOUS

           REVEALING BLAIR, standing with TEARS IN HER EYES at Miles 
           doorstep, just like he always wanted, except, ya know, never 
           like this. Holy. Fucking. Shit. Balls.  

           Both of them have looked better. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Hi.
                                 MILES
                        I was just leaving. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Can we talk first? 

           With the DOOR TO THE ROOM STILL OPEN, Miles TURNS AROUND to 
           shoot Drew a look. Without saying a word, Drew gives Miles a 
           THUMPS UP. Apparently, all is forgotten for the moment. 

           Miles CLOSES the door. They begin to walk.

           EXT. THE GRAPES OF WRATH INN - GARDEN AREA

           And talk. 

           Miles and Blair stroll together on a stone portion of a 
           little fountain type thing. It’s cute. Well-light by 
           LANTERNS.  

           We hear crickets and nighttime noises. 

                                 MILES
                        So... I’m sorry your husband 
                        punched me in the face. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Me too. He’ll live. 

                                 MILES
                        You okay?

                                 BLAIR
                        Yeah. 

           AWKWARD BEAT. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                             (genuine)
                        Miles, why are you here?

                                 MILES
                             (deep breath, still a 
                              little drunk)
                        Blair. I’m here. 
                             (starts again)
                        I’m here because I love you. When I 
                        first met you, I loved you so much 
                        I hated you, and was mean to you 
                        because of it. I’ve loved you since 
                        we were eighth graders listening to 
                        Dave Matthews Band and watching 
                        Dawson’s Creek. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        I loved you when you were having 
                        sex with my best friend. I loved 
                        you when you were in fact, mine. 
                        You moved away and we went to other 
                        schools, but I always felt 
                        comfortable in my life that at the 
                        end of the day, when all was said 
                        and done, you’d be there, and we’d 
                        be together. That you and I were 
                        irreplaceable. A team. Blair and 
                        Miles. Like Bonnie and Clyde. 
                        Fergie and Josh Duhamel. Jay-Z and 
                        Beyoncé... 

           Blair LAUGHS. They continue to walk. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                             (pause, sips Stella)
                        What I have with you, this feeling, 
                        the electricity when I think of 
                        you, or when I’m with you, I don’t 
                        have that with anyone else in the 
                        history of my existence. The 
                        thought of letting you and that 
                        feeling just walk out of my life 
                        scared the living shit out of me, 
                        and I’d rather let your fiancé beat 
                        me to a bloody pulp in public than 
                        wake up one day and realize I 
                        willingly let you go without a 
                        fight. So here I am. 

                                 BLAIR
                        No, Miles. Why are you here? 

                                 MILES
                        What do you mean?

                                 BLAIR
                        Why are you in Napa? Why did you 
                        drive up here? 

                                 MILES
                        I came to see you get married.  
                        Well, to keep you from getting 
                        married. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t you think that’s a little 
                        weird?

                                 MILES
                        Why is that weird?  You invited me 
                        to the wedding. Did you think I’d-
                                 BLAIR
                             (dead serious)
                        No I didn’t.  

                                 MILES
                        What? Yeah, you did, I have the 
                        invitation right here.

           Miles REACHES into his SUIT JACKET, retrieving his now FOLDED 
           invite. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        See, here. 

           Blair takes one look at the invite, covering her mouth with 
           her hand. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 BLAIR
                        This isn’t my invite. 

                                 MILES
                        What do you mean?

                                 BLAIR
                        That tacky stationary store 
                        prototype isn’t my wedding invite, 
                        Miles. 

           And it’s official: Miles is officially crazy, a broken man, 
           no chance but to go Ghost Protocol on a love Mission 
           Impossible. Miles is CRUSHED with a capital K. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do this. I don’t know what 
                        you thought coming here would 
                        resolve, or do for YOU. But what do 
                        you want me to say? That I don’t 
                        love Michael and all these years 
                        have been waiting for you, for this 
                        moment, that all signs lead to now? 
                        You’ve always been a hopeless 
                        romantic, and as much as I’d love 
                        to live out that whole idea of you 
                        and I, and sneaking off in the 
                        night together, it’s not real. And 
                        it can’t be. Not now. Can’t we just 
                        have had our time? 
                                 MILES
                        But it is our time, you see. It’s 
                        never over. It doesn’t just go 
                        away. If it did I wouldn’t be here. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It takes two people to fall in 
                        love, to get married, to stay in 
                        love, Miles. You’ll realize that 
                        when it IS your time. 

                                 MILES
                        You’re not in love with Michael. I 
                        know it. I can tell.  

                                 BLAIR
                        Who do you think you are? That you 
                        can just come to my wedding and 
                        tell me how I feel? Because you 
                        think you know me? You haven’t 
                        known the real me in years, Miles. 
                        High school is over and so are we. 
                        Grow up.  

                                 MILES
                             (jugular)
                        You and I both know that if your 
                        family wasn’t in dire financial 
                        straights, with your Dad selling 
                        weed via his prop plane in Palm 
                        Springs, that you would’ve come 
                        home to Los Angeles after college 
                        and you and I would’ve picked up 
                        where we left off, been together 
                        again. But instead, you decided to 
                        get engaged to the first lawyer you 
                        met at college, therefore ensuring 
                        that you wouldn’t have to make a 
                        decision like moving based on money 
                        ever again. You made the biggest 
                        relationship decision of your life 
                        based on money instead of love, 
                        without even thinking of me and us. 
                        When will you realize THAT?!

           Blair holds back tears as hard as she can. 

                                 BLAIR
                        You’re an asshole, Miles. Go home. 

           Blair WALKS OFF, leaving Miles standing there with his heart 
           on his sleeve and the phantom wedding invite in his hand. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE GRAPES OF WRATH INN - CONTINUOUS

           A few couples, most likely guests of the B&B linger, drinking 
           coffee by the entrance. 

           Miles is VISIBLY foaming at the mouth, walking with CLENCHED 
           FISTS. If dorky Jewish looks could kill -- these would be 
           those looks. 

           INT. WRATH INN, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           We hear MOANING from inside the room. Miles retrieves the 
           shitty ROOM KEY from his pocket, and with an electronic 
           click, we’re --

           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Miles is LIT from the hallway, only until the door 
           closes. 

           IT’S DARK, but for the a NIGHT-LIGHT shooting out from the 
           BATHROOM. 

           ON THE BED Drew goes to town on a female wedding-goer, 
           grunting the way that Derek Jeter probably does when he bangs 
           underage girls he meets out at bars. 

           Drew STOPS PUMPING long enough just to turn around.

                                 DREW
                             (pissed)
                        Miles?! What the fuck?

           Miles HOLDS UP THE WEDDING INVITE, so that we can just make 
           it out in the PITCH BLACK. 

                                 MILES
                        Tell me this isn’t you. 

                                 DREW
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

           MILES SWITCHES ON THE LIGHT TO REVEAL the girl under Drew is 
           Hilary PARKER, the girl from high-school, from the check-in 
           scene earlier that evening. The least of Miles’ problems. 

           ON Drew, noticing the INVITATION in Miles’ hand. 

                                 MILES
                             (to Hilary)
                        GET. OUT. 
                                 DREW
                        Seriously? What’s your problem?

           Miles THROWS the fake wedding invite at Drew. 

                                 MILES
                             (screams)
                        What’s my problem? What’s my 
                        problem? Don’t move or I’ll fucking 
                        kill you, Drew. 

           WITHIN SECONDS Hilary slides out from under from Drew, 
           gathering her belongings, HEELS IN HAND, scurrying off, 
           opening and closing the DOOR as she exits.  

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Do you realize what I’ve just done?  

                                 DREW
                        Stood up for yourself? Refused to 
                        throw in the towel? Torched your 
                        white flag. Went after the girl of 
                        your dreams? Take the tampon out of 
                        your ass and put it back in your 
                        cunt. Listen to yourself, stop 
                        being such a fucking pussy, Miles. 
                        It’s never over. I’m telling you, 
                        it isn’t over.

           Whoa. It went there. Miles STANDS, gets in Drew’s FACE. 
           Drew’s still naked. 

                                 MILES
                        Fuck you, Drew. YOU LIED. You made 
                        a fake invitation to Blair’s 
                        wedding! I should have never 
                        trusted you. You’re the same 
                        asshole that took her virginity. 
                             (almost crying)
                        I didn’t want to come. But worse, 
                        I’m here under false pretenses 
                        because my best friend in the world 
                        convinced me that it’s my destiny 
                        to be here...convincing me that she 
                        wanted me to be here. 
                             (pause)
                        Is this fun for you? Like some 
                        movie, you can just sit back and 
                        eat your popcorn, asshole? This 
                        isn’t the fucking Graduate, Drew. 
                        It’s my life.  
                                 DREW
                        Miles, your obsession was spiraling 
                        out of control. You’re stuck in the 
                        past and it’s fucking with you in 
                        the present. 
                             (pause)
                        I took matters into my own hands. 
                        Michelle’s fiancé has a mutual 
                        friend that got invited to Blair’s 
                        wedding, and when she told me, I 
                        had to act. I couldn’t watch you 
                        live like this. So I had a fake 
                        invite made and sent from New York. 
                        It was all I could do. I did this 
                        for you --

                                 MILES
                             (interrupting)
                        For me? You did this for yourself. 
                        See, you have a girl that actually 
                        WANTS to marry you. Michelle may be 
                        not be Bar Rafaeli or Kate 
                        Middleton, but she’s pretty cool. 
                        And hot. She loves you. She also 
                        happens to be loaded. But you’re 
                        too scared to commit to loving her 
                        back because you’re afraid of 
                        turning thirty without owning your 
                        own house, being your own man, or 
                        having been deemed successful by 
                        your parents, or whatever that 
                        means in your head.

           BEAT. Drew VISIBLY foaming at the mouth. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        You’re a little boy, Drew. At least 
                        I know what I want: Blair. You, you 
                        have no idea. Afraid to take 
                        chances. A shot. Roll the dice. 
                        You’re lost, so you live with me to 
                        feel young. You’re full of shit and 
                        liquid courage like the rest of 
                        ‘em. Do me a favor. Turn thirty and 
                        grow up.

           The color drains from Drew’s face.

           Drew LUNGES at Miles, shattering an ANTIQUE CLUB CHAIR in the 
           process. The iPhone song from the DOCK changes in the process 
           of all the rough and tumble.

           MUSIC CUE: “Best of My Love” by The Emotions
           They end up on the FLOOR, rolling around in their suits 
           (Miles in Armani, Drew in his birthday suit), screaming at 
           each other. Miles on top of Drew at first -- 

           Miles puts HIS HANDS AROUND Drew’S NECK.

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to fucking kill you!!

                                 DREW
                             (choked)
                        Not if your nose doesn’t stop 
                        bleeding. 

           BOOM! Drew POPS Miles in the NOSE, and MORE BLOOD BEGINS 
           SQUIRTING ALL OVER THE PLACE like something out of a 
           Tarantino movie. 

           Drew’s UP again. Miles RISES, stumbling, holding onto an 
           armoire for balance --

           TURNS BACK TO Drew, KNEELS him in the GROIN. 

           Drew goes down again, crumbling TO THE FLOOR. 

                                 MILES
                        Suck my dick, homewrecker. 

                                 DREW
                             (coughing on floor)
                        Present it.

           Drew STICKS OUT HIS TONGUE, wagging it at Miles. Egging him 
           on. 

                                 MILES
                             (sobbing)
                        We done? You had enough?  

           Drew doesn’t respond. 

           Miles grabs his iPhone. The music STOPS. PACKS up his CLOTHES 
           on the BED, throwing everything together in a jumbled, 
           drunken mess. 

           Scans the room. Takes the set of CAR KEYS from the FLOOR. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Good. I’m going to get the car and 
                        we’re leaving. Gather your shit and 
                        meet me outside in ten minutes.
           Miles throws his SUIT COAT over his shoulder, wipes his NOSE 
           on the SLEEVE of his shirt, takes his DUFFEL by the handles 
           and WALKS INTO THE HALLWAY. 

           Drew CHASES AFTER --

           INT. WRATH INN HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 

           Miles, frantically standing by the ELEVATORS with azaeilias 
           on a nearby credenza. Miles keeps PUSHING the button for 
           going down, avoiding Drew. 

                                 DREW
                        Miles. Stop. Wait.

                                 MILES
                        Seriously. Fuck off. Stop following 
                        me. 

                                 DREW
                        You’re not going anywhere. 

           DING! The elevator OPENS and Miles steps in --

                                 MILES
                        Watch me.

           The elevator door CLOSES on Drew. 

                                 DREW
                             (to himself)
                        Well shit on my chest.

           EXT. GRAPES OF WRATH INN - OUTSIDE PATIO - A FEW MINUTES 
           LATER

           It’s dark, and we can only see the OUTLINE OF THEIR SUITS IN 
           THE DARK. 

           We hear the CRUNCH of the pebbles beneath their feet. 

           Miles is nearly seventy yards from Drew. 

                                 DREW
                        Miles, wait! 

           No response.

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Come on, man. Wait up a sec!
           Miles gives him the FINGER without ever turning around, 
           sticking his hand in the air. 

           Drew BEGINS RUNNING (without shoes on, post coitus-
           interruptus).

           EXT. DOWN THE PEBBLE ENTRANCE PATH A BIT - OFF PARKING LOT - 
           CONTINUOUS

           Cars and cars and cars. Miles ZIG ZAGS through, searching for 
           the Benz. FOUND.

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE BENZ - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Miles sticks the KEYS in the cardoor, OPENING IT just as an 
           out-of-breath Drew catches up, CLOSING IT with the PALM of 
           his hand. 

                                 MILES
                        What do you want? Haven’t you done 
                        enough damage? I want to evaporate 
                        into a million little pieces. I 
                        want to go home. Get out of my way. 

           Miles goes for the CAR DOOR again, throws his duffel in the 
           CAR, actually gets in. 

           Drew PULLS HIM OUT BY THE SHIRT COLLAR. 

                                 DREW
                        This is what you’re going to do, 
                        Miles: you’re going to stand up, be 
                        a man, and watch Blair walk down 
                        that aisle with Michael tomorrow. 
                        You’re going to finish the final 
                        chapter of the Blair/Drew/Miles 
                        saga, close the book and get on 
                        with your life. If for no other 
                        reason than you not waking up one 
                        day when you’re 40 and hating me 
                        for NOT doing this. I know it’s 
                        eating you alive, but in order to 
                        move on, you need this, as wrong as 
                        it may seem in execution. You may 
                        not notice it today, or tomorrow at 
                        the wedding, but one day, you’ll 
                        thank me.  

                                 MILES
                             (breaking)
                        Do you have any idea how hard this 
                        is for me?

                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        To see Blair, at her wedding, a 
                        wedding I’m not the groom at, much 
                        less even invited to...

                                 DREW
                        I know, it’s heart-breaking. It 
                        sucks. But as you told me, it’s 
                        time to grow up. I’m gonna be there 
                        right next to you, for all of it. 
                        I’ve been standing next to you for 
                        27 years, and I’m not about to let 
                        you stand alone now, tomorrow, 
                        ever. I love you, Miles. If I were 
                        gay, I’d marry you. I really would. 

           This resonates with Miles, and as he takes a deep breath, he 
           lets it all wash over him. As hard as it might be to hear, 
           Miles knows that deep down, Drew’s right. 

           INT. THE BRIDAL SUITE - SAME TIME

           Blair, reading JUST KIDS by Patti Smith in bed by way of a 
           NIGHTLIGHT. We may or may not notice a bottle of Valium and a 
           glass of water perched on top of the nightstand, but it’s 
           there. 

           A KNOCK ON THE DOOR.

           INT. THE BRIDAL SUITE - DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 DEL
                        Blair, honey, it’s Dad. 

           Blair OPENS the door, revealing her Dad wearing a goofy 
           BATHROBE with Cowboys and Horses on it. Del holds a tiny GIFT 
           in his hand. 

                                 DEL (CONT’D)
                        Did I wake you?

                             (smiles)
                        No. Couldn’t exactly sleep with all 
                        the excitement around here. 

                                 DEL
                        Can I come in?

           INT. THE BRIDAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Blair and Del take a seat at the foot of her gigantic BED. 
                                 DEL
                        I’m sorry Michael punched Miles in 
                        the nose. 

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s okay. He deserved it. 

                                 DEL
                        We didn’t invite him, did we?

                                 BLAIR
                        No, but he came for me anyway. 

                                 DEL
                        I may have seen you two walking and 
                        talking earlier...

           INT. WRATH INN, ROOM 421 - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           The room’s a fucking disaster. Blood, guts and glory. FEMA 
           should probably get involved, and if not them, definitely the 
           hotel cleaning service. 

           Miles is asleep in BED, wearing only his bloody collared-
           shirt, BOXERS and ONE BLACK SOCK. To our surprise, the BEDS 
           ARE PUSHED TOGETHER and Drew is lying in bed with Miles, 
           somewhat entangled as the big spoon of the two. 

           They’re the cutest straight gay-couple you’ve ever seen. 

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. THE BRIDAL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Continuation of the prior scene with Del and Blair. 

                                 BLAIR
                        ...He crashed my wedding on the 
                        false pretense that I invited him. 
                        Ruined my rehearsal dinner. 
                        Embarrassed me in front of Michael! 
                        Kind of psychotic, no?  

                                 DEL
                        I feel kinda sorry for the guy, 
                        KareBlair. Have you talked to 
                        Michael about it?

                                 BLAIR
                        Not really. He just think Miles is 
                        an asshole.

                        putting all this childish nonsense 
                        with Miles behind me. 

           Del hands her THE GIFT. 

                                 DEL
                        I got you a little something. I 
                        wasn’t sure when to give it to you, 
                        but I wanted you to have it before 
                        tomorrow. 

           BEAT.

                                 BLAIR
                        Aww, Daddy. You didn’t have to. 

           Del hands her the wrapped GIFT. Blair OPENS IT. 

                                 DEL
                        It’s just a little something. For 
                        the honeymoon.

           EXT. THE GRAPES OF WRATH INN - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

           The birds are chirping. The sun BEAMS DOWN on Planet Earth. 
           It’s going to be a good day after all, a fantastic day for a 
           wedding.

           Miles wakes up, snaps to life, noticing the RED BLOOD on his 
           shirt, realizing where he is, and what day it is.

           Gorgeous scenery. Grapes. Foliage. Wineries. Trees. The 
           California sun. It’s perfect out. 

           Miles and Drew ZIP THROUGH windy little roads, passing 
           different wineries and vineyards. Miles smokes yet ANOTHER 
           JOINT.

           The type of place you buy beef jerky at on the way to 
           Mammoth. 

           Drew pulls into the tiny DIRT LOT and PARKS.

           Wines on wines on wines. Red. Whites. Rosé. Cheeses of all

           deli counter shows the sandwiches of the day. 

           Drew steps up to the deli counter.

                        Normally, I’d say yes, but I can’t 
                        be having diarrhea today. Going to 
                        a wedding.

           Drew whips past a little WOODEN FENCE, down another tiny dirt 
           road, parking a hundred yards from the biggest, tallest TREE 
           YOU’VE EVER SEEN.

           Parks. The Boyz II Men exit their car and head over to the 
           tree. 

           EXT. - THE TREE - CONTINUOUS

           Drew and Miles plop down underneath the expanse of leaves. 
           Drew unfolds a GIANT BLANKET. Makes a nice little sitting 
           area for the two of them. 

           Drew takes out a DUSTY, OLD bottle of FERRARI CARANO WINE, 
           labeled vintage 1975.

                                 DREW
                        The year was 1975. 8-tracks were 
                        the format of music. Mood rings 
                        were en vogue. Women had bushes 
                        like whoa. Jaws was the movie of 
                        the year, and Gerald Ford was 
                        president. Cocaine was everywhere, 
                        thanks to our good friend Pablo 
                        Escobar.

                        And...
                                 DREW
                        This bottle of wine right here, 
                        this shit right here, was given by 
                        your parents to mine the night of 
                        their wedding. It’s older than you 
                        or I. I stole it from their cellar. 

                                 MILES
                        And the tree?

                                 DREW
                        It’s where Axl Rose asked Stephanie 
                        Seymour to marry him in 1993. He 
                        took her to this exact spot. Axl 
                        wrote “Don’t Cry” and “November 
                        Rain” for her, probably thinking 
                        back to this very spot, where you 
                        and I now sit. It’s what inspired 
                        him. It’s the most romantic place 
                        on the planet -- in my humble 
                        opinion.  

           Drew pulls up a picture on his iPhone: 

           CU: AXL and STEPHANIE sitting under this tree so many years 
           ago. They look hilarious, Axl’s long, silly hair, Stephanie 
           gazing at him, in love.

                        You were eight years old. I was 
                        eleven. I figured no better way to 
                        get you in the mood for a wedding 
                        then to booze on a seven hundred 
                        dollar of Pinot where your musical 
                        idol asked his girlfriend to marry 
                        him.

                                 MILES
                        They broke up three weeks after 
                        they got engaged. Axl’s a fat 
                        burnout. Chinese Democracy? 

                                 DREW
                        That’s not the point, dingleberry. 
                        Thought you could use a little 
                        lovin’, a little Axl, and some very 
                        expensive, high class booze to get 
                        you through the day.  

           Drew UNCORKS the WINE, pours it into two PLASTIC CUPS for he 
           and Miles.

                        Stephanie Leibler. To Blair. To Us. 
                        I’m proud of you, Miles. I’m sorry 
                        it ended up like this. I love you, 
                        you’re my best friend. 

                                 MILES
                        I needed a good kick in the ass.
                             (pause)

                        I didn’t bone her. I couldn’t. We 
                        walked and talked about Blair. I 
                        know, it’s a cop out.

                        I know.

                        You do?

                        Of course, man.

                                 MILES
                        Does that make me a pussy?

                                 DREW
                        No, Miles. It makes you, well, you. 
                        It’s why I’m friends with you. 
                        You’re loyal, even when you 
                        shouldn’t be, like today, after 
                        what I put you through last night. 
                        I’m sorry. You’re my best friend, 
                        and I’m sorry.

                        Love means never having to say 
                        you’re sorry.

                        Let’s eat. I’ve got a hangover that 
                        feels like our founding fathers are 
                        taking a jacuzzi in the bowels of 
                        my stomach.  

           HOLD WIDE ON the boys eating, laughing, drinking wine, 
           forgetting all their troubles for a second. Things seem to be 
           in their right place for the first time since we started this 
           God awful mess.

           The boys teeter back over to the car, loading up the trunk, 
           both visibly TANKED. Miles has a PURPLE WINE STAIN on his

           The car WEAVES back and forth between two lanes as the 
           opening piano chords and strings set the tone. 

           Drew and Miles sing to each other, with PURPLE TEETH, poorly 
           imitating Axl’s falsetto, playing air-guitar during Slash’s 
           solo, crushing their best version of a GNR tribute.

           Drew and Miles pull back into the parking lot, killing the

           Drew and Miles. Suited and Booted, like some bizarre version

           than a polar bear’s toe-nail.

           Miles and Drew make their way over to the reception in SLO-

           back.

           A motif whiter than the paper this is printed on. Flowers. 
           Chairs. Yarmulkes. Twinkle lights under a Chuppah - the 
           traditional Jewish canopy.  

           A SIX PIECE STRING SECTION plays “Pachelbel Canon in D” -- 
           the Wedding Song you instantly recognize from every wedding 
           ever -- to an AUDIENCE OF A HUNDRED SOME-ODD. Everyone’s

           We find our men, standing side by side by the outcasts of the

           We land on BLAIR, standing with DEL, taking a few breathes 
           before walking down the aisle. Blair NODS to Del, signaling 
           she’s ready.

           DOWN THE AISLE. 

           EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY RISES. 

           Blair turns her head, facing MILES because he stands in the 
           last row. THE TWO share an exchange, a look that could move 
           mountains, part seas. The stuff Homer and Alicia Keys write 
           about. 

           BLAIR KEEPS WALKING --

           Blair arrives at the ALTAR, glowing ear-to-ear smiles between 
           she and Michael. They look like the happiest couple you’ve 
           ever seen.

           We can read it all over Miles face, this part hurts. He’s got 
           a lump in his throat the size of a meatball. His eyes are

           Blair and Miles celebrate their ONE YEAR wedding anniversary, 
           drinking champagne and eating what looks like WEDDING CAKE a 
           year from now. 

           EXT. BLAIR AND MILES’ FIRST HOME - DRIVEWAY - THREE YEARS 
           LATER - FANTASY

           It’s the holidays. A BLINDFOLDED Blair is led outside to the 
           driveway, where a brand new BMW convertible is wrapped in a 
           gigantic RED BOW. 

           Miles removes the blindfold. Blair loses her shit -- JUMPS in 
           Miles’ arms. 

           INT. BLAIR AND MILES’ FIRST HOME - SIX YEARS LATER - FANTASY

           Blair runs out of the bathroom in a Guns N’ Roses T-shirt 
           (Miles) and underwear, holding a PREGNANCY TEST STICK. It’s 
           POSITIVE.  

           Blair CRIES, hugging Miles for dear life. They’re going to 
           have a family! 

           EXT. BLAIR AND MILES HOME - TWELVE YEARS LATER - FANTASY

           Miles and Blair are now physically older, wiser. Parents. The 
           convertible in the driveway has been traded in for a Volvo 
           station wagon and a second family sedan. 

           Just then TWO BOYS (5 years old) run out to the driveway in 
           AYSO Soccer uniforms. 
           EXT. BLAIR AND MILES’ HOME - FOURTEEN YEARS LATER - FANTAY

           Del, Miles, and TWO SEVEN YEAR OLD BOYS play basketball in 
           the driveway.

           Blair watches from the side, drinking a Bloody Mary. 

           Just then Miles SMILES at the love of his life, clearly not 
           paying attention to the game, missing a PASS from his son. 

           The BALL SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE taking us --

                        To be my wedded wife...

                                 RABBI
                        To love and to comfort from this

                        Blair, if you would please repeat

                        To be my lawful, wedded husband...

                                 RABBI
                        To love and to comfort from this 
                        day forward...

                                 BLAIR
                        To love and to comfort from this 
                        day forward...

                                 RABBI
                        The rings, please.

           Michael takes THE RING handed to him on a little PILLOW, 
           continuing to follow instructions from the rabbi.

           INT. THE WEDDING TENT - BACK ROW - CONTINUOUS

           Drew SQUEEZES Miles shoulder, signaling that he’s there for 
           him.

                                 MILES
                        I think I’m gonna hurl.

                                 DREW
                             (whispering)
                        Don’t. Vomit doesn’t exactly fit 
                        the decor.

                        happy, just as You made Your 
                        creation happy in the garden of 
                        Eden, so long ago. You are blessed, 
                        Lord, who makes the bridegroom and

                        I now pronounce you husband and 
                        wife.

           Blair and Michael begin to TEAR UP. Michael SMASHES HIS FOOT 
           DOWN ON A GLASS (as is Jewish custom). CRUNCH! 

                                 RABBI (CONT’D)
                        You may kiss the bride.

           Michael LIFTS Blair’s VEIL, and they kiss a LONG, HARD, 
           BURNING I LOVE YOU FOREVER wedding KISS.

           Even Drew CLAPS, moved by the moment, he just can’t help it. 

                                 DREW
                             (turns to Miles, still 
                              clapping)
                        You did it. It’s over. 

           Miles FAINTS -- collapsing to the floor in the back row just 
           as --

           INT. THE WEDDING TENT - THE AISLE - CONTINUOUS

           Michael and Blair WALK DOWN THE AISLE, officially husband and 
           wife, to an uproar of applause from their family members, 
           friends and loved ones. 

           INT. THE WEDDING TENT - BACK ROW - CONTINUOUS

           Frantically, Drew tries to get Miles back on his feet. No 
           dice. Drew has no choice but to drag him out of there like 
           he’s dealing with Weekend at Bernie’s. 

                                 DREW
                             (to Drunken Uncle)
                        Little help here?

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        It’s gonna cost you that doobie.

                                 DREW
                        I’ll give you a fuckin’ eighth! Now 
                        get his legs, Bukowski. 

           Drew and Drunken Uncle CARRY Miles out of there like they 
           have coals in their shoes. 

           EXT. THE PARTY TENT - MINUTES LATER

           Guests begin to gather around TALL COCKTAIL TABLES as 
           CATERERS bring around flutes of Champagne and appetizers. A 
           couple of old codgers light cigars in nearby lawn-chairs, a 
           bit removed from the party area. 

           EXT. NEARBY SHRUBS AROUND THE SIDE OF THE TENT - CONTINUOUS

           A patch of nearby shrubs. Drew and Drunk Uncle DROP MILES to 
           the floor, full force of gravity with him. 
                                 DREW
                        Miles! 

           Nothing.

           Drew HOOTS and HOLLERS, trying to wake him up like they do in 
           the NFL when a defensive linesman gets a concussion. Drew 
           CLAPS above his head, kneeling on his chest.   

           Nothing.

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        Pass me the bag of cannabis.

           Drew hands Drunken Uncle a bag of REEFER. 

           Drunken Uncle opens it, putting the bag to Miles’ NOSE, as if 
           they were smelling salts. 

           Immediately, Miles juts to life, COMES TO -- 

                                 MILES
                             (delirious)
                        I do. 

                                 DREW
                        Miles, while I’m flattered and all, 
                        I’m just happy you’re alive.

                                 MILES
                        I’m at Blair’s wedding aren’t I...

                                 DREW
                        Correct. 

                                 MILES
                        Punch me in the nose so I pass out 
                        again.

                                 DREW
                        Not a chance, get up. 

           Miles reaches out for A HAND to grab onto. Drew yanks him 
           back to his FEET. 

                                 MILES
                        Now what?

                                 DREW
                        Now? Now, we drink face. Rage.  

                                 MILES
                        Rage?
                                 DREW
                        Against the machine. The machine 
                        being the institution of marriage 
                        and Michael, that anvil-face 
                        fuckstick. 

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        Amen, brother. I’m buying.

                                 DREW
                        It’s open bar.

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        Exactly. 

                                 MILES
                             (to Drew)
                        Try not to fuck anyone from my past 
                        on your way to the bar. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE PARTY TENT - LATER

           In the BACK OF THE TENT

           Miles, Drunken Uncle and Drew sit around a WOODEN crate on 
           LAWN CHAIRS that are different from the chairs everyone else 
           is sitting on. You must recall that save for Drunken Unc, 
           neither of them had an actual invite, and therefore not a 
           seat at the actual party. 

           A bottle of Black Label with few sips left is on the table, 
           with a couple empty COCKTAIL GLASSES. An ashtray is seated 
           next to them. 

           BEHIND THEM 

           We can see everyone else dancing, singing, enjoying the 
           party, celebrating, eating, drinking with merriment.

                        America Online.  

                                 MILES
                             (to Drew)
                        Owned. 

                                 DREW
                        Hey, old man, act your age and die. 

           WIDE ON: Drew GETTING UP out of his little shitty chair, a 
           bit drunk, heading over the MASS of people GATHERING around 
           some MC with a microphone. A CIRCLE OF PEOPLE IS FORMING, 
           CHAIRS are being pulled into the eye of the storm -- in 
           Judaism, we call this portion of the wedding THE HORAH. 

           INT. THE PARTY TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Miles and Druken Uncle continue to wax philosophy about 
           nothing in general. Drunken Uncle produces a terribly rolled 
           joint that looks like a limp shrimp.  

           LIGHTS IT. 

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                             (puffs)
                        That’s what I’m saying man. 

           PUFF. PUFF. 

           PASSES. 

                                 MILES
                             (inhales)
                        Exactly. You’re going to try to 
                        tell me that John Connor, leader of 
                        the resistance of the most 
                        technologically advanced army of 
                        the future can only send back ONE 
                        TERMINATOR to protect he and Sarah 
                        Connor? Like if Arnold failed his 
                        mission in T2: Judgement Day, they 
                        couldn’t have just sent ANOTHER 
                        Terminator to save the day before T-
                        1000 killed them and SkyNet became 
                        self aware? Or that they couldn’t 
                        have sent two of them in the first 
                        place?

           BEHIND THEM
           WIDE ON: We see a few good men HOIST BLAIR UP IN A CHAIR as 
           “Hava N’Gila” continues. UP AND DOWN UP AND DOWN SHE GOES, 
           SCREAMING IN DELIGHT. 

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        John Connor walked around with that 
                        fucking chip in his pocket for half 
                        of the movie! He couldn’t have just 
                        had Arnie run it over, or crush it 
                        with his hand? He had to wait for 
                        that pit of burning lava at the 
                        end? He could’ve ended it right 
                        then and there. COME ON!!!!!!

                                 MILES
                             (a la Arnie)
                        What’s your point?  

           WIDE ON: We now see some confused men HOST Drew UP IN THE 
           CHAIR at the CENTER OF THE HAVA N’GILA CIRCLE. UP AND DOWN HE 
           GOES until they realize -- oops, he’s not the Groom. 

           BACK WITH

           Miles and Drunken Uncle, no idea this is going on behind 
           them, but we can’t help but notice. 

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                             (drop dead serious)
                        No fate. 

                                 MILES
                        You serious?

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        Dead. Do you remember?
                             (again)
                        No fate. 

           Miles begins to NOD in agreement. 

                                 MILES
                        But what we make.  

           This resonates with Miles. Without saying much, Drunken Uncle 
           has just given Miles the motivation he needs to finish out 
           the affair. 

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        Exactly, kid. It’s up to you. Now 
                        get out there and define your 
                        destiny. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE OUTSIDE OF THE VINEYARD - AN HOUR LATER

           All of the women in the wedding make what seems like a mosh-
           pit from an early 90’s Soundgarden concert, eagerly awaiting 
           the bride to throw the BOUQUET. 

           Screaming. Cheering. Girly shit. 

           Amidst the maelstrom of people we find -- 

                                 DREW
                        Twenty bucks says I land the booq?

                                 MILES
                        Booq?

                                 DREW
                        Bouquet.

                                 DRUNKEN UNCLE
                        I’ll take that bet.

                                 DREW
                        Of course you will, old dirty 
                        bastard. 

                                 MILES
                             (what else can I lose)
                        Make it forty.

           BLAIR stands with her BACK to the mosh-pit of loved ones, 
           covering her EYES...

                                 BLAIR
                        Should I throw it?

           SCREAMS...

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)

           Blair HEAVES THE BOUQUET OVER HER HEARD.

           The BOUQUET flies in the AIR -- 

           It appears that Hilary PARKER is going to catch it, and just 
           in the knick of time, Drew PUSHES HER OUT OF THE WAY WITH TWO 
           HANDS, FULL FORCE --

           CATCHING THE BOUQUET.

                                 DREW
                             (glowing)
                        FUCK YEA, BITCHES!!!!
           Drew turns to Hilary --

                                 DREW (CONT’D)
                        Suck it, Hilary.

                                 HILARY
                        Been there. Done that. 

           EXT. THE OUTSIDE OF THE VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

           THRONGS of loved ones gather around, snapping pictures, 
           throwing rice and flowers, waving, hugging and wishing the 
           Bride and Groom farewell, moments before they get into their 
           “Just Married” painted Prius en route to the airport for 
           their Honeymoon. 

           BLAIR and her father, DEL, share a nice FATHER OF THE BRIDE 
           goodbye moment. 

           WE FIND -- 

           Miles, Drunken Uncle and Drew watching within the crowd. 

           Michael and Blair give everyone their final goodbyes, before 
           being WHISKED to their car. 

           SECONDS BEFORE

           Blair hops in the car, Miles GRABS HER WRIST. 

           Blair indicates to Michael that she needs a second.  

           He’s really doing this. Letting her go. 

                                 MILES
                        Blair.

                                 BLAIR
                             (overwhelmed, happy)
                        Miles! You’re still here?!

                                 MILES
                        I wanted to say goodbye. 

           THEY HUG, a long, warm this is the end of an era GOODBYE HUG. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Goodbye, Miles. 

                                 MILES
                        Goodbye. 
                             (slight pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MILES (CONT'D)
                        I’m sorry if I ruined your wedding, 
                        or upset you last night, or did 
                        anything to make you feel 
                        uncomfortable. Ever. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Can I tell you a secret?

                                 MILES
                        Please. 

           Blair LEANS in to Miles with her forehead, almost touching 
           her head to his, as best friends might. There’s no 
           hesitation. No worries. Raw, pure love and friendship, if 
           only for a second. 

           Blair’s acknowledging him and their relationship with one 
           maneuver. It isn’t lost on Miles. 

                                 BLAIR
                             (whispers)
                        I’m glad you came. It certainly 
                        wouldn’t have been the same without 
                        you. 

                                 MILES
                        Do you mean your life, or the 
                        wedding? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Both. 

           Miles SMILES, tears begin to well in his eyes, maybe even 
           SNIFFLE for a second. He rubs his eyes, trying to mask his 
           emotions/contempt/biggest fears -- that at this very second, 
           he is losing Blair for good. Forever. 

           Deep breaths. 

           BEAT as they regain their composure. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Be good. 

                                 MILES
                        I’ll try. 
                             (snaps to)
                        Call me if you have any trouble 
                        getting pregnant. 

           BLAIR CRACKS THE FUCK UP LIKE WE’VE NEVER SEEN HER, MOMENTS 
           BEFORE -- 
                                 MICHAEL
                             (from within the car)
                        Come on, baby. We’re gonna miss our 
                        flight. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Bye, Mi. 

                                 MILES
                        Bye, Blair. 

           BLAIR HOPS IN THE CAR, and THEY’RE OFF. Gone. For good. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        Bye. 

           ANGLE ON: MILES, STANDING THERE WITH HIS HEART IN HIS THROAT, 
           HIS BALLS IN HIS CHEST, AND HIS HEAD ON ANOTHER PLANET.

           Drew and Drunken Uncle FIND HIM through the CROWD, propping 
           him up for the walk back to the Wrath Inn. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                        Can we go home now?

           Drew THROWS his ARM around Miles as they being to walk. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT./EXT. DREW’S MERCEDES CONVERTIBLE - THE NEXT MORNING 

           Drew tosses their luggage in the trunk, while Miles plays 
           Words With Friends on his iPhone from the passenger seat. 
           Both wear SUNGLASSES. 

           Drew SLIDES into the driver’s seat, STARTS THE ENGINE, hands 
           Miles a bottle of Advil. 

                                 DREW
                        Sunglasses and Advil.

                                 MILES
                        Last night was mad real.

                                 DREW
                        A little too real. 

                                 MILES
                        You’re telling me. 
                                 DREW
                        So, inquiring minds want to know...

                                 MILES
                        Yeah...

                                 DREW
                        What’s the last track on the mix, 
                        Penis Town Volume 1? 

                                 MILES
                        Start driving and you’ll find 
                        out...

           ANGLE: THE California LICENSE PLATE. As the car TEARS ASS OUT 
           OF FRAME amidst billows of DIRT SMOKE we hear the voice of 
           none other than S. Carter BLAST THROUGHOUT THE CAR. 

           Music Cue: “99 Problems” by Jay-Z. 

                                 DREW
                             (with the song)
                        If you havin’ girl problems I feel 
                        bad for you son --

                                 MILES
                             (at Drew)
                        I got 99 Problems but a bitch ain’t 
                        one! 

           And as Drew TEARS ASS out of there en route for Los Angeles 
           we -- 

                                                          FADE TO BLACK 
                                                       JUST LIKE JAY-Z.

           TITLE ON SCREEN: 16 MONTHS LATER 

           FADE IN:

                                 ADULT V.O. (PRE-LAP)
                        ...And that’s why I owe Drew my 
                        love-life.

                                                             MATCH CUT:

           EXT. THE FOUR SEASONS BILTMORE - SANTA BARBARA - NIGHT

           Black-Tie. Applause all around. Clapping and High-Fives. 
           Friends. Family. Delicious food. Cocktails. Champagne. 
           Laughs. Good times. 
           You might think it’s Miles and Blair’s wedding -- and you’d 
           be WRONG. 

           An ENORMOUS picture of Drew and Michelle stands sentry with a 
           CONGRATULATIONS scrawled across it in glitter pen. It’s 
           cheesedick, but perfect at the same time.  

           Drew sits beside MICHELLE (wearing a smaller diamond 
           Engagement Ring) and MILES -- who is standing next to them, 
           finishing his toast with a cordless MIC. 

           We realize that THE ADULT V.O. from the beginning of the 
           movie is Miles, and that he’s been telling this story the 
           whole time at Drew and Michelle’s wedding, toasting the bride 
           and groom.

           CLOSE ON MILES:

                                 MILES
                        I guess in the end, all you can do 
                        is trust your gut, go with the 
                        flow, follow your heart, and pray 
                        to God that you have good friends 
                        to prop you up when you fall down.
                             (pause)
                        Thanks, Drew. It’s an honor and my 
                        greatest pleasure being your best 
                        man, because you’ve been my best 
                        man and friend since day one. 
                        You’ve always stood by me. 
                        Lookin’ forward to standing next to 
                        you for the rest of our lives. 
                             (pause)
                        We Bad Boys. 
                             (hold)
                        RIDE TOGETHER. DIE TOGETHER. 

           Audience LAUGHTER. 

           Various Crowd shots. 

           We might even see JEN, the girl from the Jolly Roger Inn, 
           amongst THE CROWD, a few seats over from Michelle. 

                                 MILES (CONT’D)
                             (pause)
                        And to Michelle, the hottest bitch 
                        in the game not wearing my chain. 
                        Thank you for marrying this guy. 
                        He’s lucky to have you, you’re 
                        going to make a great wife.  
                             (hold for applause)
                        Mazel Tov! 
           Drew STANDS, HUGS MILES with every inch of his being as the 
           audience rips into an enormous APPLAUSE. 

           And off the two MEN at the center of this story, Drew and 
           Miles, we --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           Inner Circle’s “Bad Boys” (The Theme from COPS) plays over 
           END CREDITS.
