           INT. WHITE CHEVY ASTRO VAN, PARKED - DAY

           CLOSE UP on a guy in the driver’s seat of a van (DALE COTTER, 
           mid-40’s).  He’s sporting a mustache and a baseball cap.

           His eyes are shut.  His mouth is half-open, with a cigarette 
           sticking out of one corner.  He’s in a total stupor.

           Suddenly, there are signs of life.

           He twitches.  Gasps.

           His face scrunches up, like he’s in pain.  His muscles 
           quiver.  His jaw tightens.

           Then he relaxes with a satisfied sigh.

                                 DALE
                        Oh hell yes...

           He reaches up a hand and takes a drag on his cigarette, as we 
           slowly MOVE OUT.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        That was definitely worth twenty 
                        bucks.

           A girl’s head suddenly pops up next to him in the passenger 
           seat.

           This is ERICA VANDROSS, age 16.  She’s a cute brunette 
           wearing a blue lacrosse T-shirt and shorts.

           She wipes her lips with the back of her hand.

                                 ERICA
                             (thoughtfully)
                        Your cum tastes like enchiladas.

                                 DALE
                        That’s what I had for lunch!

           Dale zips up his pants, still in a reverie.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Damn, I think my cock boxed your 
                        tonsils.

                                 ERICA
                        Just pay me what you owe.

           Dale digs in his pocket.  He comes up with a wad of crumpled 
           dollar bills and some stray pennies.
                                 DALE
                        Aw, man.  I only got eighteen and 
                        change--

                                 ERICA
                        Fine.

           Erica snatches the bills.  Sudden movement outside catches 
           Dale’s attention.

           TWO ATTRACTIVE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS emerge from some trees 
           twenty feet ahead.  They start approaching the van.

           Dale looks nervous to see other people heading his way.

                                 DALE
                             (squinting at the girls 
                              through the windshield)
                        So you got your dough.  Now get the 
                        hell outta here...

                                 ERICA
                        If only life were that simple.

           EXT. DESOLATE SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

           The two girls keep walking towards the parked van.  Both of 
           them are wearing lacrosse uniforms, just like Erica.

           One of them (CLAUDINE DUPONT, 17) is tall, with blue eyes and 
           long blonde hair.  She’s holding up a cell phone camera with 
           trembling hands.

           The other girl is equally pretty, but with shorter black hair 
           and dark skin (KALA MANJU, 17).

           They both look excited, but incredibly nervous as well, like 
           they’re on the verge of just running away.

           But they keep approaching the van.

                                 KALA
                             (softly)
                        We shouldn’t be doing this.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Too late to back out now.

                                 KALA
                        You think she really blew him?
                                 CLAUDINE
                        I think she’s all talk.  I mean, 
                        there’s just no way...

                                 KALA
                        She could have picked a better 
                        mark.  His van looks like crap.
                             (slowing down, getting 
                              fearful)
                        Fuck, why are we even here?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        ‘Cause you want those new Prada 
                        pumps, bitch!  Man up and follow 
                        the plan.

           INT. THE WHITE VAN - DAY

           Erica suddenly RIPS the keys out of the ignition.  FLINGS 
           them out the window.

                                 DALE
                        What the hell...

           Erica slithers out of the passenger door as the girls 
           approach.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                             (yelling out the window)
                        What is this bullshit?  I need my 
                        keys back!

           He opens the door and lumbers outside, standing in front of 
           his van.

           Kala dashes forward.  Picks his key-chain up from the road.  
           Then she runs back and hides behind Claudine and her camera.

           Dale stares down the girls.  He takes a step towards them.  
           Then another.

           Erica walks over to Claudine and Kala.  Claudine hands her 
           the camera.

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Gimme my keys right now.  Are you 
                        crazy?

           Claudine and Kala stare back at him, huddled together in 
           giddy excitement and fear.
                                 ERICA
                        Sir, are you aware you just 
                        solicited, and had sexual 
                        relations, with an underage girl?

                                 DALE
                        You said you were twenty-one!

                                 ERICA
                        Try sixteen.

           Dale stops walking.

                                 KALA
                             (piping up from behind 
                              Claudine)
                        We got your licence plate number, 
                        too.

                                 DALE
                        This is an ambush!
                             (pointing angrily at the 
                              girls)
                        You set me up!!

           Claudine and Kala both recoil in fear.  But Erica’s eyes just 
           burn with precocious intensity.

                                 ERICA
                        A good blow-job costs more than 
                        eighteen and change.

                                 DALE
                        How much more?

           Erica smiles.

                                 ERICA
                        C’mon.  Let’s go for a drive.

           EXT. BANK OF AMERICA ATM - DAY, TEN MINUTES LATER

           In the background, Dale’s white van PEELS OUT of the parking 
           lot, as he drives away as fast as he can.

           Erica and the girls stand there dividing up their loot.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        One hundred bucks each.  That’s 
                        worth skipping practice for.

                                 KALA
                        Barely.
                                 ERICA
                             (stuffing cash into her 
                              pocket)
                        One hundred and eighteen for me.  
                        We should start doing this more 
                        than once a month.

                                 KALA
                        I still can’t believe you actually 
                        blew that creep, assuming you’re 
                        telling the truth.  It’s so 
                        degrading.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        I guess Erica’s a freak like that.

                                 ERICA
                        It takes one to catch one.

                                 KALA
                        That guy was such a scummy perv.  
                        Maybe we shouldn’t have given him 
                        his van back...

                                 ERICA
                        Who else would want it?  It was 
                        full of cigarette butts, cans of 
                        Tecate, and sticky porno mags.

           The girls all giggle.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Let’s hit the road.

                                 ERICA
                        Shotgun!

           INT. A RED HYUNDAI CONVERTIBLE - MINUTES LATER

           Kala is at the wheel.  Erica is in the passenger seat, 
           fiddling with the stereo.  Claudine is bouncing up and down 
           in the back.

           The stereo starts blasting old-school gangsta rap.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Hey, wanna go party tonight?  Meet 
                        some cute boys?

                                 ERICA
                        Can’t.  Gonna finally meet my step-
                        brother Luke.
                                 KALA
                        You haven’t met him yet?  Your 
                        mom’s been remarried three months 
                        now.

                                 ERICA
                        Luke’s been in rehab for a year.  
                        He gets out today, and he’s coming 
                        home to live with us.

                                 KALA
                        Call us if he gives you any 
                        trouble.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Oh, she’ll be the one giving him 
                        trouble.

           The girls all giggle wildly again.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY, ERICA’S SUBURBAN TRACT HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           The convertible stops moving.  Erica opens the door and gets 
           out.

                                 ERICA
                        See ya later, alligators!

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (calling out)
                        Someone should warn your step-
                        brother about you, hussy!

           Kala just stabs at the car stereo with her fingers.

           Gentle indie-rock music starts wafting out of the speakers as 
           Claudine clambers up front, into the passenger seat.

           Erica waves goodbye as the car drives away.

           Then she walks jauntily up the driveway to the front door of 
           her house.

           A HANDSOME MAN with tousled brown hair (mid-40’s) waves at 
           her from the yard across the street, a few houses down.  She 
           waves back.

           The man is taking down a “For Sale” sign.

           Erica reaches the front door.  Unlocks it.  Goes inside.
           INT. ERICA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Erica walks into the kitchen.  Opens the fridge.  Takes out a 
           carton of milk.

           She sniffs it and recoils.

                                 ERICA
                             (calling out)
                        Ma, the milk smells like cat pee!

                                 LAURIE (V.O.)
                        Honey, get up here.

           Erica puts the milk back in the fridge.  Heads for the 
           stairs.

           INT. HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Erica appears at the door of her mom’s home office.

           Her mom (LAURIE, mid-40’s) is sitting at a cluttered desk 
           surrounded by real-estate books.  She looks overwhelmed.  
           Wears glasses, staring at a laptop screen.

           She peers at Erica.

                                 LAURIE
                        Why’s your hair so messy?

                                 ERICA
                        Hot animal sex with my nonexistent 
                        boyfriend.

           Erica strolls into the room and slumps down on a comfy-
           looking leather chair, across from her mom.

                                 LAURIE
                        You’ve been hanging out with 
                        Claudine and Kala again.  I can 
                        tell.
                             (teasing)
                        I don’t understand what straight-A 
                        students like them are doing with 
                        you.

                                 ERICA
                        Relax, ma.  Bob’s rich.  What do I 
                        need school for?
                                 LAURIE
                             (rolls her eyes)
                        Yes, rich from the staggering 
                        fortune one gets from managing an 
                        auto-parts store.  Please.  He’s 
                        almost as broke as your Dad was.

                                 ERICA
                             (sighing)
                        At least Daddy wasn’t some boring 
                        bald dude who collects toy trains.

                                 LAURIE
                        Don’t say mean things about Bob.  
                        Your step-dad loves you...

           Laurie holds up a spiral notebook.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        Although I don’t know what he’d say 
                        about this.  I found it in the 
                        bathroom last night.

           Erica lunges forward and grabs the notebook.

                                 ERICA
                        Cool, I thought I’d lost it!

           She sits back down, flicking through the pages, wide-eyed 
           with delight.

           On every page are drawings of DICKS.  Big ones.  Small ones.  
           Circumcised.  Uncircumcised.  Drooping.  Tumescent.  Every 
           possible kind.  One is spraying out a crayola-colored 
           rainbow.

                                 LAURIE
                        Care to explain?

                                 ERICA
                        I drew it for biology class.

                                 LAURIE
                        Look, I’ve been thinking about 
                        sending you to see Dr. DiMarcio 
                        again--

           Erica slams the notebook shut.

                                 ERICA
                        Dr. DiMarcio’s a douche!  He 
                        hypnotized me so he could feel my 
                        tits, and then he called it 
                        “therapy”.
                                 LAURIE
                        Erica, stop it!  Enough.  We’ll 
                        talk about it later.  Just don’t 
                        scare your step-brother tonight...  
                        And keep your drawings of penises 
                        to yourself.

           INT. ERICA’S BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Erica quickly goes through what appears to be a well-
           practiced ritual:

           She layers a toothbrush with Aquafresh and furiously brushes.  
           Sticks out her tongue and brushes that too.

           Then Erica extracts a water-pik, humming “Here Comes the 
           Bride” as she sprays down her teeth. 

           Finally, she swigs from a family-size bottle of Scope, 
           GARGLING noisily, leaning her head back as far as she can. 
           Then swallows.

           Wipes her mouth, smiles, checks her teeth.

                                 ERICA
                        Hell yes.

           She pops a piece of gum into her mouth.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Erica’s bedroom is a world of fascinating contrasts.

           Garish posters of old school gangsta rappers--including a 
           bunch for some guy named “MC Pimp Hand”--hang all over her 
           bedroom walls.

           But below the posters are a bunch of colorful teddy bears and 
           other cute stuffed animals.  One of them is a giant pink 
           panda bear.

           As Erica puts on lipstick, she starts talking to the panda.

                                 ERICA
                        Wanna jam out to some MC Pimp Hand?  
                        Of course you do!

           She turns to the stereo and fiddles with her iPod.

           The stereo starts pumping out profane hip hop music.
           She dances back over to the giant pink panda and gently 
           kisses him on the head.  Then she gives him a big hug, 
           shutting her eyes as she sinks her face into his comforting 
           fur.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        I love you, Panda Fluff.

           Over the music we hear LOUD BANGING on the door.

                                 LAURIE (OFF SCREEN)
                        Hurry up, honey!  We’re gonna be 
                        late!

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT CENTER - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           BOB WORAM (late-40’s) is leading his son, a hugely fat 
           teenager (LUKE WORAM), towards a waiting car.

           Bob is mostly bald, wearing a bad suit and scuffed shoes.

           Luke is so grossly obese, he makes Jorge Garcia look like 
           Keira Knightley.  He’s a fat, sloppy mess of a human being.

           INT. BOB’S TOYOTA CAMRY - LATE AFTERNOON

           Laurie is in the passenger seat.  Erica is in the back.  
           Erica leans forward, staring out the window.

                                 ERICA
                        Shit, ma.  That him?

                                 LAURIE
                        Yes.  Don’t say anything rude.

                                 ERICA
                        You didn’t tell me he was so fat!

                                 LAURIE
                        You didn’t ask.

                                 ERICA
                        No wonder Bob only showed us 
                        pictures from when Luke was a 
                        little kid.  I thought junkies were 
                        s’posed to be skinny.

                                 LAURIE
                        Shhh, they’re almost here.  Smiley 
                        faces.

           Bob and Luke reach the car.  Bob opens one of the back doors.
                                 BOB
                        Make room for your new brother, 
                        Erica.

           Erica scoots over an inch.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        More room.

           Erica sighs, moving over one inch more.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I think we’re gonna need even more 
                        room than that...

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck, just put me on the roof rack, 
                        why doncha, Bob??

                                 LAURIE
                        Erica--

                                 ERICA
                        Kidding!

           She scoots over.

           Luke squeezes himself inside next to her.  The entire car 
           sags under his weight.

           Erica gets pressed against the window by his girth.  She 
           stares at him hard.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        My name’s Erica.  You probably know 
                        that.

           He nods, head down.  Insecure and nervous.  Like a turtle in 
           his shell.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        I’m Luke.

           Bob gets behind the wheel.  The engine starts up.  Everyone 
           looks awkward and uncomfortable.

                                 LAURIE
                        Well, isn’t this exciting!  Here we 
                        are, the whole family together at 
                        last.
                                 ERICA
                        I think we should turn the radio 
                        on.  Find some Biggie Smalls.  
                        Maybe some Fat Joe.

           No one laughs.  Luke cringes.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Tough crowd.

                                 BOB
                             (ignoring her)
                        Lucas is excited to meet his new 
                        mom and his new sister.  Aren’t 
                        you, Luke?

                                 LAURIE
                        Step-mom.  I’m not trying to take 
                        anyone’s place here.

                                 BOB
                        Well, Erica.  I bet you’re excited 
                        to have an older brother, eh?

                                 ERICA
                        It’s a little weird he’s coming 
                        home to live with us, and I’ve 
                        never met him before today.
                             (looks over at Luke)
                        No offense, big guy.

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s not weird.  Where else would 
                        Luke go?  Bob lives with us.  Now 
                        Luke will too.  We’re a family.

                                 ERICA
                        Whatever.  I still think we should 
                        play some Heavy D.

                                 LAURIE
                             (hissing)
                        Knock it off!  You’re embarrassing 
                        me!

                                 ERICA
                        Sorry, ma.  Just fuckin’ around.

           Luke stares straight ahead, looking depressed and scared.

                                 LAURIE
                        Let’s just all go have a nice 
                        dinner and celebrate Luke’s 
                        recovery.
           INT. PINE CLUB STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT, HALF HOUR LATER

           We move in close to the booth where Erica and her family are 
           sitting.  This shabby steakhouse has seen better days. 

           Luke takes up one whole side of their booth.  Erica, her mom, 
           and Bob are all crammed opposite him.

           A bored-looking WAITRESS ambles over.

                                 WAITRESS.
                        Ya’ll celebrating?

                                 LAURIE
                             (excited)
                        Yes--  Yes, we are!  How did you 
                        know?

                                 WAITRESS.
                        ‘Cause people only come here when 
                        they be celebrating sumthin’.  
                        Ya’ll know what you want?

           Inexplicably, Luke’s hands start SHAKING, like he’s about to 
           have an epic freak-out.  He holds up his menu.  Tries to give 
           it to the waitress.

                                 LUKE
                        Take it...

                                 WAITRESS
                        You don’t want no food or nuthin’ 
                        to drink?

           Luke starts full on TWITCHING AND SPASMING.  Like he’s going 
           to have a seizure.

                                 LUKE
                        Please...  Take it...

           He shoves the menu into the waitress’s hands.

                                 BOB
                        He just doesn’t like eating in 
                        front of people.  He’s got--

                                 LUKE
                        Excuse me!

           Luke BURSTS UP, shaking the table like an earthquake.  He 
           starts walking away.

           Erica stands up too.
                                 LAURIE
                             (to Bob)
                        What’s going on?  Did I do 
                        something wrong?

                                 ERICA
                        Hey, Luke!  Wait up!

           She follows Luke.  He hurries right out the front door of the 
           Pine Club.

           EXT. THE PINE CLUB PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Luke keeps walking, all the way around the side of the 
           restaurant.  To the dumpsters in the back of the parking lot.

           He finally stops and collapses on a curb.  Erica catches up.

                                 ERICA
                        Dude, you running away from your 
                        new fam already?  What the fuck?

                                 LUKE
                             (wheezing, gasping)
                        Need...  some...  air...

           Erica sits down next to him.

                                 ERICA
                        Why’d you run like that?

                                 LUKE
                        I just--  I...

                                 ERICA
                        You look like you’re having a panic 
                        attack.

                                 LUKE
                        I... am...

                                 ERICA
                        Just try to think about peaceful, 
                        calming things.  Like dolphins and 
                        unicorns fucking on top of a 
                        rainbow, or some happy shit like 
                        that.

           Luke shuts his eyes.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re... not helping...
                                 ERICA
                        Focus on the unicorns.  There’s 
                        nothing unicorn love can’t solve.

           They sit there for a moment.  Luke’s breathing starts 
           returning to normal.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        So what were you in rehab for?

                                 LUKE
                        Pills...  Oxys, mostly.

                                 ERICA
                        Never tried ‘em.  I don’t do drugs.  
                        Some people say that’s pretty lame-
                        o, but fuck ‘em...  Hey, you want a 
                        blow job?

                                 LUKE
                             (completely and utterly 
                              confused, like maybe he 
                              heard her wrong)
                        What?

                                 ERICA
                        A.  Blow.  Job.  Would you like 
                        one?

                                 LUKE
                        Right now?  From you?

                                 ERICA
                        No, from our waitress, you moron.  
                        Of course from me.  I don’t mind 
                        blowing strangers.  I love sucking 
                        dick.

                                 LUKE
                        Uh, no...

                                 ERICA
                        Is it ‘cause we’re ‘sposed to be 
                        brother and sister?  Who cares 
                        about that shit.  I’ll do it for 
                        free.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, quit fucking with--
                             (his eyes meet hers)
                        Oh my god, you’re not fucking with 
                        me, are you?  You’re actually 
                        serious...
                                 ERICA
                        Dude, I’m the only offer you’re 
                        ever gonna get in your entire life 
                        for a free blow job.  So just 
                        unzip.

                                 LUKE
                        No, I--

           She grapples with his fly, trying to tear it down.  He pushes 
           her hands away.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Are you crazy??

           She comes back, clawing at his crotch with renewed vigor.

           He finally SHOVES her away as hard as he can.  She stumbles, 
           yelps, and almost falls.

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck you, then!  I probably 
                        couldn’t find your dick in all that 
                        blubber!  Jeez, how do you even 
                        have sex?  Were you that fucking 
                        fat before rehab?

                                 LUKE
                             (winded)
                        I’ve been... fat like this since I 
                        was ten... It’s really hard.

           Erica’s face softens.

                                 ERICA
                        Seriously?  So you’re probably a 
                        virgin.  And you’re sixteen.  
                        That’s pretty tragic.

                                 LUKE
                             (pause)
                        I’m eighteen.

                                 ERICA
                        Wow.  And you just refused a blow 
                        job.  Are you shy, or don’t you 
                        like girls?

                                 LUKE
                        I like Oxys.

           Luke hangs his head, like a praying Buddha.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe you offered me a 
                        blow job...  You’re more messed-up 
                        than I am.

                                 ERICA (V.O.)
                             (gently)
                        Have you ever even had a blow job?

           Her fingers starts reaching towards his crotch again, like an 
           eager spider.

           He leaps up, swaying.

                                 LUKE
                        Jesus!  What’s wrong with you?  I 
                        don’t want a blow job!  Leave me 
                        alone!

           He stomps off.

                                 ERICA
                        What a fag.

           INT. ERICA’S SUBURBAN HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Erica sprawls on a couch, wearing a tank-top and shorts.  
           She’s chatting with Claudine on her cell.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (over the phone)
                        The footage is awesome!  That dude 
                        looked like he was gonna piss his 
                        pants when he realized he was 
                        busted.

                                 ERICA
                        Sweet.

           Luke wanders past the couch.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Kala thought you were just gonna 
                        pretend to blow him.

                                 ERICA
                        You know me better than that.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        So what’s your new bro like?
                                 ERICA
                             (sighs)
                        Fat, weird and GAY.  He didn’t want 
                        a blow job.  And he weighs like 
                        eight hundred pounds.

                                 LUKE
                        Three-sixty.  I can hear you.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (on phone)
                        That’s awesome he’s gay.  You don’t 
                        have to worry he’s gonna rape your 
                        sorry ass when you’re sleeping.

                                 ERICA
                        Not unless he eats all my Ben and 
                        Jerry’s...  Really, you gotta see 
                        this dude.  It’s like if Jabba the 
                        Hut and Ralphie May had a baby and 
                        fed it pudding and lard, plus a 
                        couple hundred ice cream sundaes--

                                 LUKE
                        Jesus!  I can hear you!  What the 
                        fuck?!

           He stomps out of the room, SLAMMING the door behind him.

           Erica and Claudine both GIGGLE.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Erica is sitting on her bed, listening to rap music.

           She’s putting the money she got from Dale into a glass jar.  
           It’s already stuffed with bills.

           The door opens.  It’s Laurie.

                                 ERICA
                             (startled)
                        Ever heard of knocking, ma?  Jesus.

           She swiftly hides the jar behind her pink panda bear.

                                 LAURIE
                        Honey, Luke said you were teasing 
                        him about his weight?  Can you 
                        knock it off?

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck, he’s not twelve.
                                 LAURIE
                        I know.  But he just got out of 
                        rehab.  He’s tender...  And 
                        honestly, Bob and I don’t like the 
                        teasing either.  At least not this 
                        soon.

                                 ERICA
                        You and Bob.  You and Luke.  I 
                        should start gobbling Oxys and 
                        french fries just to get some 
                        attention.

                                 LAURIE
                             (worried)
                        You know it’s not like that--

                                 ERICA
                        I know.
                             (grins)
                        Just fuckin’ with you.

           Laurie smiles in relief.

                                 LAURIE
                        Give me a goodnight kiss, sweetie.  
                        But watch your language and go easy 
                        on Luke, okay?  Try to say 
                        something nice to him tomorrow.

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck yeah sure, ma.  No problem.

                                 LAURIE
                             (leaning against the 
                              doorframe, skeptical)
                        Then practice with me right now.  
                        What’s one nice thing you could say 
                        about him to his face?  Run it by 
                        me first.

                                 ERICA
                        So you’re a shrink now?

                                 LAURIE
                        Humor me.

                                 ERICA
                        I dunno.  How about, “Don’t eat so 
                        much fast food, ya fat fuck?”

                                 LAURIE
                             (frustrated)
                        Erica...
                                 ERICA
                        Sorry.

                                 LAURIE
                        We need to help his self esteem.

                                 ERICA
                        Okay.  Fine.  I’ll tell him that if 
                        his plane crashes in the Andes, 
                        he’ll be able to keep a whole lot 
                        of starving passengers happy.

                                 LAURIE
                        You’re not taking this seriously.  
                        I’m really disappointed.

                                 ERICA
                        Fine, fine.
                             (mind racing)
                        Okay, I got it!  I’ll tell him he 
                        has nice eyebrows.  A lot of guys 
                        have uni-brows, for some reason.  
                        He’s lucky he dodged that bullet...  
                        And he doesn’t smell!  That’s a 
                        plus, too.

           Laurie sighs.

                                 LAURIE
                        I’m glad Bob isn’t hearing this.

                                 ERICA
                        He’s not my dad, so who cares what 
                        he hears?

           Laurie walks over to the bed and kisses Erica on the lips.

                                 LAURIE
                        Sleep well, honey.

           Laurie heads for the door.

                                 ERICA
                             (calling out)
                        More tongue, ma!  Or I feel gypped!

           Her mom just shuts the door.

           EXT. BACKYARD OF ERICA’S HOUSE - DAY, THE NEXT AFTERNOON

           Bob is grilling up a weekend BBQ.  Laurie is sitting near him 
           under a sun umbrella, reading a romance novel with a tawdry 
           cover.
           Luke is slumped in the shade of a tree near the house, 
           dressed in a black T-shirt and saggy black shorts.

           Erica walks over.

           Luke looks up.

                                 ERICA
                        Sorry if I was a rude bitch 
                        yesterday.  I mean, I’ve never had 
                        a step-brother before.  Especially 
                        one who’s eighteen and still a 
                        virgin.  I dunno how to act.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s okay.  I’ve never had a 
                        sister.

                                 ERICA
                        I just want you to know that my 
                        offer still stands...  My offer to 
                        blow you, that is.

                                 LUKE
                        I was pretending that never 
                        happened.

           Erica sits down next to him.

                                 ERICA
                        I think a blowie might loosen you 
                        up.  I’m pretty experienced in 
                        these matters.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        You honestly like giving blow jobs 
                        to guys you barely know?

                                 ERICA
                        Yup.

                                 LUKE
                        It doesn’t matter who?

                                 ERICA
                        Nope.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re not... worried about getting 
                        diseases?
                                 ERICA
                        You’re safe as long as you don’t 
                        each nachos or floss right before.  
                        I looked it up on Wikipedia once.

                                 LUKE
                        Well, at least you did your 
                        research.

           Erica frowns.  Then she LAUGHS and playfully PUNCHES him in 
           the shoulder.

                                 ERICA
                        You’re fuckin’ with me!  Right?  I 
                        get it.  That’s cool.  But hey, 
                        it’s probably healthier to give 
                        free BJ’s than eat BK and pop Oxys 
                        all day.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m done with the Oxys.

                                 ERICA
                        So are they gonna send you to fat 
                        camp next?

                                 LUKE
                        My dad tried a bunch of times when 
                        I was younger.  I just came back 
                        even fatter, and then he’d yell at 
                        me...  He’s a prick.

                                 ERICA
                        My dad’s awesome, but he got busted 
                        in Kentucky robbing a casino last 
                        year.  He hasn’t hit his trial date 
                        yet, so I’m trying to save money to 
                        bail him out.  I need eight grand.  
                        My mom refuses to put up the cash.

           She digs in her pocket and holds out a photo.  Luke glances 
           at it.  The photo shows an attractive, smiling middle-aged 
           man in a nice gray suit.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        That’s him.

                                 LUKE
                        He looks like you.  The eyes.

                                 ERICA
                        Really?
                                 BOB
                             (calling out)
                        Burgers are ready!  Come get ‘em 
                        while they’re hot, kids...

           Luke instantly staggers up.

                                 ERICA
                             (putting her photo away)
                        So you’re actually gonna eat with 
                        us today?

                                 LUKE
                        I, uh...  Probably not.  I just 
                        like eating by myself, y’know...

           He lumbers away, towards the grill.  Erica stares after his 
           gargantuan figure.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Erica is on the phone to Claudine, as she looks at photos of 
           shirtless Robert Pattinson-types online.

                                 ERICA
                             (on phone)
                        I just think we could get away with 
                        twice a month.  No one’s said 
                        anything to the police.  We’re 
                        never gonna get in trouble.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Kala doesn’t want to take the risk.  
                        And we need her, ‘cause neither of 
                        us owns a car.

                                 ERICA
                        Well I’ve only saved two grand so 
                        far.  I need another six!

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Then we need to pick the right 
                        mark, instead of some random 
                        greaser in a windowless van.  
                        Someone rich.

           Right then, we hear a strange moaning sound coming from 
           outside the room.

           Erica stops talking for a moment.
                                 ERICA (V.O.)
                        Wait--I just heard something weird.  
                        Call you right back.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Erica walks down the hall.  We hear the moaning noise again.  
           It’s coming from the bathroom.

                                 ERICA
                        Mom?

           INT. ERICA’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Erica opens the bathroom door and flicks on the light.  She 
           instantly stumbles back, startled.

           Luke is curled up in the half-filled bathtub with his clothes 
           on, sobbing.  His mouth is open in a look of tortured agony.

                                 ERICA
                        Damn, you look like Shamu.  What’s 
                        wrong?

           Luke gazes up at her.  He can’t talk, like he’s having a 
           total mental breakdown.  Tears stream down his cheeks.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, what’s the deal?  I can 
                        help.

                                 LUKE
                        No one--  can help...  me...  I 
                        just want to die!

                                 ERICA
                        In my bathtub?  Couldn’t you have 
                        picked a better place?

           Luke keeps crying incoherently.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Unicorns and rainbows?

           Luke just cries harder.

           Erica sighs.  Walks out of the bathroom and into the hall.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Mom!  Luke’s totally flipping out.  
                        Come fix him.
           We hear the sound of Laurie hustling upstairs towards the 
           bathroom.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, ERICA’S HOUSE - HALF HOUR LATER

           Erica slumps on the couch with a tank top on, watching BET.

           Bob walks into the room.  He snaps off the TV.

                                 ERICA
                        So, you talk to him?

                                 BOB
                             (grim-faced)
                        I did.  Your mother’s up there with 
                        him now.

                                 ERICA
                        He was fine at lunch.  Fuck, he 
                        barely made it twenty-four hours...  
                        Is he gonna go back to rehab?

                                 BOB
                        My son didn’t relapse.

           Bob takes a seat across from Erica.

                                 ERICA
                        Then what’s the deal?  Is he still 
                        in the bathroom.  I gotta pinch a 
                        loaf something awful.

                                 BOB
                        There are things in Luke’s past you 
                        don’t know about.

                                 ERICA
                        Other than Burger King and Oxys?  I 
                        didn’t think there was room for 
                        much more.

                                 BOB
                             (leaning forward)
                        When Luke was ten, he accused 
                        someone of sexually molesting 
                        him...  A camp counselor at 
                        Woodland Pines named Paul Jordan.

                                 ERICA
                        That really sucks.
                                 BOB
                        It gets worse.  A man moved into 
                        the Carlsson’s old house last week.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah.  I waved at him today.  He’s 
                        hot.

                                 BOB
                        That’s Paul Jordan.

           Erica sits up.

                                 ERICA
                        You’re shitting me!  Luke’s 
                        molester just moved in next door to 
                        us?  What the fuck is Luke gonna 
                        do?

                                 BOB
                        You mean what are we going to do?  
                        We’re a family.  This is going to 
                        impact Luke’s sobriety in a really 
                        negative way.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, no shit.

                                 BOB
                        Luke caught a glimpse of him from 
                        his window after lunch.  He thinks 
                        Paul saw him too...
                             (sighs)
                        Erica, I don’t know what Luke is 
                        telling your mom right now, but I 
                        need you to keep your lips shut 
                        about all this.

                                 ERICA
                        What do you mean?  Why?

                                 BOB
                        I don’t want trouble with the 
                        neighbors...  And to be honest, 
                        Luke’s allegations were never 
                        proven...

                                 ERICA
                        You’re saying that he lied?  Wow.

                                 BOB
                        I’m saying that no one knows for 
                        sure.
           EXT. FRONT LAWN - TWILIGHT, MINUTES LATER

           Erica sits barefoot outside her house, painting her toenails 
           pink in the grass.  She stares at Paul’s house 
           contemplatively.

           A curtain moves inside the house, like Paul is inside.  
           Hiding.

           Erica narrows her eyes.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM DOOR, HALLWAY - TWILIGHT

           Laurie stands outside Luke’s door.

           She raises her hand to knock on it, then hesitates.

                                 LAURIE
                        Luke?

           There’s no answer.

           She gently KNOCKS on the door twice.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay in there?

           INT. INSIDE LUKE’S BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

           Luke is at the window, secretly watching Erica.  She’s still 
           standing in the front lawn, looking across the street at 
           Paul’s house.

           Luke isn’t crying anymore.  He’s just staring at her 
           unblinkingly.  Completely silent and still.

           We hear Laurie knocking at his door again in the background, 
           but he just ignores her.  His expression is oddly 
           inscrutable.

           Then Luke’s hand suddenly rises to his mouth.  His fingers 
           are clutching a large potato chip.  He brings it up to his 
           lips and chomps down on it with a loud CRUNCH.

           EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Erica is walking across the street, trying to look casual as 
           she scopes out Paul’s house.

           She reaches the other side of the road, and walks towards the 
           house.
           She pauses when she reaches it, not wanting to be seen.

           But she cranes her head to peer down his driveway.  Takes 
           note of a brand new, shiny green Lexus parked there...

           INT. KITCHEN, ERICA’S HOUSE - NIGHT, AN HOUR LATER

           Laurie, Bob, and Erica sit around the kitchen table across 
           from each other.  Laurie and Bob look too upset to eat, but 
           Erica is happily munching on a slice of pizza.

                                 LAURIE
                        So Luke wouldn’t tell me what was 
                        wrong...  He wouldn’t even let me 
                        in his room.

           Erica and Bob exchange furtive glances.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Erica)
                        Are you responsible for this?  Did 
                        you tease him about his weight 
                        again?  I told you not to be so 
                        cruel.

                                 ERICA
                        Hey, don’t pin this on me.  I’ve 
                        been super nice to him...

           Luke suddenly appears in the doorway.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Look.  Shamu’s found dry land!

           Laurie rushes over to Luke’s side, scowling at Erica.

                                 LAURIE
                        Luke, honey, how are you feeling 
                        now?

                                 BOB
                             (with a note of warning in 
                              his voice)
                        Much better.  Right?

           Luke ignores both of them.  He looks at Erica.

                                 LUKE
                        Can I talk to you?  Alone?

                                 ERICA
                        Sssssure.
           Laurie and Bob both look worried.  Erica follows Luke into 
           the hall.

           INT. THE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Luke and Erica stand there facing each other.

                                 LUKE
                             (whispering)
                        Listen...  Can you... help me... 
                        get out of here?

                                 ERICA
                        Depends on where you want to go.
                             (teasing)
                        Burger King is out of the question.

                                 LUKE
                        I wanna... go back to rehab.

                                 ERICA
                        Rehab?!  Why the fuck would you 
                        want to go back there?  That’s like 
                        Charles Manson refusing parole.  
                        You’re finally free.  Are you 
                        retarded?!

                                 LUKE
                             (hisses)
                        Keep your voice down!

           But it’s too late.  Bob has overheard.

           He stomps out of the kitchen and into the living room.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t want to hear any more 
                        nonsense from you, Luke!  Rehab 
                        cost thirty grand-- And insurance 
                        only paid for half of it!

           Laurie follows after him, pulling on his arm.

                                 LAURIE
                        Bob, calm down.

                                 ERICA
                             (to Laurie, pointedly)
                        Mom, where are your car keys?

                                 LAURIE
                        Be quiet, Erica.  Nobody is going 
                        anywhere!
                                 BOB
                             (disgusted)
                        I thought you’d outgrown this 
                        behavior, Luke.

                                 LUKE
                             (getting agitated)
                        You’ve never believed in me!

                                 ERICA
                             (thoughtfully, to Bob)
                        We could always superglue Luke’s 
                        asshole shut.  Maybe he’d feel 
                        safer that way.

           Laurie suddenly lunges past Bob, and SLAPS Erica right across 
           the face.

           The noise is loud and sharp, echoing off the walls.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (startled)
                        Ow!  I was just fuckin’ around, ma! 

           She looks at her mom, hurt.  

           Then, in the silence, we suddenly hear a weird snuffling 
           noise.  It’s takes everyone a moment to realize who it’s 
           coming from.

           Inexplicably, Luke is stifling a small laugh.

           Bob and Laurie look confused and surprised.

           Erica stares at Luke, and he stares back.  For a brief 
           moment, a little smile plays across her lips, like they’re 
           sharing some weird moment of understanding.

           A tiny drop of blood beads on her lip.

                                 BOB
                             (to Luke)
                        Why are you laughing?  What the 
                        hell’s wrong with you?

           Luke suddenly runs out of the room, and back upstairs.  We 
           hear his footsteps pound up the stairs.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                             (to Laurie)
                        I am so sorry about this.

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s fine.
                                 BOB
                        No, it’s not.  Luke is an 
                        embarrassment.  I’m not going to 
                        let him get away with these 
                        childish antics anymore--

           Erica abruptly turns and marches toward the front door.

                                 LAURIE
                        Erica, wait!  Where do you think 
                        you’re going?

                                 ERICA
                        To steal a car!

           EXT. ERICA’S NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

           Erica stomps across the street towards Paul’s house.  She 
           walks across the road and straight up his driveway

           She stops when she reaches the Lexus, and checks to see if 
           the keys are in the ignition.  They’re not.

           She sighs in frustration.

           The she brushes past the car, right up to the front door.

           EXT. PAUL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           She POUNDS on Paul’s door.

                                 ERICA
                        Open up!

           She keeps pounding.

           We hear the sound of the door being unlocked.  It swings 
           open...

           Erica barges right into the house.

           INT. PAUL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Paul stands there at the door, wearing a gray UVA sweatshirt 
           and a pair of faded jeans, with a beer bottle in one hand.

           He’s attractive for a dad, but in a subtle, low-key way.  His 
           tousled hair is receding a bit, and he’s beginning to get the 
           first signs of a beer belly.
                                 PAUL
                             (surprised)
                        Uh, can I help you?

                                 ERICA
                        You better.

           Erica strides into the center of the living room, casting her 
           eyes around Paul’s house.  The house looks totally normal and 
           suburban, except for a few boxes that still need to be 
           unpacked.

                                 PAUL
                        You’re that girl who lives down the 
                        street, aren’t you?

           A little boy suddenly BURSTS out of a hallway and runs past 
           them, giggling.  He’s naked except for a pair of underwear.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Hey!  No running indoors!  It’s 
                        past your bedtime!

           Erica looks shocked.

                                 ERICA
                        Wait, you have kids?!

                                 PAUL
                        Three boys.  So what is this all 
                        about?  Listen, if you’re trying to 
                        sell me Girl Scout cookies, you 
                        should probably work on your 
                        attitude.

                                 ERICA
                        I’m no Girl Scout.
                             (suspicious)
                        Where’s your wife?

                                 PAUL
                        On a business trip to Chicago--
                             (stopping himself)
                        Look, this is just too weird.  What 
                        are you doing here?

                                 ERICA
                        I’m here to talk about Lucas Woram.  
                        Name ring any bells?

           Paul just sighs.  He gestures towards a black leather couch.

           Erica sits down.
           Paul sits across from her in a plush chair.

           Another half-naked boy runs past again, firing a toy gun, but 
           this time Paul doesn’t even bother yelling.

                                 PAUL
                             (tiredly)
                        I’m dropping them off at my 
                        sister’s tomorrow.  They’re driving 
                        me nuts.

                                 ERICA
                        Good parenting.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, wait until you have kids...  
                        So, you want something to drink?

                                 ERICA
                        Sure.  I’ll take a beer.  So, Luke 
                        says you molested him at Woodland 
                        Pines, back when he was ten.

           Paul eyes her long and hard.

                                 PAUL
                        I thought I recognized that kid.  
                        Jesus.

                                 ERICA
                        He’s my new step-brother.
                             (running her finger over 
                              her swollen lip)
                        Hey, bring me some ice along with 
                        that beer. 

           Paul stands up slowly and heads into the kitchen.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        So, you see we have a little 
                        problem here.

           A porcelain tchotchke on the cluttered coffee table suddenly 
           catches her attention.  It’s a naked little boy holding a 
           fishing pole.

           She picks it up just as Paul re-enters the room.  He’s 
           holding a beer in one hand, and a bag of frozen peas in the 
           other.

                                 PAUL
                             (noticing)
                        That belongs to my wife.
           Erica puts it back down.  Paul holds out the beer, then 
           pauses.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Wait, how old are you?

                                 ERICA
                        Twenty-one.
                             (she grabs the beer bottle 
                              out of his hands)
                        Thanks.
                             (admiring the Pabst Blue 
                              Ribbon label)
                        Nice.

           She takes a long swig.

           Paul hands her the bag of frozen peas.

                                 PAUL
                             (watching her closely)
                        Those’ll work better than ice.  I 
                        know.  I used to wrestle at UVA.

           She takes the peas and presses them against her face.

           Paul sits back down across from her.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Luke was always a troubled kid.  
                        Even as a ten year old.  No one 
                        knew how to get through to him.  
                        It’s like he lived in his own 
                        little fantasy world.

                                 ERICA
                        Well, he’s pretty believable now.

                                 PAUL
                        He’s completely full of crap.  You 
                        know that, right?

           His eyes fall on Erica’s legs, then he catches himself and 
           looks away.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You’re not twenty-one.

                                 ERICA
                             (swigging her beer)
                        And you’re not convincing me that 
                        you’re innocent.
                                 PAUL
                             (sighs)
                        Look, I never touched Luke.  Ever.  
                        It was just all a big lie to get 
                        attention.  I mean, the head of 
                        Woodland Pines looked into it and 
                        everything.  I was totally cleared.  
                        Luke’s own parents didn’t believe 
                        him.
                             (pause)
                        How long have you even known Luke?

                                 ERICA
                        Less than twenty-four hours.

                                 PAUL
                        Then let’s talk about what you’re 
                        really doing here.

                                 ERICA
                        What do you mean?

                                 PAUL
                        Something tells me you didn’t come 
                        over here to talk about your 
                        overweight stepbrother...

           Paul stands up and approaches the couch.  She tenses.  He 
           leans in, getting close to her.

           It’s clear that Erica doesn’t know where this is headed.  She 
           sips her beer, suddenly nervous and confused. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (softly, but a little 
                              menacingly)
                        What you’re doing isn’t safe.  You 
                        can’t walk into a stranger’s house 
                        and accuse them of crimes.  
                        Seriously.  You’re gonna get hurt.

           He suddenly snatches her beer right out of her hands.

                                 ERICA
                        Hey!  I wasn’t done yet!

           Paul moves back and stares down at her.  His voice grows 
           louder.

                                 PAUL
                        What if I’d actually molested 
                        Luke??  What if I actually was some 
                        crazy child molester?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Do you think I’d respond well to 
                        your allegations?  Don’t listen to 
                        the garbage that comes out of 
                        Luke’s mouth.  It’s all an act.

                                 ERICA
                             (oddly intrigued)
                        Really?  I already know about his 
                        stint in rehab if that’s what 
                        you’re talking about.

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah, well, there’s something wrong 
                        with that kid... and if you keep 
                        going down this path, you’re gonna 
                        get in trouble yourself.  Big 
                        trouble.

                                 ERICA
                        Is that a threat?

                                 PAUL
                        Only if you want it to be.

           Erica stands up, imperiously tossing the frozen peas onto the 
           beige carpet.

           One of Paul’s kids instantly rushes past, grabs the bag, and 
           runs away giggling.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Look.  I got enough brats already.  
                        I don’t need another one trying to 
                        ruin my life...
                             (beat)
                        You think I don’t know about you?

                                 ERICA
                        What do you mean?

                                 PAUL
                        I know all about you.  What you get 
                        up to with guys around this 
                        neighborhood...  And I’m not gonna 
                        fall for it.

                                 ERICA
                             (surprised, but trying to 
                              act normal)
                        Fine.  Jeez.  Chill out, dude.  I’m 
                        sorry...

           Erica heads for the front door.  Paul watches her closely.
                                 PAUL
                        You know I stopped volunteering at 
                        Woodland Pines because of Luke.
                             (pointedly to her)
                        Some kids are beyond help. 

           Erica swings the door shut behind her.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Luke is lying in bed, trying to sleep, his face covered with 
           a pillow.  We hear a knock at the door.

                                 LUKE
                        Only come in if your name isn’t 
                        Erica.

           The door opens.  It’s Erica.

                                 ERICA
                        Hiya.

           Luke throws his pillow at her, and curls to the side.

                                 LUKE
                        Great.

                                 ERICA
                        So I just talked to Paul--

           Luke sits up like he’s been struck with lightning.  Furious.

                                 LUKE
                        You talked to him?!  You’re insane!  
                        God, you probably offered to blow 
                        him.

                                 ERICA
                             (hurt)
                        No, I went over there trying to 
                        help you--

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t want your help!  You’re 
                        just gonna make things worse.

           Luke collapses and curls up, facing the wall.

                                 ERICA
                        No, listen--  He said he didn’t do 
                        it.  That he never touched you.
                                 LUKE
                        What else is he gonna say??
                             (pissed-off)
                        You’re just like my dad.

                                 ERICA
                        No, I’m not!

                                 LUKE
                        How’s that?

                                 ERICA
                        ‘Cause I believe you...

                                 LUKE
                             (sounding surprised)
                        Why?

           He eyes her.

                                 ERICA
                        Let’s just say I have my reasons.  
                        So let me help you.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re just fucking with me again, 
                        aren’t you?  I can tell.

           Erica awkwardly sits down on the bed next to him.

                                 ERICA
                        Jesus, move over.  This is a queen-
                        sized bed and you fill the whole 
                        thing.

           Luke shifts sideways a little.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        More, more.  C’mon, lardy.

           She pushes against him, making herself comfortable.

                                 LUKE
                        If you really want to help me, just 
                        go buy a packet of razor blades and 
                        some extra-strength Tylenol...

                                 ERICA
                             (ignoring him)
                        Listen, I saw a new Lexus in Paul’s 
                        driveway.  That means he has money--
                                 LUKE
                        So who cares?  Now you want to rob 
                        him or something?

                                 ERICA
                        I don’t just want to rob him, I 
                        want to make him pay.  Let him know 
                        that we know the truth...  Don’t 
                        you want revenge, or did he rape 
                        all the manhood out of you?

                                 LUKE
                        Leave me alone.

           He turns away again.  Erica reclines against him, shoving 
           against his girth to make room for herself.

                                 ERICA
                        Well, if you don’t have the balls 
                        for revenge... I know some girls 
                        who do.

           EXT. BURGER KING PARKING LOT - THE NEXT DAY, NOON

           Kala’s red convertible is parked outside a Burger King.

           INT. THE RED CONVERTIBLE - DAY

           Luke is sitting in the back, with five Whoppers and five 
           large french fries in his lap, munching away.

           The girls are introducing themselves to him.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        I’m Claudine...

                                 KALA
                        I’m Kala Manju.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (awkward, but curious)
                        So, Erica said that some guy, like 
                        sexually molested you as a kid?

           Luke doesn’t reply.  Just keeps eating.

                                 CLAUDINE (CONT’D)
                        Did the guy go all the way?  I 
                        mean, are we talking first base or 
                        a home run?
                                 KALA
                        Ew!

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (quickly)
                        Of course, it’s okay if you don’t 
                        want to talk about it.

                                 ERICA
                        No, it’s not okay.  Paul needs to 
                        pay for what he did.  He comes off 
                        like a Mr. Mom type, but deep down, 
                        he’s a total douche.  I can tell 
                        these things.

           Luke desperately tears into another burger.

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t want to think about Paul 
                        while I’m eating.

                                 ERICA
                        I’m just impressed you’re eating in 
                        front of us.

                                 LUKE
                        Don’t jinx me!  It’s only because 
                        you’re so crazy, I don’t feel like 
                        you’re in any position to judge me.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (genuinely curious, to 
                              Luke)
                        You think he molested any other 
                        kids, or were you like, “the chosen 
                        one?”

                                 KALA
                        Claudine, cut it out!

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (sheepishly)
                        Sorry...

           Luke stuffs a massive fist-full of fries into his mouth.

                                 ERICA
                        It’s natural to be curious, right 
                        Luke?  I mean, Paul probably rammed 
                        his dick up lots of kids’ asses. 
                        But, c’mon!  Luke was special.

                                 KALA
                        Gross!  Shut up!
           EXT. THE EDGE OF THE ROAD - DAY, MOMENTS LATER

           Luke is gagging and hurling up half-digested burgers and 
           fries at the side of the road.  Erica stands next to him, 
           fascinated, continually leaning in for a better look.

           The other girls wait in the car, repulsed.

                                 ERICA
                        For a fat dude, you sure got a weak 
                        stomach.

                                 LUKE
                        Stop watching me!  What’s wrong 
                        with you?

                                 ERICA
                        What’s wrong with you??  I thought 
                        only chicks got bulimia.

           He throws up loudly again.

                                 LUKE
                        Quit watching!

                                 ERICA
                             (chuckling)
                        Dude, how can you be so grossed out 
                        by normal bodily functions?  Half 
                        the time I blow a dude, I end up 
                        barfing.

                                 LUKE
                             (wiping his mouth)
                        You’re totally crazy.  You know 
                        that, right?

                                 ERICA
                        So?  It’s not like you’re a paragon 
                        of normalcy.

                                 LUKE
                             (sounding dazed)
                        All this Paul stuff, and sex stuff 
                        and dick-sucking stuff is just too 
                        much for me.

                                 ERICA
                        A dick is just like a big thumb 
                        without a fingernail, what’s the 
                        big deal?

           Claudine starts HONKING her horn.
           Luke looks at Erica.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        Why are you doing this for me, 
                        anyway?

                                 ERICA
                        ‘Cause you give my life meaning.

           She grabs Luke’s arm.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Now get back in the fucking car.

           EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

           The convertible flies down the road, the stereo blasting old 
           school hip hop.

           INT. THE CONVERTIBLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The car parks in front of a large office building with huge 
           glass windows.

                                 LUKE
                        So why are we stopping here?

           Erica exchanges glances with Kala and Claudine.

                                 ERICA
                        I found out where Paul works...

                                 LUKE
                             (shocked)
                        Wait-  What?  Here??  Take me home!

                                 ERICA
                             (ignoring him)
                        Claudine and Kala wanted to see him 
                        for themselves--

                                 KALA
                        Yeah, to make sure he wasn’t 
                        another dud like the last guy.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        This place looks pretty white 
                        collar...
                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, see, he’s a video game 
                        designer, like I said.  Probably 
                        designs games for little kids, the 
                        sick bastard.

           Luke looks shell-shocked.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (pointing)
                        Hey, there he is!

           We see Paul in a suit and tie, talking on the phone in one of 
           the large offices.

           Luke tries to hide his face, while Claudine and Kala check 
           Paul out.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Look rich enough for you?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        He’s cuter than I thought he’d be.

                                 KALA
                        And that matters?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Yeah, it’d be way worse if he was 
                        ugly and gross.

                                 ERICA
                        I totally agree with you on that.

                                 LUKE
                             (horrified)
                        Shut up!

                                 KALA
                             (sighing)
                        So, what’s the plan, Erica?  This 
                        one of our suck and tape extortion 
                        deals?

                                 ERICA
                        No.  Luke doesn’t want me to do 
                        that.  Do you Luke?

                                 LUKE
                        I don’t want any of you to do 
                        anything.
                                 ERICA
                             (ignoring him)
                        Besides, Paul seemed to know a 
                        little too much about me for 
                        comfort.  A simple BJ won’t work.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        What if we tie him up or something?

                                 ERICA
                        Kinky, but too much hard work.

                                 KALA
                        I only want to do this if it’s not 
                        super risky--

                                 ERICA
                        Look.  Shaking down a child 
                        molester for dough is our moral 
                        obligation...  The things we did 
                        before, we just did for money.  And 
                        for kicks.  But now things are 
                        different.  We have a purpose.  A 
                        reason to do what we do best.
                             (like she’s rallying the 
                              troops)
                        So I need you both to rise to the 
                        challenge!  Paul has given us a 
                        reason to keep going.  We’re the 
                        only ones who stand between him and 
                        a whole town of innocent little 
                        boys.  We’re the only ones who can 
                        dispense any justice.  And if we 
                        don’t act now, then other little 
                        kids are gonna get hurt.  Do you 
                        want that to happen?  I think not.

           Claudine nods.  Kala still looks skeptical.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (nudging Kala)
                        Prada, baby.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        So what’s your insane plan.  How 
                        are you going to pull this off?

                                 ERICA
                             (thinking)
                        Okay, how about this?  Paul likes 
                        to drink.  So I put something in 
                        his beer to knock him out.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERICA (CONT'D)
                        Then we all strip down to our 
                        panties and take photos, to make it 
                        look like he’s banging minors.  And 
                        then we extort him for cash...

           Claudine starts nodding in agreement.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        That could work...

                                 ERICA
                        And we keep the police out of it--
                        we just threaten to send the photos 
                        to his wife.  He’s already been 
                        accused of child abuse once.  Some 
                        part of her probably knows it’s 
                        true...  We can do it tomorrow 
                        night.  His kids will be gone by 
                        then.  We can go over there and get 
                        him all alone.

                                 KALA
                        But what do we put in his drink, 
                        exactly?

                                 ERICA
                        I know how to get some Klonopin.

                                 LUKE
                        I think I’m gonna puke again.

                                 ERICA
                        Save it.  Me and the girls gotta 
                        get back to school before lunch 
                        break is over.

           INT. SCHOOL - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

           Erica is on the lacrosse field at practice, in her uniform.

           She gazes around, and her eyes find a freaky long-haired 
           stoner kid (KEITH, 18) drifting past the edge of the field 
           toward the parking lot.

           The lacrosse ball suddenly flies past Erica’s face.  Girls 
           yell at her, and she ignores them.

           Claudine jogs up to her.

                                 CLAUDINE
                             (bemused)
                        Erica!  You didn’t even try!
                                 ERICA
                        A girl can’t be good at everything.

           Her eyes are still tracking Keith...

           EXT. GIRL’S BATHROOM, SCHOOL - HALF HOUR LATER

           Keith is slipping out of the girl’s bathroom and into the 
           hallway, looking sheepish.

           INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM, SCHOOL - SECONDS LATER

           Erica is at the sink, rinsing her mouth out with a very tiny 
           travel-size bottle of Scope.

           Claudine opens the door and sees her.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Omigod...  You didn’t!

                                 ERICA
                             (gargling)
                        I got us the Klonopin.  Six pills.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        For blowing Keith?  That is so not 
                        worth it!

           Erica spits in the sink and grins at her.

                                 ERICA
                        It was for me.

           EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY

           Erica is riding her bike home from school, listening to her 
           iPod.  Her earbuds blast her skull with deafening rap music.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Erica is sitting at her desk, doodling a picture of a dick in 
           her notebook.

           Then under the dick she writes the name “KEITH,” making it 
           clear that this book is basically her blow job journal.

           She rifles back a few pages.

           We catch a glimpse of a blank page, with the name “LUKE” 
           written at the bottom of it...

           Laurie suddenly opens the bedroom door.
                                 ERICA
                             (startled)
                        What did I say about knocking, ma??  
                        I’m hard at work!  Come back later.

           Laurie walks into the room anyway.

                                 LAURIE
                        Honey, has Luke said or done 
                        anything that... you would consider 
                        strange.

                                 ERICA
                             (closing her notebook)
                        If he doesn’t have a heart attack 
                        by nineteen, that’ll be strange.

                                 LAURIE
                        Bob wanted me to ask you if he’s 
                        said anything we should know about.

                                 ERICA
                        Like what?

                                 LAURIE
                        It’s just that sometimes, Bob 
                        thinks, well...
                             (beat)
                        I can’t figure Luke out.

                                 ERICA
                             (yelling)
                        Hey, Luke!  My mom hates you!

                                 LAURIE
                             (shocked)
                        Shhh!  That’s not what I said!

                                 ERICA
                             (yelling even louder)
                        Hey, Luke!  She doesn’t hate you!  
                        She just says you creep her out, 
                        and she wishes Bob didn’t have any 
                        kids!

                                 LAURIE
                             (slowly backing away and 
                              closing the door)
                        You’re right.  I should have 
                        knocked...

           Erica cackles.
           INT. BACK YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Erica is standing outside on a crate.  She’s peering through 
           a pair of binoculars, over a low fence, trying to spy on 
           Paul’s house.

           She’s got her earbuds in, listening to hip hop music on her 
           iPod.

           Luke is sitting on the grass nearby, eating Doritos.

                                 LUKE
                        I told you no one believes me.

                                 ERICA
                        Most grownups are lame.  Except for 
                        my dad...
                             (lowering the binoculars)
                        I didn’t think a stake-out would be 
                        this boring.  And I can’t see 
                        anything through these things, 
                        anyway...  Hey, how about we flip a 
                        quarter?  If it’s heads, I give you 
                        a blow job.  And if it’s tails, I 
                        give you one too...

                                 LUKE
                             (glumly)
                        Your mouth probably has like, ten 
                        thousand venereal diseases.

                                 ERICA
                        So?  Your dick probably has its own 
                        McDonald’s franchise.

           Luke chuckles slightly.

                                 LUKE
                        That doesn’t even make any sense.

                                 ERICA
                        Like I care about making sense.

           She hops down from the crate and tosses the binoculars onto 
           the grass.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (sighs)
                        Why couldn’t your molester have 
                        been cooler?  Paul’s so uptight.  I 
                        hope tomorrow goes well.
                                 LUKE
                        There’s nothing I can say to stop 
                        this, right?

           She fiddles with her iPod, turning the volume way up, 
           gyrating to the music.

                                 ERICA
                        I love this song.

           Luke watches her.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re a good dancer.

                                 ERICA
                        What??

                                 LUKE
                        I SAID, YOU’RE A GOOD DANCER.

                                 ERICA
                        Shhh!
                             (turns the volume down a 
                              bit)
                        Have you ever danced with a girl?  
                        Like at school or something.  Or 
                        maybe some rehab shindig?

                                 LUKE
                        You already know the answer.

                                 ERICA
                        C’mon, Chubb Rock.  Let’s dance.

           Erica walks over to him, exaggerating her dance moves.

           She puts one of her earbuds into his ear.  Cranks up the 
           volume.

                                 LUKE
                             (talking loudly over the 
                              music)
                        You actually like this song?

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, it’s called “Gotta Air My 
                        Nutsack,” by MC Pimp Hand ‘N’ Da 
                        Compton Juice Kru!  They were huge 
                        in the eighties.

                                 LUKE
                        Girls have horrible taste in music.
                                 ERICA
                        That’s such bullshit!  You’re too 
                        fat to be sexist.  What kind of 
                        stuff do you like?

                                 LUKE
                        I dunno.  Belle & Sebastian...  
                        Radiohead... Vampire Weekend...

                                 ERICA
                        Gay, gay, and GAY!  MC Pimp Hand 
                        ‘N’ Da Compton Juice Kru would make 
                        those bands their prison bitches.  
                        Vampire Weekend would be sucking 
                        more than blood.

           Erica places his hands on her hips.  He holds them there 
           limply. 

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Harder.  I’m not gonna break.

           Her shirt rises a little as she raises her arms and gyrates, 
           exposing her bare skin.  Luke’s fingers brush against her 
           flesh.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Come on, dip me.  I’m gonna dip...

           She pushes his hands in place, readying herself to bend 
           backwards.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        You better not drop me.

           Then Luke catches a glimpse of himself reflected in the 
           window of the house.

           He yanks the earbud out of his ear, and lurches away.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (confused, taking the 
                              earbud out of her own 
                              ear)
                        Why’d you kill my jam?

                                 LUKE
                        Because it’s like Beauty and the 
                        Beast out here.  I look like a 
                        human chicken nugget.

           Erica steps over to him, with a look of understanding and 
           empathy in her eyes.
           She carefully places both earbuds in his ears.  Shuffles 
           quickly through her music.  We suddenly hear the opening bars 
           of a Radiohead song.  She smiles at him...

           Then she slowly sinks to her knees.

           Luke quickly covers his crotch with both hands and backs away 
           from her.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Erica stands up.

                                 ERICA
                        Dude, what gives?  I thought you 
                        were feeling me.

                                 LUKE
                        Why do you want to blow me so 
                        badly?  Is it just because I won’t 
                        let you?  You don’t have to act 
                        this way.

                                 ERICA
                        This is what I do.

                                 LUKE
                        Have you ever thought maybe giving 
                        blow jobs is like, an addiction or 
                        something?

                                 ERICA
                             (irritated)
                        Naw, I love it too much.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s pretty much what an addict 
                        would say.

                                 ERICA
                             (feeling rejected, 
                              starting to get mad)
                        You don’t have to be such a big fat 
                        buzzkill about everything...  
                        You’re probably just going to fuck 
                        things up for us tomorrow.

           She snatches up the binoculars from the grass.

                                 LUKE
                        I think tomorrow is a mistake.
                                 ERICA
                             (getting madder)
                        Of course you do!  ‘Cause you’re 
                        totally lame.  You don’t even 
                        realize how much stuff I’ve done to 
                        help you.  I’m risking everything!  
                        It’s like you don’t even care.

                                 LUKE
                        No--  I care.

                                 ERICA
                             (angry)
                        Yeah, you care about stuffing your 
                        face with fast food.  That’s pretty 
                        much it!

                                 LUKE
                        Erica--

                                 ERICA
                        Whatever.  Go fuck yourself.  See 
                        you tomorrow.

           She stomps off angrily, leaving Luke alone, standing outside 
           looking dazed.

           EXT. ERICA’S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER, NIGHT

           Erica rides off down the street on her bike, still looking 
           pissed-off.

           EXT. PAUL’S HOUSE

           Paul is standing in the front lawn, smoking a cigarette in 
           the darkness.  He watches Erica ride past, staring for a long 
           beat as she rides off.  Like he’s checking her out...

           EXT. ERICA’S BACKYARD - SECONDS LATER

           Luke is standing on the crate, watching Paul through the 
           binoculars.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        Asshole.
           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

           Erica rides her bike faster and faster.  Heading nowhere in 
           particular.  Pumping her legs almost to the breaking point...

                                                       AND WE FADE OUT.

           EXT. THE BACK OF PAUL’S HOUSE - THE NEXT NIGHT

           Erica, Claudine and Kala are hiding in a clump of trees 
           behind Paul’s house.

           Kala looks nervous.  She’s clutching a six pack of Pabst Blue 
           Ribbon.  Claudine is fiddling with her cellphone.

           Through the windows, we see Paul walking around inside.

                                 KALA
                             (to Erica)
                        You sure he drinks PBR?

           Erica nods.

                                 KALA (CONT’D)
                        So where’s Luke?

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck it.  We don’t need him.

                                 KALA
                        But I thought this was about him?

                                 ERICA
                        It’s up to us now.
                             (squinting into the house)
                        Good.  Paul’s definitely alone.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        You got the pills?

           Erica pulls out a sandwich bag full of yellow-white powder.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, they’re supposed to act super 
                        fast when they’re powdered.  I 
                        looked it up online.

           She hands the sandwich bag to Kala.

                                 KALA
                             (nervous)
                        Remember, I’m gonna run if there’s 
                        any trouble.
           Erica nods.  Takes a deep breath.

           She looks back around for Luke one last time, but then 
           pretends like she doesn’t care.

                                 ERICA
                        Wish me luck.

           She heads around the side of the house, past the Lexus, and 
           up to the front door.

           INT. LUKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Luke stands with the lights off, face pressed against his 
           window.  Watching...

           EXT. FRONT OF PAUL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Erica knocks lightly a few times.

           The door opens.

           Paul is standing there.

                                 PAUL
                        I asked you to stay away from me, 
                        and stop making false allegations, 
                        but yet here you are.  You’re 
                        harassing me.  I should call the 
                        police.

                                 ERICA
                        You sure you want to do that?

                                 PAUL
                        Is there any reason I shouldn’t?

                                 ERICA
                        Well, actually, I just came over to 
                        apologize for earlier...  You can 
                        probably tell I have, like, major 
                        Daddy issues.  I mean, since my 
                        real dad got sent away.

                                 PAUL
                             (curious despite himself)
                        You mean Bob’s not a good father 
                        figure?

                                 ERICA
                        Look at how Luke turned out.
           Paul sighs.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        So can we maybe start over?

           Paul shrugs.

                                 ERICA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Great.  I’ll get us a couple beers.

           Erica walks past him into the house, without waiting for an 
           answer.  Paul just stands there looking annoyed.

           INT. KITCHEN, PAUL’S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Through the window, we see Claudine and Kala huddled outside, 
           pressed against the side of the house.

           Covering the noise with a COUGH, Erica unlocks the back door 
           and opens it. 

           Kala hands her two bottles of Paul’s brand of beer, freshly 
           opened.

                                 ERICA
                             (whispering)
                        Shit.  They’re getting warm.

           Kala taps one to indicate that it’s been spiked.

                                 KALA
                             (mouths)
                        For Paul.

           Erica nods.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, PAUL’S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Erica returns, holding out the spiked beer.

           Paul takes it, almost as a reflex.

                                 ERICA
                        Cheers.

           She takes an encouraging swig.

                                 PAUL
                             (watching her)
                        My parents got divorced when I was 
                        nine.  It’s rough.  I know.
                                 ERICA
                        I’ll drink to that.

           She takes another swig, silently willing him to drink.

                                 PAUL
                        Seems like no one sticks together 
                        these days...

           Paul still doesn’t drink.

                                 ERICA
                        Hey, I propose a toast.

           She holds out her beer.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        To my new mentor.

           Paul doesn’t hold out his beer.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (getting a little 
                              desperate)
                        I’d really appreciate it if you 
                        helped me out, Paul.

                                 PAUL
                             (reluctantly)
                        Yeah.  Okay...

           They clink beer bottles.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        You know, I was voted favorite camp 
                        counselor three years in a row. 
                        Before Luke ruined it.

           Paul finally takes a long swig of beer.  Swallows.  Then 
           holds up the bottle and looks at it curiously.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        It’s kind of warm.

                                 ERICA
                        Really?  Mine’s fine.
                             (to distract him)
                        I’ve been feeling pretty depressed 
                        recently.  I came over here hoping 
                        you could give me some advice.  
                        Drink up, will ya?
                                 PAUL
                        Look.  Right now, you’re going to 
                        have to leave.  You can’t be 
                        hanging out here at my house, 
                        drinking beer and trying to act 
                        like a grownup.  That’s my first 
                        piece of advice.

           He takes another sip.  Erica watches with eager anticipation.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        My second piece of advice is that 
                        you need to talk to your mother and 
                        Bob more.  Open up to them about 
                        your problems.  Not me.

                                 ERICA
                        But they never listen.

                                 PAUL
                        Just give them a chance.

           He takes another sip.  Then studies his bottle again, 
           thinking.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        God, I just fixed the ‘fridge, too.  
                        Something’s really wrong with this 
                        beer.

           He holds the bottle up to the light.

                                 ERICA
                        I’m sure it’s fine.

           That’s when Paul notices something curious: little specks of 
           powder, floating around like sea monkeys.  And some sediment 
           at the bottom of the bottle.

                                 PAUL
                        What the hell?

           He swishes the liquid around and takes a closer look.

           Then he starts to realize what’s going on...

           He stares at Erica, eyes narrowing.

                                 ERICA
                        Wikipedia, don’t fail me now.
                                 PAUL
                             (already sounding a bit 
                              woozy)
                        You crazy little bitch...

           Suddenly we hear a LOUD CLATTER from the kitchen.  Erica and 
           Paul both startle.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?

           He takes a step towards the kitchen.

           With a SAVAGE YELL, Luke unexpectedly barges out of the 
           kitchen and runs straight at Paul.

           Paul is too stunned to act fast.

           Luke TACKLES Paul as hard as he can, like a freight train.  
           Erica GASPS and leaps out of the way.

           Paul goes flying backwards, with Luke on top of him.

           Paul lands right on the cluttered coffee-table.  It collapses 
           beneath him, spraying rubble everywhere.

           Luke staggers up, backing away from Paul.

                                 ERICA
                        Holy shit!  Where did you come 
                        from??

           Claudine and Kala run out from the kitchen too.  Claudine is 
           holding the cell cam.

                                 KALA
                        Oh my God!

                                 LUKE
                        Sorry.

           Luke is checking himself for injuries.  Other than being 
           winded, he seems fine.

                                 ERICA
                             (turning to him)
                        Dude, what the fuck?!

                                 LUKE
                        I’ve been waiting... to do that... 
                        For eight years...
                                 ERICA
                             (impressed, but annoyed)
                        That’s awesome you kicked your 
                        molester’s ass!  But you’ve also 
                        totally fucked up our plan to help 
                        you...

           Paul is lying on the crushed table, moaning incoherently and 
           trying to get up.

                                 KALA
                             (eyes wide)
                        I’m not touching him.

                                 ERICA
                             (to Luke)
                        What were you thinking??  I mean, 
                        he definitely deserved it, but 
                        still...

                                 LUKE
                        I did it for you.

           Erica stares at Luke for a beat.

           Claudine inches over to Paul and careful nudges his body with 
           her foot.  Paul’s movements have slowed, and his moaning is 
           quieter.

           Then Claudine SCREAMS.

           Everyone spins in her direction.

           Kala SCREAMS next.

                                 ERICA
                        Jesus, what??

           Claudine and Kala huddle together tightly, making faces. WE 
           PAN DOWN TO PAUL to see a tent at his crotch.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Luke, you turned him on!  It’s 
                        true!

                                 KALA
                        Just the sight of you made him 
                        hard...  Oh my God.

                                 ERICA
                        That, and I added a bunch of Bob’s 
                        Viagra to the mix.

           The girls groan.
                                 KALA
                        Erica!

                                 ERICA
                        What?  I just wanted the photos to 
                        look authentic.

           INT. PAUL’S LIVING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

           Luke and the girls are hoisting Paul’s unconscious body onto 
           the couch.  It’s difficult with his full erection.

                                 ERICA
                        Careful.  Don’t break it.

                                 LUKE
                        Please stop talking.

                                 ERICA
                        You shut up, Rambo.

           With a lot of effort, they finally get Paul’s body onto the 
           couch.  Then they step back and look at him sprawled there.  
           He doesn’t move.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        See?  That wasn’t so bad.

                                 KALA
                        Let’s do this fast.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah.  Luke, go take five.

           Claudine and Kala start undressing, down to their bras and 
           panties.

           Luke watches, swallowing nervously.  Erica unbuckles Paul’s 
           belt and pulls down his pants, exposing his boxers.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (to Luke, teasing)
                        This bring back any memories?

           Luke turns and walks towards the kitchen.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (calling out)
                        Don’t go barfing again!

           Once Luke is out of view, Erica strips to her underwear.  
           Claudine holds the cell cam.
                                 CLAUDINE
                        Okay, now what?

                                 ERICA
                        Time to look sexy.

           The girls start posing around Paul, positioning his hands on 
           their bodies.  Claudine snaps photos as Erica poses near his 
           crotch.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        I wish I knew cool names for all 
                        these poses.

           Claudine keeps pausing and fiddling with her cell.

                                 KALA
                             (nervous)
                        C’mon, hurry up.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, what’re you doing?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        I’m instagramming them.

                                 ERICA
                        Why?

                                 CLAUDINE
                        So they look cooler.

                                 KALA
                        Just make sure they look real. 

           Claudine snaps more photos, illuminating everything with a 
           series of flashes.

           Every now and then, she shares a good shot with the girls. 
           They nod their approval.

                                 CLAUDINE
                        Yeah.  These are awesome...

           Erica suddenly notices Luke in the entryway, watching her.  
           He’s munching on a cookie.

                                 ERICA
                        Okay.  I think we’re done.  Let’s 
                        get dressed and split.

                                 KALA
                        Finally.
           Erica grabs her clothes and starts dressing.  The other girls 
           follow her lead.

                                 LUKE
                             (talking with his mouth 
                              full)
                        Do we just leave him on the couch 
                        like that?

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, he looks comfy.  And he’s 
                        gonna have one hell of a hangover.  
                        We’ll email him the photos right 
                        away, so when he wakes up, he’ll 
                        have a nice surprise waiting for 
                        him.

           Luke walks towards Paul and leans over him.

                                 LUKE
                        He’s breathing kind of shallow.

           Claudine and Kala look worried.

                                 KALA
                        Really?

                                 ERICA
                             (sensing their nerves)
                        Look, if you want, why don’t you 
                        guys split right now and start 
                        uploading the photos.  Luke and I 
                        can clean up everything here.

                                 KALA
                             (quickly)
                        Great idea.

           Kala and Claudine head for the back door as fast as they can.

           Erica and Luke are left standing there alone, with Paul’s 
           prone body.

                                 LUKE
                        How many pills did you give him?

                                 ERICA
                        Not too many.  Just a few.
                             (sighs)
                        Six Klonopin, plus three Viagra.

                                 LUKE
                        Where’d you read that?
                                 ERICA
                        I looked it up online.

                                 LUKE
                        Doesn’t sound too safe to me.

                                 ERICA
                        Relax. He only drank half his beer.

           Erica starts picking up stuff from the carpet, trying to fix 
           the scene of destruction.  Replacing tchotchkes.

           She pauses at the porcelain one of the naked boy fishing.  
           It’s laying on the carpet--broken, jagged and splintered.  
           She puts it back on the remains of the table, with a shrug.

           Luke studies Paul closer.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, Erica?

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah?

                                 LUKE
                        I think maybe he’s not breathing at 
                        all...

           Erica steps over to Luke.  Gazes down at Paul for a few 
           moments.  Holds a hand out over his mouth and nose, to test 
           for air.

                                 ERICA
                        I feel some breath...  I mean, I 
                        think I do...
                             (trying to hide her 
                              concern)
                        Aw, he’s just gotta sleep it off, 
                        right?

                                 LUKE
                             (starting to sound a bit 
                              panicked)
                        But what if we like accidentally 
                        overdosed him or something?  Or 
                        what if he had an allergic 
                        reaction?

                                 ERICA
                             (trying to convince 
                              herself)
                        He’ll be fine.
                                 LUKE
                        But what if--

                                 ERICA
                        C’mon, dude!  He’s a child 
                        molester!  He raped you!  And got 
                        away with it.
                             (sighing)
                        He’ll be fine by the morning.  I 
                        looked it up online.  Lots of 
                        people take Klonopin to chill out.  
                        It’s very recreational, okay?

           She drags Luke towards the back door.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Paul will probably thank us for the 
                        first good sleep he’s had in years.

           EXT. PAUL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Luke and Erica creep out front, away from the house.  

                                 ERICA
                        Besides, there’s nothing to link 
                        any of us to this whole escapade...

           Erica stops, turns. Looks back.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Spray-painted in HUGE letters across the garage door are the 
           words “PEDOPHILE!”

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Forgot about that.

           EXT. ERICA’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

           A police cruiser is pulling up into the driveway of Erica’s 
           house.

           INT. ERICA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Erica is sitting on her bed, staring out the window at Paul’s 
           house.  She looks worried.  There’s no indication that Paul 
           is up and about yet.

           We hear a loud KNOCK at the door.
           Erica instantly flops back on the bed, pulling the covers up, 
           pretending she’s asleep.

           Laurie enters the room.

                                 LAURIE
                        Erica, get up.

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck off, ma.  I’m sleeping.

                                 LAURIE
                             (sternly)
                        I said, get up!  The police are 
                        here to see you and Luke.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Erica and Luke sit across from a plainclothes detective 
           (OFFICER CARLOS MARTINEZ, 39).  He’s holding a notepad and a 
           pen.

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        And neither of you saw anything at 
                        all?

                                 ERICA
                        I was with my friends, like I said.

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Doing what?

                                 ERICA
                        Buying makeup and Justin Bieber 
                        posters.  Do I need a lawyer and 
                        shit?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        No, no.  Nothing like that.  I’m 
                        just trying to figure out what 
                        happened.  One of your neighbors 
                        said she saw you and your friends 
                        outside Paul’s house last night.

                                 ERICA
                        Well, I didn’t see a thing.  What 
                        does Paul say about it?

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        We’ve been unable to contact him 
                        yet about the vandalism.  The 
                        neighbors say he’s out of town with 
                        his kids.
           Erica and Luke exchange a furtive glance.

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ (CONT’D)
                             (to Luke)
                        How about you?  See anything?

                                 LUKE
                             (stuttering nervously)
                        No, I didn’t--  I didn’t see 
                        anything...  Honest...

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        Well, are there any other teenagers 
                        in the area who would do something 
                        like that?  Usually it’s teenagers 
                        who do this kind of thing...

                                 LUKE
                        I--  No, I mean--  I--
                             (getting more scared)
                        I don’t--  What--

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                        It’s fine.  Really.
                             (closes his notebook)
                        Vandalism is a serious crime.  I’ll 
                        be in touch.  Probably have a few 
                        more questions for you...
                             (eyeing them)
                        And off the record, if you kids did 
                        this, a can of white paint could do 
                        wonders before Paul Jordan gets 
                        back home.

           Officer Martinez stands up.

                                 ERICA
                             (blurting out)
                        It could be Mexicans.  They can be 
                        pretty destructive...  I’ve been 
                        hearing about cholos on the news a 
                        lot.

                                 OFFICER MARTINEZ
                             (looking at her funny)
                        I’ll be sure to write that down.

           He walks out of the living room.  Goes to talk to Laurie and 
           Bob.

                                 LUKE
                             (whispers)
                        I’ve got a bad feeling about this.
                                 ERICA
                        I wish my dad were here.  He’d know 
                        what to do...  Maybe we should go 
                        over there and peek?  Make sure 
                        Paul’s okay?

                                 LUKE
                             (puts his head in his 
                              hands)
                        Yeah, ‘cause most criminals don’t 
                        return to the scene of their crimes 
                        or anything like that.
                             (softly)
                        Seriously, what if...  What if he’s-

                                 ERICA
                             (scared)
                        Don’t even say it!!
                             (gazing out the window)
                        But we should have heard something 
                        by now.

           EXT. THE STREET - LATER THAT DAY

           Erica and Luke are walking quickly across the street towards 
           Paul’s house.

           EXT. THE BACK OF PAUL’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Erica and Luke stare through the back windows.  Both of them 
           look subdued and scared.

                                 ERICA
                        I don’t see anything.

                                 LUKE
                        Me neither.  Let’s go home.

           Erica reaches out and tries the doorknob.  It turns.

                                 ERICA
                        It’s still unlocked from last 
                        night.  I’m going in.

                                 LUKE
                        Erica--

           INT. PAUL’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Erica walks slowly through the kitchen and into the living 
           room.
           Luke follows.

                                 ERICA
                        Paul?  You in here?
                             (beat)
                        That advice you gave me about 
                        talking to Bob about my problems 
                        was real helpful...

           She stops walking when she suddenly sees something 
           disturbing: Paul’s body still lying on the couch.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Paul??

           Then she notices a pool of blood at the base of the couch.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (shocked)
                        Oh God!

           She walks closer.  Tentatively.  Blood has oozed out from 
           underneath Paul’s body, all over the couch.  His skin is 
           white.

           Luke silently follows behind.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly, terrified)
                        Holy shit, holy shit--

           Erica moves closer still.

                                 ERICA
                        Paul.  Wake up.

           She leans in.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        C’mon.  Please.  Please be alive...

           But it’s clear that Paul is DEAD.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh fuck!  I knew he was having 
                        trouble breathing last night.  Why 
                        didn’t you listen to me??

                                 ERICA
                             (turning to Luke)
                        It wasn’t the pills!

           She tugs on Paul’s shoulder, rolling him slightly to one 
           side.
                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        Look.

           Luke walks closer.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh my God...

                                 ERICA
                        It broke. 

           We see the missing arm and fishing pole of the porcelain 
           tchotchke, imbedded in Paul’s back.

           Erica now picks up the splintered other half and shows Luke.

                                 LUKE
                             (sounding dazed)
                        Is that a naked boy fishing?

                                 ERICA
                        You did this when you tackled him. 
                        It must have nicked a vein.  He 
                        probably bled out slowly, over the 
                        night.

           Erica stumbles over to Paul’s easy chair.  She sits down 
           heavily, looking like she’s about to cry.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are we going to do 
                        now?

           A long moment passes between them.

           Luke turns to her.

                                 LUKE
                             (finally)
                        Meet me outside in fifteen minutes.

           EXT. STREET CORNER - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

           Erica stands on the corner, still looking completely shell-
           shocked.

           A car pulls up.  It’s Paul’s Lexus.

                                 LUKE
                             (through the open window)
                        Get in.
                                 ERICA
                        Are you crazy?!  What are you 
                        doing?  Stealing his car??

                                 LUKE
                        I’m taking you to bail out your dad 
                        before I turn myself in.

           Erica pauses, startled.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not gonna be able to bail 
                        him out if you’re locked up in 
                        juvie!

                                 ERICA
                        But how??  I only have two grand.  
                        It’s not enough.

           Luke pulls out a huge wad of cash from his pocket.

                                 LUKE
                        I got the other six.  Bob’s been 
                        embezzling cash from the auto-parts 
                        store.  I think he’s been saving up 
                        to send me back to rehab.

                                 ERICA
                        You’d really do this for me?

                                 LUKE
                        Just get in the car.

           EXT. ERICA’S STREET - A FEW HOURS LATER

           As Laurie pulls up to her driveway in her car, she glances at 
           Paul’s house.

           We see that poorly spelled Spanish words and weird quasi-gang 
           symbols have been added to the graffiti on his garage door.

           INT. ERICA’S HOUSE, HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurie steps into the house.

                                 LAURIE
                        Erica?

           Silence.
                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        Erica?  Luke?  Are you guys home?  
                        I need to talk to you...

           INT. ERICA’S HOUSE, KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurie walks into the kitchen.

           She sees a letter propped up on the table.  The words “To 
           Laurie, from Luke” are scribbled on the front.

           Curious, Laurie walks over and picks it up.  Opens it, and 
           starts reading...

           She suddenly gets a horrified expression.

                                 LAURIE
                        OH MY GOD!!

           The letter falls out of her hand... 

           EXT. ERICA’S STREET - HALF HOUR LATER

           The entire street is swarming with cops.

           INT. ERICA’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Laurie is yelling at Bob, as cops dust for evidence in the 
           house.

                                 LAURIE
                        How could you lie to me like this?

                                 BOB
                        I wanted to tell you!

                                 LAURIE
                        Then you could have found a way!

                                 BOB
                        Calm down.

                                 LAURIE
                        Was he ever in rehab at all?

                                 BOB
                        He was in a facility for borderline 
                        personality disorder.

           Laurie looks furious.
                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I was afraid you wouldn’t give Luke 
                        a chance if you knew the whole 
                        truth about his past.  He has 
                        mental health issues.  I was going 
                        to tell you bit by bit--

           Laurie holds up Luke’s letter.

                                 LAURIE
                        Luke says he’s kidnapped my 
                        daughter and he’s taking her to 
                        Mexico?

           She flings the letter at him.

                                 LAURIE (CONT’D)
                        Who knows what a boy like that is 
                        capable of??

                                 BOB
                        Luke would never hurt anyone...

           Just then, a cop enters the house.

                                 COP
                             (loudly, to the other 
                              cops)
                        Heads up, guys.  We got a 10-54 
                        down the street.

                                 LAURIE
                        A 10-54?  What does that mean?

                                 ANOTHER COP
                        Dead body.

           Laurie looks like she’s going to collapse...

           EXT. THE OPEN ROAD - DAY

           Erica is at the wheel of Paul’s Lexus.  Luke is sitting in 
           the passenger seat sipping a Big Gulp.  They ZOOM down the 
           road with the windows down.

           Both of them look completely stunned by what they’ve done, 
           but are trying to act normal.

                                 ERICA
                        I still--  I still can’t believe 
                        what happened.  It feels kind of 
                        like a dream.
           Luke sips on his Big Gulp.  He passes it over and offers her 
           some.  Erica takes a sip.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Should we call 911 and let them 
                        know about Paul’s body?

                                 LUKE
                             (looking straight ahead)
                        Probably not until we’ve bailed out 
                        your dad.

                                 ERICA
                        Right.

           Luke takes another sip, then offers it to Erica again.  She 
           takes a sip.  Both of them keep their eyes on the road.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        This is not how I thought my day 
                        was going to turn out.

                                 LUKE
                        Nice call on the Lexus though, 
                        don’t you think?  It’s better to be 
                        on the run in a fancy car than in a 
                        crappy one.

           Erica just looks at him.

                                 ERICA
                        Paul deserved it, right?  Tell me 
                        he deserved it.

                                 LUKE
                        Sure, I guess.

           Luke offers her the Big Gulp again, but she shakes her head 
           No.

           INT. DINGY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT, HOURS LATER

           Luke slumps back on the lumpy, queen-sized bed, making it 
           sag.

                                 LUKE
                        I thought you said the drive would 
                        only take half a day.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, like half a day is twelve 
                        hours.  We were only on the road 
                        for eight.
           Erica plops face down and covers her head with a pillow.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (muffled)
                        You can suffocate me if you want.  
                        I won’t struggle.

           Luke grabs the pillow off her head and hugs it, sitting at 
           the foot of her bed.

                                 LUKE
                        It sucks that only crummy motels 
                        take cash.

           He flicks on the TV.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        That old man at the front desk 
                        thought we were a couple.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, no doubt.  Did you see they 
                        have hourly rates here?  I’m 
                        surprised we don’t hear moaning 
                        through the walls.

           Erica crawls over and joins Luke on the edge of the bed.  
           They watch TV in silence for a moment.

                                 LUKE
                             (finally)
                        I can’t even imagine having sex.  
                        Or having a girlfriend.

                                 ERICA
                        I’m a girl.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, but you’re...

                                 ERICA
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        Kind of messed-up?

           Erica snaps off the TV.

                                 ERICA
                        So are you.  And honestly, this is 
                        a really weird conversation to be 
                        having right now...
                             (softly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERICA (CONT'D)
                        You realize that we murdered 
                        someone, Luke?  Like, our lives are 
                        pretty much over. 

                                 LUKE
                        I’m taking the blame.  I’ll say you 
                        and your friends had nothing to do 
                        with it.  That I made you girls do 
                        it.

                                 ERICA
                        Really?

                                 LUKE
                        Sure.  Why not?

           Luke lies back down on the bed.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Nobody’s ever done anything that 
                        nice for me before.  Not like you 
                        did.

           In one rapid movement, Erica straddles Luke’s torso.

           He’s startled.  Doesn’t move.  Just gazes up at her.

                                 ERICA
                        If you lost some weight, you 
                        probably wouldn’t have as much 
                        trouble finding a girlfriend.

                                 LUKE
                             (sighs)
                        It’s not like I’m gonna have to 
                        worry about girlfriends where I’m 
                        headed.  They’ll sentence me as an 
                        adult.

           Erica bounces up and down on his belly a couple times, 
           playfully.

           Luke just stares up at her, not sure what’s going on.

                                 ERICA
                        Are you holding your breath?

                                 LUKE
                        No.

           Erica leans in closer, a few strands of her hair falling 
           across his face.
                                 ERICA
                        A murder conviction might help your 
                        sex appeal, actually.

                                 LUKE
                        Really?

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, some girls like that kind of 
                        stuff.
                             (softly)
                        What would you do if I kissed you 
                        right now?

                                 LUKE
                             (incredibly nervous, like 
                              he can’t believe this is 
                              actually happening)
                        You don’t have to do this...  Like, 
                        if you’re just doing it ‘cause you 
                        feel sorry for me or obligated, you 
                        don’t need to...

           She leans back a little, frowning.

                                 ERICA
                        Why would I feel sorry for you?

           Luke shrugs.  She leans forward again.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Just relax.

                                 LUKE
                             (barely able to talk)
                        Okay.

           Their lips are about to touch...

                                 ERICA
                             (murmuring softly)
                        I’ll do anything you want.

           Their lips get even closer.  A hair apart.  Erica tilts her 
           head, angling in.

                                 LUKE
                             (inexplicably blurts out)
                        Give me a blow job.

           Erica looks like she’s been slapped.

                                 ERICA
                        What did you just say?!
                                 LUKE
                        Nothing--  I, uh--

           She sits back, eyes tearing up.

                                 ERICA
                        A blow job?  After everything we’ve 
                        been through?  Just like every 
                        other guy??

                                 LUKE
                        No, wait--  I thought that was what 
                        you wanted--

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck you!

           Erica jumps off the bed.  Gives Luke the finger.

                                 LUKE
                        But--

                                 ERICA
                        You deserve to go to jail!  I never 
                        want to see you again!

           She grabs her purse, flings open the hotel room’s door.

                                 LUKE
                        Wait, please--

           Erica SLAMS the door shut behind her.

           Luke sits up, completely stunned.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        YOUR’RE MAKING ME CRAZY!
                             (beat)
                        Shit.  I didn’t mean that.  Erica, 
                        wait--

           EXT. THE DINGY MOTEL - NIGHT

           Luke runs out after her barefoot.  Looks around.  Doesn’t see 
           Erica anywhere.

           INT. MOTEL FRONT DESK - SECONDS LATER

           Luke accosts the grizzled DESK CLERK (mid-60’s).

                                 LUKE
                        Did you see a girl go past here?
                                 DESK CLERK
                             (slowly)
                        I sure did.  A durn cute one at 
                        that.

                                 LUKE
                        Which way did she go?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        You her boyfriend?

                                 LUKE
                             (looking around wildly)
                        No.  Maybe.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        She was crying.

                                 LUKE
                             (startled)
                        Really?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Yessir.  Big boo-hoo girl tears.  
                        You break her heart or somethin’?

                                 LUKE
                        Fuck, dude, just tell me which way 
                        she went!

           EXT. EDGE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Luke catches up to Erica.  She’s walking along the grass at 
           the edge of the highway, dangerously close to cars and trucks 
           whizzing by.

                                 LUKE
                             (struggling to breathe)
                        Erica!  I’m... so... sorry!  For 
                        everything that’s happened!

                                 ERICA
                        Who cares.

                                 LUKE
                        I thought that’s what you wanted.  
                        I mean, that’s all you ever seem to 
                        want from guys...  I just wanted to 
                        say the right thing.  I’m an idiot!

           He digs in his pocket and pulls out a candy bar.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Here, take this.  I stole it from 
                        Paul’s house and was stockpiling it 
                        for later.  It’ll make you feel 
                        better.

           She swats it away.

                                 ERICA
                        I don’t want that dead child 
                        molester’s candy!

           Erica glares at him.  Cars and trucks fly past them at 
           various intervals.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s dangerous out here...

                                 ERICA
                        I don’t care!

           She climbs over the barrier and onto the edge of the highway.

                                 LUKE
                        Wait!  Are you crazy?  Stop!

           Before he can say anything else, she runs straight across the  
           highway, barely avoiding getting hit by the cars.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Fuck!!

           He barges after her.

           EXT. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           They both stand there, breathing hard.

                                 LUKE
                        You could have got us killed!

                                 ERICA
                        You didn’t have to follow me!

                                 LUKE
                        I wanted to!

           Erica starts running away from him again, heading towards a 
           24-hour truckstop and diner up ahead, lit with garish neon 
           signs.
           Luke struggles after her, completely out of breath, lagging 
           behind.

           EXT. SEEDY TRUCKSTOP - MINUTES LATER

           Luke reaches the truckstop a few minutes after Erica, his 
           chest heaving.

           He looks around, but doesn’t see her.

           Starts walking forward through the rows of trucks.

           Finally, he catches a glimpse of her through the window of 
           the diner.

           She’s sitting up at the bar next to a scummy-looking TRUCKER 
           with a bushy beard (mid-40’s).

           INT. 24-HOUR DINER - SECONDS LATER

           Erica is flirting with the Trucker.  Leaning against him.  
           Laughing.  It’s clear where this is headed.

           Luke stands in the doorway of the diner, staring at her and 
           the Trucker.

           She glances back, notices him, and then turns her attention 
           back to the Trucker.  Luke keeps staring at them.

                                 WAITRESS
                             (appearing out of nowhere)
                        Can I help you?
                             (glancing down at Luke’s 
                              feet)
                        No shoes, no service.

                                 LUKE
                             (pissed-off, dejected)
                        Great.

           He turns and leaves.

           INT. DINGY MOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Luke is lying on the bed with the TV on.

           We hear the sound of a key at the door.  It’s Erica.  The 
           door opens and she walks inside.

           Neither Erica nor Luke say anything, like they’re giving each 
           other the cold shoulder.
           Luke just watches her as she walks across the room.  She digs 
           into her purse, and then heads straight for the bathroom.  
           She leaves the door open.

           Luke watches her standing at the sink.  She glances back at 
           him, like she can’t help herself.  She’s holding her little 
           travel-size bottle of Scope.  Clearly a little ashamed.

           Luke’s face registers real pain when he sees the Scope 
           bottle.

           Then she slams the bathroom door shut. 

           Luke stares up at the ceiling.  We begin to hear all the 
           sounds of Erica’s post-blow job routine.

           Then SILENCE.

           Erica opens the bathroom door again.

           She puts the Scope back in her purse.  Then she slowly 
           approaches the bed.

           She looks down at Luke for a long beat.

                                 ERICA
                             (finally)
                        I’m taking the bed.  You get the 
                        bathtub.

           INT. THE LEXUS - THE NEXT MORNING

           Luke is at the wheel.  Erica is in the passenger seat, with 
           her sunglasses on.

                                 LUKE
                        Look, about last night--

                                 ERICA
                        I don’t want to talk about it.  
                        Just shut up and drive like you 
                        eat.

           EXT. THE ROAD - DAY, A FEW HOURS LATER

           Erica is staring out the window.

           She points at large institutional-looking building.

                                 ERICA
                        That’s it.  Up ahead.
                                 LUKE
                        Finally.

           INT. THE LEXUS - MINUTES LATER

           The car is parked in front of the prison.  Erica gets the 
           brown bag of cash out of her purse.

                                 ERICA
                        I gotta go find the booking 
                        officer...

           She opens the door.  Gets out of the car and heads towards 
           the prison gates.

           Luke watches her until she disappears from view.

           He turns on the radio.  Rap music blares out.  He shuts it 
           off instantly.

           INT. THE LEXUS - HALF HOUR LATER

           Luke watches as Erica reappears and heads back towards the 
           car.

           She open the passenger door and gets inside.

                                 LUKE
                             (tentatively)
                        How’d it go?

                                 ERICA
                        They said it might take a while.  
                        So we’re stuck here.  They’ll send 
                        him out as soon as he’s processed.

                                 LUKE
                        You should be happy.

           She turns and gives him a big fake smile.

                                 ERICA
                        That good enough for you?

                                 LUKE
                        You’re still mad at me.

                                 ERICA
                             (gazing out the 
                              windshield)
                        Wow, you’re sharp.
                                 LUKE
                        This is bullshit.  You blew that 
                        trucker last night to piss me off.  
                        I should be mad at you...  In fact, 
                        I am mad at you.

                                 ERICA
                        Hey, you had your chance and you 
                        screwed it up.

           Erica is silent, still staring out the windshield.  She 
           finally turns to face him.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        You’re an asshole.  Look at all the 
                        stuff I did for you.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey, I’m the one paying to bail out 
                        your dad.

                                 ERICA
                        Fine.

                                 LUKE
                             (after a long pause)
                        What’s up with this fixation on 
                        blow jobs?  I don’t understand it.

                                 ERICA
                        You really want an honest answer?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.  I do.

                                 ERICA
                        Because I’m good at it.  Good at 
                        something the whole, entire male 
                        population on the planet likes.  
                        There isn’t a single dude who 
                        doesn’t.  Plus, if you blow a guy 
                        good enough, then... 

           Her words trail off.

                                 LUKE
                        Then what?

           A look suddenly comes over his eyes.  Like he’s having a 
           revelation.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God!!
                                 ERICA
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        I figured it out!  I should have 
                        known!

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, whatever.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s a form of controlled intimacy, 
                        isn’t it?  A way to preserve your 
                        chastity!  You never have to fuck a 
                        guy if you blow him first...  
                        You’re a virgin!!

                                 ERICA
                        Fuck off.

                                 LUKE
                        You are!

                                 ERICA
                             (sulking)
                        You are too.

                                 LUKE
                        But look at me!  Anyone with eyes 
                        can see that!  But you--  This is 
                        all a cover.  A front.  You must be 
                        really scared of getting hurt...
                        You’re just an innocent little 
                        virgin princess.

           Erica turns on the radio, spinning the dial, trying to drown 
           him out.  But all the stations are now playing gentle indie-
           rock music.

           She snaps off the radio.

                                 ERICA
                        I am not innocent!

                                 LUKE
                        Sure you are.  You’re innocent like 
                        Snow White.

           She looks away, trying to stay pissed-off.

                                 ERICA
                        I’ve blown over a hundred dudes.
                                 LUKE
                        That doesn’t count, virgin.

                                 ERICA
                             (sighing)
                        Dude, don’t you get it?  It’s like 
                        we’re both the same.

                                 LUKE
                        How’s that?

                                 ERICA
                        I’ve been thinking about it...  I 
                        think the reason you eat so much 
                        food, and I suck so many dicks, is 
                        because something bigger is missing 
                        from our daily lives...

                                 LUKE
                             (surprised)
                        Where’d you pick that insight up 
                        from?

                                 ERICA
                        It’s actually a line from “Gotta 
                        Air My Nutsack.”

                                 LUKE
                             (beat)
                        To be honest, I haven’t been all 
                        that hungry since I met you, for 
                        what it’s worth...

           Erica faces him.

                                 ERICA
                        And I didn’t really blow that dude 
                        last night.  I was just trying to 
                        piss you off.

                                 LUKE
                        See?  You’re an innocent.

           Luke suddenly notices a man emerge from the prison gates.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Hey, is that your dad?

                                 ERICA
                        YES!!

           She bolts from the car.

           Luke keeps watching through the window.
           He sees a very skinny, grizzled-looking dude (MARK, mid-40’s) 
           standing there, with a scruffy beard and a slightly dazed 
           expression.

           Erica approaches.  Hugs him.  The man tentatively hugs her 
           back.

           Luke smiles.

           INT. THE LEXUS - AFTERNOON

           Luke is driving.  Erica is in the passenger seat.  Mark sits 
           in the back.

                                 MARK
                             (still a bit dazed)
                        I can’t thank you enough for 
                        bailing me out.  Man, prison ain’t 
                        no pony ride.

                                 ERICA
                        That’s what I always figured.  I’m 
                        so glad to have you back.

           She gestures to Luke.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        It’s all because of him.  He put up 
                        most of the money.

                                 MARK
                        Aw, thanks.
                             (clapping Luke on the 
                              shoulder)
                        So are you and her, like, a couple?

           Erica and Luke look at each other.

                                 ERICA
                             (quasi-teasing)
                        Naw, he’s too fat.

                                 LUKE
                        And she’s a skank.

           Mark looks at them knowingly.

                                 MARK
                        You guys in a little lover’s spat?  
                        Let me give you some advice about 
                        relationships.  I mean, I should 
                        know...  I’ve been in a few.
                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, I think at this point, we 
                        could probably use some advice 
                        other than lyrics from an MC Pimp 
                        Hand song.

                                 ERICA
                             (to Mark)
                        Yeah, can you fix us?

                                 MARK
                        It’s up to you to fix yourselves. 
                        You need to look inwards.  What 
                        you’re looking for in another 
                        person is generally what you’re 
                        looking for in yourself...  Take 
                        me, for example.  The first 
                        girlfriend I had was a black chick 
                        who sang in a church choir.  She 
                        was real religious.  But by the 
                        time we broke up, she was drunk and 
                        in the gutter ‘cause of me, and I 
                        was a born-again Christian...  It 
                        didn’t last long.

                                 ERICA
                             (nodding)
                        Wow, that’s deep.

           Luke looks completely perplexed.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m not sure that really helps us.

                                 MARK
                             (ignoring him)
                        My advice to you guys is to drink a 
                        couple beers, smoke a bowl, and 
                        kick back and listen to some 
                        records before something terrible 
                        happens...  Like the end of the 
                        world, or nuclear war, or the 
                        return of the black plague.

                                 ERICA
                        That’s pretty good advice--

                                 MARK
                             (interrupting)
                        So, can you guys drop me off in the 
                        city?  Right near the corner of 
                        Sierra and Fifth Street?  It’s just 
                        up ahead.  I gotta meet a friend.
                                 LUKE
                             (startled)
                        What?

                                 ERICA
                        But--  We just got here.  Stay 
                        awhile.  I think you’d be good for 
                        us.

                                 MARK
                        That’s sweet of you, hon.  But my 
                        friend’s got something I need real 
                        bad...  It ain’t something you can 
                        buy in a store.  And it’s a 
                        sonofabitch to cook myself.

                                 LUKE
                             (confused)
                        Cook?  We can get you whatever food 
                        you want.  I mean, you’re Erica’s 
                        dad.

                                 MARK
                        Uh, yeah, er what?

                                 ERICA
                             (to Mark)
                        Just ignore him.

                                 LUKE
                             (insisting)
                        You’re her dad, right?

           Mark looks at Erica again.  She shrugs.

                                 MARK
                             (to Luke)
                        Whatever you say, my man.  So just 
                        drop me off at Sierra and Fifth and 
                        I’ll be okay.  And oh yeah, if you 
                        got a little scratch, I’d be happy 
                        if you could put some in my pocket. 

                                 LUKE
                        Wait, I don’t understand this at 
                        all--  Erica came all the way here, 
                        and did all kinds of things to get 
                        the money to bail you out.  You 
                        should treat her with more respect.

                                 MARK
                             (to Erica)
                        What’s this fat kid talking about?  
                        No offense.
                                 LUKE
                        Wait...
                             (suddenly starting to 
                              realize)
                        Oh no... OH NO!!
                             (screaming at Erica)
                        This isn’t your dad is it??

           He SLAMS on the brakes and pulls the car over to the side of 
           the road.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)

                        Hell, I’m whoever you want me to 
                        be, son.  Never seen you two before 
                        in my life.  But you just picked me 
                        up from jail and saved me some bus 
                        fare.

                        You’re crazy!!  We just picked up 
                        some random guy instead of your 
                        dad!  What’s wrong with you??

                             (puts his head in his 
                              hands)

                        I just made that up to sound cool, 
                        and then I used it so we’d have a 
                        reason to take a road trip.  I 
                        didn’t know things would end up 
                        like this...  When you suggested 
                        leaving town, I didn’t know what 
                        else to say but Yes...  My dad 
                        walked out on me and my mom a 
                        couple years ago.  I haven’t seen 
                        him since then...  My mom got the 
                        divorce papers in the mail.  He’s a 
                        worse dad than Bob.

           He opens the car door.  Luke just sits there.

                        Thanks for the ride!  Good luck,

                             (turning back to Erica, 
                              sounding oddly calm)
                        He’s right.  That does suck.

                                 ERICA
                        Wait...  You’re not mad at me for 
                        lying?

                                 LUKE
                        Naw.

                                 ERICA
                             (squinting at him)
                        Why the fuck not?  You should be.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m just not.
                             (beat)
                        Why were you saving all that money, 
                        though?

                                 ERICA
                        Oh, just to buy a car.  I’m sick of 
                        relying on Kala for everything, and 
                        I know my mom will never buy me 
                        one...  I still can’t believe 
                        you’re not mad.

                                 LUKE
                             (slowly)
                        Well, maybe it’s ‘cause I got 
                        something to confess to you...

                                 ERICA
                        Go for it.

                                 LUKE
                        You’re gonna hate me...

                                 ERICA
                        Fire away.

                                 LUKE
                        I mean, like really hate me.
                                 ERICA
                        It can’t be worse than what you 
                        said to me last night.

                                 LUKE
                        I think it’s pretty much the worst 
                        thing in the world.

           Luke takes a deep breath.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        You know all that stuff I told you 
                        about Paul?  About how he molested 
                        me and everything?  At Woodland 
                        Pines when I was ten?
                             (long pause)
                        I made it all up.  The whole thing.  
                        Paul never touched me.

           Erica looks at him.

           Her expression is completely blank and inscrutable.  She 
           holds his gaze.

           Luke looks away, totally ashamed of himself.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I just... did it to get attention.  
                        Because no one cared about me...  
                        Because I’m a total loser, I 
                        guess...  And a big liar, like my 
                        dad says...  I wasn’t even in 
                        rehab.  I was in a mental hospital 
                        for acting crazy...
                             (voice breaking)
                        And now, Paul’s dead...  And for no 
                        reason, other than I’m all screwed 
                        up...   He actually totally ignored 
                        me at Woodland Pines...
                             (looks at Erica)
                        But he wasn’t innocent.  I saw him 
                        with another kid at camp.  A ten-
                        year-old girl.  He had his hand 
                        down her pants...  This is fucked-
                        up to admit, but at the time, I 
                        felt... jealous of that girl.

           He looks away, super embarrassed, hiding his face.

           Erica just shrugs.

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah, I figured you were lying 
                        about him molesting you.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERICA (CONT'D)
                        I could tell he was straight 
                        because he kept checking out my 
                        tits.

                                 LUKE
                             (shocked)
                        YOU KNEW?!

                                 ERICA
                        Well, I mean, I suspected.  I 
                        didn’t know for sure.

                                 LUKE
                        I can’t believe you knew!  And you 
                        still drugged him and everything!

                                 ERICA
                        Hey, I told you.  You gave my life 
                        meaning...  And Paul was a real 
                        douchebag.  It sounds like he did 
                        some pretty bad things in his life--
                        even if he just never did them to 
                        you.

           Luke smiles at her.  Erica hesitates for a moment, then leans 
           over and hugs him tight.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (softly)
                        I don’t want them to send you away.

           Luke hugs her back, hard.

                                 LUKE
                        Me neither.

                                 ERICA
                        You’re probably gonna get raped by 
                        some big, tatted-up lifer...  It’s 
                        all come full-circle in a weird 
                        way. 

           She pulls away, gazing at him.

                                 LUKE
                             (softly)
                        I better take you back.

           INT. SELF-SERVE CAR WASH - DAY

           Erica and Luke are washing the car.  Erica is holding the 
           hose, spraying out water.
           She sprays some in Luke’s direction.  He dodges it.

                                 ERICA
                        We gotta vacuum the inside of this 
                        beast, too.

                                 LUKE
                        You really think cleaning Paul’s 
                        car will help our case when we go 
                        back?

                                 ERICA
                             (shrugs)
                        No.  But at least I won’t be 
                        sitting in cookie crumbs for the 
                        drive home.

           INT. THE LEXUS - DAY

           They drive down the highway, headed back home, with Erica at 
           the wheel.

                                 ERICA
                        Should we try to think up some 
                        story to explain why we did what we 
                        did?

                                 LUKE
                        I was thinking we should just try 
                        telling the truth this time.

                                 ERICA
                        Me too...  But mostly ‘cause I 
                        can’t think of a good lie.

           Suddenly, a police car appears behind them.  Sirens wailing, 
           lights flashing.

                                 LUKE
                        Oh God.  I hope that’s not for us.  
                        We’re screwed if they catch us 
                        before we can turn ourselves in.

                                 ERICA
                        It’s for us.

                                 LUKE
                             (glancing in the rearview 
                              mirror)
                        Shit!

                                 ERICA
                        What do I do??
                                 LUKE
                        Pull over.

           Instead, Erica floors it, ZOOMING even faster down the empty 
           road.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I knew you’d do that.

           The police cruiser gets nearer.

           Erica drives faster.

                                 ERICA
                        How fast can a Lexus go??

           The cruiser is still gaining on them.

                                 LUKE
                        Not fast enough!

                                 ERICA
                        That sucks!

                                 LUKE
                             (over the noise of the 
                              engine and the sirens)
                        I don’t want it to end this way! 
                        Honestly, this has been the best 
                        couple days of my life!

                                 ERICA
                        Mine too!

           The siren BLARES even louder.  The Lexus is juddering.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Bob better spring for a lawyer, 
                        ‘cause prison isn’t for guys who 
                        look like you!

           The car is going faster and faster, like it’s about to careen 
           out of control.

                                 LUKE
                             (shutting his eyes and 
                              yelling)
                        Erica?!

                                 ERICA
                        YEAH?
                                 LUKE
                        I think I’ve fallen in love with 
                        you!!

           EXT. THE SIDE OF THE ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           The Lexus has come to a stop at the side of the road.  The 
           police cruiser is parked behind it.

           Erica and Luke hold hands tightly across the gearshift.

           A police officer appears at the window, a hand on the holster 
           of his gun.

           Another officer gets out of the cruiser behind them, already 
           on the radio requesting backup.

                                 THE OFFICER
                        Hands where I can see ‘em!!  Get 
                        out of the vehicle!!

           Erica and Luke tighten their grip on each other.

           The officer leans over and peers into the car.

           Sees Erica. 

           And then he suddenly recoils, speechless.

           The policeman is Dale Cotter.

           Erica smiles sweetly at him.

                                 ERICA
                        Hello again, officer.

           She turns towards Luke, who looks completely baffled.

           Dale starts backing away from the car.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                             (to Luke)
                        Start driving...

                                 LUKE
                        Huh?

                                 ERICA
                        Just start driving.  I think we 
                        still have a little more time...

           She leans over and kisses Luke.
           EXT. A GRASSY FIELD - DAY

           Erica and Luke are lying in an empty grassy field on a 
           blanket, next to the Lexus.  The warm sun is shining happily 
           down on them.

           Erica is snuggled against Luke.  Her shirt is on, but we see 
           her bra laying next to them in the tall grass.  Luke is just 
           wearing his boxers.  And a big grin.

                                 LUKE
                        That was...  Wow...

                                 ERICA
                        No need for Scope.  It feels weird.

                                 LUKE
                        Wow...

                                 ERICA
                        Seriously, say something else 
                        ‘cause you’re freaking me out...

                                 LUKE
                        Wowzer.

           They both giggle.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        That was amazing...

                                 ERICA
                        See, now aren’t you bummed out you 
                        were a virgin for all those years?  
                        You could have been getting laid 
                        for at least a decade.

                                 LUKE
                        Same goes for you!

                                 ERICA
                        True, but I’m not going to prison 
                        for the rest of my life.

           She leans over and kisses him on the lips.

                                 LUKE
                        I wish we could stay right here 
                        forever.

                                 ERICA
                        I think we should pull a Bonnie and 
                        Clyde.

                        Just drive across the country and 
                        keep going until we die in a hail 
                        of bullets.
                             (thoughtfully)
                        Or maybe a Thelma and Louise.

                                 LUKE
                        Cool, so both those plans suck.  
                        What if we just went home?

                                 ERICA
                        You think Bob will pay for a good 
                        lawyer for us?

           TITLE CARD:

                                 “SIX MONTHS LATER”

           EXT. MAXIMUM SECURITY PSYCH WARD - DAY

           Erica is stepping out of the passenger side of her mom’s car.

                                 LAURIE
                        You sure you don’t want me to come 
                        in with you?

                                 ERICA
                        I’ll be okay, ma.  But thanks.

           Erica grins at her mom.  Her mom smiles back.

           Then Erica starts heading towards the large, monolithic 
           hospital gates.

           INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY PSYCH WARD LOBBY - DAY

           Erica walks through a metal detector inside the noisy ward.

                                 GUARD
                        This way, ma’am.

           Erica follows him.

           INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY PSYCH WARD, CUBICLES - DAY

           Erica is sitting in front of glass partition.  Luke is seated 
           on the other side behind the glass, handcuffed.  An armed 
           guard stands behind him.

           Erica and Luke are talking over the telephone intercom.
                                 ERICA
                        That sucks Bob wouldn’t pay for a 
                        lawyer.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah.  It was kind of a surprise.  
                        At least I got declared insane.

                                 ERICA
                             (optimistically)
                        Yeah, you could be out soon!
                             (softly)
                        Hey, thanks for taking all the 
                        blame and saving my ass.  I owe you 
                        my whole life.  You’re doing my 
                        time for me.

                                 LUKE
                             (grinning shyly)
                        My pleasure...  It’s actually not 
                        too bad.  I’ve already lost thirty-
                        three pounds because they don’t 
                        serve any fast food in here.

                                 ERICA
                        Sweet.
                             (leaning forward)
                        Luke, you know I won’t wait for you 
                        forever, so you better get sane 
                        pretty fast.

                                 LUKE
                        I know.
                             (leaning forward, pressing 
                              his hand against the 
                              glass)
                        You give my life meaning.

           Erica presses her hand against the glass too, and holds it 
           there.

                                 GUARD
                        Two minutes left.  Two minutes.

                                 ERICA
                             (to Luke)
                        Except for being declared 
                        clinically insane, I think you’re 
                        on the right track...

                                 LUKE
                        I hope so.  What about you?
                                 ERICA
                        Just hand jobs these days.
                             (beat)
                        I’m trying.

           They both giggle.

                                 ERICA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, look.  I brought you something.

           She rummages in her purse.

           Then she takes out a piece of paper, and holds it up against 
           the glass.

           It’s the page from her blow job book with Luke’s name on it--
           and a really colorful drawing of his dick.

           It’s not just a quick sketch.  It’s beautifully drawn in 
           pastels, with artistic flourishes.  Clearly, Erica has spent 
           some serious time working on it.

                                 LUKE
                        Thanks, Erica.
                             (tilts his head)
                        Sure it’s mine?

                                 ERICA
                        I’m thinking about having an art 
                        exhibition.  A show of all my dick 
                        drawings...  Maybe I’ll use yours 
                        as the poster for it.

                                 LUKE
                        Cool...

           As they keep talking and giggling, we start slowly moving 
           out, and “Gotta Air My Nutsack” begins playing, getting 
           LOUDER AND LOUDER AND LOUDER...

                                                              FADE OUT.
