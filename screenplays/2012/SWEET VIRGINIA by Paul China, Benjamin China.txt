           FADE IN:

           A luminous moon, shrouded by tree branches.  The lulling
           sound of Patsy Cline's 'Walkin' After Midnight' fills the
           air.  We pan down on a deserted two lane road, bordered
           by dense thickets and Virginia farmlands.  

           Headlights pierce through the darkness: an oncoming car.

           CLOSE ON A BARN OWL 

           Perched on a tree limb: watching the vehicle attentively
           as it speeds past. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           The country-ballad plays on the radio.  Tom Burkell, late
           fifties and balding, perspires in the summer heat.  

           He tinkers with the air-conditioning flaps, then wipes
           his brow with a handkerchief.  Loosens his tie. 

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 

           We are pulling into the graveled parking lot of the
           Fairvale Diner: its name lit in fading neon.  The place
           appears to be closed for business.  No other buildings
           surround the property.  Two vehicles are parked outside.

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- NIGHT

           The car's engine switches off, abruptly cutting out the
           radio.  The headlights fade to black.  We hear the distant
           sound of crickets.  

           Tom steps out from the driver's door, breathless.  He
           removes his jacket and throws it into the backseat.  His
           shirt is stained with sweat.  

           He saunters out of the frame, revealing, at the back of
           the lot, a beat-up Mustang parked suspiciously in the
           shadows.  We hold for a beat.

           INT. FAIRVALE DINER -- NIGHT

           CLOSE ON A SHOPKEEPER'S BELL

           Triggered by an opening door.

           The diner's dated decor features a long marble counter,
           window-side booths and a vintage Wurlitzer jukebox by the
           entrance.

           Two men sit alone at the far end of the room, playing
           cards in a cloud of cigar smoke.  

           One of them is the owner of this establishment: Lou Hopkis,
           a weathered old-man clad in a white smock.  The other is
           Mitchell McBain, a pompous individual in his early
           thirties. 

           We track behind Tom as he approaches the men.

                                 LOU
                        There he is.  Didn't know if you
                        were gonna show.

                                 TOM
                        Will you get a load of this heat. 

           He removes his tie.  Beads of sweat cover his face.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Hotter than the hubs of Hades.

                                 MITCHELL
                            (turning in his
                             chair)
                        Jesus, you are sweatin' like a
                        pig Burkell.

                                 LOU
                        Goin' to reach 95 degrees tomorrow. 

           Lou pours whiskey into a third glass. 

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                        So the radio says.

                                 TOM
                            (leaning over the
                             table)
                        What's the count boys?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Seven card stud.

                                 LOU
                        He's robbing me blind.  Blind I
                        tell ya.

                                 MITCHELL
                        I'm up fifty bucks already, and
                        there's no telling when I'm goin'
                        to stop.

                                 TOM
                        That right. 

                                 LOU
                        Don't turn your back on this McBain
                        boy, Tom.  I mean it now.  He'd
                        steal the britches off an orphan.

           Mitchell laughs, giddily.

                                 TOM
                        It just the three of us?  Where's
                        Carl and the others?

                                 LOU
                        Carl's up in Shenandoah Valley. 
                        Won't be back for a fortnight. 
                        And Wade's got his son this week. 
                        What's that kid's name again?

                                 LOU
                        Knew it was somethin' biblical.   

                                 TOM
                        Where's ol' Desmond?

                                 LOU
                        Not sure-- 

                                 MITCHELL
                        --sick.  Lila caught him in the
                        pharmacy and he didn't look too
                        sharp.

                                 TOM
                        Jeez, I hope it ain't a virus.

           He wanders over to a nearby payphone, searching his pockets
           for change.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Last thing a man needs is a fever
                        in this heat.  It'll put him on
                        his back for good.

                                 LOU
                        Where you off to?  We're dealing
                        you in.

                                 TOM
                            (calling over his
                             shoulder)
                        Duty calls gentlemen.  Duty calls. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Not two minutes in the door and
                        he's already callin' the wife.  

           Lou raises his glass.  He throws the whiskey down his
           throat, then winces. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- SAME

           We track along a bookcase displaying an impressive
           collection of literature.  Their sizes and conditions
           vary, though most appear tattered and well-read.

           A framed University diploma hangs from a wall. 

           The continuing track reveals a red-headed woman in bed,
           sleeping.  A paperback novel rests under her chin.

           This is Bernadette "Bernie" Burkell.  Still beautiful in
           her early fifties, she is slim in stature and her skin is
           a wondrous milky white.

           A harsh jangle from the telephone.  Bernie stirs.

           The phone rings again.  Bernie reaches for the receiver. 
           The novel crashes to the floor.

                                 BERNIE
                        'lo.

                        Did I wake you?

                                 BERNIE
                        No.  
                            (clearing her throat)
                        No.  I was up.

           INT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Tom leans by the payphone.  

                                 TOM
                        Liar.  Doing what?

                                 BERNIE
                        Watching pornography.

           A short burst of laughter crackles down the line.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        How was the sale's meet?  Anderson

                                 TOM
                        Like a Northern Pike.  All that's
                        left now is the signatures.  

                                 BERNIE'S VOICE
                        Ah, I'm real proud of you hon.

                                 TOM
                        Drive down from Lynchburg was a
                        stretch.  Thought the air-con was
                        gonna up and die on me.

                                 BERNIE'S VOICE

                        Well, don't stay out too late.  I
                        know you boys don't drink

                                 BERNIE
                        I'm turning in.

                                 TOM'S VOICE
                        Alright, then.

                                 BERNIE
                        Night hon.

           Bernie hangs up the receiver and collapses back onto her
           pillow.  She stares up at the ceiling fan.

           We hear a rhythmic whir as it turns slowly.

           Bernie closes her eyes.

           Later.

           CLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPHS

           Black and white pictures of the diner, taken years ago,
           collect dust.  

           CLOSE ON JIMMY CARTER

           A striking portrait hangs above a quotation that reads:

           "We must adjust to changing times and still hold to
           unchanging principles."

                                 MITCHELL (O.S.)
                        All I'm sayin' is you gotta have
                        options.  That's all. 

           We track in on the three men seated at the end of the
           counter.  Fueled by alcohol, Lou and Mitchell are in the
           middle of a heated conversation.  Tom muses over his poker-
           hand, completely indifferent to the unfolding argument.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        Without options--

                                 LOU
                        --c'mon, you youngsters are only
                        out to chase a buck.  You don't
                        know the meaning of the word
                        principle.  A man's got to have
                        principles.  Tell him Tom.

           Tom studies his cards, deep in thought.

                        Yes sir.  Principles.  

           Mitchell drags on his cigar.  Smoke billows in the air.

                                 MITCHELL
                            (shaking his head)
                        You're goin' about this the wrong
                        way.  You got it all screwy.  The
                        seventies are over.  These are
                        exciting times.

           Lou smiles, wryly.

                                 LOU
                        Jesus Mitchell, I'm sixty-eight
                        years of age.  I can barely wipe
                        my own ass.

                                 TOM
                            (studying his watch)
                        Are we gonna finish this game? 
                        It's now officially Thursday.

           Mitchell breaks into a conceited grin. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        If you're not part of the solution
                        Lou, you're part of the problem. 
                        That's all there is to it--

                                 LOU
                        --problem?  What problem?
                            (to Tom)
                        What is he talkin' 'bout?

           Tom shakes his head as he buoyantly fills his glass with
           more whiskey. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Real estate, equities and bonds. 
                        It's all about to boom.  There's
                        no future in retail.  

                                 LOU
                        This establishment here is all I
                        own.  No bank loans or nothin'.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Well, selling could put you
                        straight.  You'd make more than a
                        nickel, I can guarantee you that--

                                 LOU
                        --forgive me if I'm mistaken, but
                        people still need to eat and drink.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Alright, but what about your
                        competition?  Huh?

           Lou eyes him, curiously.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        There's franchises and chains to
                        worry about now.  Big corporations
                        breathin' down your neck. 

           Lou grunts. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        We've got to move with the times.
                        New political initiatives are
                        upon us.  Tax cuts.  National
                        defense.  Take a look at the damage
                        of that hostage crisis over in
                        Iran, man.  Folks are restless. 
                        Ol' Reagan is a shoe-in come
                        November--

                                 TOM
                            (protesting)
                        --whoa, hey now.  Come on.

                                 LOU
                        Christ, McBain.

                                 MITCHELL
                        It's a new decade-- 

                                 LOU
                        --ain't no damn actor goin' to
                        get elected--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --a new beginning.  All I'm sayin'.

           An awkward beat.  The men stare idly at their cards,
           desperate to shake off their political dispute.

           Further silence. 

                                 LOU
                        'Bedtime for Bonzo'.

           Tom gives an acknowledging smile.

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                        Remember that picture?  
           © Paul China, 2011

           The three men begin to chuckle.  We slowly drift away
           from this trivial conversation and track in on a large
           window by a booth. 

                                 LOU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Reagan and the chimp.  Who was
                        the actress in that?  Pretty gal. 

           As we approach the glass, we catch sight of the dimly-lit
           parking lot outside.  

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Gail Russell.

                                 LOU (O.S.)
                        Nah, it was Diana Lynn.  I know
                        it.  She died young y'know.

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           REVERSE ANGLE

           We pull away from the window as the men continue to
           squabble amongst themselves. 

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        So did Gail Russell.

                                 LOU (O.S.)
                        That right?

           Their dialogue fades as we pull further away.

           MUSTANG

           We now track in on this battered vehicle, parked dubiously
           at the back of the lot.  As we approach the dark
           windshield, we detect that someone is sitting in the
           driver's seat.

           There is no movement inside the car. 

           WING MIRROR

           Again, the mysterious figure's identity is distorted by
           the glass and severe lack of light. 

           The diner stands out in the background.  Inside, the three
           occupants can clearly be seen through the glass windows.  

           INT. FAIRVALE DINER -- LATER

           CLOSE ON A WHISKEY BOTTLE

           Almost empty.  Lou's hand enters the frame and pours the
           remaining liquor into his glass.

           The men are laughing: someone has told a successful joke. 
           Mitchell leans across the table to stub out his cigar.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Okay, here's one for ya.  You're
                        going to love this.  

           He clears his throat.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        I flew out to Kansas state a little
                        while back--  

                                 LOU
                        --how come?  

                                 MITCHELL
                        Oh, work as usual.  Had some
                        meetings to attend.  Anyways, I
                        found myself sitting next to this
                        beauty on the airplane.  Silky
                        blonde hair.  Legs up to her ass-- 

           CLOSE ON A SHOPKEEPER'S BELL

           Triggered by an opening door.

           The men turn to see who has entered the diner: a perplexing
           look plastered across each face.

           We track behind a young man who advances steadily through
           the room.  We only see the back of his black, well-combed
           hair and his worn-out boots.  Each heavy footstep breaks
           the suspenseful silence.

           Suddenly, he leaves the frame, and slides into a window-
           side booth halfway down the isle. 

           The men continue to stare, dumbfounded.  Beyond them, in
           the background, we see this stranger taking his seat.  

           Note: we do not see his face.

           Lou smiles, nervously.

                                 LOU
                        ...the hell?

           Tom shrugs his shoulders.  Mitchell remains twisted in
           his chair, eyeing the unknown newcomer.  Lou rises from
           his stool.

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                            (calling out)
                        Hey!  We're closed!

           Beat.  Eerily, the stranger does not turn around, only
           continues to face forward.

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                            (calling out)
                        Mister!  You hear me?

           Another beat.  Lou is flabbergasted.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                            (calling out)
                        Heck, it's--

           Lou raises his wrist, but then realizes that it's bare. 
           He turns to Tom who quickly glances at his own watch.

                                 TOM
                        12.35 in the a.m.

                                 LOU
                            (calling out)
                        12.35 in the a.m.  Chrissakes,
                        we're closed!

           An uneasy silence.  No response.

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                        Damn kids.  No respect for their
                        elders.

           Mitchell pushes his stool aside and hops to his feet.  He
           straightens his shirt.

                                 LOU (CONT'D)
                            (protesting)
                        Mitchell, don't do a damn--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --s'alright, now.  Just sit back
                        down.  

                                 LOU
                        Christ, I don't think--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --he'll listen to me.  Don't you
                        worry about that.

           He steps gingerly down the isle.  Lost for words, Lou
           perches himself back on his stool.  

           Mitchell inches closer toward the stranger: the walk
           seemingly longer than one would expect.  Finally, when he
           reaches the booth, we pan around to get a clear shot of
           the mysterious young man.  

           He is in his early twenties, with striking facial features:
           dark, sunken eyes, high cheekbones and an acute jaw-line. 
           He studies a menu, oblivious to Mitchell's presence.

           Beat. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        Did you not hear--

                                 YOUNG MAN
                            (still reading)
                        --I'll take the early bird special,
                        no eggs, extra bacon. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 MITCHELL
                            (baffled)
                        What?

           The young man looks up from the menu. 

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Early bird special.  It is early,
                        after all, dependin' on how you
                        look at it.   

                                 MITCHELL
                        Listen here--

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        --I'll have a cool glass of water
                        too.  Plenty of ice.  
                            (laughing to himself)
                        I can't take this damn heat.  

                                 MITCHELL
                        Where do you think you are?

           The young man cranes his neck and glances out the window.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Ain't this the Heart of Appalachia?

                                 MITCHELL
                        Some mouth.  This is Fairvale,
                        and this diner is closed.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        That a fact, now?

           Mitchell leans onto the table, domineeringly.  

                                 MITCHELL
                        That's a fact.  So run along and
                        get yourself home.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Well, that's gonna be a problem. 
                        I don't live round these parts
                        and a drive like that is gonna
                        cost me a lot of gas.  Plus, I
                        could really do with somethin' to
                        eat.  

           Mitchell is equally annoyed and intimidated.

                                 MITCHELL
                        Maybe you're not hearin' me right? 
                        Maybe I ought to call--

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        --ain't you got a pretty young
                        wife to get on home to?  Huh?  

           He peers over his shoulder.

           YOUNG MAN POV

           Lou and Tom are staring right at him, anxiously, from the
           far end of the counter.

           The young man turns back to face Mitchell. 

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
                        She might not like you stayin'
                        out late and gamblin', Mitch.

           Mitchell is astonished at the mention of his name.  He
           frowns, disoriented.

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
                        What I say?  Did I say somethin'
                        wrong?  I apologize if I was rude
                        just then--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --do I know you?  

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Well, I like to think everybody
                        knows everybody.  Somehow or other.

           Mitchell glares, agitated. 

                                 MITCHELL
                        Be straight with me.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        I'm straight as can be.  You got
                        my word on that.

           Beat.  Mitchell looks back at his friends, pondering. 
           Lou detects his apprehension and rises from his stool. 

                                 YOUNG MAN (CONT'D)
                        So, how about that early bird--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --get out.  Now.

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Is something wrong--

                                 MITCHELL
                        --do you want me to call the
                        authorities?    

           The young man peers back over his shoulder at the men,
           then looks back up at Mitchell.  Unperturbed.

           A tense beat.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to count to three--

           All of a sudden, the stranger springs out from the booth. 
           Mitchell takes a step backwards.  Another beat. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        You got no manners Mitch, you
                        know that?  Without manners, a
                        man can look awfully stupid--

           Mitchell slaps the young man hard across the face.  

           Tom stands up beside Lou.  Both of them are obviously
           unsettled by what they have just witnessed.

                                 LOU
                            (calling out)
                        What's going on Mitchell?

           Mitchell stares at the young man as he waits for a
           retaliation.  Nothing happens. 

                                 MITCHELL
                            (calling out)
                        Nothin'.  S'alright.

           An awkward silence passes, underlined with dread.  The
           young man grins: somewhat sadistically.

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                            (calling out)
                        This gentlemen here was just
                        leaving.

           The stranger pats his ruffled hair back into place and,
           when satisfied, turns and heads toward the front door.

           Tom sits back in his chair, relieved.

           We track in front of Mitchell as he makes his way back
           towards the men.  Over his shoulder, in the background,
           we notice that the young man has stopped by the Wurlitzer
           jukebox at the door.  He appears to be selecting a track.

           Mitchell shakes his head as he continues to walk.  Lou
           and Tom study him with keen interest. 

                                 MITCHELL (CONT'D)
                        I can't believe that just happened.

                                 TOM
                        What went on?

                                 LOU
                        Why'd you strike that boy?

                                 MITCHELL
                        I'd a done a lot more given the
                        chance.  He weren't right at all. 

                                 LOU
                        Who the hell was he?  

                                 MITCHELL
                        He didn't look familiar.

                        Thought maybe he was from Abingdon,
                        or another neighboring town.  He
                        was after some supper and--

           CLOSE ON A SHOPKEEPER'S BELL

           Triggered by a closing door.

           The men turn around just in time to see the door swing
           shut.  Outside, through the glass, there is only darkness.

           A suspenseful beat. 

           Then: we hear the haunting intro to 'California Dreamin'
           by the Mamas & the Papas.  The guitar-picking cuts through
           the diner.  

           CLOSE ON WURLITZER JUKEBOX

           A record spins on a dated turntable.

           The men look at each other worriedly, not knowing what to
           do.  They are evidently frightened.  Mitchell forces a
           weary smile, but it is not returned.  As the song builds,
           we slowly track in on the front door.  

           Then, unexpectedly, the young man barges back into the
           room, almost knocking the door off its hinges.  He
           brandishes a long barreled revolver: holding the weapon
           out at arm's length.

           The men stare.  Confused.  Transfixed.  Terrified. 

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           We track along the large windows of the diner as the
           massacre unfolds.  Inside, the gun roars.  The men scream
           and wail, desperate to escape.  Every gunshot is deafening.

           Note: This horrific scene plays out to the jukebox tune
           that now dominates the soundtrack.

           Furniture crashes to the floor as the bodies are hit with
           bullets.  One window pane is sprayed with blood, while
           another shatters from a ricochet.

           The young man has fired six shots.  As he reloads, we can
           hear groaning coming from the victims.  Without any
           hesitation, he raises his gun again and continues to fire.

           Opening.  The young man stuffs his pockets with as many
           bills as he can manage.

           He has been shot twice: once in the chest and once in the
           stomach.  His body lies close to the kitchen door from a
           failed escape attempt.

           CLOSE ON TOM

           Sprawled and twisted in a booth.  He has been shot in the
           face, neck and legs.  His lifeless eyes stare at nothing.

           The portrait is now stained with blood.  We can still
           distinguish the president's cheerful smile.

           CLOSE ON MITCHELL

           Alive, barely.  He crawls through the wreckage towards
           the front door.  A trail of blood is left in his wake. 
           He has been shot in the arm and back.  We notice the young
           man appearing behind him, out of focus.

           Trudging slowly, and heavily, towards Mitchell.

           MITCHELL

           Attempts to heave himself forward with what little strength
           he can summon.  He tugs desperately at his surroundings. 
           However, the young man's boots soon catch up and stand
           before him, blocking his path.

           Mitchell collapses and begins to sob.  He looks up.

           HIS POV

           The young man raises his gun and points it right at us.

           Trembling.  Saliva hangs from his mouth.  The barrel of
           the pistol aimed inches from his face.

           HIGH WIDE SHOT

           OVER BLACK

           We hear the distant noise of a tumultuous crowd. 

           FADE UP:

           INT. RODEO ARENA -- EVENING

           BLACK AND WHITE

           A single slow-motion shot.  We see a gallant young cowboy
           on top of a strapping bull: one hand grips the bull rope,
           the other waves free.  His white hat hangs low, obscuring
           most of his face.  Numerous cameras flash from the stands. 

           As the animal bucks back and forth, the crowd's reaction
           builds to hysteria.  Two rodeo clowns stand nearby.  Then,
           the bull kicks both its hind legs dangerously high into
           the air.  The cowboy loses his balance.

           The audience continues to scream.  Pure pandemonium. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- MORNING

           CLOSE ON AN EYE

           Suddenly opening.  The pupil's diameter constricts. 

           Sam Lipinski, late fifties, wakes up with a start.  Shaken
           by his memory, he wipes sweat from his forehead.   Morning
           rays break through the room.  We hear cars pass by outside.

           Sam reaches across the bed to the nightstand and, with a
           metallic Zippo, lights himself a cigarette.

           CLOSE ON NIGHTSTAND

           A framed photograph sits upright.  In the picture, a woman
           in a 1950s swimsuit holds a young girl in her arms on a
           beach.  She does not smile.  The child is waving. 

           Sam exhales with a sigh.  Smoke surges above his head.

           INT. LIPINSKI BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON SINK

           A razor shakes in the water.  Dark shavings and white
           foam float across the surface.

           CLOSE ON PENDANT

           Of patron St. Jude that dangles from Sam's neck on a thin,
           silver chain.

           Sam studies himself as he shaves.  His face, once handsome
           in his youth, is now senescent and haggard.  Wrinkles
           cover his brow, and his hair is almost completely grey.

           He leans close to his reflection, carefully guiding the
           razor through the thick lather.  As we pull away we notice
           that his bare back is heavily scarred.

           SHOWER

           Sam steps under the steaming water.  He shuts his eyes,
           mollified. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- LATER

           CLOSE ON A COWBOY HAT

           White and well-worn, hanging from a bed post.  Sam's figure
           potters in the background, getting dressed.  We hold until
           his hand grasps the hat and removes it from the frame.

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- MORNING

           A modest room which serves as both a reception area for
           guests and a parlor for employees.  Behind the check-in
           desk is an armchair, a sofa, kitchen appliances and a
           small television unit.

           Various memorabilia hang from the walls: rodeo photographs,
           trophies, certificates, some civil war artifacts, a large
           bull skull, and an old-fashioned rifle.

           At the desk, with homework papers spread in front of her,
           sits sixteen-year-old Maggie Russell.  She quietly sings
           along to a portable radio: 'River' by Joni Mitchell.

           Sam emerges through a door at the back of the parlor,
           revealing a partial view of his bedroom.  He walks with a
           slight, yet noticeable limp.  Maggie turns.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh, Sam.

           She switches off the radio.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Did I wake you?

                                 SAM
                        Not at all, sweetheart.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'm sorry.  Was in a world of my
                        own.

           Sam opens the registration book and flips through the
           pages. 

                                 SAM
                        You keep on with the singin' and
                        you'll be givin' that Toni Mitchell
                        a run for her money.  

           Maggie blushes, smiles.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don't you mean Joni Mitchell?

           Sam realizes his mistake.  Winks.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I just made some.

                                 SAM
                        You're an angel, Maggie.  Heaven
                        sent.  Do I ever tell you that?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No.

                                 SAM
                        Well, I ought to.

           He gleefully fills a mug with hot coffee.

                        Where's Rose?  I could'a sworn
                        this was her shift.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It is.  She's on cleaning duty.

                                 SAM
                        Ain't you got school?

                        Don't have class till nine-thirty.  

           Sam wanders over to the open door of the office, and then
           leans against the doorjamb.  Sips his coffee.

                                 SAM
                        Well, it's some weather we're
                        havin'. 

           SAM POV

           A clear view of the motel.  Two dozen rooms stretched out
           in a U-shape.  A porch runs the entire length of the single
           storey building.  

           The cabins have been purposely built around a diminutive
           swimming-pool.  An adjacent car-park is situated in front
           of the office.  A busy highway bustles in the background. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Too hot for my liking.  I can't
                        sleep at night.

                                 SAM
                        Me neither, angel.  

           He squints into the sunlight.  Maggie smiles.

           As Sam loads a cigarette into his mouth, he spots an obese
           man bathing on a lounger by the pool.  Clad only in
           sunglasses and a speedo, the man's skin is seeping sweat.

                        I was wondering if I could pick
                        up some extra shifts before the
                        holidays?  I'm thinkin' about
                        taking a trip.

                                 SAM
                        Sure.  Where you goin' go?

                                 MAGGIE
                        I haven't decided yet.  Any ideas?

                        Some place cold.  And quiet, too. 
                        Get outta the damn sun.  Weather
                        like this can make folks do the
                        strangest things.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, but, Alaska's a little
                        drastic don't you think?

           Sam saunters back into the room.

                                 SAM
                        They've got towns up there filled
                        with people.  I hear the sun goes
                        down in November and doesn't come
                        back up till January.

                        All you can see are stars and
                        snow.  If I had a little time and
                        money, that's where I'd go. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Alright.  I was thinkin' more
                        like Florida.

                        Are you going to Bernadette's
                        tonight?  For the wake I mean.

                                 SAM
                            (still looking at
                             the newspapers)
                        We all should.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's nice of her to hold a service
                        for those men.  Considering there
                        were no public burials.

                                 SAM
                        Some things are just private I
                        guess.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I haven't seen her since.  Nobody
                        has.

           Sam removes his hat and then peers through the window
           blinds, idly. 

                                 SAM
                        Well, she's had it tough.  Each
                        of those families have.  
                            (pause)
                        Ain't that one of the Driscol
                        boys?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Huh?

           SAM POV

           Through the window, we see a teenage boy peddle into the
           driveway on his bicycle, struggling in the summer heat. 
           He grips a piece of paper in his hand.

                                 SAM
                        Comin' up the drive.  The youngest
                        one I think.  
                            (turning)
                        He your boyfriend?

           Maggie stands, nervous.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?  No!

           The boy bursts into the room: out of breath and saturated
           with sweat.  He is soft-spoken and hesitant.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        Bobby Driscol.  

                                 BOBBY
                        Hi Maggie.  Hello Mr. Lipinski.

           Sam nods, the cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is somethin' wrong?

                                 BOBBY
                        You--you got in!  The O'Mathy
                        state finals!  You got in! 
                        Everybody's talking about it.  

           He hands Maggie the soaked paper.  Her face lights up
           with excitement.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What?  Nu-uh.

                                 BOBBY
                        They posted it first thing this
                        morning, on the board outside the
                        gym.  

                                 SAM
                        Well, we've got the next Toni
                        Mitchell workin' at this motel.

                                 BOBBY
                        You sure do, sir.  A couple of
                        other girls got through too, but
                        I figure they don't stand a chance.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Stop.

                                 BOBBY
                        None of 'em can sing like you
                        can.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        You came all the way out here
                        just to tell me about this?  On
                        your bicycle?

           Bobby is disconcerted.

                                 BOBBY
                        Well, yeah.  I mean--I figured
                        you'd want to know as soon as--

                                 MAGGIE
                        --Bobby, it must be eighty-odd
                        degrees out.  

                                 BOBBY
                            (bashfully)
                        I guess so.

                                 MAGGIE
                        We're right on the edge of town. 
                        It's dangerous for you to peddle
                        up here on the highway.  

           Sam, smirking, fans himself with his hat.

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        You could have got in an accident.

           An awkward silence. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well, I best head on back to
                        school.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        Okay.

           Bobby advances backwards.

                                 BOBBY
                        Um, don't forget your paper on
                        the Battle of Gettysburg for Mrs. 
                        Halleck.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        I won't.

           Beat. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Well, see ya.

           Maggie says nothing. 

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Goodbye, sir.

           Sam nods farewell.  

           The boy turns, sheepishly, and leaves.  Sam, still smiling,
           looks over at Maggie.  She notices.  Beat. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        He's not my boyfriend. 

           Sam raises both hands in defense.  Then: 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Sam?

           He turns to see Rose Miller, a matronly woman in her
           sixties, standing in the doorway with a cleaning cart.   
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 ROSE
                        Some guests are complaining.  

           Beat.  There is a concerned look on her face. 

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        There's another disturbance.  At
                        number seven.  

           Sam sighs, then stubs out his cigarette.

           EXT. MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           A DOOR:  NO. 7

           We can hear the muffled sounds of a man shouting and the
           crashing of furniture.  Sam's hand enters to knock.  

           Silence.  Sam knocks again.

           The door swings open to reveal a shirtless, unshaven man. 
           He uses his burly frame to block the view inside the room.  

                                 MAN
                        Yeah?

           Sam takes off his hat. 

                                 SAM
                        Sorry for botherin' you so early. 
                        I'm the, uh, manager here at the
                        motel.  We've met before.

           The man says nothing.  Sam forces a congenial smile.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Sure is hot out today.  If the
                        weather keeps up like this--

                                 MAN
                        --what do you want?

                                 SAM
                        It's Mr. Barnes, correct?

           Beat. 

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Yeah.

                                 SAM
                        Well, Mr. Barnes, I'm afraid we've
                        been receivin' some complaints
                        about your room.

                                 MR.BARNES
                            (agitated)
                        What kind of complaints?

                                 SAM
                        Noise, mostly.  
                                 (MORE)

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Truth of the matter is this is
                        the second time that people have
                        come forward.

           Mr. Barnes stares, unfazed.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        On account of all the noise and
                        what have you.

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Sounds to me like people are just
                        playing their t.v.'s too loud.  

                                 SAM
                        Maybe. 

           INSIDE THE ROOM

           It is dark.  The shades are drawn.  An empty suitcase and
           numerous items of clothing are scattered across the floor. 
           A lamp has been knocked to the ground.  The bed is unmade.

           A woman, dressed only in her underwear, sits at the edge
           of the mattress.  She is turned away from the door, with
           her face hidden under a mess of hair.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        But, the thing is, there's been
                        reports of a woman screaming. 
                        From this room.  Number seven.

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Shit, the only woman here is my
                        wife, and she certainly ain't
                        been playin' up.

           He creaks the door open a little further.  Sunlight falls
           into the room, bathing the woman in light.

                                 MR.BARNES (CONT'D)
                        Have you honey?

           Beat.  She sniffles.

                                 WOMAN
                            (softly)
                        No.

                                 MR.BARNES
                        The man can't hear you.

                                 WOMAN
                        No.

           Mr. Barnes wedges himself back into the doorframe and
           scratches his stubble.  

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Guess we can't help you there.  
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 SAM
                        Guess not.

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Sure it was number seven?  You
                        shouldn't go round blaming people. 
                        It's unmannerly and offensive.

                                 SAM
                        Well, I mean no disrespect.  

                                 MR.BARNES
                        I just might have to register my
                        own complaint.  Against management.

           Sam stares. 

                                 SAM
                        Should anything be broken in that
                        room, you'll be held liable for
                        the damages--

           Mr. Barnes slams the door shut.  Sam takes a step back.  

           After a moment's pause, he turns his head back towards
           the office and sees Maggie standing in the doorway with
           her schoolbooks placed under one arm.  There is a solemn
           look on her face.

           Sam offers a smile of encouragement, then rests his hat
           back on top of his head.

           HIGH WIDE SHOT

           We pull up and away from the motel, floating above the
           swimming pool and parking lot until we come to rest on a
           sign facing out to the highway.  It reads:

           SWEET VIRGINIA MOTEL

           TV.  Pool.  Vacancy.

           EXT. BURKELL HOUSE -- NIGHT

           We move in on a two storey property on a quiet tree-lined
           street.  The large, white house is of typical American
           colonial design.  Numerous cars are parked in the driveway.

           INT. BURKELL HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A wake is in progress.  Most of the mourners are dressed
           in black attire.  Casual chatter and soft music fill the
           house.  Flowers and food cover the tables.  We work our
           way through the downstairs crowd and clamor.

           INT. BURKELL KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           and discuss dessert.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        Well, with this particular kind
                        of cobbler, you need to watch
                        that gingerbread mixture.

           INT. BURKELL LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           An old-man sleeps in an armchair: a napkin still tucked
           into his shirt.  Half a dozen people are seated around
           him.  They watch television, completely engrossed.  

           CLOSE ON T.V.

           News coverage of Mount St. Helens catastrophic eruption
           in Washington state.

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           We track along shelves and hangers that display a
           collection of men's clothes: shoes, shirts and suits.  

           A cabinet in an en-suite bathroom exposes aftershave and
           brylcreem.  Two toothbrushes are held upright in a glass.

           On a bedside cabinet, a man's watch and wedding ring are
           sealed inside a clear plastic evidence bag.

           Bernie Burkell studies this bag from her bed.  Spread
           around her, on the mattress, are copious business papers.

           Music from downstairs drifts in faintly.  There is a knock
           on the door.  Bernie pays no attention.  Beat.

           Another knock. 

           A young woman with pretty features enters.  This is Lila
           McBain: prim, naive, mid-twenties.

                        what you've done.  Pulling all
                        this together.  I've gotta run,

           She eases the door shut behind her.

                        He was a man, Lila.  There was
                        blood in his veins and hairs on
                        his back. 

           Lila sits beside Bernie and comforts her.

                        not alone.

           Bernie takes Lila's hand, consolingly.

                        Just listen to me complain.  You

                        has no logic.

                        together and not a goddamn tear. 
                        Despicable.

                        downstairs amongst family and
                        friends.  Get you a strong drink--

           Bernie rises.

                                 BERNIE
                        --I can't.  Not now.  I need to
                        finish filing these damn papers.  

           Lila turns to look at the documents sprawled across the
           mattress.  

                                 LILA
                        You look organized.

                                 BERNIE
                        Yeah, well, I've got Tom to thank
                        for that.  Insurances, records,
                        bills.  He's looking out for me
                        now, even from beyond the grave.

           Bernie starts to place some of the papers into a small,
           open safe in the wall.

           CLOSE ON SAFE 

           Reveals its contents: files, jewelry boxes and several
           short stacks of money.  Hundred dollar bills.

           Lila notices.

                                 LILA
                        Tom really didn't trust the banks,
                        did he?

                                 BERNIE
                        Nope.

                                 LILA
                        Mitch always thought he was just
                        avoiding taxes. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Most people did.  But, he was
                        right.  Why pay someone an arm
                        and a leg to keep what's yours?  

           Bernie closes the steel door and spins the dial.  She
           then lifts and places a large-framed painting over the
           wall-safe.

                        involved.  Judas taught us that.

           Suddenly, Lila embraces Bernie.

           Bernie gently strokes the young woman's hair.  Lila looks

                        for the girls.  First the murders,
                        now this.  Barbara keeps puttin'
                        his food out.  Like he might smell
                        it and come home.

           Sam takes a drag from his cigarette. 

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        Ah, he'll turn up soon enough. 
                        Bound to in this town.  Damn border
                        collie.  Well, I better make--

           Footsteps approach the porch.  The back door squeaks open
           and Bernie emerges.  

           Sam rises and removes his hat.  He tosses his cigarette
           into the dirt.  Marty pulls his shirt straight.

                                 BERNIE
                        At ease, gentlemen.

                                 MARTY
                        'Lo Bernie.

           An awkward silence.

                                 BERNIE
                        Am I disrupting anything?

                                 MARTY
                        Not at all.  Fact is, I was just
                        on my way.  Barbara won't sleep
                        unless I tuck her in, y'see.  

           Bernie takes a seat on the steps.  Sam hesitates for a
           second, then sits down next to her.

           Beat. 

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        Will I catch either of you at
                        Buck's retirement? 

                                 SAM
                        Sure.  I'll be droppin' by.

                                 MARTY
                        Bernie?

                                 BERNIE
                        Maybe.

                                 MARTY
                        Well, it'd be nice to see you
                        there.  I'll say good night then.  

                                 BERNIE
                        Night Marty.

           They watch the officer shuffle across the lawn into the
           shadows.  Sam loads two cigarettes into his mouth and
           lights them both.  He hands one to Bernie.

           A beat.  

                                 SAM
                        Christ, Bernie.  I don't know
                        what to say.

                                 BERNIE
                        Then don't say anythin'.

           An uncomfortable silence.  They smoke.  

           Bernie then reaches out and runs her fingers through Sam's
           hair.  She tucks some loose strands behind one ear.  

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        It's getting long again.  I need
                        to cut it.

           Sam stares ahead only.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.

           Her hand falls softly to his cheek.  She keeps it there a
           moment before pulling away.

                                 BERNIE
                        Maybe I could swing by later.  If
                        you want.

                                 SAM
                        I'm not sure that's a good idea,
                        Bernie.  

                                 BERNIE
                        I guess it isn't.  Perhaps I'm
                        being foolish.

           Beat.  They continue to smoke.  Finally, Bernie stubs out
           her cigarette and stands.  She wipes ash from her skirt.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Well, I'll see you Samuel.  Thanks
                        for coming.  Means a lot to me. 

           She leaves.  Sam turns.

                                 SAM
                        I'm sorry Bernie--
           © Paul China, 2011

           The back door swings shut: Bernie is now lost amongst a
           sea of mourners.  Her figure grows smaller as she makes
           her way through the room.

           As we hold on Sam, alone under the porch light, we hear
           the honky-tonk intro to 'Cotton Fields' by Creedence
           Clearwater Revival.

           INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           A seedy venue replete with male patrons.  The song blares
           from a jukebox. 

           Lila, clad in black formal wear, enters.  She is clearly
           discomfited by her surroundings.  Her eyes scan the bar. 

           CLOSE ON BOOTS

           Sticking out from a booth at the back of the room.

           Lila approaches.

           A lone occupant sits at this table: it is the young man
           from the diner.  His head bobs to the beat of the music,
           as he ardently chomps on some chewing gum.

                                 LILA
                        Are you Elwood? 

           The young man does not answer: instead he continues to
           enjoy the jukebox track.  Lila stands uncomfortably.

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        Is your name El--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --you like Creedence?

                                 LILA
                        What? 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Ain't nobody like 'em.  They had
                        that thing y'know?  That kick. 
                        But, y'know what's crazy?  They
                        never had a number one hit single
                        in this country.  Came in second
                        a couple of times, but they never
                        got what was due.  Mind you, they
                        did reach the top of the charts
                        over in, uh, England.  That's in
                        Europe.  

                                 LILA
                        I know where England is.

                                 ELWOOD
                        And I could never figure out where
                        they came from.  My guess was
                        Louisiana.

                        But, of all places, they were
                        from California.  El Cerrito or
                        some-shit.  A small city in Contra
                        Costa County.  Matter of fact, my
                        mother was born near there. 
                        Nineteen thirty-three, in a house
                        up on Albany Hill.  Her grandfather
                        was killed in that, uh, dynamite
                        explosion.  Nineteen o' five I
                        think that was.  You ever been to
                        California?

                                 LILA
                        No.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Me neither.  Always wanted to
                        though.

           Beat.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Don't you wanna sit down?  You
                        won't catch nothin'.  

           Lila sits.  Another beat.  Elwood chews. 

                                 LILA
                            (softly)
                        Why'd you go kill those men?

                                 ELWOOD
                        I was only doin' my job, you know
                        that--

                                 LILA
                        --it was supposed to be just
                        Mitchell.  That's all.  I mean, I--
                        I sent Miles that photo of him,
                        the, uh, one taken from last
                        Christmas.  With the beige sweater. 
                        Didn't you get it?  I remember
                        him sayin'--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --whoa, this ain't Miles' deal no
                        more.  Alright?  I did what needed
                        to be done.  What had to be done--  

           A waitress arrives, collecting glasses.  She snatches up
           Elwood's empty beer bottle and places it onto her tray.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Another?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Same again.

                                 WAITRESS
                            (to Lila)
                        How about yourself?
           © Paul China, 2011

           Lila shakes her head.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Naw, she'll have one too.  And
                        make sure they're cold.  That
                        last one was warm as piss.

           He watches the waitress depart. 

                                 LILA
                        I didn't ask for this.  Not at
                        all.  Those other men, they--they
                        didn't deserve it.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, that may be so.  But there's
                        nothin' we can do about that now? 
                        I can't turn back the clocks.  

                                 LILA
                        You had a choice though.  Perhaps
                        you should talk to Miles.  I mean,
                        couldn't you have waited till--

           Elwood smacks the table-top with his fist.  Lila is
           startled.  Some men seated nearby glance over. 

                                 ELWOOD
                            (leaning forward)
                        --your husband weren't comin' out
                        of that diner.  It's that simple. 
                        Now, I was told he would have
                        been finished up by midnight.  So
                        who's faults that?  Christ, they
                        think it was a robbery.  You should
                        be celebrating.  Tellin' me when
                        I'm gonna get my money-- 

           The waitress returns and sets two beer bottles on the
           table.  She waits: her hands resting idly on her hips.

           Beat. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        They're cold.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        So?  

                                 WAITRESS
                        You not wanna test 'em?

                                 ELWOOD
                        You not wanna tip?

           She rolls her eyes and leaves.

                                 LILA
                        Don't you worry about that.  It's
                        all taken care of.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Alright.  When?

           Lila is somewhat confused. 

                                 LILA
                        Didn't Miles explain--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --when?

                                 LILA
                        This week.  I thought you knew
                        about the arrangement.  I'm--I'm
                        seeing Albert Farmsworth first
                        thing Wednesday morning.  He's
                        our lawyer.  Mitchell's lawyer.

                                 ELWOOD
                        I'm owed fifty remember?  

           Lila nods.  

                                 LILA
                        Oh, there's plenty.  Mitchell was
                        good with finances.  He had two
                        bank accounts for Pete's sake. 
                        Life insurance.  Some bonds too. 
                        Plus... 
                            (contentedly)
                        ...I'm the only one that's written
                        in his will.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        That right?  

                                 LILA
                        Yes.  I made sure of it.  Right
                        after our honeymoon in Phoenix. 
                        I'm not a dummy.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, I hope not.

                                 LILA
                        I was smarter than him.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Won't hold that against you. 
                        He's the one that's dead.

           Lila reaches for her beer and takes a self-conscious sip. 
           Repulsed by the taste, she places the bottle back on the
           table and holds her fingers to her mouth.  

           She swallows with dismay. 

           After an awkward silence, through which Elwood continues
           to stare:

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        So.  Why'd you kill him?

                                 LILA
                        I didn't.  You did.

                                 ELWOOD
                            (sighs)
                        Why'd you want him dead?   

           Lila looks down into her lap, sheepishly.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        He beat you up or somethin'?

                                 LILA
                        No.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, what then?

           He waits for a response.  Finally:

                                 LILA
                        He was always cheating on me. 
                        Any chance he'd get.  Girls used
                        to call the house.  Anytime of
                        night.   
                            (pause)
                        He went to a whorehouse in Dallas
                        once.  It was called Pink...
                            (embarrassed)
                        ...Pink Pussy.

           Elwood tries to conceal a germinating grin. 

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        I had somebody follow him. 
                        Undercover, y'know?  A PI.  Well,
                        Mitchell was a pig alright.  One
                        time he...

           Lila hesitates.  

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        ...one time he gave me a venereal
                        disease.

           She lowers her head to her chest, utterly ashamed.  Elwood
           stops his chewing: a hint of consideration.  

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                            (softly)
                        It ain't right.  

           Suddenly, we hear: 

                                 DJ (O.S.)
                        Time's time Gentlemen.  So reach
                        into those pockets--

           DJ CUBICLE

           A dour looking DJ speaks into a microphone: his voice a
           barely audible monotone.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 DJ (CONT'D)
                        --and show your appreciation. 
                        Vera's our first girl tonight, so
                        remember: take out that green if
                        you wanna be seen.

           A scantily dressed young woman struts onto a small stage
           with a mirrored backdrop.  'Back Door Man' by the Doors
           erupts from the speakers.

           The majority of the bar-folk gape and gawk at the girl's
           denuded flesh.  Others pay no attention: they shoot pool
           and chatter amongst themselves.

           Onstage, the stripper dances with minimal enthusiasm. 
           The crowd cheers as she sways her ass in their direction.  

           BACK ON BOOTH

           Lila is sliding Elwood a napkin across the table.  She
           puts a fountain pen back into her purse.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Look at that: a home number. 
                        This all works out I could take
                        you to a movie.  Dinner, too.  

                                 LILA
                        Um, well--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --don't look so horrified.  I'm
                        just teasin'.  

           Lila forces a weak smile.

                                 LILA
                        Where are you stayin'?  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Don't you worry about that.  The
                        less you know the better.

                                 LILA
                        Okay.  I guess that's it then.

           Lila stands. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        You not wanna stay for the show? 

           Lila glances over at the stage.  The young woman is now
           removing some articles of clothes.  

                                 LILA
                        No.  No thank you.

           She goes to leave.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Lila.

           She peeks back over her shoulder.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I don't think I need to tell you
                        what'll happen if I don't get
                        what's owed.  

           Lila nods, timidly.

           IN A SERIES OF SHOTS

           Note: the remainder of this scene is played out in slow-
           motion, and is scored solely to the stripper's selected
           music. 

           We track in front of Lila as she makes her way through
           the bar.  She clutches her purse to her stomach.  Her
           eyes are then drawn back to the stage.

           The young woman is crawling across the floor on all fours. 
           She tosses her hair from side to side.  The crowd grows
           tumultuous.

           Elwood watches the performance from his booth.  He swigs
           leisurely from his beer.

           The stripper now arches her back, hoisting her backside 
           high into the air.

           Lila averts her eyes as she nears the exit.

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           Sam is in bed.  He stares at the ceiling with an arm folded
           behind his head.

           A pair of headlights break through the room as we hear a
           vehicle pull up outside.

           Sam sits up: listening intently.  We hear a car door open
           and shut, followed by the sound of footsteps on gravel.  

           He reaches over to the nightstand.

           CLOSE ON FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH

           Of the woman and child at the beach.  Sam turns the picture
           face down.

           DOOR

           Muffled knocking.  Sam opens it dressed only in his
           underwear. 

           Bernie stands before him on the porch.  They stare at
           each other, uncertain what to say.  Then: 

                                 BERNIE
                            (reaching into her
                             handbag)
                        I brought you a book.  
           © Paul China, 2011

           Sam leans out of the doorway and twists his head toward
           the motel rooms: his eyes somewhat suspicious.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Nobody saw me, Samuel.

           OPEN WINDOW

           Curtains whisk gently in the summer night breeze.  We pan
           across the room to reveal Sam and Bernie in bed: their
           bodies passionately entwined in white sheets.

           They kiss tenderly.  Sam pulls back and gazes amorously
           into Bernie's eyes.  Slowly, his head inches down her
           body and out of the frame.  

           We hold on Bernie as she writhes in ecstasy.  As the climax
           builds, she turns her face to one side and bites her bottom
           lip.  Then --

           -- she lets out a sharp, uncontrollable moan. 

           LATER

           The couple are clasped in bed: their naked figures bathed
           in moonlight.  Sam's head rests on Bernie's chest.  She
           gently caresses his hair.  Beat.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I really need to cut it soon.

                                 SAM
                        Mm-hmm.

                                 BERNIE
                        Too hot for you in this heat.

           Bernie toys with Sam's necklace, then places the St. Jude
           pendant between her thumb and forefinger.  She studies
           the artifact closely. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        You really think you're a lost
                        cause, Samuel?

                                 SAM
                        I'm not sure.

                                 BERNIE
                        Well, I am.  And you're not.  

                                 SAM
                        Yes ma'am.

                                 BERNIE
                        Don't you ma'am me.  There's no
                        greys on my head.  My teeth are
                        still my own.

           Sam chuckles.  Bernie smiles.  Beat.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I love you, y'know.

                                 SAM
                        I don't see why.  I'm just an ol'
                        cowboy with a limp.

                                 BERNIE
                        No.  That isn't true.  You're a
                        good man Samuel.  Good men are
                        hard to find.

           Beat.

                                 SAM
                        Tom was a good man.

                                 BERNIE
                        Yes.  Yes, he was.  Christ, he
                        put a ring on my finger when no-
                        one would have me.  Even though
                        he knew my ovaries were withered.  

           Sam runs his thumb around her navel.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        He didn't talk much, but when he
                        did, people paid attention.   
                            (pause)
                        Samuel?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.

                                 BERNIE
                        Where do you reckon he is?

                                 SAM
                        Somewhere.  Heaven.

                                 BERNIE
                        You really believe that?

                                 SAM
                            (sadly)
                        No.

                                 BERNIE
                        I still feel like he's here.  In
                        the shadows of our house.  In the
                        earth.  In the soil.

           Bernie traces a finger along the scars on Sam's back:
           over every groove, blemish and indentation.

                                 SAM
                        Nobody can ever go away.  Not
                        really.  You can't erase the past.  
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 BERNIE
                        I loved him, it's just I--I wasn't
                        in love with him.  There's a
                        difference, y'know?  People forget. 
                        They get weighed down by
                        convenience.  We hadn't made love
                        in twelve years.  You can't
                        overlook somethin' like that.   

           Bernie's finger continues to explore the enduring evidence
           of Sam's injuries.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Intimacy.  Flesh and blood.

           Sam ponders.

                                 SAM
                        Flesh and blood.

           LATER

           It is dawn.  Bernie scoops her garments from the floor as
           she dresses.  Sam sleeps, peacefully. 

           Quietly, Bernie approaches the bed and pulls the sheets
           up around his shoulders.  He stirs, but only for a moment. 

           CLOSE ON NIGHTSTAND

           Bernie's hand enters the frame and stands the photograph
           upright.  She then places a weathered copy of a novel
           nearby: 'The Ballad of the Sad Cafe' by Carson McCullers.

           EXT. ROAD -- MORNING

           A boy, wearing summer shorts and a baseball cap, races
           his bicycle down a country road.  We track behind him as
           he turns into the parking lot of the Fairvale Diner.  

           The dark building is encased with cautionary tape.  It
           stands silent, spectral.  A window is boarded with wood.

           INT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           THROUGH A WINDOW

           The boy creeps up to the murky glass and peers inside.

           HIS POV

           Patches of sun rays and shadows.  More police tape.  Faded
           chalk outlines on the floor.  Possibly dried blood.

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Satisfied, the youngster scours the ground for a decent-
           sized stone.  He finally seizes one and, after hesitating,
           hurls it at the diner.
           © Paul China, 2011

           An entire window shatters.  Glass bursts everywhere. 
           Panicked, the boy sprints to his bicycle and flees: unaware
           his baseball cap has fallen behind. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- MORNING

           HIGH SHOT

           An Osprey has perched on top of the motel sign, observing
           the cars on the highway.  

           We hold until the bird takes flight.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           We track in on a frumpish woman doing a crossword puzzle
           in bed.  As we do so, we hear sporadic banging over static.

           REVERSE ANGLE

           Shows a middle-aged man standing over a small television. 
           The screen is scrambled.  Occasionally, we glimpse a sports
           news channel.  

           The man pounds the top of the t.v. with his fist.

                                 WOMAN
                            (Long Island accent)
                        Wilbert.  Will you let me
                        concentrate?

                                 WILBERT
                            (Long Island accent)
                        Honey, don't get me started now--

                                 WOMAN
                        --what did Dr. Schenck say?  Huh? 
                        About our individual spaces?  

           Wilbert tweaks the antennas, agitated.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Are you listening to me Wilbert?

           No response.  

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Will you quit that racket!  My
                        mother can hear you back in
                        Uniondale!   

                                 WILBERT
                        It's the Stanley Cup Playoffs. 
                        We talked about this.  Dr. Schenck
                        said--

                                 WOMAN
                        --if it means that much to you,
                        go listen to the summary on the
                        radio.  Car's parked just outside.

           Wilbert breathes deeply: a desperate attempt to calm his
           nerves.  

                                 WILBERT
                        Nystrom scored in overtime, of
                        game six.  I wanna see the
                        highlights.  

                                 WOMAN
                        You wanted to drive, Wilbert. 
                        Save on money.  I don't know why
                        I bothered coming along.  Who
                        wants to go to Memphis?  

                                 WILBERT
                        It's my cousin's wedding.  He
                        came to ours.

                                 WOMAN
                        Look how that turned out.  Your
                        brother forgot the ring and your
                        ex-wife showed up.  Some family. 

           She proceeds with her crossword.  Wilbert lowers his head,
           sighs.  Beat. 

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        No wonder I've got piles. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON DOOR

           As it shuts. 

           Wilbert leaves his motel room and heads toward the parking
           lot: car keys in hand.  Children play in the pool, nearby.

           SAM 

           Stands in the office doorway, sipping coffee.  He stares
           off-screen. 

           The obese man from earlier is once again sprawled across
           a lounger: blistering in the sun.

           Wilbert approaches.

                                 WILBERT
                        Some morning. 

                                 SAM
                        You leavin' us Mr. Behrman?

           Wilbert glances at his watch.

                                 WILBERT
                        Oh, we'll make tracks just before
                        lunch.  You've got us for a couple
                        of hours yet.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 SAM
                        Well, take your time.

                                 WILBERT
                        We'll be back in a couple of days
                        though.  Break up the journey. 
                        That's if you've got room for us.

           As Wilbert leaves: 

                                 SAM
                        There's always room Mr. Behrman.  

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam shuffles in and pours himself some more coffee.  He
           loads a cigarette into his mouth and searches his trouser
           pockets for the Zippo.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Shouldn't smoke y'know.

           Sam turns to see a young man with well-combed hair standing
           behind the reception desk.  It is Elwood: chewing gum. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Those white sticks are killers. 
                        Do more damage than good.  

                                 SAM
                        So people keep tellin' me.

           Elwood nods his head forward.

                                 ELWOOD
                        I like your hat.

                                 SAM
                        Thank you...

           Sam runs his fingers across the rim, bashfully. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        ...been keepin' my head dry over
                        the years.  

           Elwood stares.  Silence. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Do we know each other?

                                 SAM
                            (pause)
                        Have you stayed here before?

                                 ELWOOD
                        No, sir.  This is my first visit
                        to the Old Dominion.  But, I like
                        to think everybody knows everybody. 
                        Somehow or other.   

           Elwood continues to gape. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           Sam musters a nervous laugh, then retrieves the Zippo
           from his shirt-breast pocket.

                                 SAM
                        Well, mister, what can I do for
                        you?

           He lights his cigarette.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Where are my manners?  The name
                        is Elwood.

           He offers his hand: Sam shakes it.

                                 SAM
                        Sam.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Pleasure to meet you, Sam.  I'm
                        in room fourteen.  A pretty girl
                        checked me in a few nights back. 
                        Now, I said I'd be out of your
                        hair by this evenin', but...

           Sam scans through the registration book: the cigarette
           dangling from his mouth.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...there's been a slight change
                        in plan, unfortunately--

                                 SAM
                        --cabin fourteen, you say?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Yes, sir.  One and four.  Y'see,
                        I was hopin' I could hold on to
                        it for just a couple more days. 
                        I'm aware of your policies--

           Sam raises his head from the registration book. 

                                 SAM
                        --sure.  Room's yours.  We've got
                        no further bookings.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        You don't need an extra deposit?

                                 SAM
                        We got your first payment.  There's
                        no reason for another retainer.

           Elwood grins: almost sadistically.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well.  I appreciate that, Sam. 

                                 SAM
                        Just doin' my job is all--
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 ELWOOD
                        --whoa!  Will you look at that. 

           Sam turns to see what has caught the man's attention: it
           is the old-fashioned rifle that hangs on the wall behind.

           Elwood whistles.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Boy, that is somethin'.  

                                 SAM
                        It's German.  That usually puts
                        most people off.  

           CLOSE ON RIFLE

           The emblem of Nazi Germany, an eagle with a swastika, is
           imprinted on the weapon. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        The Karabiner 98k Kurz they called
                        it.  Manufactured by Mauser in
                        thirty-five.  Nazi infantry rifle.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        No kiddin'?

                                 SAM
                        My uncle Conrad seized it off a
                        paratrooper in Northern France. 
                        Used it, too.  Said he wouldn't
                        of made it home otherwise. 
                            (looks at cupboards)
                        Hell, he even kept some cartridges. 
                        I got 'em in a box someplace.  

           Elwood is interested: 

                                 ELWOOD
                        What happened to the man it
                        belonged to?  The German.

                                 SAM
                        His name was, uh, Gustav Witz. 
                        So his wallet said anyways.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Your uncle shoot him?

                                 SAM
                        Said he didn't.  Claimed he found
                        him slumped under a tree, just
                        holdin' a photograph of his wife. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        So how'd he die?  

                                 SAM
                        Broken heart I guess.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 ELWOOD
                        Better that than a bullet.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe.  Maybe not.

           An uncomfortable beat.  Both men smile: amused by their
           conduct and conversation.  

           Elwood runs his eyes over the additional relics displayed
           on the wall.  Sam dallies with his hat.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Well, I'm glad we got your room
                        sorted.  Truth is, we don't get--

           Elwood, in sheer revelry, smacks the desk with his palm.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Jesus Christ!

           Sam is alarmed, confused. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ!

           Elwood paces back and forth: unable to contain his
           excitement.  He shakes a finger at the rodeo photographs.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You're him!  That rodeo champ? 
                        The bull rider?  It's you, right?  

           Sam is equally enamored and embarrassed.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Fuck me.  I knew I recognized you
                        from someplace!
                            (remembering)
                        Shit, it's, uh, Lib--Libinski,
                        right?  Libinski?

                                 SAM
                        Lipinski.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Lipinski!  Hell, my father would
                        have a heart attack if he were
                        here now.  He's a Tennessee man,
                        like yourself, huh?  

                                 SAM
                        Born and bred.

           Sam's hand is held steady: the cigarette placed between
           his fingers now forms a large amount of ash. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        He raised me in Oak Ridge.  Christ,
                        I remember it now.  He used to
                        drive to all your shows.

                        Outta state, too.  Wyoming.  Texas. 
                        Even took me as a boy.  He was a
                        bronc rider, y'know.  In his youth. 
                        Worshipped the ground you walked
                        on.  Kept pictures of you from
                        the papers and everythin'.   

           Elwood shakes his head in utter disbelief. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Shit, he even followed you out to
                        the NFR's in Nevada.  Remember? 
                        That year when you...

           Elwood suddenly hesitates.  Sam studies him with interest:
           his cigarette, untouched, molding into a stick of ash.

           Beat.

                        ...well, you know what happened. 
                        You were there after all.

                                 SAM
                        That I was.

                                 ELWOOD
                        You don't need me spittin' it
                        out.  

           Another beat. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You must get recognized all the
                        time.  Probably gets on your
                        nerves. 

                                 SAM
                        People, they don't remember.  Or
                        they forget.  I'm happy either
                        way. 

           Elwood is convinced.  Beat.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, I'll catch you around Sam. 
                        And thanks once again...

           Sam smiles, feebly.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...I appreciate your help.

           As he leaves:

                                 SAM
                        Mind how you go.  Pass my regards
                        on to your father.

           Elwood pauses by the office doorway: the sun now beating
           at his face.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Will do.  But, I won't see him
                        for awhile.  He's dead and buried. 

           Sam stares after the young man as he vanishes into the
           harsh brightness of daylight.

           CLOSE ON CIGARETTE

           Now just a strand of burnt ash.  We hold until it crumbles
           and falls apart.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING -- DAY

           ESTABLISHING SHOT

           An antiquated building in the center of town.  Lettering
           stenciled on a large window reads:

           A. K. FARMSWORTH 

           LAWYER, ACCOUNTS & CATERING

           INT. RECEPTION -- DAY

           A staid waiting room.  We track in on Lila sitting upright
           in a chair: knees together and hands resting in her lap. 
           Seated nearby are two women: both read a magazine.

           A young receptionist giggles on the telephone: her dialogue
           faint and indistinct.  A fan squeaks as it slowly turns.

           Lila notices the other women peeking at her behind their
           periodicals.  Disquieted, she reaches for a magazine and
           begins to flip through its pages.

           CLOSE ON MAGAZINE 

           Show a variety of stories.  One headline reads: 'Pac-Man:
           The Social Phenomenon Uncovered'.

           Lila stops on a photograph of a young woman who looks
           strikingly similar to herself.  

           A caption below states: 'True Confessions: I Hired A Killer
           to Murder My Husband...Now He's After Me'.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Ms. McBain?

           Lila stares in absolute horror.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Excuse me, Ms. McBain?  

           She looks up, disoriented.  The receptionist stands with
           a solicitous look upon her face.  The two women with
           magazines also share the same expression.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Farmsworth will see you now.

           We hold on the wide-eyed Lila.  

           INT. FARMSWORTH OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Albert K. Farmsworth, a corpulent man with a receding
           hairline, struggles to open a window: his plump fingers
           squeezed between the sash and sill.

           Lila waits patiently at his desk: listening to the man
           grunt.  Eventually, after a considerable amount of
           commotion, he gives up.

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        Hotter than a honeymoon hotel. 

           He wheezes back over to his desk, defeated.

                                 FARMSWORTH (CONT'D)
                        Sorry about that.  Window must be
                        jammed.  

           Farmsworth collapses into his chair, which, due to its
           design, causes him to roll away and spin around.  

           He struggles to pull himself back: his heels scraping
           wildly at the ground.  Lila watches, motionless.  

                                 FARMSWORTH (CONT'D)
                        There we go.  That does it.
                            (writhing)
                        Unfortunately, the fan doesn't
                        work either.

           He slaps a portable fan on the desktop.  The device makes
           an unhealthy buzzing sound: its blades barely move.

                                 FARMSWORTH (CONT'D)
                        Circuits gone or somethin'.  Say,
                        you want a root-beer?

                                 LILA
                        What?

           Farmsworth bends down and reaches into a bulky cooler
           loaded with ice and soft drink cans.  He takes out the
           mentioned beverage.

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        Cool you down a little?

           Lila shakes her head.

                                 LILA
                        Oh, no.  No thank you.

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        I can't survive the heat-wave
                        without a cold refreshment.  

           Farmsworth opens the can, causing foam to spray everywhere. 
           He quickly gulps on the drink to stop the spillage, then
           lets out a slight belch.

                                 FARMSWORTH (CONT'D)
                        Pardon me.  It's the damn foam. 
                        Upsets my stomach.  Ain't good
                        for the IBS.  My wife says it
                        makes my breath smell, too.  But
                        I always say "Rita, darlin', bad
                        breath is better than no breath
                        at all."

           Farmsworth chuckles.  Lila forces a smile.  Beat.

                                 FARMSWORTH (CONT'D)
                        So Ms. McBain--

                                 LILA
                        --Lila.  Please.

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        Lila.  I don't really know if
                        it's my place to discuss such
                        formidable matters.
                            (pause)
                        Ms. McBain, were you aware of
                        your husband's financial
                        difficulties?

                                 LILA
                        Difficulties?

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        His troubles?  As you're probably
                        aware, I hadn't seen Mitchell in
                        a number of years.  So, this is
                        all relatively new information. 
                        For the both of us.  Anyways, I
                        ran some credit checks and called
                        the taxation depart--

                                 LILA
                        --taxation?  Wait--what?  I don't
                        understand.  

           Beat.  Farmsworth breathes deeply, then sighs.

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        Your husband was bankrupt Ms.
                        McBain.  I'm sorry to be the one
                        to lay that--

           Lila shakes her head: refusing to believe such allegations.

                                 LILA
                        --no, no.  There must be some
                        mistake.  Mitchell was an
                        entrepreneur.  A business man. 
                        He had thousands of dollars.   

           Farmsworth leans back into his chair, then swabs his clammy
           forehead with a tissue.  
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        How much did you really know about
                        your husband's businesses?  Two
                        former partners were suing him. 
                        Did you know that?  He's had run-
                        ins with the IRS since '75--

           Lila starts to panic.

                                 LILA
                        --but what about the will?  And
                        the insurances?  He showed me the
                        papers. I've got bills.  Expenses.  

                                 FARMSWORTH
                        I'm sorry Ms. McBain, but none of
                        that carries any weight.  It's of
                        no consequence.  Now, the bank
                        owns your house--

                                 LILA
                        --I'm a widow for Chrissakes!
                            (beginning to cry)
                        I-I still need to make payments
                        on his casket.  Solid mahogany it
                        was.    

           Farmsworth lowers his head.   

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        I can't give that back.  If I had
                        known all this I would have thrown
                        that...monster out with the trash--

           Lila breaks into an uncontrollable sob.  Farmsworth, ill
           at ease, slides a box of tissues across the desktop.

           After a moment of indecision, he takes a much-needed swig
           from his root-beer.  Lila continues to cry.

           INT. TOWN HALL -- EVENING

           A bustling party.  

           A large banner reads: 'Happy Retirement!'.  A live band
           plays honky-tonk music as couples whirl on the dance floor.  

           Sam watches the celebrations unfold.  Marty Petrone, out
           of uniform, stands nearby: a small girl dozes in his arms.

                                 MARTY
                        Damn dignitaries.  Captain can't
                        do a thing. 

           Sam lights a cigarette and gazes across the room. 

           Bernie sits with a group of women at a table decked with
           food.  She catches Sam's eye: her fixed look broken by
           the swaying bodies on the dance floor.  
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        This is a murder investigation. 
                        Capital offence.  No place for
                        geographical dispute--

           The young girl squirms in his arms.  Marty lifts her to
           the ground.

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        --okay, okay.  There you go.  Go
                        see mom.

           She runs to join some other children popping balloons. 
           Sam observes: cigarette in mouth.  A thin smile. 

                                 SAM
                        Did your dog turn up?  Shankly?

                                 MARTY
                            (shakes head)
                        Cheryl's been puttin' up flyers,
                        but it hasn't done any good.

                                 SAM
                        Sorry, Marty.

                                 MARTY
                        Oh, we'll find him.  Mark my words.  

           Cigarette smoke clouds the air around them. 

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        We ain't caught our gunman, but
                        we'll catch that canine.

           Sam looks back over at Bernie: her chair now empty.

                                 MARTY (CONT'D)
                        If not, what hope is there?  

           MAGGIE RUSSELL

           Stands with two friends by a punch bowl, laughing.  Over
           her shoulder we see Bobby Driscol approaching: a tense
           look plastered across his face.  

                                 BOBBY
                        'Lo, Maggie. 

           The girls hush up.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hi Bobby.

           An uncomfortable silence.  Bobby fidgets. 

                                 BOBBY
                        I was wonder--

                                 MAGGIE
                        --your shirt's nice.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 BOBBY
                        Thanks.  Reminded me of Travolta. 
                        Y'know, like 'Urban Cowboy'?

           Beat.  Maggie is confused.  

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Well, I was wonderin' if you'd
                        like to dance.  With me, I mean.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh.  Bobby, that's kind, but I--I
                        can't dance with you. 

                                 BOBBY
                        Okay.  
                            (pause)
                        I'll see you, then.

           He turns: now desperate to leave. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        It's not you.  I have two left
                        feet.  I'd make an idiot of myself.  

                                 BOBBY
                        It's alright.

           Bobby hurries away, humiliated.  Maggie watches with
           remorse as her friends start to snigger.

           Empty.  We hear the partygoers cheer and applaud as Buck
           Boyd, a short fellow with a thick moustache, steps up to
           the microphone.  He is clearly affected by the reception.

           The ovation then fades.  Beat.

                                 BUCK
                        Now I forgot what I was going to
                        say.

                            (shouting)
                        Welcome to retirement Buck!

           Laughter. 

                                 BUCK
                        Who's that?  That you, Earl? 
                        Sonofabitch.   

           Further laughter.  

                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        Well, here it is.  The end of
                        another road.  Forty-four years
                        of work.  Boy, did it go fast.

                        I still feel like the young man I
                        always was.  Full of adventure. 
                        Wonder.  Just now my bones ache. 
                        My muscles get tired.  But, I do
                        not regret gettin' older.  It is
                        a privilege denied to many.  This,
                        of course, brings me to the three
                        gentlemen that are not here with
                        us tonight.

           Silence.  Buck muses.

           CLOSE ON VARIOUS FACES

           Listening intently.

                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        Lou Hopkis.  I've been eating at
                        Lou's for over thirty years. 
                        Like a lot of you.  Nobody needed
                        a shrink when Lou was around. 
                        Just head over to that diner.  An
                        hour and a bottle of whiskey later,
                        you were as good as new.   
                            (pause)
                        Mitchell McBain.  He was a good
                        boy.  Lovin' husband.  Big earner,
                        too.  A young man in his prime
                        gone too soon.
                            (pause)
                        And Tom Burkell.   

           CLOSE ON SAM

           Hat in hand: his attention held. 

                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        He never had a bad word to say
                        about anybody.  And if he did,
                        well, hell they probably deserved
                        it.  So, I'd like you to raise
                        those glasses in a toast.

           Buck lifts a shot-glass high into the air.  

                                 BUCK (CONT'D)
                        "To die completely, a person must
                        not only forget but be forgotten. 
                        And those who are not forgotten,
                        are not dead."  

           He slings the liquor into his mouth.  We hear some of the
           mob yell: 'Amen!'

           LATER

           The band plays a soul ballad: 'My Lover's Prayer' by Otis
           Redding.  Sam stands at the back of the hall, listening
           to an intoxicated individual blather and belch.

                                 DRUNKEN MAN
                        He used to be a democrat for Pete's
                        sake.  Only switched over in '62.   

           The man burps.  Sam observes him, curiously. 

                                 DRUNKEN MAN (CONT'D)
                        I mean, sure, he was defeated
                        twice in the nominations. 

           Another belch.

                                 DRUNKEN MAN (CONT'D)
                        But we're givin' him the short
                        end of the stick.  Carter's bitten
                        off more than he can chew.  Christ,
                        he pardoned that damn Cuban.  

                                 SAM
                        Puerto Rican.  

                                 DRUNKEN MAN
                        Puerto Rican!  Truman's turnin'
                        in his grave--

           A hand is laid on Sam's shoulder: it is Bernie.

                                 BERNIE
                        Care to dance?

                                 SAM
                            (perturbed)
                        Pardon me?

                                 BERNIE
                        I danced to this song once.  When
                        I was young.

           Sam glances at the drunken man, who now observes him with
           prying eyes.

                                 SAM
                            (quietly)
                        Bernie, I--

                                 BERNIE
                        --it's just a dance, Samuel.  If
                        you don't want to, I'm sure this
                        man will accept my invitation--

           The drunkard smiles and pats his hair.  

                                 SAM
                        --no, no, it's alright.
                            (pause)
                        I'll dance with you.

           DANCE FLOOR

           They embrace.  Bernie folds her arms around Sam's neck:
           his hands placed low at her hips.

           Faces in the crowd watch them with concern and deprecation. 
           Sam notices:

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        They're watchin' us.

                                 BERNIE
                        I know.  

           The music sweeps across the room like a hypnotic spell. 
           Other couples, teens and children included, dance as well.

           As the song nears its end, Bernie rests her forehead
           against Sam's chest: her hands fall to his shoulders.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                            (softly)
                        Thank you, Samuel. 

           She then turns, rather hastily, and leaves.  We hold on
           Sam, alone and wistful, surrounded by dancers.

           The band plays on.  

           EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT

           A window.  Through the tawdry curtains we glimpse two
           naked bodies: accompanied by a heavy grunting sound.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood fucks a prostitute.  The girl has stringy blonde
           hair and wears tattered high-heels.  She is on all fours.

           Elwood is shirtless: his pants lowered to his thighs.  He
           thrusts with vigor and sustain.

           CLOSE ON ELWOOD'S CHEST

           Reveals a striking tattoo of an open-winged bird: its
           frame and feathers inked black.  

           Elwood grits his teeth as his speed increases.  Beads of
           sweat trickle into his eyes.  

           The girl, showing no emotion, throws a hand against the
           headboard to steady herself.  She then checks her watch. 

           LATER

           The girl stands by the open door.  She adjusts her skirt
           as Elwood counts money from his wallet.  No eye contact. 

           LATER

           A towel is spread across the mattress.  Elwood dismantles
           his revolver, then carefully cleans each component. 

           MIRROR

           Elwood studies his reflection: pistol in hand.  We hold
           as he skillfully spins the firearm back and forth.

           LATER

           Elwood exercises.  He grips a chair with each hand: his
           feet propped up on the bed.  Pushes himself up and down.  

           LATER

           CLOSE ON ELWOOD'S FACE

           Bathed in blue light as he flicks through various t.v.
           channels.  Disgruntled, he switches off the television.

           EXT. MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Elwood leaves his motel room.  As he walks along the porch
           he spots a vehicle pulling into the parking lot.  

           ANGLE ON SAM

           Stepping out from his car.  We hold as he locks the door.

                                 ELWOOD (O.S.)
                        You sure look smart.

           Sam turns to see Elwood standing outside the brightly-lit
           office.  The young man observes his spruce outfit. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Been on a date?

                                 SAM
                            (smiling)
                        Retirement party.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, I hope it weren't your own.

           Sam chuckles.  

                                 SAM
                        What are you up to at this hour? 
                        Causing mischief?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Not at all, Sam.  Was gonna head
                        on over to that roadside cafe...

           Elwood nods his head:

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...up the highway.  Say, you fancy
                        joinin' me?    

                                 SAM
                        Uh, well, I don't know--

           Sam squints at his watch in the darkness. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        --c'mon.  Two boys from Tennessee. 
                        How about it?

                                 SAM
                        My shift starts at midnight.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        I'll have you back before both
                        hands reach twelve. 

           Sam considers the young man's request: glances at his
           watch again.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Coffee and pie.  My treat.   

           INT. ROADSIDE CAFE -- NIGHT

           A quiet cafe with outmoded furnishings.  Truck-drivers
           stoop over the counter.  The radio plays a country tune.  

           We track behind a wandering waitress until she arrives at
           a table where Sam and Elwood are seated.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Fill ya up some?

           She holds out a pot of coffee in one hand. 

                                 SAM
                        Sure.

           Elwood pays no attention: he is devouring a chocolate
           sundae.  Used plates clutter his side of the table.  

           Sam smokes and watches.  

                                 ELWOOD
                            (mouthful)
                        You sure you don't want nothin'
                        to eat?

           Sam shakes his head: raises a hand. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Suit yourself. 

                                 SAM
                        You'll be bouncin' off the walls
                        with all that sugar.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Sugar don't bother me.

           He wipes his mouth with a napkin:

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I got real steady hands.  Like a
                        surgeon, y'know?  

           He then slurps from his soda.  

                                 SAM
                        You mind if I ask you a question,

                                 ELWOOD
                        I don't see why not. 

                                 SAM
                        What brings you up here...across
                        the border?  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well...

           Elwood mulls over his answer. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...mostly I, uh, came here to
                        hunt.

           Sam frowns. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Pheasants, quails.  Geese, even. 
                        There's a big shootin' preserve
                        just north of here.  2,000 acres
                        they got.  Came highly recommended.  

                                 SAM
                        I know the place.  Used to be a
                        ranch some years back-- 

                                 ELWOOD
                        --that's the one.  But, the problem
                        with those private properties are
                        the lodgings.  Too damn expensive.  

           Sam nods: cigarette in mouth.  Smoke billows in the air. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You mind if I ask you a question,
                        Sam?

                                 SAM
                            (smiling)
                        Shoot.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        You miss ridin'?  Be honest now. 

           Beat. 

                                 SAM
                        No.

                                 ELWOOD
                        I suppose an accident like that
                        is bound to put off a rider. 
                        King of the rodeo had to fall
                        sometime, right?

                                 SAM
                        It got me outta the draft.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I got no complaints. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        So now you're in the motel
                        business.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.  Buddy a'mine used to run
                        the place.  He kinda passed it on
                        to me. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        How's that?

                                 SAM
                        Well, he died.  And he had no
                        siblings.  No kids.  

           Elwood leans across the table: eager to voice his own
           anecdote. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        When my mother passed she left me
                        nothin'.  Nothin'.  Her only son. 
                        Believe that?  She had it tough,
                        though.  Full-blown tuberculosis. 
                        Spread like wildfire.  She was
                        just a skeleton by the end.  

                                 SAM
                        I'm sorry to hear--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --my father weren't around to
                        take care of her, see.  He was
                        servin' time in a penitentiary. 
                        Out in El Reno, Oklahoma.  Shot a
                        federal judge over a previous
                        conviction.  Grand theft auto, I
                        think that was.  

           Sam sits silent: uncertain what to say. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Sonofabitch got his comeuppance
                        though.  He was stabbed in a prison
                        riot.  Christmas Eve, 1976.  They
                        say he was dead before he even
                        hit the ground.

           Elwood gulps the last of his soda.  Sam studies the young
           man, curiously. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        What goes around comes around,
                        huh?

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie drives.  Lila sits in the passenger seat.  

           Silence.

                                 BERNIE
                        I appreciate you keeping me
                        company, darlin'.

           She reaches across and pats Lila's knee.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Didn't know if you'd be up.

                                 LILA
                        It's alright.  I haven't been
                        sleepin' much lately.

                                 BERNIE
                        Me neither.  I get nightmares
                        every time I close my eyes. 

                                 LILA
                        Perhaps it's the heat.  

                                 BERNIE
                        Perhaps.

                                 LILA
                        Mother says I used to get bad
                        dreams as a girl.  Every summer,
                        without fail.  She had to read me
                        stories about Eskimos and igloos. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Did it work?

                                 LILA
                        I guess.

           She gazes solemnly out the window. 

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        All I ever seem to dream about
                        now is snow.  

           EXT. ROADSIDE CAFE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Bernie's car pulls up outside.  The engine is left running.

           INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila climbs out of the vehicle, then peers in through her
           open door.

                                 LILA
                        What flavor?

           Bernie scours through her handbag.  
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 BERNIE
                        Vanilla.  No, chocolate.  What do
                        you feel like?

           Lila shrugs.  Bernie holds out some crumpled bills.

                                 LILA
                        Put that away.  I brought a little
                        money.

                                 BERNIE
                        You sure?  I feel bad draggin'
                        you outta bed-- 

                                 LILA
                        --it's fine.  Honestly.  I was
                        supposed to go with you to Buck's
                        tonight, remember?

           Bernie peers into her handbag, again. 

                                 BERNIE
                        How about we split it?  Fifty fif--

           Lila slams her door shut.  Bernie, startled, watches the
           woman scuttle into the building.

           INT. ROADSIDE CAFE -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila enters and approaches the counter.

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD

           Roaring with laughter.  Sam chortles. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        He had his pants on back to
                        front...the whole damn time. 

           We see Lila pass in the background. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Creases me up, man.  Every time I
                        tell it. 

           Elwood's guffawing subsides.  A lengthy beat.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        So, you got a woman?

                                 SAM
                        What?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Must be lonely in that motel. 
                        You don't do taxidermy do ya?

           Sam smirks:

                                 SAM
                        No.  Afraid not.
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 ELWOOD
                        So, c'mon then.  There's gotta be
                        a woman.  

                                 SAM
                        Well...

           He lowers his voice:

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        ...there...there is somebody. 
                        But I don't talk about it much.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Somebody special then I bet?

           Beat.  

                                 SAM
                        Yeah.

           He seems surprised by his answer.  

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Yeah.  I'd say so.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, you make sure you hold on
                        to her...

           Sam turns his head as something catches his eye.  It is
           Lila: leaving the cashier.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...my parent's marriage was built
                        on damn mind games--

                                 SAM
                            (calling out)
                        --Lila!  Hey Lila!

           Elwood suddenly freezes.

           ANGLE ON LILA

           Glancing around the room.  She then spots Sam sitting
           with another man whose back is turned to her.  

           We track behind Lila as she walks over to their table.

                                 LILA
                        Hiya Sam.

           Sam rises and removes his hat. 

                                 SAM
                        How are ya?

                                 LILA
                        Okay, I guess.  Surviving-- 

           The other man now stands as well.  Lila sees his face. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                            (shocked)
                        --oh.

                                 SAM
                        Lila, this is Elwood.  A guest at
                        the motel.  Hails from Tennessee,
                        like myself.

           Lila lowers her head, timorously.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Pleasure to meet you.

                                 SAM
                        It's a surprise seein' you down
                        here.  What brings you out so
                        late?

           Lila raises a hand which holds a plastic bag:

                                 LILA
                        Ice-cream.  We're watching a movie
                        tonight.  Over at Bern--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --which one?

                                 LILA
                        What?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Which movie? 

                                 LILA
                        I'm not sure.  It's an oldie. 
                        With Rock Hudson.

           Elwood frowns: 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Ain't he queer?

           Beat.

                                 SAM
                        Still, I hope you enjoy it anyways. 
                        Ice-cream, too.  

                                 LILA
                        Thanks.  I best be on my way. 
                        Bernie's waitin' in the car and I 
                        don't want this to melt.

                                 SAM
                            (intrigued)
                        Bernie?

                                 LILA
                        Nice to see you, Sam.  

           She turns: desperate to leave.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Bye, now. 

           Elwood settles back into his chair.  Sam continues to
           stand as he watches the girl scurry away. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        She could be a looker that one,
                        huh?  A little make-up. Nice dress.

           Sam is unresponsive: lost in thought.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You alright there?  

           Beat.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Sam?

                                 SAM
                        Sorry.  I, uh, need to use the
                        restroom.

           He tosses his hat onto the table as he leaves. 

           INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila clambers back into the vehicle and shuts the door.

                                 BERNIE
                        So, what'd you go for?

           No answer.  Then... 

                                 LILA
                            (distracted)
                        ...what?  Oh, right.  I--I got
                        both.  Both kinds. 

           Bernie starts the engine. 

                                 BERNIE
                        You okay?  You're as pale as a
                        ghost.

           Lila nods, then smiles unconvincingly.

                                 LILA
                        Just hungry is all. 

           INT. ROADSIDE CAFE -- MOMENTS LATER

           We slowly track in on Elwood sitting alone.  His meandering
           eyes come to rest on an object on the table: Sam's hat.

           Elwood tries on the headpiece.  He raises a table knife
           to catch sight of his reflection.  Dissatisfied, he rotates
           his chair...

           ...to face the closest window pane.  We hold on Elwood as
           he studies his mirror image: shifting his head into various
           poses.  

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           CLOSE ON TELEVISION

           Shows a romantic encounter between Jane Wyman and Rock
           Hudson from the film 'All That Heaven Allows' (1955).

           Bernie sits in bed with a spoon in one hand and an ice-
           cream tub in the other.

                                 BERNIE
                        Did you know the title of this
                        comes from a poem by John Wilmot?   

           The door to the bathroom is slightly ajar.  It is evident
           that someone is fidgeting around inside.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        He was one of the world's most
                        famous libertines, y'know?  Hell,
                        he died of syphilis.

           Tom Burkell steps out from the bathroom with a toothbrush
           in his mouth.  He is dressed in striped-pyjamas.

                                 TOM
                            (brushing teeth)
                        Syphilis?  When was this...the
                        60's?

                                 BERNIE
                        No.  Seventeenth century, hon.  

           Tom shrugs his shoulders and steps back into the bathroom. 
           Bernie sighs.  We can hear the faucet start to run. 

           Something then draws Bernie's attention to the window. 
           There seems to be a glimmer of movement just outside.  

           Bernie stares.  A long, tense beat. 

           Suddenly, a bird smacks straight into the glass.  It is a
           raven: squawking and flapping its wings.  Bernie jumps.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Jesus!  A goddamn raven just flew
                        into our window, Tom!  Tom?

           She turns to face the bathroom, only to discover that the
           light is off inside.  The door is slightly ajar.  

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Tom?

           We hear a strange whining noise.  The only source of light
           now comes from the television.  Bernie steps out of bed
           to investigate.  The moaning builds, steadily.
           © Paul China, 2011

           Bernie inches closer to the bathroom door, then nudges it
           open.  Tom is standing against the back wall: masked in
           shadow.  His body shakes in the darkness.  

           We cannot tell whether he's crying or cackling.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Tom?

           He falls silent.  Beat. 

                                 TOM
                        How long you been fucking him?

                                 BERNIE
                        What?

           Bernie fumbles for the light-switch.  We then see Tom's
           bullet-ridden corpse: eyes bulging in their sockets and
           blood gushing from the mouth.  The sight is horrifying.

           Bernie goes to scream --

           -- then wakes up in a sweat, gasping for air.  

           The amorous scene with Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson still
           plays on television.  The window curtains are drawn shut
           and the bathroom door is closed.

           Bernie turns to see Lila sitting next to her in bed: a
           spoon in one hand and an ice-cream tub in the other.

           Beat. 

                                 LILA
                        You want to hear about the Eskimos,
                        huh?

           INT. MUSTANG (MOVING) -- DAY

           Elwood drives.  He gnaws on some chewing gum.  The radio
           blares 'Do You Remember Rock N Roll Radio?' by the Ramones.

           A flyer has been fastened under one of the windshield
           wipers: it features a photograph of a lost border collie.

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           We turn off a busy street and pull into the parking lot
           of a squalid saloon.

           EXT. MUSTANG -- MOMENTS LATER 

           Elwood shuts his car-door.  He rips the flyer out from
           under the wiper, crunches it into a ball, then slings it
           to the ground. 

           We track behind Elwood as he makes his way into the dimly-
           lit bar.  He shapes a phone with his hand, and a bartender
           points to an open door at the end of the room.

           Elwood then steps through the doorway and out into a back
           parking lot.  He spots a single payphone located near the
           sidewalk.

           We hear vociferous laughter.  Three men, drinking liquor,
           lean against a pick-up truck.  They speak in hushed tones
           as Elwood passes.  Then:

                                 MAN 1
                            (shouting)
                        Timber nigger!

           Elwood stops in his tracks.  He turns around, slowly.  

           Beat.

                                 ELWOOD
                        I look Indian to you?  

           The drunks continue to laugh.  Elwood walks on. 

           PAYPHONE

           Elwood removes a napkin from his shirt-pocket.  He peers
           over at the men as he dials a number. 

           INT. MCBAIN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           A telephone lurches as it rings.

           EXT. PAYPHONE -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood listens, waits.

           INT. MCBAIN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           A tabby cat sits beside the telephone.  The ringing
           persists.  The animal then turns to look at its owner.  

           Lila McBain stands silently by the kitchen counter: a bag
           of groceries held in each arm.

           The answer machine clicks in:

                                 MITCHELL'S VOICE
                        Hello, you've reached the McBain
                        residence.  Please leave your
                        name and, uh, number after the
                        beep, and we'll get back to you
                        when we can.  

           EXT. PAYPHONE -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood hears the beep.  

           INT. MCBAIN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila stares at the telephone, flustered.  Silence.

                                 ELWOOD'S VOICE
                        ...cunt.
           © Paul China, 2011

           EXT. PAYPHONE -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood hangs up.

           INT. MCBAIN KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           Further silence.  Lila rests the groceries on the counter. 
           She starts to shelve the items, but notices the tabby cat
           gaping at her.  Lila returns the gaze.

           EXT. PAYPHONE -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood is still.  He then pulls out a knuckle-duster from
           one of his back pockets.  

           Elwood slides the steel onto his right fist as he marches
           over to the pick-up truck.

           THE MEN

           Observe Elwood as he approaches.  The heckler steps forward
           with arms outstretched: 

                                 MAN 1
                        Blanket ass looking for fun? 
                        Injuns and their squaws can fuck---

           The man is struck across the nose.  His legs buckle, but
           Elwood holds him by the shirt and continues to brutally
           pummel his face.  He spits teeth.

           The second man grabs Elwood from behind and locks his
           arms tight across his neck.  He pulls Elwood off the first
           man whose body has now fallen limp.  

           Elwood lashes out with his legs to keep the third man at
           bay.  He then throws his body backwards and crushes the
           second man into the truck.  They both tumble to the ground.  

           Elwood gasps for air.  He uses a car to hoist himself up. 
           The second man is still on his back.  Elwood raises his
           boot and begins to stomp him, repeatedly.  

           The third man fetches a baseball bat from the cab of the
           truck.  He swings at Elwood, but cracks a car window
           instead.  Glass shatters everywhere.  

           The two fighters then pant in the heat as they circle
           each other.  A tense beat. 

           The man then swings again and misses.  Elwood springs
           forward and slugs him twice.  The man drops his bat and
           crashes to the floor.  As he scrambles to his feet...

           ...Elwood plucks up the bat and cracks him hard across
           the head.  The man slumps to the ground.  There is no
           movement from his body.  

           Elwood paces and then rests against a car bonnet.  The
           sun beats at his face.  He spits.  Blood stains the bat.

           We hear the distant noise of a tumultuous crowd.

           INT. RODEO ARENA -- EVENING

           BLACK AND WHITE

           A continuation of Sam's flashback.  

           In a single slow-motion shot we see the bull kick both
           its hind legs into the air.  The cowboy loses his balance. 
           Numerous cameras flash.  The crowd is wild, hysteric. 

           Two rodeo clowns charge towards the animal.  The cowboy
           is tossed up into the night sky like a rag-doll.  His
           limbs flail as he plummets head first toward the ground. 

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Sam... 

           The audience continues to scream.  Pure pandemonium.

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- DAY

           CLOSE ON AN EYE

           Suddenly opening.  The pupil's diameter constricts.

           Sam is sprawled across the mattress: fully dressed.  Rose
           stands above him with a concerned look on her face. 

                                 ROSE
                        ...Sam?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah?

                                 ROSE
                        Bernadette's here.

                                 SAM
                        Oh.  Okay.

           Sam sits up, disoriented.   

                                 ROSE
                        You alright?

                                 SAM
                        Sure.  Yeah.

           Rose takes in her surroundings.  She spots the framed
           photograph on the nightstand.

                                 ROSE
                        Well, take your time.  I'll tell
                        her you're in the shower.  Getting
                        cleaned up.

           She goes to leave.  

                                 SAM
                        That a hint?

           Rose shrugs.  Sam lifts an arm and smells his armpit.

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Sam enters: buttoning up a fresh shirt.  Bernie is admiring
           the rodeo pictures on the wall.  Rose knits on the sofa.

                                 SAM
                        'Lo Bernie.

                                 BERNIE
                        Sorry to drop in unannounced.  I 
                        thought I'd wait.  Rose said you
                        were showering.

           Sam and Rose exchange glances.

                                 SAM
                        Gets muggy in the afternoons. 

                                 BERNIE
                        It does.  Supposed to rain tonight
                        though.  So the t.v. says.  

           Sam nods.  Beat.

                                 SAM
                        So, uh, what brings you out here? 
                        Just passin' through are you--

                                 BERNIE
                        --well, actually, I was hoping
                        you might like to join me for
                        dinner.  Tomorrow night that is.

           Sam stares.  Rose listens in on their conversation. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        It's a new recipe I'm tryin' out. 
                        For a beef and barley stew.  Need
                        a test-dummy for the first batch.  

                                 SAM
                        Well, uh-- 

                                 BERNIE
                        --you don't have to, I mean, I
                        was only askin'--

                                 SAM
                        --no, sure.  That sounds great. 
                        It's just...I have plans.

           Bernie is clearly devastated.  Rose continues to observe
           the couple. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Oh.  Alright.  Well--

                                 SAM
                        --it's Maggie.  She got into the
                        O'Mathy state finals.  The singing
                        contest.  It's held up in Lynchburg
                        and I promised to take her.

                                 BERNIE
                        Oh, right.  State finals, huh?    

                                 SAM
                        But, y'know, I--I can swing by
                        later.  After the show.  Save me
                        some of that stew.

           Bernie smiles.  

                                 BERNIE
                        I'd like that.  

           An awkward silence.  Rose knits.

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I'll see you then, Samuel.

                                 SAM
                        Goodbye. 

           He watches Bernie as she disappears outside.  Beat.  Rose
           continues to thread her knitting needles.

                                 ROSE
                        That Old Spice I smell?

                                 SAM
                            (sheepishly)
                        It is.  

           Rose tries to conceal a growing grin.  

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           A car cruises through a suburban neighborhood.

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila sits at the wheel.  She listens to an evangelist's
           sermon on the radio: the voice dull and monotonous.  

           Lila takes a right turn.  We notice that the car behind
           her does as well.  The preacher drones on.  

           Lila then makes a left turn.  Again, the car behind her
           does as well.  Lila notices.  She studies the headlights...  

           ...through the rear view mirror.  Nervous, she makes
           another left turn.  The car behind disappears.  Beat. 

           Lila relaxes.  Then, suddenly, the headlights reappear:
           piercing brightly through the darkness.

           Lila, watching her mirrors with bated breath, takes a
           right turn.  The vehicle follows:  

                                 LILA
                            (terrified)
                        ...no.

           Lila accelerates, but the headlights gain closer until
           the car rides dangerously close to her bumper.  

           A tense beat. 

           Then, without indicating, Lila throws a sharp left.  The
           headlights behind miss the corner and shoot past.  

           Lila stops her vehicle.  Shaking, she twists around in
           her seat.  The car has vanished.

           EXT. MCBAIN HOUSE -- NIGHT

           ESTABLISHING SHOT

           A single storey property.  Lila's car sits in the driveway.

           INT. MCBAIN BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Lila folds an array of clothes into two large suitcases. 
           She talks on the telephone as she packs:

                                 LILA
                        Uh-huh.  Just for a little while. 
                        I'm rattlin' around in this house
                        with nobody to talk to.
                            (sighing)
                        Tell him to be quiet.  Does he
                        want me to bring Mitchell's cat?

           Lila fastens one case: the phone held between her ear and
           shoulder. 

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        Okay, then.  Well, y'know I love
                        you more, mother.
                            (laughing)
                        Yes...

           EXT. MCBAIN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON FRONT DOOR

           Opening.  The tabby cat darts inside.  

           Lila drags a suitcase out to her car.  We hear distant
           thunder.  She studies the night sky, briefly, then... 

           ...loads and shuts the boot.  Beat.  

           Lila notices a car parked across the street.  She then
           spots another vehicle sat under a line of trees.

           She stares, perplexed.  The dark bushes in her yard quiver
           in the wind.  Shadows sway.  Another roll of thunder.

           Lila hurries back towards the house.

           INT. MCBAIN HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 

           Lila lifts the second suitcase.  Suddenly, we hear the
           front door bang shut.  Lila turns to see...
           © Paul China, 2011

           ...Elwood charging towards her.  She quickly drops the
           luggage and tries to run.

           Elwood catches her hair and throws her into a nearby table. 
           Ornaments crash to the ground.  Chairs topple over. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        ...fuck you goin', huh? 

           Elwood grabs Lila's feet and begins to drag her down the
           hallway.  The cat follows, curious.

                                 LILA
                        No!  Please!  No!

           Lila clutches at each piece of furniture she passes.  Her
           nails scratch the floorboards and walls.  

           Elwood hauls her into the bathroom.  She screams. 

           INT. MCBAIN BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood wrestles Lila into the empty tub.  He draws a
           revolver from his waistband and holds up a single bullet.

                                 ELWOOD
                        See this!  See this!

           Lila struggles, cries.  Elwood loads the bullet and spins
           the chamber.  He points the gun at Lila's head, then cocks
           the hammer. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Where's the money?  Huh?  Where
                        the fuck is it?

           He pulls the trigger.  Click.  Nothing.  Lila shrieks.  
           Elwood cocks the hammer, again.

           The cat, dormant, watches from the doorway.

                                 LILA
                            (weeping)
                        ...I...don't have it...

           He pulls the trigger.  Click.  

           Lila wails.  

           Elwood shoves the barrel into her cheek, then yanks the
           shower curtain across his body for protection.  He turns
           his head away and cocks the hammer.

                                 LILA (CONT'D)
                        I can get it!  I can get it! 

           The revolver is gradually lowered.  Lila keeps repeating
           herself as she bawls and blubbers.  

           Elwood opens his other hand to reveal the bullet.  He
           slings it at Lila.  She flinches and continues to cry.

           INT. MCBAIN KITCHEN -- LATER

           Both sit at the breakfast table drinking coffee.  Elwood
           slurps.  Lila's cup is untouched.

           A lengthy beat.  Then: 

                                 ELWOOD
                        What is this?  Walnut?

                                 LILA
                            (weakly)
                        Almond.

           Elwood nods in approval.  Another beat. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        I got a lot of late payments.  In
                        debt, just like yourself.  
                            (pause)
                        To be honest, this has really
                        held me back.  I feel like I'm
                        owed extra.  A compensation. 

                                 LILA
                        You know I haven't got anything. 
                        A little put by for groceries and
                        gas.  That's all.

                                 ELWOOD
                        Well, maybe we can work out another
                        arrangement.

           Lila stares, frightened.

                                 LILA
                        What?

           Heavy rain begins to fall.  Elwood looks up at the ceiling.

           Bernie sits on the sofa, watching.  She turns to face a
           window.  Rain starts to lash against the glass.

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           The lights dim, momentarily, as we hear a crash of thunder. 
           Sam goes to tamper with the radio, but only finds static.

           A middle-aged woman enters the office.  Sam turns. 

                                 SAM
                        'Lo there.

                                 WOMAN
                        Dirty night.

                                 SAM
                        Yes, though I can't say we don't
                        need the rain.

           The woman gives an acknowledging smile.

                                 WOMAN
                        The name's Hannie.  Hannie Ward. 
                        I'm stayin' in room six.  Checked
                        in this morning. 

                                 SAM
                        Oh sure.  Sure.  Everythin' alright
                        I hope?

           The woman stares.  

                                 HANNIE
                        There seems to be some kind of
                        fight.  

                                 SAM
                        Fight?  

                                 HANNIE
                        Next door.  In number seven.  A
                        woman was...screaming.

           Beat.  Sam broods.

                                 HANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Shall we call the police?  I wasn't
                        sure--

                                 SAM
                        --no.  No, it's alright.

           He extinguishes his cigarette.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I'll take care of it.

           EXT. MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           A DOOR:  NO. 7

           We can hear faint sounds of a man yelling.  Sam's hand
           enters to knock.  The shouting persists.  A woman sobs.

           Sam knocks again.  Silence.  Mr. Barnes, exasperated,
           throws the door open.  Sam removes his hat.  Beat.

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Yeah?

                                 SAM
                        Mr. Barnes.  I'm the manager here
                        at the--

                                 MR.BARNES
                        --yeah, I remember.  What's the
                        problem?

           Sam's eyes survey the unkempt room.  The bed is unmade
           and various belongings are scattered across the floor.  

           The bathroom door is shut: a shadow moves across the light
           that pools underneath. 

                                 SAM
                        You know what the problem is.

           Mr. Barnes leans against the doorjamb.  

                                 MR.BARNES
                        Really?  

                                 SAM
                        Listen, somethin' needs-- 

                                 MR.BARNES
                        --y'know, I saw you walkin' about
                        the other day.  Around this porch. 
                            (pause)
                        Noticed you got a gimp leg on
                        yer. 

           Sam stares.

                                 MR.BARNES (CONT'D)
                        You come knockin' on this door
                        again, I'll put you on your
                        backside for good.  

           The man slams the door.  Beat.  Sam fixes his hat back on
           his head: contemplating his next move.  He knocks again.

           Mr. Barnes throws the door open.  Sam suddenly grabs his
           shirt and hurls him off the porch ledge into the rain.  

           The man quickly scrambles to his feet, but Sam tackles
           him at the waist.  The two men wrestle in the mud until...

           ...Sam pins his opponent to the ground.  Then, he pummels
           the man's face to a bloody pulp.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Stop!  Stop it!

           A woman dressed in a nightgown charges out of the room. 
           She pushes Sam aside and throws herself over Mr. Barnes.

                                 WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Leave him alone!  Leave him alone!

           The man, badly beaten, begins to whine.  The woman cradles
           him in her arms.  Then: 

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Mommy...

           A little girl stands in the doorway, watching.  Sam stares
           in disbelief. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Get inside, Jenny!  Get back
                        inside!  Now dammit!  

           The woman tosses a slipper at her daughter.  The girl
           scurries away from view.

           Sam reaches for his fallen hat: soaked and encased in
           mud.  The rain continues to hammer down. 

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- NIGHT

           We slowly track in on a Mustang parked at the back of the
           lot.  Its windshield wipers beat frantically in the rain. 

           INT. MUSTANG -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood stares at the dark building through his windshield. 
           The radio plays, low.

                                 SPORTS BROADCASTER 1 (V.O.)
                        The Indianapolis 500 is as big as
                        they come. 

                                 SPORTS BROADCASTER 2 (V.O.)
                        Don't forget, this is the third
                        win for the Lone Star J.R. 

                                 SPORTS BROADCASTER 1 (V.O.)
                        What is that Rutherford eatin'
                        for breakfast?  Maybe Jim Hall-- 

           Elwood turns off the engine.  He then opens the driver's
           door and steps out of his vehicle. 

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood runs toward the diner.  He steps in a large puddle:
           narrowly missing a young boy's forgotten baseball cap. 

           INT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood, drenched, tears at the police tape that obstructs
           the front door.  He then steps inside the building. 

           The diner is silent, eerie.  Elwood looks down at his
           boots and spots the chalk outline of a corpse.  Beat. 

           Suddenly, we hear a loud squawking sound.  
           © Paul China, 2011

           A large Peregrine Falcon perches on a stool at the far
           end of the counter: half-hidden in shadow. 

           Elwood stares.  Another beat.  He hesitates, then makes
           his way through the crime scene towards the wild bird.  

           As he draws near, the Falcon suddenly screeches and spreads
           its wings out wide.  Startled, Elwood stops in his tracks.  

           We then hear a car engine roar into life.  Elwood turns
           his head at the sound.  

           WINDOW

           Elwood approaches the glass and peers outside into the
           darkness.  The headlights to his Mustang switch on. 

           EXT. FAIRVALE DINER -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood throws open the front door and rushes out into the
           rain-swept lot. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Hey! 

           His car nudges forward as the engine revs up: its wheels
           spinning in the wet gravel. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Stop!

           Suddenly, Elwood freezes.  Through the windshield we see
           three men sitting inside the vehicle.  They appear to be
           his murdered victims. 

           The headlights then flick to high-beam.  Elwood shields
           his eyes, stumbles backwards, and slips.  He crashes to
           the ground with a thud. 

           The car races towards him at full speed, tires squealing. 
           Elwood crawls away, terrified, but the Mustang gains closer
           and closer.

           He raises both arms, screams -- 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

           -- then wakes up in a cold sweat.  Beat.  Strong sunlight
           breaks into the room through the half-opened drapes. 

           Elwood turns his head towards the dresser to see a stuffed
           Peregrine Falcon staring at him.  He returns the gaze. 

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- MORNING

           CLOSE ON WINDOWSILL

           A white cowboy hat, turned upside down on its crown, dries
           in the sun. 

           Sam sits in an armchair, reading a weathered copy of 'The
           Ballad of the Sad Cafe'.  Rose sits on the sofa, knitting.

           A lengthy beat. 

                                 ROSE
                        Rain didn't last. 

                                 SAM
                        Mm. 

           Sam turns a page. 

                                 ROSE
                        Country fair tomorrow.  Seems
                        just like yesterday we had that
                        last one. 

                                 SAM
                            (indifferent)
                        Yeah. 

                                 ROSE
                        You should go.  Take Bernadette.  

           Beat.  He looks up. 

                                 SAM
                        Huh? 

           There is a knock at the office door: Elwood leans against
           the doorjamb.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Sam the man. 

                                 SAM
                            (stands up)
                        Hey.  What you up to? 

                                 ELWOOD
                        There ain't a payphone round here
                        by any chance is there?

           Sam nods his head:

                                 SAM
                        Just outside.  By the pool.  Need
                        change?

                                 ELWOOD
                            (pats his pocket)
                        I got plenty, thanks. 

           He smiles and leaves.  Sam continues to stare at the empty
           doorway.  Beat. 

                                 ROSE
                        Who was that? 

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS 

           Elwood hops down from the porch and treks over to the
           payphone: the ground wet beneath his boots.

           He spots a lonesome figure sunbathing by the pool.  It is
           the obese man: dressed in a speedo. 

           PAYPHONE 

           Elwood, apprehensive, slots some coins into the machine
           and dials a number.  A telephone rings down the line.  

           A long beat. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Hello?

                                 ELWOOD
                            (spirits raised)
                        Ma?  Ma?

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Hello?  Who is this--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --ma, it's me.  It's your boy. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                            (confused)
                        My boy?

           Elwood, nervous, pats his hair. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Your son.  Your son, ma. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        My son?  
                            (pause)
                        Who is this--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --ma, listen.  I'm outta state. 
                        Workin'.  Making big money.  I
                        know I haven't called in awhile--

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        --why are you calling here?  Who
                        is this?

           Elwood lowers his head, saddened. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Ma.  Please, ma.  

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        My son is dead.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Please.  Don't. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        My son died. 

           Elwood breaks down and begins to sob.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        He's dead to me.  You hear?  He
                        died with his father-- 

                                 ELWOOD
                            (protesting)
                        --no.  No, he didn't. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                        Yes.  There was an accident.  At
                        the abattoir.  Who is this? 
                            (calling off)
                        Marie?  Somebody's calling here--

                                 ELWOOD
                        --Please, just--just listen--

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                            (calling off)
                        Marie?  There's a stranger on the
                        telephone... 

           Elwood cries silently.  His body trembles as tears roll
           down his face. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                            (calling off)
                        ...says he's my son.  I buried my
                        son.  

           Elwood lifts the receiver from his ear and rests it against
           his forehead: his sadness now building to anger. 

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Who is this?  Stop calling here--

           Elwood smashes the receiver repeatedly against the phone
           base.  The line goes dead.  

           PORTLY SUNBATHER

           Sits up, alarmed.  He raises his sunglasses to watch the
           young vandal walk back to the motel.  

           Elwood notices: 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Fuck you lookin' at fat man? 

           The rotund guest says nothing.  He lies flat and turns
           his attention to the scorching sun: his skin seeping sweat. 

           EXT. BUTCHER -- DAY

           ESTABLISHING SHOT

           A single-storey building with large windows.  A hand-
           painted sign reads:

           INT. BUTCHER -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON TAKE-A-NUMBER 

           Display board.  The electronic digits switch from thirty-
           five to thirty-six. 

           A mother leaves the store with her child.  The butcher, a
           young man with baby-face features, wipes the counter top. 

                                 BUTCHER
                        Thirty-six. 

           We slowly pull back to reveal a hand clutching a ticket
           stub.  This solitary customer approaches the counter.  

                                 BUTCHER (CONT'D)
                        What'll it be? 

           The butcher lifts his head to see Elwood, staring.  Beat. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Uh, gimme some of that Italian
                        sausage.   

                                 BUTCHER
                        Genoa salami.  Sliced? 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Yeah. 

           The butcher reaches for the sausage and begins to cut the
           meat into thin slices.  Elwood notices that the young man
           is missing half of his right index finger.   

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Your name Lee?  Lee Fowl?

                                 BUTCHER
                            (still cutting)
                        Who wants to know?

                                 ELWOOD
                        I'm an acquaintance of a friend
                        of yours.  

                                 BUTCHER
                            (still cutting)
                        Friend?

                                 ELWOOD
                        Miles. 

           The butcher stops his actions and looks up. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Said you were dependable. 

           EXT. BUTCHER -- LATER

           The back of the store.  Elwood sits on an empty crate,
           eating his salami.  Lee Fowl lights a cigarette.

           Silence.  Then: 

                                 LEE FOWL
                        Fairvale, huh? 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Yeah. 

                                 LEE FOWL
                        Small town.  

           He brushes cigarette ash from his white apron.

                                 LEE FOWL (CONT'D)
                        When's the job?

                                 ELWOOD
                            (mouthful)
                        Tonight.

                                 LEE FOWL
                        Tonight, tonight?  Shit.  That's
                        not going to work, man. 

           Elwood stops chewing. 

                                 LEE FOWL (CONT'D)
                        I got a date with Tanya Sauls. 
                        Reserved a table at a fancy
                        restaurant.  French food.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        Pussy's pussy.  We're talkin'
                        serious green here.  You wanna
                        earn or dont'cha? 

           Lee ponders as he smokes. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You got a gun?

                                 LEE FOWL
                        I ain't shootin' anybody. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        You need protection is all.  If
                        not a pistol then somethin' sharp.  

           Lee takes a drag from his cigarette, then coughs violently. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                            (disapprovingly)
                        Those white sticks are killers. 

                                 LEE FOWL
                            (protesting)
                        My grandfather still smokes. 
                        He's eighty-three.  Healthy as a
                        horse. 

           Elwood stares.

                        Well, he wears a diaper.  Soils
                        himself all the time. 

           EXT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT

           We hear the faint sound of applause.  A large sign on an
           easel reads: 

           O'MATHY SINGING FINALS

           LYNCHBURG AUDITORIUM 

           INT. AUDITORIUM -- CONTINUOUS

           A teenage girl leaves the stage as Maggie Russell, dressed
           in a frock, shuffles toward the single microphone stand. 

           The house band plays 'Return of the Grievous Angel' by
           Gram Parsons.  Maggie, clearly nervous, begins to sing. 

           We track up the rows of students and parents, many of
           whom fan themselves with programs, and rest on Sam. 

           Maggie sings heartily.  Another track across the attentive
           audience reveals Bobby Driscol: he watches, doe-eyed. 

           EXT. AUDITORIUM -- LATER

           Sam spills out with the rest of the crowd into the summer
           night.  He spots Maggie standing with a group of girls in
           the parking lot.  She steps toward him as he approaches. 

                                 SAM
                        That was somethin', alright. 

                                 MAGGIE
                            (smiling)
                        You liked it?

                                 SAM
                        You kiddin'?  You'll be singing
                        at the Grand Ole Opry in no time. 

           Maggie lets out a light chuckle. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You should have won, Maggie. 
                        Those judges don't know--

                                 MAGGIE
                            (shrugging)
                        --it's okay.  I was happy just to
                        be up there. 

                                 SAM
                        Well, your father missed one hell
                        of a show. 
                            (pause)
                        You need a ride home?

           Maggie motions the group behind her:

                                 MAGGIE
                        I'll go with the girls.  We're
                        gonna stop and get ice-cream.  

           Sam nods. 

                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                        I appreciate you taking me. Showing
                        your support.  

           Maggie smiles.  She goes to leave... 

                                 SAM
                            (hesitant)
                        I had a daughter once. 

           ...then stops. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Some years back. 

                                 MAGGIE
                            (sympathetic)
                        I know, Sam. 

                                 SAM
                        She was an angel...just like you. 

           Maggie then steps forward and kisses Sam softly on the
           cheek.  We hold as he watches the girl rejoin her friends. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           We turn off a quiet tree-lined street and pull into the
           driveway of the Burkell residence.  

           EXT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           The car's engine switches off.  Sam stares up at the house
           from behind the steering wheel.  Beat.  He then opens the
           driver's door. 

           EXT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam approaches the front door and knocks.  He quickly
           removes his hat as Bernie opens the door. 

           The lovers stare at each other with faint smiles.  Then,
           Sam turns his head to study the neighboring houses.  

                                 BERNIE
                            (eyes on Sam)
                        Nobody saw you, Samuel.

           INT. BURKELL DINING ROOM -- LATER

           CLOSE SHOTS ON...

           Dirty plates and cutlery.  An empty wine bottle and two
           used glasses.  The leftovers of a beef and barley stew.

           INT. BURKELL STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON SAM'S HAT

           Hanging at the bottom of the banister.  A slow pan reveals
           Bernie's clothes strewn across the stairs. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie wakes in bed.  She turns to find Sam sitting at
           the end of the mattress, dressing.  Beat. 

                                 BERNIE
                        What time is it?

           Sam turns: surprised to hear her. 

                                 SAM
                        Late.  

           He struggles to pull on his boots.  Bernie watches.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I didn't mean to wake you. 

                                 BERNIE
                        You don't have to leave y'know? 

           No answer. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Aren't you gettin' tired of all
                        this sneakin' around in the night? 

           Sam stands and puts on his shirt.  He forces a smile. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I know I am. 
                            (pause)
                        Why don't you stay till morning? 
                        We can have breakfast in bed. 

                                 SAM
                        I can't.

                                 BERNIE
                        Can't or won't? 

                                 SAM
                        Bernie, don't--

                                 BERNIE
                        --don't what?  Huh?  Speak the
                        truth?  One of us has to. 

           Sam continues to dress: alarmed at where the conversation
           could be heading. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Look at me.  Samuel, look at me. 

           He doesn't. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                            (saddened)
                        Why won't you fight for this? 
                        Don't I...mean anythin' to you?

           Sam stops fastening his shirt buttons.  He looks up into
           Bernie's somber eyes.  Beat. 

                                 SAM
                            (heartfelt)
                        Of course you mean--

                                 BERNIE
                            (pleading)
                        --your family's dead. 

           Sam stares: clearly taken back by this sudden statement. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...they're dead, sweetheart. 

           A heavy silence.  Sam lowers his head, turns and leaves
           the room. 

           INT. BURKELL STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam hurries down the stairs.  Bernie soon follows: pulling
           a dressing robe tight around her naked figure. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Samuel...

           Sam reaches the front door, but Bernie pushes herself in
           front of him.  

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...Samuel? 

           No response.  Dispirited, he cannot bring himself to look
           at her.  A lengthy beat.  

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        They've been gone nearly thirty
                        years.  Tom's been dead six days. 

           She lifts a hand and gently strokes his face. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Let them go, Samuel...

           He stares mournfully at the ground.  Breathes heavy. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...let them go. 

           Sam, contemplating his next move, opens the front door
           and leaves.  Bernie now stands alone, devastated.

           INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam climbs into his vehicle.  He looks up at the dark
           house and broods.  We hold for a beat.

           INT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie still stands by the closed front door. 

           INT. CAR -- CONTINUOUS

           Another beat.  Sam then turns the keys in the ignition. 

           INT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie hears the engine of the car.  She presses the palm
           of a hand wistfully against the door.  Lowers her head. 

           EXT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam's car reverses out of the driveway and then disappears
           up the street. 

           INT. BURKELL HALLWAY -- LATER

           We track, slowly, towards the kitchen doorway.  Bernie
           stands at the sink cleaning dishes.  Beat. 

           INT. BURKELL KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS

           PROFILE SHOT

           On Bernie as she carries out her domestic chore.  She
           appears sad, despondent.  Her mind elsewhere.  Then...

           ...we hear a short, scraping sound outside.  Bernie looks
           up though the window behind the sink.  Listens again. 

           FIXED SHOT

           On the window pane.  Bernie can only see her reflection
           in the brightly lit room.  She studies her mirror image. 

           Silence.  The sound does not return. 

           Bernie dries her hands and unplugs the sink.  We observe
           her counterpart through the glass as she leaves...

           ...the kitchen and turns off the light.  Darkness. 

           Suddenly: outside we see a figure staring in.  He wears a
           clear-plastic, bird-like mask.  The sight is horrifying. 

           EXT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           We pull away from this stationary figure as he gazes into
           the window.  He tilts his head, slightly, to one side. 

           An eerie image. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           A black, endless highway.  No other vehicles in sight.

           Sam drives.  The car radio plays 'I'll Come Running Back
           to You' by Sam Cooke.  We hold for a beat. 

           INT. BURKELL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie enters the en suite.  She sits on the edge of the
           tub and runs herself a bath. 

           CLOSE ON TAPS

           Ejecting water.  We hear the clangor of worn-out pipes. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam continues to drive.  Perturbed, he reaches across and
           turns off the radio.   

           INT. BURKELL BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie runs her fingers under the flowing water to test
           the temperature.  She then stands to remove her robe...

           ...but suddenly hears a noisy disturbance from downstairs:
           the breaking of glass, perhaps. 

           Startled, Bernie turns off the bath taps, only to find an
           uneasy silence.  She listens again.  A tense beat. 

           INT. BURKELL LANDING -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie edges out of her bedroom and creeps, slowly, down
           the corridor.  She reaches the top of the stairs. 

           INT. BURKELL STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           We look up at Bernie, deathly still, on the landing.  

           INT. BURKELL LANDING -- CONTINUOUS

           BERNIE POV

           The dark staircase.  Light spills below from the dining
           room into the hallway, creating sinister shadows. 

           BACK ON BERNIE

           Attentive.  Doubting the noise she thought she heard. 

           INT. BURKELL STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie steps cautiously down the stairs.  Her hand runs
           the length of the banister. 

           The wooden boards creek under her bare feet. 

           INT. BURKELL HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie reaches the ground floor.  Beat.  She peers down
           the long hallway towards the kitchen.  Her eyes alert.

           BERNIE POV

           The room sits in darkness.  No movement from inside.  All
           is still.  Strangely quiet.  Another beat. 

           BACK ON BERNIE

           Still staring into the blackened kitchen.  After a moment
           of hesitation, she ambles forward, but stops when... 

           ...a low, crunching noise emanates from inside the room. 
           The sound of footsteps on glass. 

           BERNIE POV

           Suddenly: the masked figure steps out of the shadows like
           a nightmarish vision.  He stares straight ahead at Bernie. 

           BACK ON BERNIE

           She gasps, then turns and runs into...

           ...a second intruder.  He wears a similar, harrowing mask:
           his face distorted behind the plastic material. 

           CLOSE ON MEAT CLEAVER

           Gripped tightly in his hand. 

           Bernie lets out a short scream, then races towards the
           staircase.  Both assailants follow in quick pursuit. 

           INT. BURKELL STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie scrambles up the stairs as fast as she can manage:
           the intruders dangerously close behind her. 

           INT. BURKELL LANDING -- CONTINUOUS

           The chase continues.  Bernie rushes down the corridor and
           yanks opens a door that leads to a set of narrow stairs. 

           The first invader has paused on the landing: he stares at
           a large-framed painting that hangs in the master bedroom...

           ...the Cardinal Grosbeak. 

           The second invader has stopped as well: as though waiting
           for instructions.  He pants as he clutches his hefty knife. 

           The first intruder points after Bernie, then turns and
           hurries into the bedroom.  His partner follows orders...

           ...and charges after the woman.  He reaches the hidden
           staircase in time to see the door above slam shut. 

           INT. BURKELL STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie double locks the door and steps back into the room. 
           This small, converted loft contains a desk and a bookcase.

           We hear the second intruder stomp, sluggishly, up the
           stairs.  Bernie, frightened, forces open the only window. 

           She peers out. 

           BERNIE POV

           A long, three-storey drop to the dark yard below. 

           BACK ON BERNIE

           Glancing behind her as we hear the door-handle rattle. 

           CLOSE ON HANDLE

           As it shakes, violently. 

           Bernie whimpers.  She grabs a sharp, letter-opener from
           the desk and backs herself into a corner.  Slides down to
           the ground as the door is kicked vigorously from outside.  

           The wooden frame jerks with each increasing impact.  The
           sound is deafening.  We hold on Bernie: terrified. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The room is dark.  We hear a key sliding into the door-
           lock outside.  Sam enters and fumbles for a light switch.  

           He shuffles into the room and tosses his car-keys onto
           the nightstand.  Then: sits on the bed and sighs.  Beat. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam splashes cold, running water onto his face.  He turns
           off the tap and studies his reflection.  Another beat. 

           Sam notices the St. Jude pendant that is now hanging over
           his shirt.  He suddenly rips the thin chain from his neck. 

           CLOSE ON SINK

           As the religious artifact is dropped into the empty basin. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam marches over to the telephone.  He dials a number and
           waits for the connection.  Beat.

           CLOSE ON TELEPHONE

           Lurching as it rings. 

           INT. BURKELL SECOND STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           turns and peers down the narrow stairs as...

           INT. BURKELL STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie, crouched in the corner, hears the sound of the
           telephone in the house: a glimmer of hope in her eyes. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam listens, waits.

           CLOSE ON TELEPHONE

           The ringing persists. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The first intruder, crowbar in hand, stares out into the
           landing.  He waits for the harsh jangling sound to stop.  

           We notice the Cardinal Grosbeak painting on the floor by
           his feet.  The closed door of the safe has been vandalized. 

           INT. LIPINSKI BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam, perplexed, hangs up the telephone.  We hold on him
           for a beat. 

           INT. BURKELL STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie listens to the silence.  Hung in suspense.  She
           stares at the door.  Suddenly: the heavy kicking returns.  

           CLOSE ON HANDLE

           The locks weaken as the door shifts in its frame.

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The first intruder has his crowbar jammed into the steel
           door of the wall-safe.  He struggles to pry it open. 

           INT. BURKELL SECOND STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           The second intruder continues to kick at the study door:
           meat cleaver in hand. 

           INT. BURKELL STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie cowers.  Both locks on the door are now dangerously
           close to breaking. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The first intruder, unable to open the safe, flings his
           crowbar to the floor.  He opens up a small duffel bag... 

           ...and pulls out a grand revolver.

           dial-lock of the safe. 

           INT. BURKELL SECOND STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           The second intruder boots the study door. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The first intruder cocks the hammer of his pistol.  He
           listens to the kicking sound.  Prepares for the shot. 

           INT. BURKELL SECOND STAIRCASE -- CONTINUOUS

           The second intruder boots the study door when--

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           --BANG!  The first intruder fires his revolver. 

           INT. BURKELL STUDY -- CONTINUOUS

           The door flies open.  Crashes against the wall.  Two busted
           locks hang from the frame.  Splintered wood everywhere.   

           Suddenly, and unexpectedly, the second intruder is stabbed
           in the heart.  Bernie grips the handle of the letter-opener
           as dark blood oozes out onto her hand.  A tense beat. 

           The meat cleaver drops to the floor as the assailant begins
           to choke.  Blood splutters from his mouth and stains his
           mask.  Bernie stares in shock.  She lets go of the handle. 

           The intruder falls backwards.  His lifeless body tumbles
           down the steep staircase.  Limbs smacking into the walls. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           The first intruder unloads the contents of the open safe
           into his bag: short stacks of money and jewelry boxes. 

           Behind him, through the doorway, we see the corpse crash
           onto the landing.  The thief quickly turns around, alarmed. 

           HIS POV

           The body is twisted on the floor.  Letter-opener sticking
           out of his chest.  A broken mask reveals Lee Fowl's face. 

           Elwood stares at the corpse.  Then: he returns, hastily,
           to the robbery.  Moves as fast as he can manage. 

           INT. BURKELL LANDING -- CONTINUOUS

           Bernie steps, cautiously, onto the landing.  She stares
           at the young man's broken body: unable to avert her eyes. 

           Beat.  

           She then looks up the corridor.

           HER POV

           We see Elwood in the bedroom: zipping up his small, duffel
           bag.  The wall-safe is now empty. 

           INT. BURKELL BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood stands, then turns to see Bernie watching him.  A
           quick, suspenseful beat passes before... 

           ...Bernie rushes towards the main stairs.  Elwood sprints
           after her: bag in tow.  

           INT. BURKELL HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           The chase reaches the downstairs hallway.  Bernie runs
           for the front door, but Elwood soon grabs hold of her. 
           She struggles to break free from the intruder's grasp. 

           As the grapple escalates, Elwood's shirt is ripped: his
           striking tattoo of an open-winged bird now revealed to
           Bernie.  Suddenly, the scuffle causes both figures to...

           ...crash onto a glass coffee table.  The surface shatters
           from the brutal impact.  Broken glass scatters everywhere. 

           Elwood does not move.  We notice a large shard of glass
           has been embedded into his abdomen.  A lengthy beat. 

           Bernie stirs.  She starts to crawl, slowly, out from the
           wreckage.  Deep cuts cover her face and arms.  She wines
           with agony as she pulls herself forward.  Inch by inch. 

           Behind her, we see Elwood gradually sit up.  One hand is
           held firmly to his stomach wound.  He sees Bernie escaping,
           and reaches into the open duffel bag.  Pulls out his gun.  

           Bernie then turns to his Elwood hoisting himself to his
           feet.  She moans as she drags herself across the floor. 
           Desperate to escape.  Elwood, pistol in hand, staggers...

           ...after her: labored by his injury.  He thrusts his boot
           on Bernie's neck and pushes her face to the ground.  Then:
           sticks the barrel of his revolver to the back of her head. 

                                 BERNIE
                            (pleading)
                        No...please...

           Elwood cocks the hammer to his gun.  Beat. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        ...no...no. 

           Suddenly: something catches Elwood's attention off-screen. 

           HIS POV

           We slowly push in on a white, well-worn hat that hangs at
           the bottom the banister.  The head-piece looks familiar. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           Elwood stares in disbelief: his eyes now glaring through
           the holes of his mask.  We hear Bernie's sobs increase.  

           A suspenseful beat. 

           INT. CAR (MOVING) -- LATER

           THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

           We are pulling up to Bernie's house.  Ambulances and police
           cars now cover the street.  Bright lights flash in the
           dark.  Neighbors observe the scene from their front yards. 

           Sam, driving, slows his vehicle.  

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           The car grinds to a halt.  Sam climbs out and stares at
           the commotion before him: his eyes wide.   

           HIS POV

           We see a body-bag being carried out from the house on a
           stretcher.  Police officers talk quietly with a coroner. 

           Sam suddenly rushes forward...  

                                 SAM
                            (shouting)
                        Bernie!  Bernie!

           ...limping as he runs. 

           ANGLE ON AMBULANCE

           Bernie, draped in a blanket, turns at the sound of her
           name being called.  Two uniformed medics treat her wounds. 

           ANGLE ON SAM

           As he continues to run. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (shouting)
                        Bernie!

           ANGLE ON AMBULANCE

           Bernie rises from the back of the vehicle. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Sam? 

           She walks further out into the street and sees her lover
           hurrying forward.   

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Sam!

           They run into each other's arms.  Sam holds Bernie tightly:
           her face buried into his neck.  An emotional embrace. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 SAM
                        I've gotcha.   

           Both of them fall to their knees. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I'm not goin' anywhere.  You
                        understand? 

           Bernie sobs.  Beat. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I'm not goin' anywhere.  

           We hold. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT

           HIGH SHOT

           On the "Sweet Virginia Motel" sign.  Lit in buzzing neon. 

           PARKING LOT

           We track, low, across the lined vehicles until we rest on
           a battered Mustang.  Beat. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON MASK

           Clear-plastic.  Bird-like.  Face-up on the mattress.  We
           hear a bath running off-screen. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON CLOTHES

           Blood-stained.  Heaped on the floor. 

           CLOSE ON SINK

           Shows torn fabric, used forceps, and a large shard of
           broken glass.  Then: we hear the bath-taps turn off. 

           BATH

           Elwood, pale, lowers himself into the tub.  A dark, red
           gash in his stomach pulses blood.  The water turns pink. 

           Beat.  Elwood grits his teeth, then leans over and vomits
           on the tiled, bathroom floor. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER

           CLOSE ON NIGHTSTAND

           Reveals an open first-aid kit, scissors, sterile pads,
           antiseptic ointments, and an open packet of painkillers. 

           Elwood, dressed only in a towel, sits on the edge of the
           bed.  He is wrapping a bandage tightly around his waist. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           ANGLE ON HIS FACE

           As he falls back onto the mattress.  His weary eyes slowly
           close.  We hold. 

           EXT. SKY -- DAWN

           VARIOUS SHOTS

           On morning twilight.  Sun still below the horizon.  The
           "blue hour". 

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Rose Miller pushes a cleaning cart along the wooden porch
           that runs the length of the motel.  The rusted, worn-out
           wheels squeak. 

           She shuffles past room number fourteen. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON ELWOOD

           Slowly opening his eyes.  We hear the noisy cart outside. 
           He suddenly sits up.  Registers his situation.  Beat. 

           Then: Elwood frantically starts to pack his belongings. 
           He quickly zips up the small, duffel bag loaded with loot. 

           INT. MOTEL OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Rose enters through the office door: the cleaning cart
           rattles.  She then looks up and sees Sam stepping out
           from his bedroom.

                                 ROSE
                            (surprised)
                        Sam.  I thought you were still at
                        the hospital. 

                                 SAM
                        Needed a hot shower.  Clean
                        clothes.  Besides...

           He walks over to the kitchen counter: tucking his loose
           shirt into his jeans.  

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        ...I can't have my favorite
                        employee workin' a double now,
                        can I?

                                 ROSE
                            (protesting)
                        Sam, I don't mind--

                                 SAM
                        --go on.  Get yerself home. 

           He starts to pour himself a mug of hot coffee.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Eat breakfast with your husband. 

           Rose offers a smile and fetches her handbag from the
           parlor.  Then: she stops and turns to face Sam. 

                                 ROSE
                        How she doing?

                                 SAM
                        Better.  

           Sam smiles, faintly.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Doctors are gonna let her home
                        this afternoon.  

           He sips his coffee.  Beat. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        It's mostly the shock, y'know. 
                        Psychological trauma. 

                                 ROSE
                            (sympathetic)
                        That poor woman.  So much troubles. 

                                 SAM
                        She's a fighter, though.  Tougher
                        than most. 

                                 ROSE
                        Did she...identify those men? 

                                 SAM
                            (shakes head)
                        The one that fled, he was cut up
                        pretty bad.  Bernie said she seen
                        a tattoo on his chest--

                                 ROSE
                        --tattoo?

                                 SAM
                        Some sort of bird of prey. 

           He loads a cigarette into his mouth...

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        A hawk or somethin'. 

           ...then lights it with his zippo. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        As for the other one, the deceased. 
                        He was just a kid. 

           Sam sighs, exhales smoke. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Twenty-one years old. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           Rose stares with equal measures of sadness and horror.  A
           quick beat. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Police found a cartridge shell. 
                        By the safe?  Same bullet type
                        from the diner. 

           Rose mulls this information over. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I don't understand it, Rose.  I
                        just don't. 

                                 ROSE
                        How can you?  It's a new world
                        out there.  Nothing but greed.  

           She pulls the straps of her handbag over one shoulder. 

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Violence. 

           Beat. 

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Give my love to her, won't you?

           Sam nods, smiles.  Rose makes her way towards the open
           door of the office. 

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                            (optimistic)
                        The sun's on it's way, Sam. 
                        Today's gonna be a good one.  

           She turns around, briefly: 

                                 ROSE (CONT'D)
                        You'll see. 

           We hold on Sam as he watches the woman leave. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood, wearing a white A-shirt, sits on the edge of the
           bed.  Frantic, he struggles to pull on both his boots. 

           CLOSE ON DRESSER

           Reveals the long barreled revolver.  A scribbled telephone
           number on a napkin sits nearby. 

           ELWOOD

           Stands and seizes the gun.  He tucks the weapon into the
           back of his jeans, conceals it with his shirt, then marches
           across the room and pulls open the door.  

           Elwood shuffles back to grab his luggage.  One hand grasps
           the duffel bag; the other a ragged suitcase.  He turns
           around to leave....
           © Paul China, 2011

           ...but freezes, suddenly. 

           SAM

           Now stands in the doorway.  He holds his hat in his hands. 

                                 SAM
                        Hey, kid. 

                                 ELWOOD
                            (surprised)
                        Sam.

           Quick beat. 

                                 SAM
                        I, uh, saw your light was on. 
                        Wondered if you'd be up. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Oh.  Right... 

           Elwood does not move.  His luggage still suspended in the
           air by his knees. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...right.  It is early, huh? 

           Sam nods his head at the young man's baggage. 

                                 SAM
                        You're finally leavin' us then? 
                        Back to Tennessee I suspect?

           Elwood nods, nervously. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        Yes.  Yes, sir...  
                            (feigning a smile)
                        ...back to the Blue Ridge. 

                                 SAM
                            (warm-hearted)
                        Well, it's gonna be awfully quiet
                        around these parts without you.  

           He is somewhat embarrassed by this confession. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Been nice having you here, I must
                        admit. 

           Elwood says nothing.  Only stares.  Sam registers this
           unusual behavior.  An awkward beat passes. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I can take your key now if you'd
                        like to take your bags to the car--

           Sam stops, suddenly.  Something has caught his attention.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (confused)
                        You're bleeding. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        What?

           Elwood glances down at his stomach and sees, much to his
           horror, dark blood seeping through his cotton shirt. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Oh.  Yes.  I--I had an accident. 
                        Yesterday. 

           He is clearly agitated.  Struggles to find the right words.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        A car accident.  Yesterday. 

           Note: we notice the gun masked in the back of his jeans. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I--I'm fine, though.  It's nothing. 

           Then: Sam spots two black wings on the young man's chest:
           sticking out from under his white vest.  

           A partially concealed bird tattoo. 

           Suddenly: Sam's hat slips through his fingers.  It hits
           the floor and topples to one side.  

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Sam?

           No response.  Elwood realizes something is wrong. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Sam?

           A haunting realization washes over Sam.  He slowly looks
           up into Elwood's eyes.  A suspenseful beat.  Then...

           ...Elwood drops his luggage.  Thud. 

           Sam turns and runs. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam, limping, moves as fast as he can manage.  He turns
           the corner of the porch and rushes toward the office.  

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           Approaching from behind.  He marches forward with long
           strides.  Eyes fixed solely ahead on Sam. 

           One hand is held firmly to his stomach wound; the other
           grips the long barreled revolver.

                                 ELWOOD
                            (shouting)
                        Sam!

           BACK ON SAM

           As he continues to run.  He pants, heavily. 

           HIS POV

           A man walks out from the office towards him.  It is Wilbert
           Behrman. 

                                 WILBERT
                            (calling out)
                        Mr. Lipinski...there you are--

                                 SAM
                            (shouting)
                        --get back!

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           As he suddenly raises his pistol into the air.  His arm
           outstretched before him. 

                                 ELWOOD
                            (shouting)
                        Sam!

           BACK ON SAM

           Still running.  Limping. 

                                 SAM
                            (to Wilbert)
                        Get back!

           Wilbert, oblivious to what is actually happening, continues
           to walk forward.  He frowns, confused.  Sam gains closer. 

                                 WILBERT
                        Mr. Lipinski?  What's going on-- 

                                 SAM
                            (shouting)
                        --run!

           --BANG!  Blood explodes from Wilbert's face and splatters
           Sam.  Both men collapse to the floor in a heap. 

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           Marching forward.  Gun still raised. 

           BACK ON SAM

           As he stares at Wilbert's body beside him.  Shocked, he
           pushes himself back against a motel door.  Gasps. 

           The corpse's face is horribly disfigured from the bullet
           wound.  We see only blood, flesh and bone.

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           As his boots tread noisily along the wooden porch. 

           BACK ON SAM

           Now grasping the doorknob behind his head.  Terrified, he
           shakes the handle violently.  The door is locked. 

           --BANG!  A bullet hits the door mere inches from Sam's
           shoulder.  He quickly scurries forward, on hands and knees,
           past Wilbert's bloodied body. 

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           Gaining closer. 

           BACK ON SAM

           Panic-stricken.  He reaches another door and twists the
           handle.  It swings open.  Sam immediately crawls inside...

           ...and kicks the door shut with the soles of his boots.  

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           Now slowing his pace as he walks past the corpse sprawled
           out on the porch.  A pool of blood forms around its head. 

           Elwood then turns his attention to the closed door as he
           stands before it.  A brief beat. 

           CLOSE ON DOOR

           NO. 6

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           A deafening sound is heard as the door is violently kicked
           open.  The security chain is torn from the wall.  Elwood
           enters: one hand on his pistol; the other to his wound. 

           HIS POV

           An empty room.  Dark.  Tranquil. 

           Elwood's eyes scan his surroundings.  We see a neatly
           made bed, a sizeable wardrobe and a closed bathroom door. 

           ANGLE ON ELWOOD 

           As he suddenly bends down to peer under the double-bed. 

           HIS POV

           Nothing.  Bare floorboards. 

           Elwood stands, dissatisfied.  He looks from the bathroom
           door to the wardrobe.  Beat.  Then: raises his pistol and-- 

           --BANG!  A bullet shatters through the wardrobe at chest
           height: a gaping, dark hole now left in its wake. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam, staring at the closed door before him, flinches at
           the sound of the gunshot.  Sweat trickles past his temple. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood lowers his weapon, then slowly looks over at the
           bathroom.  Beat. 

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam, terrified, listens to the eerie silence that is now
           suddenly disrupted by the sound of heavy boot steps. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood approaches the bathroom, steadily.  He reaches the
           closed door, then studies the floor at his feet. 

           HIS POV

           A thin bar of soft light under the door.  No shadow. 

           Elwood turns his head close to the door: ears alert.  We
           hear a faint scraping sound, followed by sustained silence. 

           Beat.  Elwood quickly stands back.  He grips the revolver
           tightly in his hand and suddenly...

           INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           ...kicks the door open.  Splintered wood hits the tiled
           floor.  Elwood enters and instantly raises his weapon. 

           HIS POV

           An empty room.  A stained shower curtain has been pulled
           across to conceal the bathtub. 

           Elwood marches forward.  He quickly yanks back the curtain
           to find...

           ...a high, narrow window that sits open.  The square has
           barely enough space for a grown man to crawl though.  

           Elwood, shocked, stares at his unwanted discovery. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood rushes out of room number six and hurries back
           along the wooden porch: his wound slowing his actions. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Elwood barges into his room.  He quickly snatches the
           luggage up from the floor. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           The parking lot.  Elwood, panting, scurries past numerous
           vehicles.  
           © Paul China, 2011

           One hand grasps his ragged suitcase; the other holds both
           the duffel bag and revolver. 

           MUSTANG

           Elwood throws open the trunk, tosses in the luggage, then
           slams the door shut.  Suddenly: he stops.  Turns his head.

           HIS POV

           Sam stands up on the porch with the Nazi infantry rifle
           in his hands.  The long barrel is aimed at Elwood. 

           A tense beat.  Elwood laughs, silently, to himself.  He
           then turns his body to face Sam.  Shakes his head. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        How'd you shimmy through that
                        window with a lame leg?  Huh?
                            (amused)
                        You are full of surprises, Sam. 
                        You really are-- 

           Sam pulls back the bolt on his rifle.  A harsh, piercing
           noise.  Elwood's smile vanishes.  He nods his head forward.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        See you found those bullets? 

           No answer.  

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                            (remembering)
                        Gustav Witz. 

           The men continue to stare at each other.  Elwood still
           holds his pistol down by his side.  A lengthy beat passes. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I've got three shots left.  But
                        you know that already dont'cha? 

           Sam, perspiring, stays silent.  Elwood then looks over at
           the bloodied corpse on the porch.  Frowns. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I didn't mean to kill that man.  
                            (turns head back)
                        I didn't mean for a lot of things. 
                        When I was a baby, my mother used--

                                 SAM
                        --drop the gun. 

                                 ELWOOD
                        I can't do that. 

                                 SAM
                        I will shoot you dead. 
           © Paul China, 2011

                                 ELWOOD
                        No.  You won't.  You ain't got
                        the grit, Sam.  Sorry to say that,
                        but it's just the way it is. 

           He takes a slow, step forward.  Sam tenses and tightens
           his grip on the rifle. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        You never served on account of
                        your handicap.  No tour of duty. 

           Another step forward.  Sam backs up.  Stumbles, slightly. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        No reason to kill.  You're an old
                        man with too much to lose--

                                 SAM
                        --stop! 

           Elwood stands still.  Hint of a thin smile.  He then,
           very slowly, starts to raise his pistol. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                            (pleading)
                        Don't.  

                                 ELWOOD
                        S'alright... 

                                 SAM
                        Don't.

           Suddenly: the first rays of morning sunlight break out
           over the horizon.  A warm orange glow immerses both men.

                                 ELWOOD
                        ...s'alright, Sam. 

           Elwood's pistol continues to rise, higher and higher,
           till it points at Sam.  

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        Life sure is peculiar--

           --BANG!  A bright flash bursts from the nozzle of the
           rifle.  Elwood is thrown, violently, back against the
           Mustang.  He drops behind another vehicle: out of view. 

           Beat.  Sam, stunned, gradually lowers his weapon. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Low angle.  We track behind Sam's boots, on gravel, as
           they step in between two parked cars to reveal...

           ...Elwood: flat on his back.  His hands are pressed tightly
           to his stomach where the gunshot wound gushes dark blood.  

           He whines: high and childlike.  His face now ghostly white. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           Sam approaches and drops his rifle.  He sits on the floor
           behind Elwood: lifting his body up against his.  Elwood,
           now cradled in Sam's arms, begins to cry.  Winces in pain. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                            (struggles to talk)
                        My...mother...

           Blood fills his mouth and seeps through his teeth.

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        ...my mother--

                                 SAM
                            (whispering)
                        --shhh. 

           Some tears roll down Elwood's pale cheek.  Then:

           ELWOOD POV

           Up on the porch we can see three men: their identities
           partially hidden by the morning sun rays.  They appear to
           be the murdered victims from the diner massacre. 

           Elwood studies this vision.  Then, suddenly, he panics. 
           Starts to moan.  His body squirms, shakes. 

                                 ELWOOD
                            (frightened)
                        It's dark...it's dark...

           One of Elwood's blood-stained hands reaches up and touches
           Sam's face. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                            (crying)
                        I don't...see a light...

           Sam, upset, continues to hold the dying young man in his
           arms.  His chin gently rests on the top of Elwood's head. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                        I don't...

           Elwood's voice softens as his body begins to slow.  The
           sporadic shuddering now draws to a stop.  No movement. 

                                 ELWOOD (CONT'D)
                            (barely audible)
                        ...see... 

           Sam still cradles Elwood's lifeless body: an unexpected
           and mournful reluctance to let go.  We hold. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER

           Dark.  We face an open door that reveals, out on the porch,
           Wilbert Behrman's body.  The sky outside is now brighter. 

           Mrs. Behrman clutches on to her deceased husband.  She
           sobs and wails uncontrollably.  Looks up to the heavens.

           Police officers and medics console this hysterical woman
           as they try, unsuccessfully, to pull her away. 

           We slowly track forward.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Time catches up with the best of
                        us.  Whether you want it to or
                        not, don't matter...

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           A strewn of emergency vehicles and bright, flashing lights.
           Motel guests observe this commotion from their doorways. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        ...can't argue with death.  No
                        sir.  Can't change what's comin'. 

           ANGLE ON SAM

           Being questioned by a police officer.  His attention is
           fixed on the distraught Mrs. Behrman. 

           HIS POV

           The widow still clings to the corpse.  Her dress and hands
           are stained with blood. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Some of us forget the frailty.  A
                        thin thread on which we hang.
                        Others choose to ignore it... 

           BACK ON SAM

           His eyes now raise to see...

           ...various police representatives entering and exiting
           room number fourteen. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...like unwanted bills.  Missed
                        telephone calls. 

           INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Elwood's room.  A gloved officer shows a detective his
           discovery: a scribbled telephone number on a napkin. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        I figured the boy was right,
                        y'know.  Life is peculiar. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- CONTINUOUS

           CLOSE ON ELWOOD

           A body-bag is quickly zipped to mask his lifeless face. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Least it is for most folk.

           ANGLE ON AMBULANCE

           As coroners load the stretcher, carrying Elwood's corpse,
           into the back of the vehicle.  The doors are slammed shut. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Full of moments.  Chances.  Riddles
                        to a puzzle we'll never solve. 

           EXT. AMBULANCE -- LATER

           Close shot on the ambulance as it travels through morning
           traffic.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        I tell myself there's a nice spot
                        up there for him. 

           INT. AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

           The body-bag rocks gently with the sway of the vehicle. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Repentance...forgiveness...

           EXT. HOSPITAL -- LATER

           The doors of the ambulance are thrown open.  Hospital
           staff drag out the stretcher.  Their movements methodical. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        ...redemption.  But, I do not
                        believe my own words. 

           INT. HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER

           A coroner and a nurse wheel the stretcher through a white
           corridor lit with fluorescent lights. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        A man makes a choice and must
                        attend to the consequence. 

           INT. MORGUE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Morgue attendants lift the body-bag off the stretcher and
           onto a sliding table. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        It is his and his alone. 

           INT. VAULT -- CONTINUOUS

           Close shot on the body-bag as it slides into an open wall
           vault.  The door suddenly closes.  Darkness.  

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        A cross to bear.

           EXT. POLICE CAR (MOVING) -- NIGHT

           Officer Marty Petrone sits at the wheel.  Behind him we
           see another police car.  Both vehicles flash their lights. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Tell your friends, neighbors...

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON DOOR

           A hand enters to knock.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        ...wives and mothers. 

           An elderly couple, in nightwear, open their front door to
           see Marty Petrone and two other officers standing outside. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        They understand it too. 

           Inside the house...

           LILA MCBAIN

           ...stands halfway up the stairwell.  She wears a knee-
           length nightgown and holds an aged teddy-bear in her arms. 

           Her parents and the officers turn to face her. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Deep in their hearts.  Tips of
                        their tongues. 

           INT. POLICE CAR (MOVING) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Lila McBain, handcuffed, sits in the back of the vehicle. 
           She faces forward and sobs, uncontrollably.  

           Through the back windshield we see her mother chasing the
           car.  She bangs the trunk with her fists and screams.  

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        One span... 

           The father tries to restrain his wife as the vehicle pulls
           further away.  Both of them are bathed in flashing lights. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...no second go-around's. 

           INT. BURKELL HOUSE -- NIGHT

           We pan across the lounge to reveal Bernie sitting in front
           of an open box on the floor.  Her face still badly scarred. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        So take heed in the pleasures. 
                        The small details.

           She studies old photographs.  One picture shows her and a
           handsome Tom, laughing, in their youth.  Memories of life. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And laugh. 

           Bernie chuckles, softly.  Cries. 

           EXT. COUNTRY FAIR -- NIGHT

           A band plays in a marquee.  We push through the crowd to
           find Maggie Russell and Bobby Driscol slow-dancing
           together.  The girl rests her head on the boy's shoulder.  

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Dance.   

           Outside, fireworks erupt in the night sky. 

           INT. RODEO ARENA -- EVENING

           BLACK AND WHITE

           A continuation of Sam's flashback.  

           In a single slow-motion shot we see the cowboy, finally,
           crash to the ground.  The bull tramples the man's back
           and crushes his body down into the dirt. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        Remember the triumphs...  

           Numerous cameras flash from the stands.  The crowd is
           wild.  Two rodeo clowns charge towards the unruly animal. 

                                 SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...the failures... 

           The audience continues to scream.  Pure pandemonium.

           EXT. FAIRVALE -- MORNING

           A scorching summer's day.  We are looking down on a Red-
           Tailed Hawk as it soars over houses, trees and streets. 

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        ...and that everyday above ground's
                        a good one. 

           EXT. BURKELL HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           FIXED SHOT

           We can see two figures up on the front porch.  Next door,
           some children in swimsuits play frivolously with a lawn
           sprinkler.  Another neighbor sweats as he mows his yard.  

           EXT. BURKELL PORCH -- CONTINUOUS

           Sam sits in a wicker chair.  He is naked from the waist
           up.  Bernie, her scars still healing, cuts his hair with
           a pair of barber scissors. 
           © Paul China, 2011

           An old portable radio plays in the background. 

                                 SAM
                        I didn't take to Cousin Lymon. 

                                 BERNIE
                        Well, why not?

           She trims the hair at the back of Sam's neck. 

                                 SAM
                        He ruined that woman.  

           Bernie chuckles, slightly. 

                                 BERNIE
                        That's the beauty of the book,
                        Samuel.  The hardships of love. 
                        Loneliness.  Empathy. 

           She moves across to the porch banister and...

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        McCullers was a genius. 

           ...picks up a cool glass of ice tea.  Takes a refreshing
           sip to quench her thirst. 

                                 SAM
                            (playful)
                        Well, if you say so. 

                                 BERNIE
                        I do. 

           Suddenly: we hear a dog barking.  The couple turn to see
           an elated border collie run down the street. 

           Seconds later, officer Marty Petrone, in uniform, follows
           in hot pursuit.  He pants as he runs in the torrid heat. 

                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        I'll be...

           CLOSE ON SAM

           As he smiles to himself.  Amused by the sight. 

                                 BERNIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Oh, I do like this song.

           Bernie turns up the antiquated radio.  We hear a country-
           blues track: 'Sweet Virginia' by the Rolling Stones. 

           Possessed by the music, Bernie begins to sway her body to
           its rhythm.  She dances, carefully, around a radiant Sam
           as she continues to trim his hair.  

           We hear her hum the melody. 

           Then, as the song nears its rousing chorus, Bernie bends
           down and whispers something softly into her lover's ear.

           CLOSE ON SAM

           His smile suddenly widens.  Ear to ear.  He laughs and,
           surprisingly, looks up at us, his audience. 

           'Sweet Virginia' still plays as we-- 

                                                        --CUT TO BLACK.
