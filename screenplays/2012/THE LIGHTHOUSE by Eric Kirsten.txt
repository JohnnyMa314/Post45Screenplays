           INT. STEEL FACTORY - FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

           A quick BLAST of yellow light, white at its center. Noxious 
           brown smoke lifting past us. We see towering furnaces, 
           scarred black from their fate. A heat that could melt skin.

           EXT. STEEL FACTORY - FREIGHT YARD - DAY

           Through the silver light of dawn, we find a freshly minted 
           steel I-BEAM, strapped in and dangling, thirty feet above a 
           freight train. Sinking toward a waiting flatbed.

           MOMENTS LATER -- it’s dropped onto the stack with a sharp 
           CLANG that doesn’t raise an eyebrow.

           EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

           The I-Beam rides open-air, crossing the hills of 
           Pennsylvania.

           INT./EXT. HUDSON RIVER BARGE (MOVING) - DAY

           Covering the expansive deck of the BARGE, identically stacked 
           pyramids of steel beams. Finishing their long journey 
           together.

           Heading toward --

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY (1930) - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           From the shores of New Jersey, we look across the Hudson to 
           the island of Manhattan. Sitting silent, preparing itself for 
           glory and greatness as the center of the known universe. 

           In 1930 though, despite one or two tall buildings, it’s not 
           much to marvel at.

           EXT. BANK OF MANHATTAN BUILDING - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           An obvious work in progress. A steel skeleton that already 
           stretches higher than any other building on the planet. The 
           typical lunch hour crowd encircling the work site’s fence 
           line, watching the commotion.

           About halfway up, teams of BRICKLAYERS work quickly, adding 
           skin to the skeleton. Four inches at a time.
           EXT. BANK OF MANHATTAN BUILDING - 68TH FLOOR - LATER

           Up at the top of the world. TOM COLEMAN (40’s) tightens a 
           bolt the size of a fist. NED SHEUSTER (30’s) stands a few 
           feet away, urinating into a silver bucket as he releases a 
           satisfying yawn.

                                 TOM
                             (wipes at his cheek)
                        Piss down wind, will ya, Ned? We 
                        talked about this.

           Ned shakes out his last few drops.

                                 NED
                             (looking over the edge)
                        Those brickburners down there are 
                        lucky I’m hitting the bucket at all. 
                        Can barely see straight. 

                                 TOM
                        It’s abuse is what it is. Hand me the 
                        twelve gauge, will ya?
                             (as Ned hands it over)
                        How long’s it been since we been able 
                        to actually look up at a bird?

                                 NED
                        This shift’s eleven hours, one before 
                        that was twelve, right? 

                                 TOM
                             (cranking the wrench)
                        Thirteen. And the hell we say 
                        anything. You hear how many floors 
                        went up over at Chrysler yesterday? 
                        Let me have a finishing cap...
                             (as Ned hands it over)
                        Four! In a single goddamn day.

                                 NED
                        How’s that even possible?

                                 TOM
                        Hell if I know, but I do know what it 
                        means for us.

                                 NED
                        We’re not sleeping this month...

                                 TOM
                        Exactly. Lemme see the soddering tip 
                        again...
                             (as Ned hands it over)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Truth is, we’re fucked, Ned. With a 
                        capital shove-it-up-your-ass.

           FROM BEHIND NED - A single I-Beam moving INTO FRAME, lowering 
           toward them. Tom notices it.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Incoming.
                             (jumping up, waving it in)
                        Okay, easy now...

           The towering CRANE, itself a wonderment of engineering, sits 
           adjacent to the scaffolding. Its LIFTING HOOK still attached 
           by a long steel line to the moving I-Beam.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Neddy. Tie me off.

                                 NED
                        Tom, why don’t you let me take it?

                                 TOM
                        Because I always take ‘em in, and I’m 
                        smart enough not to mess with 
                        tradition at seven hundred feet. Now 
                        tie me off.

           As Tom speaks, he throws on his anchor vest - essentially a 
           piece of canvas strapped on like a life vest, but with the 
           critical difference of a spooled piece of cable attached to 
           the back. The loose end of the cable has a carabiner hook on 
           it, used for attaching to fixed beams.

           Ned moves through the routine, grabbing the cable and pulling 
           it to a nearby beam. He wraps it around once, about to hook 
           it off - 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Ned, buddy, you forgetting something?

           Ned pivots his head, his confused, bloodshot eyes trying to 
           remember.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        The rivets?

           Ned shakes his head, clearing the cobwebs. 

                                 NED
                        Sorry, Tommy. I’ll call down for some 
                        coffee after this one.

           Ned releases the hook, quickly jumps over to the toolbox.
           CLOSE ON THE HOOK - the cable runs through it, but the small 
           gate that locks it in was left open. The cable teeters on the 
           point of the carabiner hook.

           Ned crouches at the toolbox, grabbing the forgotten rivets, 
           but as he does - 

           CLOSE ON THE HOOK - the teetering cable tips off, the hook 
           immediately unwrapping, falling limp.

           Ned squats, ready with the rivets. But as he does, he hears a 
           TAP...metal against metal. And then another. He turns his 
           head to see the hook swinging loose. A confused expression as 
           if the sight doesn’t make sense. But then, all at once, it 
           does -  

           The I-beam swings in close. Tom reaches out for it.

                                 NED (CONT’D)
                        Tom, no! Wait!!

           But it’s too late. Tom’s already pitching forward.

           He reaches desperately for anything, finding only air. His 
           face contorting into confused horror, every nightmare from 
           his past twenty years converging at once. Ned’s eyes go wide, 
           trying to scramble to his feet, but powerless now.

           SLOW MOTION - On Tom as he slips below Ned’s sight line.

           ANGLE FROM ABOVE as Tom falls. Arms and legs kicking, his 
           eyes pleading wildly. 

           Ned looks over the edge, screaming down for his friend. 
           Nothing else to do. 

           END SLOW MOTION - Tom’s body is a blur, gravity doing its 
           worst. It CRASHES through the wooden floor thirty floors 
           below, too much force to be stopped. Missing every 
           bricklayer, sucking rubble into the void, before disappearing 
           from our view in a silent dust cloud. 

           AT STREET LEVEL, anxious pedestrians rush toward the chaos 
           from every angle.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. NEW YORK TIMES OFFICES - NIGHT

           The offices are quiet, but one office is still lit, still 
           pursuing all the news that’s fit to print. Inside the office:
           WILL VAN ALEN (mid 30’s), clean-cut and handsome, is tense at 
           the moment, his jaw muscle flexing as he sits across a 
           cluttered desk from LARRY HOPKINS (mid-50’s). Larry taps a 
           pen against his cheek, studying Will’s face.

                                 LARRY
                        Just like that...you want me to print 
                        that you’re giving up...

                                 WILL
                        A man fell seven hundred feet 
                        yesterday, Larry. 

                                 LARRY
                        Wasn’t one of your men.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t care.

           A beat of silence before Larry shakes his head.

                                 LARRY
                        I do, Will. This dogfight you’re 
                        in...it’s the best story this place 
                        has covered in years.
                             (lights a cigarette)
                        You really think you’ll ever get 
                        another shot at something like that?

                                 WILL
                             (meets Larry’s eyes 
                              before)
                        I still need you to print it, and it 
                        needs to hit in a week or so.

                                 LARRY
                             (a beat; exhales)
                        Fine.

           As Will stands, steps toward the door.

                                 LARRY (CONT’D)
                        But this whole thing, it’s not about 
                        who ends up with the tallest building 
                        in the world...
                             (off Will)
                        It’s about who becomes immortalized 
                        and who becomes forgettable. And I 
                        guess you just answered that.

           Off Will’s tired eyes, we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           INT. ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS (DORM ROOM) - DAY

           PULL BACK from these same eyes...

           Younger now, their boyish innocence still intact. They belong 
           to the sunlit face of a man looking out a window: Will Van 
           Alen, now in his early 20’s. His eyes scan the horizon, but 
           what he actually sees is a secret known only to him.

           SUPER:  Paris, 1923 - 7 Years Earlier

           WILL’S POV: The Eiffel Tower, a mile away, dwarfing every 
           other structure within sight.

           The door swings open behind him. Meet HARRY TANNING (24). 
           Thinning hair and the first signs of a belly, his confidence 
           has never suffered from his physical shortcomings.

                                 HARRY
                        Ah, my ruminating roomie. Was hoping 
                        you’d be here.

                                 WILL
                             (not looking over)
                        Harry.
                             (then)
                        Pleasurable evening?

                                 HARRY
                             (flopping down onto his 
                              bed)
                        You missed out yet again, Will. Pack 
                        of crazed Turkish women on holiday. 
                        Made for a very respectable Tuesday 
                        night.

           Harry takes a swig from a flask, notices Will not 
           listening...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You know...it’s my belief that your 
                        introspective tendencies are clearly 
                        the result of one thing.

                                 WILL
                        Get dressed. We need to be there in 
                        thirty minutes.

                                 HARRY
                        And that one thing is clearly this: 
                        you’re going to miss me. Terribly.
                             (then)
                        Three years is an unnaturally long 
                        time for two grown men to share 
                        living quarters this cozy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        And the fact is, after we graduate, 
                        you’re going to be lost without my 
                        guidance. 

           Will smirks, finally turns from the window to face Harry, 
           who’s switching out one blazer for another.

                                 WILL
                        You seriously undervalue clarity in 
                        human conversation, Harry. What are 
                        you trying to say?

                                 HARRY
                        I’m suggesting a partnership, old 
                        friend. We join forces back in the 
                        states and make a splash as the 
                        newest architecture firm to take 
                        Chicago by storm. Tanning and Van 
                        Alen.

                                 WILL
                        Van Alen and Tanning.

                                 HARRY
                        Ha! There’s my tiger. We’ll bed the 
                        most beautiful women, eat in the 
                        finest restaurants, drink obscenely 
                        expensive wine...

                                 WILL
                        And I thought a partnership meant 
                        actually doing some work. Are my 
                        sleeves too short?

           Harry places a hand on Will’s shoulder, leans in close. Eye 
           to eye...

                                 HARRY
                        We will design structures even the 
                        gods are not worthy of. Or, at least 
                        you will. I’m comfortable with my 
                        creative limitations, so I’ll do all 
                        that businessy stuff you won’t have 
                        time for.

           Will’s face is noncommittal. But he’s listening...

                                 WILL
                        Why Chicago?

                                 HARRY
                        Chicago, Boston, San Francisco. 
                        They’re all equally in need of some 
                        real taste. You choose...
           Will chews his lip, considering all of this. Harry grins, 
           messes Will’s hair.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        But not now. Your interest is piqued, 
                        so my job here is done. 
                             (then)
                        But yes, your sleeves are too short.

           Harry opens the door to leave. Suddenly face to face with a 
           man standing there: ALAN REYNOLDS (50), his closed hand 
           raised to knock. Looking out of place among the students.

           Harry grasps Alan’s shoulders with passionate conviction, 
           kisses this stranger on each of his cheeks:

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Greetings, kind stranger! The 
                        pleasure was entirely mine!

           And with that, Harry walks off. A perplexed Alan looks toward 
           Will.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t mind him. Can I help you with 
                        something?

                                 ALAN
                        Sorry, I’m just having trouble 
                        tracking down a student here. Name of 
                        William Van Alen...?

                                 WILL
                        And you’d be?

                                 ALAN
                        Alan Reynolds. I’m here from New 
                        York.

           Will wrangles on his school blazer, smiles.

                                 WILL
                        Problem solved, Alan.
                             (Will extends a hand, they 
                              shake)
                        You mind a stroll?

           EXT. ECOLE DES BEAUX ARTS CAMPUS - MINUTES LATER

           The pleasant serenity of academia. Stucco and leaded glass 
           stand poised above manicured grass and stone walkways. The 
           Eiffel Tower looming in the distance.
           Will and Alan walk together, several paces behind the moving, 
           energized throng of Will’s CLASSMATES. 

                                 ALAN
                        I’m here, Will, because I’m building 
                        a premier forty-five story hotel on 
                        the corner of Lexington and forty-
                        second street. You won’t find a more 
                        prized piece of land on the planet.

                                 WILL
                        Congratulations. I know that corner 
                        well.

                                 ALAN
                        I assumed you would. 
                             (pulling a sheet of paper 
                              from a pocket; reading)
                        Will Van Alen, born and raised in New 
                        York City, studied at the Pratt 
                        Institute where he excelled from 
                        start to finish, graduating at the 
                        top of his class before winning a 
                        scholarship to come to lovely Paris, 
                        where he has continued to be showered 
                        in awards and praise.
                             (folding up the paper)
                        Did I miss anything?

                                 WILL
                        I’m also an above average swimmer.

                                 ALAN
                        I want to hire you, Will. As part of 
                        developing this hotel, I’m assembling 
                        an architecture team from the finest 
                        talent available.

                                 WILL
                        Ahh, but there’s the kink.
                             (off Alan’s face)
                        I’m not available.

                                 ALAN
                             (a bit thrown)
                        Oh...I assumed with your school being 
                        an ocean away that nobody had 
                        recruited you yet.

                                 WILL
                        Starting my own firm actually. With 
                        another student here. His brilliance 
                        is... 
           WILL’S POV - within the heart of the throng, just ahead, 
           Harry sits atop the shoulders of another student, flapping 
           his arms like an eagle.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        ...indescribable.

                                 ALAN
                        Really... I’m impressed. That’s a lot 
                        for a man your age to bite off.
                             (extending his hand)
                        I can’t say I’m happy about it, but I 
                        guess there’s no reason to waste any 
                        more of your time...

           Will shakes Alan’s hand, mulling something.

                                 WILL
                        Could you stand a bit more walking, 
                        Alan?

           INT. PALAIS DES ETUDES - MINUTES LATER

           Soaring buttresses and stained glass that demand silent 
           reverence from the uninitiated. One of the finest examples of 
           French Court Gothic architecture in the world.

           The peacefulness is crushed as the scores of rowdy students 
           stream in, Will and Alan bringing up the rear.

           Alan doesn’t try to hide his awe, his neck craning in 
           wonderment as he takes in his surroundings. 

                                 WILL
                        Amazing, right?

           Will and Alan continue down the center aisle, toward the pews 
           where Will’s classmates are restlessly milling. They find a 
           space of their own, off to the side.

                                 ALAN
                        So?

                                 WILL
                        So... I want you to hire my firm to 
                        design your hotel.

                                 ALAN
                        Ahh. And I assume I would be client 
                        number one?

                                 WILL
                        Ensures you a permanent, special 
                        place in our heart.
           Alan chuckles.

                                 ALAN
                        Okay, let me play along. Why would I 
                        use an unproven, outside firm of 
                        recent graduates when I can just 
                        create my own hand-picked team?

                                 WILL
                        Because my unproven firm will live or 
                        die by how we perform for you. And 
                        because I am moving back to New York, 
                        Alan, and I can either work for you 
                        or I can design the hotel across the 
                        street from yours.

           Alan watches Will’s eyes, taking him seriously now.

                                 ALAN
                        And your fees?

                                 WILL
                        I assume you brought a written offer 
                        for me? For the job?

           Alan pulls a sealed letter from his breast pocket.

                                 ALAN
                        I did.

                                 WILL
                        Then I accept. But instead of getting 
                        a single employee, you get an entire 
                        firm, dedicated to building you the 
                        most glorious hotel you haven’t even 
                        imagined yet.

           Alan taps the envelope against his cheek, considering this. 
           After an extended beat, he holds it out for Will. Will takes 
           it. 

                                 ALAN
                        Well done, Will. I guess you have 
                        yourself a client.

           Will inspects the offer letter. After a beat, he pulls a pen 
           from his back pocket.

                                 WILL
                        You forgot to sign it.

                                 ALAN
                        No, no.

           Alan pulls his own GOLD PEN from his breast pocket.
                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                             (scratching his signature)
                        I only use this one. At least for 
                        occasions worthy of it.

           The two men shake hands. As they do, Will finds Harry in the 
           crowd of students. Harry is watching them curiously, meeting 
           Will’s eyes. Will just winks.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING - DAY

           An expansive loft. Too big of an office for the paltry number 
           of workers. Quiet. Four APPRENTICE DRAFTSMEN (20’s) sit at 
           their angled drafting desks. Pencils, T-squares, and 
           protractors at work. At the center conference table, Will and 
           Alan Reynolds stand over an unrolled blueprint.

                                 ALAN
                             (re: blueprint; pointing)
                        This is good. But I’d like to open 
                        this space up a bit.

           Will scribbles some notes.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Where’s your other half been lately?

           ANGLE ON Harry’s office. A few piles of papers on the desk, 
           but no Harry.

                                 WILL
                        Out trying to make our young firm 
                        less reliant on you, I’d presume.

                                 ALAN
                        And? How’s he doing?

                                 WILL
                        He’ll get there.
                             (shifting the 
                              conversation)
                        I’ll make sure we get these changes 
                        in for the next round.

           Alan grins sympathetically. Keeping his thoughts to himself.

           A couple of quick KNOCKS at the main office door before CRAIG 
           SEVERANCE (40’s) ENTERS. Severance is movie star handsome in 
           an expensively tailored suit.

                                 CRAIG
                        Knock, knock? Anyone home?
                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry, I don’t believe we had any 
                        appointments scheduled today.

                                 ALAN
                             (moving toward Craig)
                        My fault, my fault. Will, this is 
                        Craig Severance. I asked him to meet 
                        me here.

           Will watches Alan and Severance exchange a friendly 
           handshake.

                                 WILL
                             (sotto; annoyed)
                        Guess we’re done here...

           Severance approaches Will, offering his hand and a warm 
           smile. Owning the room as he typically does.

                                 CRAIG
                        And you must be Alan’s brilliant new 
                        architect.
                             (off Will)
                        Alan has shared some of your plans 
                        with me. Hope you don’t mind. You 
                        have a gifted eye.

                                 WILL
                        Very kind of you. In the business, I 
                        assume.

                                 CRAIG
                        More on the financial side, but we 
                        all have our roles, right?

                                 ALAN
                             (cutting in)
                        So, unfortunately, Craig and I are 
                        going to be late for our lunch 
                        reservation.
                             (putting on his coat)
                        Maybe you two should set up a 
                        meeting?

                                 CRAIG
                        Love to. 
                             (to Will)
                        Do you ride?

           Will looks from Craig to Alan, then back to Craig.

                                 WILL
                        Do I ride...what?
           Craig smiles, amused. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Craig sits atop a gorgeous SILVER MARE, handling the majestic 
           animal with experienced grace. Will’s HORSE is less stately, 
           struggling to tolerate its clumsy rider.

           We join Will in mid-thought:

                                 WILL
                             (animated)
                        ...I’m not dismissing the practical 
                        Vitruvian view, but there are 
                        vernacular concerns and canonic 
                        examples of functionality as well... 

                                 CRAIG
                             (light)
                        If you say so...

                                 WILL
                        I’m boring you. 
                             (then)
                        What was your question again?

                                 CRAIG
                        I believe I asked, ‘So you’re an 
                        architect?’

           Will nods, embarrassed.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        I love seeing your passion, Will, but 
                        I’m sure you’ve figured out that our 
                        chance meeting had nothing to do with 
                        chance.

                                 WILL 
                        And what does it have to do with?

           Craig smiles at Will’s bluntness.

                                 CRAIG
                        You’ve been at this, what, eight or 
                        nine months now?
                             (off Will’s silence)
                        And how are things so far with your 
                        school friend...Harry, is it? How’s 
                        the partnership...
                                 WILL
                        Well, he does all the sales and 
                        Alan’s still our only client, but 
                        he’ll find his sea legs. If he’s 
                        anything, he’s tenacious.

                                 CRAIG
                        Surely you aspire to more than a 
                        single client and a few underworked 
                        draftsmen...

                                 WILL
                        And why are you sure of that?

           Craig notices Will’s defensiveness. 

                                 CRAIG
                        I apologize. There’s nothing wrong 
                        with enjoying a small boutique firm. 
                        Nothing at all. Please forget I even 
                        mentioned it.

           They clip-clop in silence for a few moments, Craig waiting 
           for Will to speak first...

                                 WILL
                        I can’t deny that Harry’s client 
                        development efforts have fallen a bit 
                        short.

                                 CRAIG
                        And do you know why that is?

                                 WILL
                        I think he was counting on his last 
                        name to unlock more doors than it 
                        has. His father is quite the powerful 
                        lawyer apparently.

                                 CRAIG
                        Ah, success as a birthright. Lucky 
                        for you, that’s not how it works.

           The two men’s eyes meet.  

                                 WILL
                        We should probably head back, I’ve a 
                        good amount of work-

                                 CRAIG
                        Can I be honest with you, Will?

                                 WILL
                        If it will get me off this creature 
                        any faster, then by all means.
                                 CRAIG
                             (smiles, then)
                        Harry is your friend, I understand 
                        that. But starting a new firm in New 
                        York is beyond difficult. It takes a 
                        lot more than the right last name. 

                                 WILL
                        Such as...?

                                 CRAIG
                        Well, first off, it takes genuine 
                        ability. I’ve seen your work, so I 
                        know you’re covered there.
                             (then)
                        But you also need a person who 
                        belongs to the club.

                                 WILL
                        There’s a club...

                                 CRAIG
                        There’s always a club. One that 
                        requires membership and without 
                        which, you’re an outsider. And 
                        outsiders are always running uphill. 
                        Eventually you’ll just die of 
                        exhaustion.

                                 WILL
                        All due respect, Craig, I don’t tire 
                        easily.

           Craig grins at Will’s innocence.

                                 CRAIG
                        Look, Will. Alan’s project fell onto 
                        your lap because of your talent, but 
                        I promise that that’s unlikely to 
                        happen again. 
                             (they meet eyes)
                        Decide quickly how serious you are 
                        about all of this. Alan likes you and 
                        he wants to help. 
                             (then)
                        Our meeting wasn’t an accident, but 
                        it’s up to you what you do with it.

           Hard as it is to hear, Will is listening. Off him...
           INT. EAST SIDE TAVERN - NIGHT

           Prohibition has turned this tavern into a mild-mannered 
           eatery. Will and Harry sit at a table together, each of them 
           working on sandwiches. Harry holds up his glass of water...

                                 HARRY
                             (through a full mouth; 
                              thick with sarcasm)
                        Mmm. Water. Nothing tops off a meal 
                        more completely than a cup of 
                        invigorating water. 
                             (takes a drink)
                        Delightful!

           Will is used to Harry’s odd outbursts. He lets it go, not in 
           the mood to play along. A beat.

                                 WILL
                        So, how did your meetings go today? 
                        Any nibbles? 

           Harry’s not listening, still examining his water glass.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s literally liquid nothingness. 
                             (reaching into his breast 
                              pocket)
                        But luckily for me, I’ve got a guy.

           Harry withdraws a small silver flask. He lifts his water 
           glass, spots a potted plant nearby - 

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                             (pouring the water in)
                        Because...I...am not...a plant.

           He pours the hooch into his empty glass, takes an adoring 
           gulp.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I’d offer you some, but your lack of 
                        tits precludes me from even 
                        considering it.

           Harry takes another drink. 

                                 WILL
                        So you had, what, the shoe company 
                        and an apartment developer? Think we 
                        have a shot with either one?
                                 HARRY
                        Does it honestly not annoy you? Are 
                        the Baptists and Methodists and all 
                        of the other ists so insecure that we 
                        should be denied a few drops of 
                        liquid barley now and then?

           Will’s annoyance is growing, unable to even look at Harry.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        This country is truly on the brink of 
                        destruction when these religious 
                        zealots can dictate an amendment to 
                        the U.S. Constitution -

                                 WILL
                        Harry! Enough!
                             (off Harry’s surprised 
                              face)
                        I don’t care about the water or the 
                        eighteenth amendment or the religious 
                        zealots! WE don’t have the luxury to 
                        care about any of that! Your sales 
                        are what’s going to keep our firm 
                        alive until Alan starts building his 
                        hotel. And so far, those sales have 
                        been zero...

           Harry takes a drink, watching Will.

                                 HARRY
                        Someone had a shitty day.

                                 WILL
                        No, my day was fine. It was a fine 
                        day. I just want you to tell me about 
                        your meetings with the shoe store and 
                        the developer. Jesus...

                                 HARRY
                        My, my...so testy. You just had to 
                        ask.

                                 WILL
                        I did.

                                 HARRY
                        Did you?
                             (off Will’s stare; a beat)
                        Huh. Well, the bastard at the shoe 
                        store wouldn’t meet with me, 
                        insisting that I was late, despite 
                        the fact that I know for certain our 
                        appointment was for eleven, and not 
                        at ten like he thought.
           Will stays expressionless, part of him expecting this.

                                 WILL
                        And the developer?

                                 HARRY
                        Going with a different firm. Nice 
                        gent though, I’m pretty certain I 
                        finagled a couple of invitations to 
                        his beach house for us at some point.

           Will nods, a beach invitation hardly what he had in mind.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        We’re young, partner. Drink your 
                        water and be merry. Opportunity is 
                        everywhere.

           Will forces a half-hearted grin, lifts his glass.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Will walks alone, hands in is pockets. Lost in his 
           contemplations. 

           His thoughts are jarred short by a loud CLANG in the 
           distance. And then another... Will looks over to see, at the 
           edge of the park, a building being erected. Hundreds of men 
           working together to create something real.

           Will can’t take his eyes off it.

           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING (MAIN AREA) - DAY

           The four young draftsmen pretend to work, all of them 
           actually watching the nearby COMMOTION from the corners of 
           their eyes. 

           REVERSE on the source of their entertainment: Through the 
           glass wall outside Harry’s office, they see Harry holding a 
           table lamp and SHOUTING at Will. Harry cranks back his arm, 
           about to throw the lamp.

           BACK ON THE DRAFTSMEN, cringing with anticipation. All of 
           their necks jerk back in unison at the sound of a loud 
           CRASH...

           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING (HARRY’S OFFICE) - SAME 
           TIME

           Harry points at Will, his eyes accusing and hurt.
                                 HARRY
                        I didn’t suspect this kind of 
                        disloyalty from you, Van Alen! But I 
                        should have.

                                 WILL
                        And what does that mean?

                                 HARRY
                        Brooklyn boy rises up, has a shot at 
                        the inner sanctum. Takes a better man 
                        than you to turn that down.

                                 WILL
                        That’s unfair.

           Harry notices a pile of papers on his desk, pushes them 
           violently to the floor. Will continues to stand calm, feeling 
           for his friend.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not trying to part ways here.

                                 HARRY
                        My name is coming off the door. A new 
                        one is taking its place. What else 
                        would you call it!?

           Will tries to place his hand gently on Harry’s arm.

                                 WILL
                        Harry, please.

           Harry pushes Will’s hand away. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        I want you to stay. Bringing on Craig 
                        Severance is good for us.

                                 HARRY
                        It’s good for you.

                                 WILL
                        No! Us!!
                             (containing himself)
                        He has access, he can get meetings we 
                        can’t. This firm will fail without 
                        that, do you understand?

                                 HARRY
                        I understand that I’m now an employee 
                        in a firm I co-founded.
                                 WILL
                        He wouldn’t agree to any other 
                        structure. I tried to conv -

                                 HARRY
                        You didn’t! You didn’t try!

           Will looks down at the floor. The silence lingering for a few 
           moments.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Reconcile this, all of this, however 
                        you need to so that you can sleep at 
                        night, Will. But I’m being replaced.
                             (Harry moves toward the 
                              door; turns back)
                        And you let it happen.

           Harry leaves. Off Will...

                                                         TIME DISSOLVE:

           EXT. CORNER OF 42ND STREET & LEXINGTON AVE. (NYC) - DAY

           SUPER: Six Years Later

           Snow falling, bundled pedestrians walking quickly to their 
           destinations. An obviously older Will stands motionless - 
           peering through a theodolite (essentially a sort of telescope 
           used for surveying), set on a tripod. He lifts his head from 
           the eyepiece, inspects the land before him --

           WILL’S POV - A huge hole. Thirty to forty feet deep, and 
           three-hundred feet long and wide. FENCING set around the 
           perimeter.

           To the side of Will, and unnoticed by him, a woman (MEG 
           BAGLEY, 30) holds a HASSELBLAD CAMERA, pointing it toward 
           him. She snaps his photo. The FLASH catches his attention.

                                 WILL
                        Why did you just do that?

           Meg tilts her head at him. She’s beyond pretty, radiant 
           actually. Her porcelain skin flushed from the cold.

                                 WOMAN
                        Because I wanted to take your 
                        picture...
                             (she walks toward him)
                        Your eyes say intelligent, but now 
                        I’m thinking maybe not so much.
                                 WILL
                        I realize you were taking my picture. 
                        My question is why...

                                 WOMAN
                        Because it’s what I do. 
                             (extends a hand)
                        Meg Bagley.

           Will takes her hand. Confused, but drawn in. The woman oozes 
           confidence.

                                 MEG
                        This is where you say your name.

                                 WILL
                             (clumsy)
                        Oh, yes. Sorry. Just been a busy 
                        morning, and my normal surveyor is 
                        sick so if these measurements are 
                        going to get done, it’s going to be 
                        by me.

           Meg nods, eyebrows raised with amusement.

                                 MEG
                        Understood. And...who might you be 
                        again?

                                 WILL
                        Oh, right, keep doing that. Will Van 
                        Alen. Architect.

                                 MEG
                        Ah, and did you design this beautiful 
                        crater, Will Van Alen Architect?

                                 WILL
                             (smiles, then)
                        I’m afraid so.

                                 MEG
                        Well, it’s one of the finer holes 
                        I’ve ever seen. You’re very gifted.
                             (then)
                        You plan to fill it with anything, or 
                        is this just a really bad plan to 
                        trap a few thousand innocent New 
                        Yorkers?

                                 WILL
                             (without spirit)
                        Yeah, I don’t know. Someday. These 
                        things take time. Especially this 
                        thing...
           She punches him playfully in the arm.

                                 MEG
                        Just a little joke, William. Don’t 
                        you go dark on me!
                             (light; re: the 
                              theodolite)
                        Now tell me what your little 
                        riggetyroll here does.

                                 WILL
                             (trying to focus)
                        Nothing fun, I’m afraid. Just 
                        measures angles that I need.
                             (stepping aside)
                        Here, have a look...

           She does. As she looks: 

                                 MEG
                        Uh huh. And what do you do with these 
                        angles once you’ve measured them?

                                 WILL
                        I use them to draw pictures and build 
                        a model of a building...to show 
                        people.

                                 MEG
                        Interesting. You know, my nephew does 
                        that...

                                 WILL
                        Your nephew’s an architect.

                                 MEG
                        My nephew is seven.

           Will grins, embarrassed. Meg watches him curiously. Tilting 
           her head.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah...well, I was seven once.

           Meg’s face shows amused confusion. This grown man, so 
           awkward. She likes it.

                                 MEG
                        Okay, Will Van Alen Architect, I’ll 
                        be seeing you. Keep up the good work 
                        on our little pit here.

           She turns and walks off. Will offers a quick, hopeful wave to 
           her back. His face suddenly falls to utter despair as she 
           goes.
                                 WILL
                             (sotto)
                        I was seven once. 
                             (then)
                        Unbelievable...

           INT. OFFICES OF SEVERANCE & VAN ALEN (DRAFTING ROOM) - LATER

           The tripod slung over one shoulder, Will walks into the large 
           drafting room, now a bustling area filled with sixty 
           DRAFTSMEN - moving about, sketching at their desks, 
           conferring in small groups. The steady din of success.

           Will’s eyes land on one particular worker: Harry. 

           CLOSE ON HARRY - Eyes focused as he works at his desk amidst 
           the clamor. 

           Will hesitates, then starts walking toward him. As he 
           approaches, another draftsman gets to Harry first, Harry and 
           the other man sharing a laugh.

           Will stops and turns toward his office...

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Will leans the tripod against a wall. Before he can even turn 
           around --

                                 CRAIG
                             (routine update; quick)
                        You’re back, excellent. McConnell is 
                        bringing in a possible restaurant in 
                        Chelsea. Meeting’s at three today, 
                        I’ll be in it. If it happens, we’re 
                        gonna need at least three new men. 
                        Maybe an additional intern. The pitch 
                        for the Winter Garden Theatre got 
                        moved to next Monday.

                                 WILL
                             (beat of silence; looking 
                              up)
                        You forgot the Stadler account.

           Craig is surprised that Will has been listening..

                                 CRAIG
                        What about it?

                                 WILL
                        Harry closed it. Finished the deal 
                        last night.
                                 CRAIG
                        Harry did... Huh...
                             (then)
                        Well kudos to good ol’ Harry for 
                        actually doing his job.

           Will smirks, letting Craig have his little jab.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Grab your notes and the latest 
                        numbers. Alan’s coming in to talk 
                        about his hotel.

                                 WILL
                        Really...

                                 CRAIG
                        Yes, really and truly. 

                                 WILL
                        Did he give any clue as to why?

                                 CRAIG
                        Partner, he’s been our largest client 
                        for almost seven years, so he can 
                        come in and talk to us anytime he 
                        wants. I know it’s hard to keep 
                        revising the same plans over and 
                        over, but trust me, he pays us very 
                        well for your time.

           Craig takes a seat on the edge of Will’s desk, shifting into 
           parenting mode - 

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Building a hotel is about a bit of 
                        compromise, Will. Settling on what’s 
                        agreeable. We’re designing something 
                        that weary travelers will be coming 
                        to for years, looking for comfort. 
                        And the first person who needs to 
                        feel comfortable is Alan.  

           Will leans back in his chair, eyes on his window view. Craig 
           sees Will’s discontent.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to be the one to say it, but 
                        hey...that’s why we’re a great team, 
                        right? One of us has to keep things 
                        pragmatic.

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, of course.
                                 CRAIG
                        Alright, good man. So grab what you 
                        need and let’s go keep our biggest 
                        fish happy.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll meet you in there, just need to 
                        do one quick thing.

           INT. OFFICES OF SEVERANCE & VAN ALEN (DRAFTING ROOM) - 
           MINUTES LATER

           Will sidles up beside the desk of DOROTHY (20’s), a young, 
           pretty secretary.

                                 WILL
                        Dorothy, hi, have you seen Harry 
                        around? I spotted him earlier.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Van Alen. He went off 
                        to lunch with a potential client, 
                        and...
                             (checking a scheduling 
                              book)
                        ...then he’s off-site at two 
                        consecutive sales calls. 

                                 WILL
                        And after that?

                                 DOROTHY
                             (still consulting her 
                              calendar)
                        Let’s see...oh, dinner at Clancy’s.
                             (looking up to Will)
                        With a potential client.

           Will tries to cover his surprise.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Did you want me to pass on a message?

                                 WILL
                        Um, no, that’s fine. No message.

           Will walks off, toward the main conference room.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Will and Craig sit beside each other, papers on the table in 
           front of them.
           Alan Reynolds pushes into the conference room, shakes the 
           unmelted snow from his shoulders and hat.

                                 ALAN
                        How we doing, boys?

                                 CRAIG
                        Outstanding, Alan. We have the new 
                        budgets based on the changes, plus 
                        Will personally drafted the latest -

           Alan raises a hand, stops him.

                                 ALAN
                        Not that kind of meeting.

           Alan calmly hangs up his coat, then sits, leaning forward 
           with eyes on Will. A beat before: 

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                             (pointing at Will)
                        Your new design. The one you had sent 
                        to my home yesterday.

                                 CRAIG
                             (holding up his hand)
                        Wait...what?
                             (turning to Will; 
                              accusing)
                        Why didn’t I know about this?

           Now Alan holds up his hand, retaking control.

                                 ALAN
                        Hold on, Craig. This design, Will, 
                        it’s...how do I say this right?...not 
                        your usual. I need to hear what you 
                        were thinking.

                                 CRAIG
                        Surely you won’t hold one set of 
                        designs against us, Alan, especially 
                        considering all of the good work 
                        we’ve done - 

                                 ALAN
                             (eyes still on Will; firm)
                        I’m talking to Will right now. Just 
                        Will.

           Craig sets his jaw. Two sets of eyes bearing down on Will 
           now. Will considers his words before speaking.
                                 WILL
                        Okay...
                             (then)
                        I guess I figured I’d give you 
                        another option.

                                 ALAN
                        Is that it?

           Alan and Will lock eyes. Alan knows that there’s more.

                                 WILL
                             (a glance at Craig before)
                        No, that’s not it... I was thinking 
                        that you didn’t show up at my door in 
                        Paris so that I could design 
                        something common...or safe. Since 
                        when has Alan Reynolds chosen the 
                        path more taken?
                             (to Craig)
                        And I was thinking that I didn’t 
                        choose to start my own architecture 
                        firm to design something common...or 
                        safe.

           Craig smiles nervously, condescendingly. This kind of passion 
           unsettling to a conservative man of business.

                                 CRAIG
                        Your passion is commendable, Will, 
                        but I’m sure Alan - 

                                 WILL
                             (interrupting; eyes on 
                              Alan)
                        You can feel the tides shifting, 
                        can’t you, Alan? The restlessness for 
                        something worth looking up to... 

           Will stands now, energized...

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Enough of the old! The ornamental 
                        stonework and the overbearing self 
                        importance...it’s done, it’s tired. 
                        Let’s use glass, let’s use light. I 
                        found a nickel chromium alloy they 
                        make in Germany called Nirosta...it’s 
                        spectacular, shines brighter than the 
                        sun. No other building in the world 
                        uses it, but we will. It’s time...
                             (turning to Craig now)
                        Let’s change things.
           Alan taps his chin, listening. But then a grin creeps 
           through.

                                 ALAN
                        Julius Caesar referred to something 
                        he called his moments of clarity. His 
                        vicis de expedio...
                             (then)
                        I recently had one.

           Alan pauses. Off the silence - 

                                 CRAIG
                        And...what was it?

                                 ALAN
                        You just heard it.
                             (standing)
                        Will, I couldn’t have said it better.

           Alan begins putting on his coat.

                                 WILL
                        So, what are you saying, Alan?

                                 ALAN
                        I’m saying, churn the cement! Order 
                        the steel and that nickel chromium 
                        stuff! It’s time to build, boys.

           Will can’t hold back his grin, silently savoring the moment 
           as Alan ties off his scarf. Alan moves toward the door, 
           fingers on the handle before looking back at Will.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                             (warm)
                        Always knew you’d get there...

           Alan leaves. As Will absorbs the news, Craig silently stands 
           and moves toward the door. He also turns back toward Will.

                                 CRAIG
                        Don’t ever send new plans to a client 
                        without telling me first, got it?

           Will’s eyes meet Craig’s. A side of his partner he hadn’t 
           seen before.  Craig leaves before Will can respond.

           INT. B TRAIN (MOVING) - LATER

           Will sits, shadows crossing his serene face as the train 
           shakes its way north. 
           INT. B TRAIN (MOVING) - LATER

           Will hasn’t moved.

                                 TRAIN OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Next stop, Atlantic Avenue!

           Will’s brain breaks from its trance at the sound of his stop. 
           He rises from his seat. The train slowing...

           CLOSE on Will’s face - something swirling, like a dream 
           that’s close to being remembered.

           The train stops, doors sliding open. As passengers move to 
           get off, Will lowers himself back into his seat.

           EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY, NEW YORK - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

           The sun’s rays slanting over the snow-covered farmland.  A 
           black passenger train cuts through the whiteness. It 
           continues on, away from us, disappearing in the blinding gold 
           of the late afternoon sun...

           EXT. OSSINING, NEW YORK COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Still carrying his briefcase, his collar turned up against 
           the biting cold, Will walks down the center of a long, 
           unpaved road. Snow falling gently, his STEPS the only 
           sound... 

           REVERSE on Will’s destination: Sing Sing State Penitentiary. 
           From this angle, a forbidding fortress of grey stone, 
           bordered by two rows of high fencing.

           A moment later, Will walks INTO FRAME, continuing toward the 
           grey walls, past the stoic SIGN for the prison.

           INT. SING SING STATE PRISON (VISITING ROOM) - DAY

           KA-THUMP! Steel slamming against steel. Will shifts his 
           weight in a government-issue metal chair, his hands resting 
           on his lap. Surrounded by drab green cinder-block walls.

           Another KA-THUMP! And a moment later, Will hears a door open 
           behind him. He rises to his feet, turns to see a GUARD 
           holding the arm of TERRY VAN ALEN (upper 30’s). Behind the 
           tired eyes and thinning hair, there’s an unmistakable 
           kindness. He wipes his hand down his mouth, exhales slowly as 
           he sees his baby brother. 

           Terry turns his face toward the guard.
                                 TERRY
                        You mind, Bob? It’s my kid brother.

           Bob considers it, gives a quick nod, lets go of Terry’s arm.

           Terry steps toward Will, stopping in front of him to take a 
           close look. 

                                 WILL
                        You look good, Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        You look like hell, little man.

           Will lets out a cathartic burst of laughter. A beat, and then 
           the two brothers embrace each other. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           MINUTES LATER --

           The two of them sit, facing each other. The tension gone.

                                 TERRY
                             (casual; lighting a 
                              cigarette)
                        Second visit in five months. I’m 
                        gonna start thinkin’ you care.

                                 WILL
                        Honestly?

                                 TERRY
                        You don’t remember? You were here in 
                        August.

                                 WILL
                        I meant, are you honestly sticking it 
                        to me already? I just got here.

                                 TERRY
                        Relax, will ya? I was just teasing 
                        ya. Honestly...

                                 WILL
                        Sorry. I’m sure I’m just tired from 
                        the trip...

           Terry casually waves it off, lights a cigarette.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        You look thin. Are you eating enough?

           Terry smirks.
                                 TERRY
                        I get your letters, so I know you’re 
                        a busy boy, Will. How about you tell 
                        me why you’re here. 

           Will meets his eyes, unsure whether to share his good news...

                                 WILL
                        We’re starting construction. On the 
                        hotel.

                                 TERRY
                             (blows out smoke, then)
                        Oh, yeah? Good for you, kiddo.

                                 WILL
                             (can’t hold back)
                        It’s actually happening. Six years 
                        I’ve been waiting for this, but to 
                        finally hear it...

           An extended beat. Terry just grins back, not offering much. 
           Terry snuffs out his smoke with his shoe.

                                 TERRY
                        You’re happy, that’s good.
                             (standing)
                        C’mon, you want to take a walk? I 
                        only get an hour to breathe real air 
                        and I don’t want to miss it.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - MINUTES LATER

           Surrounded by other drab-colored prisoners huddled in small 
           groups, Terry and Will walk the perimeter of the wall. 

                                 WILL
                        You don’t belong here, Terry.

                                 TERRY
                        Is that right?
                             (calling to a nearby 
                              guard)
                        Hey, Gus! My brother said I shouldn’t 
                        be here. Alright with you if I leave?

           Stone-faced Gus doesn’t respond.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think Gus’s alright with it.
                                 WILL
                        You were an eighteen year old kid. 
                        And if you hadn’t done it, I would 
                        have gotten around to it. 

           They come to an opening in the wall, blocked only by wired 
           fencing. New York City faintly visible down the Hudson River, 
           in the distance...

                                 TERRY
                        You see that?

           Will follows Terry’s gaze.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                             (eyes fixated on the 
                              distance)
                        Every day I march out here, do my 
                        little walk around the yard, just 
                        like we’re doin’ now. And every day, 
                        I stop here and imagine all you’re 
                        workin’ on down there.
                             (turning toward Will)
                        Maybe it’s stupid, but it’s good 
                        enough, Will. 
                             (beat)
                        Build your building. I’ll know it’s 
                        there. And that’ll be enough...

           Will looks away, shakes his head.

                                 WILL
                        It’s not good enough. 
                             (grabbing Terry’s arm; a 
                              beat)
                        But I have been looking into getting 
                        you a new lawyer...

           They lock eyes. Terry doesn’t have the strength to buy into 
           Will’s passion.

                                 TERRY
                        So, listen, break time’s almost up, 
                        and I still need to collect on some 
                        smokes a few of these bums owe me.

           Terry pats Will on the face.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming up, kiddo. Let me 
                        know when you finish that fancy hotel 
                        of yours.
           One last look into Will’s eyes, and then Terry walks off 
           toward another group of prisoners across the yard. Off 
           Will...

           INT. TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY

           Will rests his head against the window, watching the 
           landscape race by as he heads home. The muted orange of dusk 
           lighting his face. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. GRACIE MANSION - LATER

           A magnificent black tie party. Glittering lights and VIPs 
           fill the mayor’s mansion. Alan stands just inside the entry.

                                 ALAN
                        Mr. Mayor, allow me to introduce the 
                        men behind my architecture firm, Mr. 
                        Craig Severance and Mr. William Van 
                        Alen.

           They each exchange quick handshakes with MAYOR JOHN HYLAN, a 
           short mustachioed man. A miniature Teddy Roosevelt. 

                                 MAYOR HYLAN
                        Pleasure, gentleman. All of us are 
                        very excited about this.

                                 ALAN
                        Not publicly, I hope.

           The mayor pats Alan on the back. Country club LAUGHS all 
           around...

                                 MAYOR HYLAN
                        Oh, we know better than to steal your 
                        thunder with the newspapers, Alan. 
                        Haven’t told a soul.
                             (to Craig and Will)
                        Enjoy yourselves, boys. Have a drink.

           EXT. GRACIE MANSION - LATER

           Craig and Will stand on the back patio, each holding a high 
           ball. Taking in the crowd, sipping their drinks...anything to 
           avoid each other’s eyes.

                                 CRAIG
                        So, everything is good?
                                 WILL
                        Sure. Alan seems happy.

                                 CRAIG
                        I mean with you and me...the 
                        partnership. Things have been sort of 
                        icy lately, I know you’ve noticed.

           Will taps his glass against Craig’s.

                                 WILL
                        Ice under the bridge, partner.

           Craig likes this, his mood lightening. He pats Will hard on 
           the shoulder. Alan saunters up, still surveying the scene.

                                 ALAN
                        Almost time to let the world know 
                        what we’re up to, boys. I counted at 
                        least eleven newspaper reporters 
                        milling around.

                                 WILL
                        How can you tell?

                                 ALAN
                        They’re vermin. I can smell ‘em.

           Alan’s eyes drift toward the front entrance. His face 
           brightens.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        ‘Scuse me, boys. Someone I need to 
                        welcome.

           Alan heads off. Craig and Will each swivel their heads, 
           trying to spot the subject of Alan’s attention.

           WILL’S POV - It’s Meg Bagley, the photographer, handing her 
           shawl to a valet, revealing a stunning black dress 
           underneath. 

           ON WILL. A curious grin crossing his lips.

                                 CRAIG (O.C.)
                        We should move tomorrow’s two o’clock 
                        meeting to three since we have -

                                 WILL
                             (already walking off; 
                              transfixed)
                        Excuse me...

           He heads toward Meg, observing her as he approaches. 
           WILL’S POV: Her bright laughter, the gentle way she tucks a 
           loose piece of her hair behind an ear. In mid-laugh, she 
           glances over toward Will, meeting his eyes for just a beat 
           before she’s joined from behind by her date, JONATHAN 
           PREWSTER (upper 30’s). Jonathan’s movements are awkward, as 
           stiff as his half smile.

           At the sight of Jonathan’s arm wrapping around Meg’s back, 
           Will stops short. But it’s too late, Alan notices him.

                                 ALAN
                        Ah, Will! Wonderful! Look who’s here! 

           As Will takes his final steps toward them, he and Meg 
           exchange a lingering grin before Jonathan thrusts his hand 
           toward Will.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Hello. Jonathan Prewster. I’m a 
                        professor of archaeology. Columbia.

                                 WILL
                        Um...hi. Columbia, really? Never been 
                        to South America, but I hear it’s 
                        lovely.

                                 JONATHAN
                             (missing it)
                        The university, of course.

                                 WILL
                        Of course.

           Craig wanders up, joining the group. 

                                 ALAN
                        Hey, the gang’s all here! Craig 
                        Severance, meet Margaret Bagley and 
                        her date, Mr. Jonathan Prew -

                                 JONATHAN
                        Doctor Prewster. Actually.

           A beat as Alan recovers from the interruption.

                                 ALAN
                        Right, well Margaret here is joining 
                        our elite little team. Was 
                        recommended by Will, apparently very 
                        talented.

                                 CRAIG
                        You don’t say. 
                             (to Meg; cool)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CRAIG (CONT'D)
                        And what is your apparent talent, 
                        Miss Bagley?

                                 MEG
                        Alan hired me to photograph the 
                        construction of his hotel.

                                 CRAIG
                             (to Alan)
                        A photographer. I don’t recall the 
                        budget being so...flexible.

                                 MEG
                        Really...Mr. Severance, I’d think a 
                        man of your reputed business acumen 
                        would be eager to have someone 
                        tracking the construction of the 
                        hotel...
                             (winking at Alan)
                        Hard for Alan here to miss a payment 
                        when you can show proof of your 
                        deliverables on film, don’t you 
                        agree?

           A short, silent standoff between Meg and Craig. Craig grins 
           at her condescendingly.

                                 ALAN
                             (re: Meg)
                        I like this one! She’s got moxie! I 
                        knew you wouldn’t recommend some 
                        invertebrate, Will. Well done...
                             (then, spotting Prewster)
                        Dr. Prewster, have you heard about 
                        Will’s design for the building?

                                 JONATHAN
                        Um, no, I don’t - 

                                 ALAN
                        Well, it’s genius. And that’s not a 
                        word I toss around lightly. Pure 
                        genius.

           Will stares at his shoes, somewhat embarrassed by the praise. 
           When he looks up, he notices Meg’s eyes on him. Alan spots 
           someone across the room.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Now, if you’ll all excuse me, I do 
                        believe I’ve spotted some fresh 
                        vermin, so please eat and drink to 
                        your heart’s delight. For once, it’s 
                        not on me...
           Alan heads off, all of them watching him go. The odd group of 
           Will, Craig, Meg, and Jonathan are left behind. After an 
           extended beat of uncomfortable silence - 

                                 JONATHAN
                        So I guess we’ll just - 

                                 CRAIG
                             (already moving)
                        Yes, great, and I’m sure I need to go 
                        catch up with...somebody. 

           Jonathan leads Meg away as Craig moves off in a different 
           direction. Will is left alone in the crowded room.

           EXT. GRACIE MANSION (HALLWAY) - LATER

           The door to the women’s powder room opens, Meg appearing. As 
           she turns, she spots Will. He’s in his own world, staring up 
           at the hallway ceiling, knocking on walls randomly. Meg 
           watches him for a few moments.

                                 MEG
                        Are you really going to make me ask?

                                 WILL
                        I’m trying to get up to the roof.

                                 MEG
                        Have you considered the stairs?

                                 WILL
                        C’mon, Miss Bagley, I know you’re 
                        more adventurous than that.
                             (glances at her)
                        Or, maybe you’re not. Which is fine.

                                 MEG
                        Or maybe I am! What are we looking 
                        for, Mr. Van Alen?

                                 WILL
                             (knocks on a wall, then)
                        This place was built in 1799, so I’m 
                        betting a secret stairwell was added 
                        during the civil war. 

                                 MEG
                        So, you’re just going to walk around 
                        knocking on walls like a mad person?

                                 WILL
                        If you’re embarrassed, there’s plenty 
                        of cocktail chatter waiting for you.
           Meg considers this. After a beat, she turns and knocks on a 
           wall, her ear pressed to it.

                                 MEG
                        How will I know when - 

                                 WILL
                             (looking up)
                        Thar she blows...

           ANGLE ON THE CEILING in the hall - we see it. It’s faint, but 
           clearly a rectangular slit cut into the plaster.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        We’re gonna need a chair.

           EXT. GRACIE MANSION (ROOF) - MINUTES LATER

           Will and Meg step carefully around the slightly sloped roof 
           of the Mayor’s mansion, their surroundings lit only by a 
           single candle in Will’s hand. 

           The muted mixture of party CHATTER and a STRING QUARTETTE 
           from below hangs in the spring air.

                                 WILL
                        So, do you want to see what really 
                        drives an architect?

           Meg turns slightly, checking over her shoulder.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll have you back to 
                        the Columbian doctor in a jif.

                                 MEG
                        Okay...I’m game. Make me an 
                        architecture expert in five minutes 
                        or less.

                                 WILL
                        No, not architecture. Architects.
                             (then)
                        There’s a tremendous difference. 
                        Architecture is pure. Architects are 
                        vile egomaniacs.

                                 MEG
                        Present company excluded?

                                 WILL
                        Oh no, present company very much 
                        included. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WILL (CONT'D)
                        You’re talking to someone who’s 
                        designing a luxury hotel which I’m 
                        sure will change the look of this 
                        city forever. My ego is very clearly 
                        steering the ship.

           Meg has reached the peak of the roof. She leans back against 
           one of the chimneys.

                                 MEG
                        Or perhaps you design buildings 
                        because you actually enjoy it?

           Will considers this, meets her eyes for a beat.

                                 WILL
                        Perhaps.

           He holds up his candle, begins to scan the highest bricks on 
           the chimney.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        This mansion was designed by a John 
                        McComb. And if he’s like almost every 
                        other architect I’ve ever known or 
                        studied, then he carved his initials 
                        at the highest point on the 
                        structure.

                                 MEG
                        You’re not serious.

           Will nods apologetically. He’s serious.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Okay then, I guess we’re looking for 
                        a J and an M...

           She begins to search as well. Will looks across the roof, 
           toward the other chimney.

                                 WILL
                        I’m thinking the other one may be 
                        higher.

           They start to cross the roof toward the other chimney.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Think about it. Hundreds of people 
                        are involved in putting up a 
                        building. But the architect’s ego 
                        demands that his initials alone be at 
                        the highest point, immortality etched 
                        into his creation forever. Not 
                        exactly a healthy perspective.
                                 MEG
                        I guess that could be considered a 
                        tad self-centered.

           Will stands on his toes, scanning the bricks again. Meg 
           restarts her search as well.

                                 WILL
                        What your friend does...Jonathan, was 
                        it?
                             (off Meg)
                        It’s really no better. Reducing all 
                        of the desires and hopes and fears of 
                        entire civilizations to a few clay 
                        pots on display at a museum. Seems 
                        rather condescending I think.

                                 MEG
                        You don’t find a certain romance in 
                        re-discovering what came before us? 
                        Imagining the lives we might have 
                        lived were it not for a bit of lucky 
                        cosmic timing? 

                                 WILL
                        I find it depressing.

           Meg smiles at his honesty.

                                 MEG
                        And what is that you find exciting, 
                        Mr. Van Alen?

           A beat.

                                 WILL
                        Imagining the future and then 
                        creating it. Filling in the blanks.

           When Will glances over at her, she’s watching him.

                                 MEG
                        Filling in the blanks. I like that.

           Will and Meg each let their eyes linger on the other, before 
           each looking away. Back to searching the bricks. A few 
           moments pass before - 

                                 WILL
                        Ah, here we go... Have a look.

                                 MEG
                        No! You found it?
           Will nods, holding his light up to one of the top bricks. And 
           there, lit in the flickering glow, is a very clear “JM”.

           Meg giggles, proud of their find, enjoying the moment. Will 
           watches her, smiles.   

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

           Warm morning light reflecting on the Hudson. The soft 
           announcement of today’s potential...

           EXT. CORNER OF 42ND STREET & LEXINGTON AVE. (NYC) - DAY

           Craig and Will stand at the edge of the gaping crater. 
           Looking down to see scores of DEMOLITION MEN, clearing the 
           hole of debris. Prying boulders from earth’s mantle, removing 
           truckloads of dirt. It’s still a hole, but it’s becoming an 
           orderly hole.

                                 WILL
                             (sotto)
                        I can’t believe it’s happening.

                                 CRAIG
                        Do you realize what our fees are 
                        going to be for this?

           Will looks at him.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Enough to ensure our future for a 
                        very long time.

           Craig smiles big, CLAPS his hands together. Will forces a 
           grin, then scans the work site as if trying to find 
           something.

                                 WILL
                        Where’s Alan? Odd he wouldn’t be here 
                        on the first day, don’t you think?

           Craig shrugs, he couldn’t care less. Will looks back down to 
           the depths. From behind him:

                                 MAN (O.C.)
                        ‘Scuse me?

           Will and Craig both turn to see two MEN (40’s) standing 
           there. Each of them with the worn hands and faces of 
           laborers. 
                                 LABORER #1
                        You know who we could talk to ‘bout 
                        gettin’ some work?

                                 CRAIG
                        Sorry, gentlemen. We’ve got 
                        everything we need.

           Craig turns back to the hole, already done with them.

                                 WILL
                        You boys having trouble finding work?

                                 LABORER #2
                        Job we were on shut down early. 
                        Nobody else hiring at the moment.

                                 LABORER #1
                        Foreman said the owner lost his 
                        money, said the stock market 
                        was...how’d he say it?

                                 LABORER #2
                        Taking a shit.

                                 LABORER #1
                        Yeah, that.

           Will grins. He likes these men. 

                                 LABORER #2
                        Appreciate your time anyway...

           Will nods before the two men turn, begin to walk off. Will 
           continues to watch them.

           EXT. WEST 73RD STREET BROWNSTONE - LATER

           Will stands at the front door of a gorgeous, four-story 
           brownstone, KNOCKING. No answer. He steps back, spotting an 
           open window one story up.

                                 WILL
                        Alan!

           Still no response. He steps back to the door and jiggles the 
           knob. To Will’s surprise, the door opens easily.

           INT. WEST 73RD STREET BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

           Will steps into the tiled foyer of the home, finds himself 
           facing a wide, steep mahogany staircase.
                                 WILL
                        Alan! Hello? It’s Will! 

           He begins to climb the stairs, unsure now...

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        The door was open!
                             (a few more steps)
                        You here, Alan?!

           INT. THE 2ND FLOOR PARLOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Will turns the corner to find himself in a large, ornately 
           decorated room. The large picture windows are open, curtains 
           fluttering in the breeze. Puccini’s La bohème PLAYS loudly on 
           a Victrola...

           And in the middle of the room is Alan: wearing a white, silk 
           kimono, holding a long sword aloft as he performs a slow, 
           meditative kata. 

           ON WILL - confused/engrossed as he watches the scene.

                                 WILL
                        Alan? 
                             (then)
                        You sent for me...?

           Alan doesn’t respond. Will steps cautiously into the room.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Everything alright, Alan?

           Again, Alan doesn’t respond. Will stops, not sure what to do.

           After a few final kata movements, Alan stops. He turns toward 
           Will.

                                 ALAN
                        Sorry about that. A kata’s sorta like 
                        intercourse. Feels just awful to stop 
                        before the task is completed.
                             (remembering; a beat)
                        Here...

           Alan tosses the sword to Will. It’s a gentle lob, but still a 
           reckless move. Will manages to catch it without cutting 
           himself.

                                 ALAN (CONT’D)
                        Real samurai sword from Honshu. Late 
                        twelfth century.
           Will runs his hand along the sword’s curve, hands it back 
           gently.

                                 WILL
                        It’s beautiful. 

                                 ALAN
                             (holding it out)
                        And now it’s yours.

                                 WILL
                        What? Why...?

                                 ALAN
                        Because it’s just a thing, Will. The 
                        kind of thing that’s kept me enslaved 
                        to the Rockefellers or the 
                        Vanderbilts or the rat-infested banks 
                        for far too long.
                             (placing the sword in 
                              Will’s hands)
                        So, please, accept it as a favor to 
                        me.

           Will takes the sword, watching Alan closely, seeing his 
           instability.

                                 WILL
                        What’s going on, Alan? You didn’t ask 
                        me here to shower me with gifts.

                                 ALAN
                        I’ve always admired you. Respected 
                        you.
                             (off Will, waiting for 
                              more)
                        You’re here because you deserve to 
                        hear from me what you’d probably hear 
                        from someone else soon enough.

           Will freezes, watching Alan’s face. Praying for a punchline 
           that doesn’t come.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t say any more, please...

                                 ALAN
                        My life is controlled by the same 
                        wretched institutions that control 
                        the stock market, Will. When they 
                        bring down the exchange, they bring 
                        me down with it.

                                 WILL
                        And the hotel?
                                 ALAN
                        Something we referred to in the Great 
                        War as collateral damage. An innocent 
                        victim in all of this...
                             (off Will’s fallen face)
                        Same as you.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. OFFICES OF SEVERANCE & VAN ALEN (BOARD ROOM) - DAY

           CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly...

           Silent beams of morning sunlight cutting through the empty 
           board room...

           CONTINUE MOVING BACK...

           INT. THE DRAFTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...through the drafting room, normally the epicenter of 
           energy and action, but today...empty. 

           Abandoned desks, abandoned chairs, a few scattered boxes. The 
           silent aftermath... CAMERA STOPS by the main entrance - we 
           can see the entire office space now.

           From opposite sides, Will and Craig both walk INTO FRAME, 
           meeting each other in the middle. 

           Will extends his hand. 

                                 WILL
                        It’s been a great ride, Craig.

           Craig doesn’t take Will’s hand.

                                 CRAIG
                        Have to turn the keys in, so make 
                        sure you don’t leave anything behind.

           Will lowers his hand. So this is how it has to go...

                                 WILL
                        I’m all set.
                             (removing a gold pen from 
                              his breast pocket)
                        Found Alan’s pen in my office though, 
                        so I’m going to run it by his place.

                                 CRAIG
                        I’ll save you the trip since 
                        obviously you haven’t heard.

                                 CRAIG (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        Alan’s dead. 

           The words hang in the air. Will stares back in disbelief.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                             (casual)
                        Yep. Jumped. Climbed to his roof and 
                        jumped. Unsavory way to go out, if 
                        you ask me. Even for Alan...
                             (as Will takes in the 
                              news; a beat)
                        The stock market claims another 
                        victim. Guess you just inherited a 
                        pen.

                                 WILL
                        How could he...? I just saw him. He 
                        seemed a bit off maybe, but still...

           Craig shakes his head, grins condescendingly.

                                 CRAIG
                        I should have realized this would be 
                        hard on you. 

           Craig sits on the edge of a desk.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        If I’m being honest with myself, I 
                        really do owe you an apology, Will. I 
                        tried to show you how things work, 
                        mentor you even, but I think, 
                        sometimes, certain people are just 
                        unteachable. Even now, I look at you, 
                        all emotionally bruised and sad for 
                        your friend, and I realize, you 
                        clearly weren’t ready for this. Any 
                        of it.
                             (beat)
                        I guess I just have myself to blame. 
                        You’re somewhat talented, certainly 
                        not unintelligent, but again, if I’m 
                        being honest, you’re essentially an 
                        average chap who I threw into an 
                        extraordinary situation. And I feel 
                        bad about that.

                                 WILL
                        You should feel bad about being an 
                        asshole, Craig.
                                 CRAIG
                             (smiles, then)
                        Whoa, you’re misunderstanding me, 
                        Will! Part of me envies you! You’ll 
                        go on to design some nice 
                        storefronts, maybe a lovely 
                        children’s museum or something like 
                        that...and you’ll be happy. That’s 
                        really where I went wrong - 
                        forgetting that some people are 
                        happier and better off in more, 
                        what’s the word...realistic settings.

           Will smirks, shaking his head.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Look...I’m trying to apologize here.
                             (off Will’s silence)
                        Anyway...

           Craig reaches into his bag and removes a document. He hands 
           it to Will.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        This officially dissolves the 
                        partnership. Have your lawyers review 
                        it, then sign and mail a copy to 
                        mine.

           Sickened by Craig’s coldness, Will drops the document onto a 
           table, and with Alan’s pen, signs it quickly. He tosses it 
           roughly back. 

           Craig catches it and returns it to his bag.

                                 CRAIG (CONT’D)
                        Okay. So that’s that...

           And with one last insincere grin for Will, Craig walks out.

           ON WILL standing completely alone in the large office...

           EXT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE (BROOKLYN, NY) - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A row of second tier townhouses, their chipped paint facades 
           set back a few feet from the sidewalk.

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 

           The inside is as unimpressive and unoriginal as the outside. 
           Unwashed clothes spread around, unwashed dishes in the sink. 
           Other than a photo of the Eiffel Tower, the walls are bare. 
           Standing in the kitchen, Will checks his icebox. Empty. He 
           opens a cupboard. A single bruised apple.

           Will moves to a window, pulls a curtain to the side to peer 
           out...

           WILL’S POV - Across the street, a line of people waiting...

           Will lets the curtain fall closed, mulls his situation.

           EXT. AVENUE M (BROOKLYN, NY) - MINUTES LATER

           Will crosses the wide avenue, takes his place at the end of 
           the long line he glimpsed minutes earlier.

           Just ahead of him, a tall bear of a man (TED, 40’s) turns his 
           head slightly...

                                 TED
                        Thanks, buddy.

           When nothing more comes, Will leans forward - 

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry?

                                 TED
                        I’m not last anymore. Feels a little 
                        better, you know?

                                 WILL
                        Happy to help...

           An extended beat as Will stares straight ahead into Ted’s 
           shoulder blades. Not moving. Finally, Will taps Ted on the 
           arm.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Has the truck done the drop off yet?

                                 TED
                             (without turning)
                        Nope. Should be here soon though.

           After a long beat, Ted turns toward Will, extending his hand.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I’m Ted.

                                 WILL
                             (shaking Ted’s hand)
                        Will.
                                 TED
                        You look like a smart fella. I can 
                        tell with people. 
                             (analyzes Will’s face)
                        I’m gonna say...doctor...no, 
                        accountant...

                                 WILL
                        Sorry. Just an architect.

                                 TED
                        Is that right? You probably know a 
                        bunch of the metal monkeys I see here 
                        every day.

                                 WILL
                        Metal monkey...

                                 TED
                        You know, metal...steel. Most of us 
                        been working sites together for 
                        years. These days I’d honestly work 
                        for pennies, just to have a rivet gun 
                        or a welding torch in my hand again. 
                        Shit, I think we all would...

           Will nods, listening closely.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        But hey, you gotta keep your chin up, 
                        right? Something good’s always just 
                        around the corner.

           Ted smacks Will on the shoulder. Will smiles, genuinely likes 
           this guy. As he does, another man steps into line behind 
           Will.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        See? Things are already looking up. 
                        You’re not last anymore.

           INT. BROWN & BASTINGS ARCHITECTS (WAITING ROOM) - DAY

           Will sits in the cramped waiting area. Every other chair 
           filled with young men, most of them in their low 20’s.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Van Alen, you can go ahead in.

           Will jumps up, smooths his tie.
           INT. BROWN & BASTINGS ARCHITECTS (OFFICE) - MINUTES LATER

           Will sits across from JERRY BASTINGS (50), one of the top 
           honchos at Brown & Bastings. Bastings reads from a sheet of 
           paper.

                                 BASTINGS
                        A bit overqualified, aren’t you?

                                 WILL
                        I’d welcome the chance to bring my 
                        design experience here, Mr. Bastings.

                                 BASTINGS
                        You understand this is for an intern 
                        position...
                             (off Will)
                        An unpaid intern position.

                                 WILL
                        Right. Well, I was hoping you might 
                        reconsider given the experience I - 

                                 BASTINGS
                        Let me stop you right there. The 
                        position is unpaid because we can’t 
                        pay. Do you not read the papers? 
                        People are standing in food lines for 
                        chrissakes...

                                 WILL
                        So I’ve heard.

           EXT. SIDEWALK (OUTSIDE BROWN & BASTINGS) - LATER

           Will exits the building, unsure which direction to walk since 
           there’s no place he needs to be.

                                 HARRY (O.S.)
                        Will!

           Will turns his head. Harry walking toward him...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Where’ve you been? I went by your 
                        place.

                                 WILL
                        Why did you - ?

           Harry glances up at the building Will just emerged from.
                                 HARRY
                        Brown and Bastings? The lowest of the 
                        low. C’mon, let’s get you out of 
                        here, I’ve something you might be 
                        interested in...

           INT. TANNING PENTHOUSE - LATER

           Harry leads Will into his parents’ beautifully decorated 
           penthouse. High ceilings, expensive furniture...

                                 HARRY
                        Parents are away, so make yourself 
                        comfortable.

                                 WILL
                        Are you living here?

                                 HARRY
                        God, no. But I’m also too soft to 
                        rough it, as they say. So, when they 
                        travel, I come here to forget my lack 
                        of funds.

                                 WILL
                        I feel terrible about that, Harry. 
                        But without Alan’s hotel project, the 
                        firm just couldn’t stay afloat.

           Harry begins pouring two scotches from the bar.

                                 HARRY
                        Exceptional segue, old friend. 
                        Exactly what I wanted to talk about. 
                        Come, sit.

           Harry takes a seat on the plush sofa, looking very much at 
           home. Will sits across from him, cradling his drink.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Turns out, dearly departed Alan sold 
                        the land for his hotel to Walter 
                        Chrysler right before he, 
                        well,...departed.

           Will looks at Harry, who just nods.

                                 WILL
                        And how do you know this?

                                 HARRY
                        Chrysler employs a lot of lawyers. 
                        One of those lawyers likes to drink 
                        scotch with my father.
           Will’s face shows a tiny spark of hope, but it dies away 
           quickly.

                                 WILL
                        Doesn’t matter. Man like Chrysler 
                        probably bought the land as an 
                        investment. He’ll just sit on it for 
                        ten years.

                                 HARRY
                        Possibly. Or...perhaps he’s currently 
                        reviewing design options for the new 
                        Chrysler company headquarters and 
                        wants to break ground within sixty 
                        days.
                             (takes a sip; grins)
                        Scotch has a way of making men 
                        blabber.

           Will stands, suddenly energized. He walks to the large 
           picture window.

                                 WILL
                        So, you think I should...?

                                 HARRY
                             (reclining back)
                        Hotel...office building for a large, 
                        multi-national corporation...what’s 
                        the difference? Your design is 
                        groundbreaking, Will. Knock down a 
                        few walls, take out the beds and put 
                        in desks. You’re as good as done...

           Will takes a sip, his face contorting at the strong taste. 
           After a moment of consideration...

                                 WILL
                             (grins; still looking out 
                              the window)
                        Okay. I’m going to do it.

                                 HARRY
                             (standing)
                        Fantastic! But with one correction. 
                        We’re going to do it. Tanning and Van 
                        Alen will rise like a phoenix, my 
                        amigo.

           Will studies Harry’s face. He’s serious.

                                 WILL
                             (grins)
                        Van Alen and Tanning.
           Harry laughs. They shake hands.

                                 HARRY
                        There’s my tiger.

           Harry walks back to the bar. When he reaches it, he turns 
           back to Will.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and did I mention that the 
                        deadline to submit designs is 
                        tomorrow?

           Off Will...

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE (BEDROOM) - NIGHT

           Will sits at his inclined desk, working by candle light with 
           intense focus. Erasing, drawing, flipping his T-square...

           And then...Will’s candle light goes dim. The candle burnt low 
           enough to be a flat, amorphous blob.

                                 WILL
                        No, no, no...

           And with that, the tiny blue flame gives a final 
           flicker...and goes dark.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BUSY STREET - LATER

           The roads mostly deserted at this late hour. A single car 
           drives by.

           Will sits cross-legged under a single street light, his 
           blueprints on his lap, working with the same focus and speed. 
           After a beat, another car drives by - it’s tail breeze 
           blowing one of Will’s papers into the street, forcing Will to 
           chase after it.

           EXT. CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS (NEW JERSEY) - DAY

           A turn-of-the-century brick factory. Utilitarian in every 
           aspect. Completely forgettable.

           Harry stands fifty yards away, hands in his pockets, pacing 
           with nervous energy. Watching the front doors...

           HARRY’S POV - Will emerges, walking toward him, empty handed. 
           As Will reaches him - 

                                 HARRY
                        That was quick. What’d Chrysler say?

                                 WILL
                        Not a thing. Chrysler wasn’t even 
                        there.

           Harry falls in step with Will...

                                 HARRY
                        But they took the plans?

                                 WILL
                        They took the plans.

                                 HARRY
                        So now what?

                                 WILL
                        I guess now we go home and we wait...
                             (waving his hand)
                        Taxi!

           The TAXI pulls over, Will and Harry each opening their doors. 
           Looking over the roof at each other - 

                                 HARRY
                             (smiling)
                        I feel good about this.

                                 WILL
                        You know...I think I do too.

           INT. WAREHOUSE LOFT (DOWNTOWN, NYC) - DAY

           The warehouse walls are all brick, the ceiling laced with 
           exposed beams and pipes. Will moves through it, industrial 
           tarps hanging from the pipes blocking the source of the 
           VOICES we hear echoing ahead of us.

           A bright FLASH of white lights up the walls around Will, a 
           loud CRASH of glass immediately following...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Okay, let’s try it now with the girls 
                        up front.

           Will pushes past his final hanging tarp, spots Meg up ahead.

           Meg has her camera mounted on a tripod, pointed at an 
           uncomfortably stiff, unsmiling FAMILY of four (mother, 
           father, twin girls). She spots Will moving toward her - 
                                 MEG
                        Will? 

                                 WILL
                        I know you’re working, but I can 
                        wait. Promise I won’t be any trouble.

           Will looks over at the waiting family. Mother and Father are 
           not amused by the interruption, but Will gives a little wave 
           to the twin girls, who each timidly wave back.

                                 MEG
                             (nervously glancing toward 
                              the family)
                        I guess that’s fine. But why are you 
                        here?

                                 WILL
                        Oh, I want to show you something. But 
                        please...go back to what you were 
                        doing. Pretend I’m not here.

           INT. WAREHOUSE LOFT (DOWNTOWN, NYC) - LATER

           Will sits on the floor of the loft, behind Meg, hidden behind 
           a newspaper he’s reading.

                                 MEG
                             (to the girls)
                        Please? Would you consider smiling 
                        for me?

           The young girls shake their heads in unison. The handsome 
           mother addresses the girls formally - 

                                 MOTHER
                        Do as I do, girls. A simple look of  
                        mild amusement will be fine. 

           The girls look back to Meg.

                                 MEG
                             (stepping behind her 
                              camera)
                        Okay, great, let’s give it a try. 
                        Nice smiles...or looks of mild 
                        amusement...on three. One, 
                        two...three!

           ON THE GIRLS as their barely perceptible grins immediately 
           fall away, revealing only miserable frowns.

           The camera bulb FLASHES. Meg exhales, ready to give up.
                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Maybe we can try something else-

           Meg is suddenly interrupted by the sound of little girl 
           LAUGHTER, the twins giggling uncontrollably. Meg looks at 
           them, shocked and confused. Meg follows their gazes...toward 
           Will.

           Still hidden behind the newspaper, Will has constructed a 
           silly origami frog and has it poking above the top of the 
           newspaper, its mouth moving.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Oh, okay...this is good...

           Meg quickly lines up her camera, aims it toward the family. 
           FLASH! She gets the shot.

           Meg turns her head, looking back at Will. They meet eyes and 
           she silently mouths “thank you”.

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

           Will and Meg stroll together along the walking path. Neither 
           of them speaking. 

                                 MEG
                        So? Where are you taking me?

           The two of them are approaching STANLEY (70’s), an older man 
           waiting for them on the path ahead. Will gives the man a 
           little wave.

                                 WILL
                        To meet Stanley, of course.

           Meg raises an eyebrow, completely confused. As they reach the 
           man, Will and Meg stop.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Meg, this is Stanley Keebler. An old 
                        family friend of mine.

                                 STANLEY
                        Old being the key word.

           Still confused, Meg goes along with it, shakes Stanley’s 
           hand.

                                 MEG
                        Pleasure to meet you. 
                                 STANLEY
                             (to Meg)
                        All the times he’s come here, he’s 
                        never brought anyone with him.

                                 MEG
                        Is that right...?

                                 WILL
                        Okay, okay...that’s enough talking, 
                        you two. We all set, Stan?

           Stanley unlocks a tall gate that blends into the wire fence 
           running along the walking path.

                                 STANLEY
                        Up you go now. Just watch your 
                        footing.

           Stanley winks at Meg as Will leads her through the gate.

                                 WILL
                             (to Meg)
                        If this is too much for you, we can 
                        just get coffee or something. 

           Meg knows she’s being manipulated, shakes her head with a 
           knowing grin.

                                 MEG
                        Onward, Mr. Van Alen...

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MINUTES LATER

           At the top of the bridge’s west tower, both of them take in 
           the panorama, Manhattan’s mini-skyline. Meg is awe-struck in 
           spite of herself.

                                 MEG
                        It’s stunning!

                                 WILL
                        It’s not the highest view in the 
                        city, but it is my favorite. I 
                        figured someone with an artist’s eye 
                        might appreciate it.

           Meg’s face is serene, silently appreciative. The golden sun 
           crossing her face...

                                 MEG
                        It really is breathtaking.
                                 WILL
                        I admit, I also wanted to make sure 
                        you met Stanley.

                                 MEG
                             (turning toward Will)
                        And why would you want that?

                                 WILL
                        Because I’ll need you to come back 
                        here at some point, possibly on your 
                        own.
                             (off Meg; a beat)
                        Alan’s building is going to happen, 
                        Meg. And I still want you to 
                        photograph every step along the way.

                                 MEG
                        But I thought when Alan died the 
                        hotel died with him.

                                 WILL
                        The hotel maybe, but not Alan’s dream 
                        of creating something...important. 
                             (beat)
                        We’ll be working for Walter Chrysler 
                        instead of Alan, and it’ll be an 
                        office building instead of a 
                        hotel...but we’re going to do 
                        something historic over there, Meg. 
                        And I want you to be part of it.

                                 MEG
                        That’s quite an offer.
                             (off Will’s smile; beat)
                        When did all of this happen?

                                 WILL
                        Well, it hasn’t yet. Not quite at 
                        least... 
                             (pointing)
                        But do you see the spot over there, 
                        just to the right of the Met Life 
                        Building? That’s where the Chrysler 
                        building is going up. And once it’s 
                        up, I want you to come back here and 
                        photograph it from this spot.

           Meg studies his face. His conviction...

                                 MEG
                        Alright, Mr. Van Alen, I accept. You 
                        have yourself a photographer.
           EXT. AVENUE M (BROOKLYN, NY) - DAY

           Sun setting over the long food line. Cradling his newly 
           acquired sack of food, patting a few of his new friends (Ted 
           among them) who are still waiting their turns as he passes in 
           the opposite direction. All of this, routine for Will now.

           STAY ON WILL as he crosses the street, moving toward his 
           townhouse.

           WILL’S POV - Up ahead, sitting on Will’s front stoop, is 
           Harry. Harry spots Will and stands.

                                 HARRY
                        I don’t suppose today’s goody bag 
                        included a nice porterhouse...

                                 WILL
                        Strangely, no.
                             (taking out his keys)
                        Skip lunch today?

           Harry falls in behind Will, following him into - 

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 HARRY
                        It’s just the damn stress. I’m always 
                        famished.

                                 WILL
                        I thought you were supposed to be the 
                        relaxed one.

           Will flips open his mailbox, pulls out a stack of letters. 
           Harry makes a move for them, but Will jerks them away too 
           quickly.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Let me put the food down first.

           As Will lowers the small sack onto a counter, Harry tries 
           again, this time snatching the mail from Will’s hand. Will 
           just rolls his eyes as Harry flips through the envelopes.

           Stopping on the last, Harry freezes. This is the one.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 HARRY
                        It’s from the Chrysler Corporation. I 
                        had a feeling today would be the day.
           Harry holds the letter gingerly, staring at it.

                                 WILL
                        Well, go ahead then!

           Harry holds the letter out for Will.

                                 HARRY
                        You...

           Will grabs it, starts to tear into it. After a beat, he stops 
           himself, looks at Harry.

                                 WILL
                        Question first.

                                 HARRY
                        Honestly?!
                             (off Will)
                        Fine. Just be quick about it.

                                 WILL
                        Why did you come looking for me?
                             (off Harry)
                        Once you’d learned about Alan selling 
                        his land to Chrysler, why would you 
                        bring it to me? You have to admit, 
                        things became kind of odd between us.

                                 HARRY
                        Ahh. This.
                             (pulling up a stool)
                        Figured we’d get around to it sooner 
                        or later.

                                 WILL
                        You could have taken that information 
                        to a hundred architects, to one who 
                        had something real to offer you. So 
                        why me?

                                 HARRY
                        You know me, I’m just lazy.

                                 WILL
                        Harry...

           Harry meets Will’s eyes. Sees that he’s serious. A beat 
           before -

                                 HARRY
                        Fine.
                             (taking a seat, then)
                        I’ve got this second cousin, name’s 
                        Daniel. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARRY (CONT'D)
                        He’s only eleven years old, but the 
                        little kid loves planes. Always been 
                        his thing. He’s never even been in 
                        one mind you, but still, just goes 
                        bananas for anything that flies. 
                             (beat)
                        Now, do you think a trained, 
                        professional pilot would ever risk 
                        his neck and take off in a real plane 
                        with Danny beside him as his co-
                        pilot? Or do you think he would do 
                        the obvious thing and send him off to 
                        play with the other kiddies?

           Will grins, already getting it.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t do the obvious thing, 
                        Will. You crawled into the cockpit 
                        with me, started the engine, and 
                        risked your neck with me beside you.

                                 WILL
                        I needed a sales pro and you were 
                        willing.

                                 HARRY
                        Oh, horse shit. I was a kid. And the 
                        only thing I was a pro at was riding 
                        your coattails. But I did develop a 
                        taste for flying...and now I’m ready 
                        to be a real co-pilot.

           A couple moments of unspoken understanding.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        So, open the damn letter, will ya?

           Will nods, then rips into the envelope, pulling out the 
           letter. His eyes immediately race over the typed words...

           C.U. ON THE LETTER - we don’t see it all, but we see enough: 
           “Reviewed your submission”...”Unfortunately”...”have selected 
           a different firm to design”...”Good luck”...

           Harry watches Will close his eyes in defeat. Without needing 
           details, Harry slowly rises from his stool and puts on his 
           jacket.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                             (forced enthusiasm)
                        Okay! The speakeasy on thirty-first 
                        street...you and I need to be 
                        there...now.
           Will trods darkly past Harry, patting him on the shoulder as 
           he moves toward the living room.

                                 WILL
                             (defeated)
                        You go ahead. We’ll talk later.

                                 HARRY
                        No, no. None of that. This isn’t the 
                        time to get down.

                                 WILL
                        This...is precisely the time to get 
                        down. The most incomparably ideal 
                        time to get down I could ever 
                        imagine, in fact.

           Will falls back onto his sofa.

                                 HARRY
                        Well, I’m still insisting that you 
                        follow me. We can be there in ten 
                        minutes.
                             (Will doesn’t respond)
                        Come on, where’s your coat? I can - 

                                 WILL
                             (interrupting; firm)
                        Harry! I don’t want to go with you, 
                        okay? 

           Harry absorbs the sting...turning and leaving quietly. 

           EXT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

           Meg checks a piece of paper in her hand, looking for an 
           address.

           EXT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Meg KNOCKS at the rickety wooden door. No response.

           She KNOCKS again. This time the door pushes open a few 
           inches. Unsure of whether to enter...but then she does.

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                                 MEG
                             (calling out)
                        Hello? Will?
                             (off the silence)
                        It’s Meg! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MEG (CONT'D)
                        I have some test photos I wanted to 
                        show -
                             (interrupted by the sound 
                              of WRETCHING)
                        - you.

           Meg raises her eyebrows in surprise. She steps cautiously 
           toward the door down the hall - the source of the sound.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Something you ate?

           Another chorus of vomiting. She spots a mostly empty bottle 
           of liquor on a kitchen counter.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                             (soft)
                        Or drank?

           Meg pushes on the door, pokes her head into the bathroom to 
           see Will lying awkwardly beside the toilet.

                                 WILL
                        I can’t even wallow in self pity 
                        properly.

                                 MEG
                        Actually, I’d say you’ve got it down 
                        quite well.

           INT. WILL’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Will sits at his kitchen table, his haggard face cradled on 
           his hand. Meg appears above him, places a cup of coffee in 
           front of him.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry I can’t hire you after all.

                                 MEG
                        Just drink. Slowly.

           Will nods his appreciation, takes a sip. Meg scans the 
           rejection letter, moves her gaze to Will.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        There’ll be something else. Maybe 
                        this wasn’t meant to be.

           Will stares off, deep in thought. Meg watches his face, 
           concerned, as she takes a seat across from him.
                                 WILL
                        You know my brother, Terry. I owe 
                        him...everything. Not that he’d see 
                        it that way. But when we were little, 
                        he protected me - did what he had to 
                        do to make sure I was safe. No matter 
                        the consequences...
                             (beat)
                        I wanted to show him that it wasn’t 
                        for nothing...

           She reaches out across the table, touching his hand. As he 
           notices, she catches herself, pulling back.

                                 MEG
                        What was it that Chrysler didn’t like 
                        about your design?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. Never met him...

                                 MEG
                             (beat; shocked)
                        What?

           Will shakes his head. 

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                             (picking up the rejection 
                              letter; beat)
                        Then it’s not over yet...

           Off Will...meeting her eyes.

           EXT. PRISON YARD (SING SING) - DAY

           Will and his brother Terry sit on the ground, their backs 
           leaning against the wire fence of the prison yard. They’re 
           playing a card game, taking turns tossing and picking up 
           cards...

                                 TERRY
                        She’s right you know. It is just a 
                        letter.

                                 WILL
                        So you think the CEO of one of the 
                        largest companies in the world should 
                        just happily drop everything to meet 
                        with some architect who thinks he 
                        deserves a second shot...

           Terry tosses a card, looks up to Will.
                                 TERRY
                        Sure, why not?

           Will shakes his head, smirks at the ridiculousness of it.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        So that’s it, huh? Waving the white 
                        flag?

           Will is about to toss a card, but stops - 

                                 WILL
                        I thought you agreed that we weren’t 
                        talking about this.

                                 TERRY
                             (holding up his hands)
                        Touchy, touchy. Throw your 
                        cards...you’re about to owe me a 
                        dollar.

           Will finishes his motion, tosses a card. A beat.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        It is too bad though. I finally 
                        coulda seen something you made.

                                 WILL
                        First off...how about we actually let 
                        it go... And second, you wouldn’t 
                        have been able to see it anyway.

                                 TERRY
                        What are you talking about? We have a 
                        clear shot to the city from here.

                                 WILL
                        You see that rectangular building 
                        there?
                             (pointing toward New York 
                              through the fence)
                        Would have blocked it.

           After a beat, Will looks up from his cards, eyes on Terry, 
           but his mind already someplace else. 

           His stare shifting to the distant skyline of New York...

                                 TERRY
                             (re: the card game)
                        You gonna go or what?

           But Will doesn’t move. His mind churning, fixated now...
                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Hellooo. Anybody home?

           Without taking his eyes off New York, Will calmly lays down 
           his cards.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Four aces? You’ve gotta be kidding 
                        me.

           Off Will...

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

           Will struggles beneath the weight of an overloaded box of 
           architecture text books. He unceremoniously dumps them onto 
           his bed.

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

           Sitting on the floor, his back against a wall. A thick 
           textbook open on his lap, others scattered around him. He 
           shuts his open book, tosses it with the others. Frustrated.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WILL’S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

           Will sits at his kitchen table, a clean sheet of white paper 
           before him. He lifts his fountain pen and he begins to write: 

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Dear Terry...Despite everything 
                        you’ve done for me already, I’m once 
                        again coming to you for help. I need 
                        to pull something from myself that 
                        I’m not even sure is there...

           EXT. ST. PAUL’S CHAPEL (NYC) - DAY

           Will walks along Broadway, stopping suddenly at the iron gate 
           of St. Paul’s chapel. Drawn in... 

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        My text books taught me formulas for 
                        optimum arch abutment ratios, but 
                        they said nothing of subtle beauty...

           WILL’S POV - Slowly following the gentle curves of the 
           buttresses that give flight to the chapel’s stone exterior... 
           A drop of water accelerating as it follows the downward 
           curve...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        ...or a structure’s delicate 
                        relationship with nature...

           INT. ST. PAUL’S CHAPEL (NYC) - LATER

           With a WEDDING underway in the b.g., Will stands at the back 
           of the nave, looking up.

           PAN OVER the lofty ceiling of the chapel, supported by simple 
           yet impressive columns...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        My teachers lectured about columnar 
                        load balancing and vertical stress 
                        supports...

           PAN OVER a towering, multi-paned storyboard of arched stained 
           glass, luminescent... 

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        But they said nothing about the sun’s 
                        powerful effect on a surface... 

           ON THE WEDDING DRESS of the new bride as she says her vows, 
           the fabric flickering with the blues and golds of the stained 
           glass...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Or on the lives of real people...

           ON WILL’S FACE - entranced by all of it.

           EXT. FERRY BOAT (MOVING) - DAY

           Despite the falling rain, Will stands at the bow. Passing 
           beneath Lady Liberty, Will watching her ignoring stare drift 
           by.

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        How do you take lifeless steel and 
                        transform it into something animated?

           ANGLE ON THE STATUE OF LIBERTY from below - the serpentine 
           peaks of her torch... The sharp triangular barbs shooting 
           from her arched crown...
           EXT. NEW JERSEY SUBURB - DAY

           Two young BOYS, probably brothers from the looks of them, 
           ride past Will on their bicycles. They dismount a few feet 
           from him before playfully running off. Will watches them, 
           then crouches down beside the bikes, running his finger along 
           the smooth frame of one.

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        I want this building to shine with 
                        hope, Terry.

           ANGLE ON THE BICYCLE - the streamlined chain guard... The 
           curved, art-deco symmetry of the silver fender...

           INT. PRISON CELL - SAME  

           Terry sits on the edge of his bed, holding Will’s letter, 
           soaking in each word.

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        ...the way you taught me to trust in 
                        it, rely on it. I want it to shine 
                        with the brilliant glare of hope...

           Terry’s eyes move up to his small cell window, looking beyond 
           the bars and the warping translucent glass...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        ...with love...your brother, Will.

           INT. CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS (CEO’S OFFICE) - DAY

           Will wears his best three-piece, sitting in the waiting area 
           of a large office suite, his oversized, covered poster board 
           resting awkwardly on his lap. A SECRETARY sits poised at a 
           desk nearby, ignoring him.

           Will takes a sip from a glass of water, checks his watch, 
           just as THE DOOR ACROSS FROM HIM OPENS...

           Two men emerge from the inner sanctum: PAUL LUBERTAZZI (upper 
           30’s) and WALTER CHRYSLER himself. Will leans forward with 
           anticipation, ready for his moment. 

           The two men are laughing it up, chummy. They shake hands and 
           Chrysler instantly turns back into the safety of his office. 
           The door closes behind him.

           Will is crestfallen. He settles back into his seat and 
           glances toward the secretary who couldn’t care less. Will 
           rechecks his watch.
                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                        You that architect from New York?

           Will follows the voice to Paul Lubertazzi, now standing near 
           the exit door. Paul is a walking coronary, his belt sagging 
           below a distended gut, an unlit cigarette in his hand.

                                 WILL
                        I guess so.
                             (standing)
                        Will Van Alen.

           They shake hands.

                                 PAUL
                        Paul Lubertazzi. You’re with me. 
                        Let’s walk.

           Paul pushes through the exit door. Will is confused, but on 
           impulse, he grabs his poster board and hustles after.

           INT. SHED - MINUTES LATER

           The small brick shed is crowded with file cabinets, a desk, 
           piles of papers.

                                 WILL
                        Can I ask who you are exactly?

                                 PAUL
                        Chrysler’s builder. I oversee 
                        construction on anything he wants to 
                        put up.

           Will watches Paul finally light his cigarette.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (re: Will’s poster board)
                        So I assume we turned you down and 
                        that’s some sorta last ditch effort 
                        to change our minds?
                             (off Will’s silence)
                        Why don’t you leave it with me? You 
                        seem like a nice guy, and hey, you 
                        never know. Maybe the firm Chrysler 
                        chose will like your work, hire you 
                        on.

           Will looks down at his dripping wet poster board.

                                 WILL
                        I think I’ll hang on to it actually. 
                        Thanks again.
           Will nods politely, exits the shed...

           INT. CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS (CEO’S OFFICE) - MINUTES LATER

           Will walks back into the waiting area of Chrysler’s office 
           suite. Chrysler’s secretary lifts her eyes from her 
           typewriter, less than happy to see him again.

           Will approaches her desk, smiles innocently.

                                 WILL
                        I’m just waiting for a friend to pick 
                        me up in his car, was hoping I could 
                        wait here.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Actually, Mr. Chrysler prefers that 
                        this area be reserved for people with 
                        appointments...only. 

                                 WILL
                        Of course. 

           Will turns and heads for the exit door. The secretary watches 
           him take a seat on one of the stoops, just outside. Will 
           turns his head, gives her a little wave which she doesn’t 
           return.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT./INT. CHRYSLER HEADQUARTERS (CEO’S OFFICE) - LATER

           Will, still sitting on the stoop, straightens each leg, 
           fighting the stiffness. He glances back toward the 
           secretary’s desk...watching as she finishes typing a 
           document, pulls it from the typewriter. She stands, pulls her 
           handbag from a drawer and walks off, down an adjacent 
           hallway.

           Will cranes his neck, watching her disappear. He jumps up, 
           quickly heads into Chrysler’s waiting area. 

           IN THE HALLWAY

           About to enter the women’s restroom, the secretary checks her 
           handbag. Realizing she forgot something, she turns, heads 
           back toward her desk.

           IN THE WAITING AREA

           Will crouches on all fours, beside Chrysler’s door. And with 
           one swift motion, he pushes his poster board, SLIDING IT into 
           Chrysler’s office. Disappearing into the inner sanctum.
           THE SECRETARY’S POV - as she re-enters the reception area, 
           she spots the back of a man, crouched on the floor, just past 
           her desk.

                                 SECRETARY
                             (not happy)
                        Excuse me.

           But as she draws closer, she sees Will, crouched down, tying 
           one of his shoes.

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Van Alen?

                                 WILL
                        Oh, there you are. I just realized I 
                        never thanked you for the water 
                        earlier.

                                 SECRETARY
                             (raising an eyebrow)
                        You’re welcome?

                                 WILL
                             (pleasant smile, then)
                        Okay, have a good day then. 

           Will turns, leaves through the doors and walks off. Empty 
           handed.

           INT./EXT. WILL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           In the living room, Will reclines on one of his sofas, his 
           hand behind his head, staring at the ceiling. Across from 
           him, Harry lights a new cigarette with his last one.  

           Harry takes a long pull on the smoke. The two of them, 
           wallowing in the smoke and the silence. Pushing their brains 
           for an idea.

                                 WILL
                        We could start a taxicab service...

                                 HARRY
                        Do you realize how large your pile of 
                        cabbage has to be to afford a fleet 
                        of cars?

                                 WILL
                        Larger than ours I’m guessing...

           A beat. Their desperate minds swirling.
                                 HARRY
                        How about a delicatessen? You know, 
                        sandwiches...pickles...maybe a soda 
                        fountain?

                                 WILL
                        Ah, I think that one’s the ticket.
                             (looking over at Harry)
                        ‘cause when people can’t afford 
                        clothes for their babies, what they 
                        really need is a good pastrami on 
                        rye. 

                                 HARRY
                        Don’t forget the pickles.

           The two of them start to chuckle. Pent up anxiety escaping 
           from them in a spurt of laughter...

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        I do believe our ship is without a 
                        rudder, my friend.

           An urgent KNOCK at the front door interrupts their solitude.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Ah, opportunity knocks...

                                 WILL
                             (shakes his head)
                        Probably God actually. 
                             (off Harry)
                        The local church has stepped up their 
                        recruitment efforts lately.

           Will walks from the room. 

           AT THE FRONT DOOR

           Will opens it to see --

           A BALD MAN with bushy, gray eyebrows and a stoic face. The 
           man wears a black overcoat and black pants and holds a black 
           porter’s hat in his hands. The rain is careening down his 
           smooth head. 

                                 BALD MAN
                        William Van Alen?

           Will is trying to comprehend this figure before him. He 
           forgets to answer.

                                 BALD MAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re him?
                                 WILL
                             (nods, then)
                        I am.

           The man gives a single nod of satisfaction, then replaces the 
           hat onto his wet head and turns back into the rain. Will 
           furrows his brow.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Wait! What was that?! If you’re with 
                        the church, I’m not - 

           WILL’S POV - The man stops at a gleaming white CHRYSLER 
           IMPERIAL L-SERIES SEDAN, parked at the curb. Even at night, 
           in the rain, it sparkles.

           Will watches the man open the car door, reach in, and pull 
           out an umbrella. After opening it, he moves aside for the 
           car’s other passenger to step out.

           ON WILL as he registers his real visitor. Questioning his own 
           sanity. REVERSE to see Walter Chrysler moving toward Will’s 
           front door under the dry shelter of his chauffeur’s 
           umbrella...

           Will quickly tucks his shirt into his pants.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Sorry for the late night social call. 
                        I trust it’s not too late?

                                 WILL
                        No, of course not, Mr. Chrysler. Not 
                        late at all. Nuh uh...no way is it 
                        late.

           Will smiles stupidly at both men.

                                 BALD MAN
                        Perhaps you’d both be more 
                        comfortable indoors?

           Will gets the obvious hint, steps aside quickly.

                                 WILL
                        Oh god, sorry. Please, come in, both 
                        of you. I’m just a blockhead...

           Chrysler steps in. The chauffeur ignores the invitation.

                                 BALD MAN
                        I’ll be in the car, sir.

           He heads back to the car. And just like that, Will is face to 
           face with Walter Chrysler in his dingy foyer.
                                 CHRYSLER
                        This isn’t a social call, so let’s 
                        say we skip the awkwardness and get 
                        right to it. You game, Mr. Van Alen?

                                 WILL
                        Of course, let’s do that. I mean, I’m 
                        game. Definitely game...for that.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Still awkward, lad.

           Will takes a quick deep breath.

                                 WILL
                        Won’t happen again. Would you like to 
                        come in, have a seat?

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Another time maybe. I saw your design 
                        proposal for my parcel in New York. I 
                        liked it, it’s bold.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you. That’s very kind of you.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I can’t say I’m in favor of how you 
                        got your design to me, but it tells 
                        me one of two things - you’re either 
                        a helluva persistent, resourceful 
                        sonofabitch, or you’re the type that 
                        will lie and cheat to get ahead. I 
                        assume it’s the former, or I wouldn’t 
                        be here. 

           Will nods, offers a small grin. The silence hangs, Will 
           finally realizing that Chrysler is waiting for more...

                                 WILL
                        Yes! The former. Absolutely the 
                        former.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Okay, so that leads me to my next 
                        question. 
                             (beat)
                        Are you mad?

                                 WILL
                        Am I mad?
                             (thrown off)
                        Um, no. I believe I’m quite sane 
                        actually. Of course, a mad person 
                        would probably say the same thing, so-  
                                 CHRYSLER
                        You’re proposing that my new 
                        headquarters become the tallest 
                        building on earth.

                                 WILL
                        I am.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        And what makes you capable of such an 
                        aspiration? I’ve already hired a very 
                        reputable firm you know...

                                 WILL
                        Yessir, I’m aware of that. But that 
                        firm is based in Kansas City.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        And why would that matter?

                                 WILL
                        All due respect, Mr. Chrysler, you’re 
                        not basing your company in Kansas 
                        City. You need someone expertly 
                        versed in New York. 

                                 CHRYSLER
                        And you’re that someone?

                                 WILL
                        Well...yes. I am.

           Chrysler grins at Will’s confidence, crosses his arms.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Prove it to me.

           Will smiles nervously, assuming it’s a joke, but sees that 
           Chrysler is serious.

                                 WILL
                        I’m not sure how I could prove it, 
                        sir. I was born here, and I’ve worked 
                        here for years, so I understand - 

           Chrysler waves his hand dismissively.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Just words... 

           Chrysler grins compassionately. Stepping toward the door.
                                 CHRYSLER (CONT’D)
                        I commend you on your efforts, son. 
                        I’ll have my folks keep you in mind 
                        for future projects.

           Chrysler opens the door, about to leave. Will’s eyes 
           searching for an answer as his dream slips away.

                                 WILL
                        Pick a number!
                             (off Chrysler)
                        From one to one hundred. Please...

           Chrysler squints through skeptical eyes, but he’s curious 
           enough to let go of the door knob.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Okay. Seventy-three.

                                 WILL
                        Seventy-three, very well. And if you 
                        could humor me one more time, choose 
                        a number from one to one thousand.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I assume there’s a point here, so 
                        I’ll play along.
                             (then)
                        Four hundred and twenty-two.

                                 WILL
                             (eyes on the floor, 
                              thinking)
                        Four twenty-two, seventy-third 
                        street. Okay...
                             (looking up; confident)
                        Four twenty-two, seventy-third street 
                        is a classic nineteenth century 
                        brownstone, but unique in its use of 
                        both Roman and Greek influences. 
                        There’s a doric frieze above the 
                        door, and the front steps are guarded 
                        by two Roman lions, built to mimic 
                        those at the New York Public Library. 
                        Excellent choice, Mr. Chrysler.

           After a beat, Chrysler actually chuckles. Impressed. Chrysler 
           eyes him for a beat, silently assessing him.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I’m going to give you a shot, Mr. Van 
                        Alen.

                                 WILL
                        That’s...wonderful, thank you.
                                 CHRYSLER
                        We’ll see how wonderful it is. I want 
                        to come by your offices tomorrow and 
                        check out your operations. How many 
                        men do you have over there?

                                 WILL
                        Gosh, I guess...
                             (thinking fast)
                        I’d like to say we’re up to forty 
                        now? Give or take.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Very good. If I like what I see, we 
                        might have something to talk about. 
                        Call my office with the address, I’ll 
                        be there at eleven.

           Chrysler opens the front door, his trusty chauffeur waiting 
           for him. And like that, he’s gone...

           Will shuts the door slowly. The surreality of the past three 
           minutes sinking in.

           INT. WILL’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Harry hasn’t moved from his position on the couch. Still 
           smoking, still reclined. He looks over as Will re-enters the 
           room.

                                 HARRY
                        Okay, you ready for this? An ice 
                        delivery service. Everyone needs ice, 
                        right?
                             (off Will’s blank 
                              expression; a beat)
                        You hate it, fair enough, but you 
                        just need to hear this one out.
                             (off Will’s frozen 
                              expression)
                        What? What’s that look? Was it God?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah, it sorta was.
                             (grins)
                        Our night just became so much more 
                        interesting.

           Off Will...
           INT. OFFICES OF SEVERANCE & VAN ALEN (BOARD ROOM) - LATER

           Still night, still pouring rain outside. We’re back inside 
           the deserted offices of Will’s and Harry’s ex-firm. 
           Everything motionless and dark, everything silent, until...

           A loud CRACK. Followed by a BANG...

           And then -- A WINDOW SLIDES OPEN.

           We watch as the drenched bodies of Will, and then Harry, ooze 
           through the opened window, each of them flopping clumsily to 
           the floor once inside.

           They stand, looking around at the familiar surroundings.

                                 HARRY
                        Can I have my old office back?

                                 WILL
                             (looking around)
                        Well, since you’ll probably be my 
                        cell mate soon, you can have any 
                        office you want.

           EXT. 422 73RD STREET - SAME TIME

           The white Chrysler Imperial slows, stopping in front of a 
           brownstone. Walter Chrysler opens his door, steps onto the 
           street. He peers in the direction of one of the brownstones.

           CHRYSLER’S POV - A Greek FRIEZE stretching across the facade 
           above the front door, TWO SCULPTED LIONS at the entrance to 
           the front steps.

           Chrysler smirks, then climbs back into the Imperial’s back 
           seat. The car drives off into the night... 

           INT. OFFICES OF SEVERANCE & VAN ALEN (DRAFTING ROOM) - LATER

           Will and Harry are moving quickly, rearranging desks, doing 
           their best to make it look like a real office again.

                                 WILL
                        It doesn’t need to look perfect. Just 
                        lived in.

                                 HARRY
                        Lucky it hadn’t been rented.

                                 WILL
                        The benefit of a shattered financial 
                        system. Nothing’s rented.
           Will straightens a desk just so, steps back to assess their 
           work.

                                 HARRY
                        Minor thing, Will, and I’m hesitant 
                        to bring it up when your scrotum has 
                        finally shown itself, but you did 
                        tell the founder and CEO of the 
                        Chrysler Corporation that you had 
                        forty men working for us, correct?

                                 WILL
                        I said forty men, more or less.

                                 HARRY
                        Right, well I think thirty-eight less 
                        might raise a wee bit of a warning 
                        sign, don’t you?

           The men’s eyes meet for a beat. 

                                 WILL
                        Always stuck on the details, Harry. 
                        Leave this one to me.

           MOVE IN ON THE WINDOW behind them

           ACCELERATED TIME as the darkness outside changes from inky 
           black to purple to blood-orange. Rain and clouds over the 
           Hudson dissipating to reveal a golden sun, blue sky. New York 
           brought back to life again.

           PULL BACK FROM THE WINDOW

           Harry is dressed in his suit now, his hair groomed. Pacing 
           with nervous energy around the office. He hears the door 
           CLICK, looks up to see -

           WILL - standing in the doorway. His face blank, giving away 
           nothing. 

           Then he swings the door open wider, and as Harry watches in 
           disbelief --

           A parade of FORTY MEN file into the office, each of them 
           looking around as they enter, as if they were stepping onto a 
           new planet. The last to enter is Ted (from the food line). He 
           and Will shake hands.

                                 TED
                        Two dollars for each man?

                                 WILL
                        That’s the deal... Ted, meet Harry.
           Harry gives Ted a quick wave, still perplexed by what just 
           happened. The office is suddenly bustling with men, all of 
           them talking and laughing with each other. As Ted moves off 
           to join them, Harry walks toward Will.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Forty men, more or less.

                                 MEG (O.C.)
                        And one lady, at your service.

           Meg is standing in the doorway. Will looks at her, shocked.

                                 MEG (CONT’D)
                        Harry called.
                             (off Will)
                        What? You can’t have a working office 
                        without a doll like me to greet your 
                        clients.

                                 HARRY
                             (to Will)
                        Are we insane?

                                 WILL
                        Maybe. But we’re getting this job. 
                        Understand? Now show these men how to 
                        act like architects...
                             (checks his watch)
                        ...in the next twenty minutes.

           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING - LATER

           ON THE CLOSED ENTRANCE DOOR. It opens and we’re instantly 
           face to face with Walter Chrysler, flanked by a couple of 
           well-dressed, overeducated SYCOPHANTS.

           REVERSE to see Meg, smiling her warmest welcome.

                                 MEG
                        Mr. Chrysler. Welcome to Van Alen & 
                        Tanning. Please come in.

           She steps aside and Chrysler enters. Taking in the office 
           with a critical eye. Mr. Chrysler removes his coat, hands it 
           to Meg. The sycophants pile their own coats onto Meg’s 
           waiting arms as well.

           CHRYSLER’S POV - We see the men from the food line, moving 
           about, sitting at drafting tables, using T-squares (seemingly 
           correctly), pretending to analyze blueprints...

           By all accounts, a successful, thriving firm. Chrysler nods 
           to himself. 
           Just as -- 

           WILL walks up urgently, his hand extended in a greeting.

                                 WILL
                             (shaking hands)
                        Mr. Chrysler! Thank you for coming, 
                        so sorry I wasn’t here to greet you. 
                        Busy, busy day.

                                 SYCOPHANT #1
                        Perhaps we should get started. Mr. 
                        Chrysler has a full day and we’re 
                        already four minutes behind schedule.

           INT. THE BOARD ROOM - LATER

           Will and Harry sit across from Chrysler and his two 
           followers. Behind Chrysler, the entire bustling office can be 
           seen through the glass wall.

           Will talks budget to the three visitors...

                                 WILL
                        ...and we can secure bulk priced 
                        steel from several mills in 
                        Pittsburgh or keep some control over 
                        variable shipping rates by going with 
                        an outfit we know in Jersey...

           And as he continues speaking, Will notices one of the food-
           line men (who we’ll come to know as CHIP) in the office 
           looking in at them, trying to get Will’s attention. Looking 
           for feedback on how the meeting’s going. Will shakes his head 
           slightly, hoping for Chip to go away...

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. THE DRAFTING ROOM - SAME TIME

                                 CHIP
                             (to everyone)
                        Hey, I think the car guy is giving 
                        our boy a hard time!

           Ted looks over from his drafting table across the room.

                                 TED
                        Hey, Chip! Get away from there. Let 
                        Will have his meeting!

           But Chip ignores him...still motioning to Will. Waving his 
           arms.
           WILL’S POV - In the outer office, Ted has come to the rescue, 
           grabbing Chip by the ear and dragging him away from the board 
           room. 

           Chrysler suddenly stands. His men follow his lead.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Okay, I’ve seen and heard all I need.

           Will and Harry glance at each other, not knowing how to 
           translate this. They both stand to meet their fate.

           In the drafting room, the commotion has stopped - all eyes on 
           the board room. 

           POV FROM THE DRAFTING ROOM - Will and Harry trading cordial 
           handshakes with Chrysler and his handlers. 

           A moment later, Chrysler turns and heads for the drafting 
           room. All of the men instantly spring to life, drawing inane 
           circles with compasses or scrutinizing blank blue prints. 
           Anything to look busy.

           ON CHRYSLER as he moves through the drafting room with 
           urgency. He takes his coat from Meg and exits with his two 
           drones.

           After the door CLICKS shut, the office is thick with 
           anticipation. All eyes turn to Will and Harry. An extended 
           beat of silence.

                                 TED
                        Come on! You get it or not?!

           Will is stone faced, shaking his head slowly, but he can’t 
           hold back the grin for long...

                                 WILL
                        We did.

           All of the men instantly explode with a roar of CHEERS and 
           APPLAUSE. Will and Harry are suddenly surrounded by these 
           bright-hearted men, their hair getting tussled, their backs 
           getting slapped.  

           WILL’S POV - Standing apart from the others, but watching 
           with a joyous smile, is Meg.

           EXT. CHRYSLER BUILDING WORK SITE - DAY

           Cement mixers pouring, men scurrying about in every 
           direction. Construction is in high gear now.
           Will and Harry are kneeling beside a slab of wet cement. They 
           both have their hands pushed into the soft slab, leaving 
           their prints. Their smiling faces are turned back to the 
           semicircle of REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS surrounding them.

           Standing with the photographers, Meg readies her camera. 

           MEG’S POV - Through her camera lens, Will and Harry leaving 
           their hand prints. CLICK!

           FREEZE FRAME IN B&W - The image of them frozen for the ages.

           ON WILL AND HARRY as they remove their hands, cleaning them 
           off with a towel.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        How high are you planning to go, Mr. 
                        Van Alen?

                                 WILL
                        Well, one of our elevator buttons is 
                        going to say ‘Mars’, so you’ll have 
                        to do the math yourself.

           The reporters all laugh along.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        No, no...  The Woolworth Building is 
                        at 705 feet, and our plan right now 
                        is to go to 740.

           The reporters scribble on their pads.

                                 REPORTER #2
                             (confused)
                        Then what’s your reaction to the 
                        plans for the Bank of Manhattan 
                        building?

           Will and Harry share a quick glance.

                                 WILL
                             (forced casual)
                        This city is growing so fast. Can’t 
                        even keep track of every new 
                        development anymore.

                                 REPORTER #3
                        Their designs are planning to top out 
                        at 840 feet. Does it bother Mr. 
                        Chrysler that his building will have 
                        to settle for the silver medal if 
                        they move forward?
                                 REPORTER #1
                        One hundred feet is a significant 
                        shortfall, Mr. Van Alen.

           CLOSE ON WILL - an awkward, forced grin as he takes in the 
           news. Questions continue relentlessly.

                                 REPORTER #4
                        Do you believe the motivation behind 
                        Severance’s plans to be highest was 
                        to surpass you in particular?

                                 REPORTER #5
                        Do you think there’s a personal 
                        vendetta at play, Mr. Van Alen?

           Will’s eyes move in thought. Clearly caught off guard.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Are you saying you weren’t aware that 
                        your ex-partner was planning to 
                        upstage you?

           A beat. Will’s had enough. He looks up, focused and direct.

                                 WILL
                        Of course we knew. And my reaction is 
                        this: Our team has the brightest, 
                        most sought-after minds anywhere. Mr. 
                        Severance is more than welcome to 
                        make a horse race of it, but look 
                        around...it’s a race he’s going to 
                        lose. Thank you, gentlemen, that’s it 
                        for today.

           Will and Harry walk off. Meg stays behind, watching them go. 

           ON WILL, stone-faced as he walks.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                             (eyes straight ahead)
                        Okay, first thing we do is raise our 
                        target height to something above 840 
                        feet. Let Paul know when you see him.
                             (beat)
                        Then we have to get some bright, 
                        sought-after minds...quickly.

                                 HARRY
                        I should say so.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION (BROOKLYN, NY) - NIGHT

           Will and Meg step off their train, onto the station platform. 
                                 WILL
                        So...have you thought about bringing 
                        Jonathan by the site?

                                 MEG
                        Would you like me to?

                                 WILL
                        If you’d like to, then...I would like 
                        you to.

           Meg casts a sideways glance at him.

                                 MEG
                        Well I can’t.
                             (then)
                        He’s in Ireland, excavating a 
                        medieval castle.
                             (then)
                        Or so I hear.

           This last bit causes Will to turn his head toward her in 
           surprise. He covers quickly.

                                 WILL
                        Oh, I’m sorry...are you two no 
                        longer...

                                 MEG
                             (grinning)
                        Oh, shut up. You’re being smug. 

                                 WILL
                        I’m not!
                             (beat)
                        What happened?

                                 MEG
                        He received a grant to excavate some 
                        castle on the coast of Ireland, 
                        invited me to come along. All 
                        expenses paid by the university.

                                 WILL
                        But you didn’t go.

                                 MEG
                        Nope.

                                 WILL
                        Huh. Do you think he’d consider 
                        taking me?

           Meg smacks him in the shoulder with the back of her hand.
                                 MEG
                        I have family in Ireland, family I’ve 
                        always wanted to meet. And I also 
                        would have had endless time to 
                        travel, photograph a whole new part 
                        of the world.

                                 WILL
                        But you didn’t go...

           Meg stops, looks into his eyes.

                                 MEG
                        Am I insane?

                                 WILL
                        Well, that all depends, of course.

                                 MEG
                        On?

                                 WILL
                        On whether you chose to not go, or 
                        whether you chose to stay.

                                 MEG
                        There’s a difference...?

                                 WILL
                        A very large one.

           They walk in silence for a couple moments.

                                 MEG
                        I know my job is just to record the 
                        progress of the building’s 
                        construction. But at the same time, 
                        how often does a person get a chance 
                        to record someone’s dream as it comes 
                        true? 

                                 WILL
                        Mr. Chrysler would be flattered.

                                 MEG
                             (smirks)
                        I’m not talking about Chrysler’s 
                        dream, Will.

           Their eyes meet for a moment before Meg looks away. The two 
           of them continuing their walk, away from us.
           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

           The sun casting its morning haze over the city.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE (NYC) - DAY

           Hundreds of pedestrians criss-crossing at this intersection 
           of the world. As they do, more than half of them drop a dime 
           into the hand of the NEWSPAPER BOY (16), snatching their 
           morning NEW YORK TIMES.

           As one BUSINESS MAN grabs his newspaper, we STAY WITH 
           HIM...peering over his shoulder to see a C.U. ON THE FRONT 
           PAGE HEADLINE:

           “Chrysler Building Now Set to Reach 842 Feet”

           And the subheading:

           “Would be World’s Tallest”

           After another beat, the business man crumples the newspaper, 
           stuffing it into a garbage as he passes. REVERSE ON THE 
           BUSINESS MAN - it’s Craig Severance. And he’s not happy about 
           the morning’s news.

           EXT. AVENUE P (BROOKLYN, NY) - DAY

           Will walks down a neighborhood Brooklyn street, heading 
           straight for --

           Another long FOOD LINE of the downtrodden, half a block 
           ahead. CLOSE on some of their faces...

           Reaching the front of the line - 

                                 WILL
                             (to everyone on line)
                        Excuse me! Good morning, everyone! My 
                        name is Will Van Alen.
                             (off their tired eyes as 
                              they look over)
                        I realize we don’t know each other, 
                        but I’m here offering work for anyone 
                        who wants to put in an honest day. 
                        The work is hard and the pay is 
                        average at best, but I promise you’ll 
                        be contributing to something special. 
                        Something you might want to tell your 
                        grandkids about someday. All you have 
                        to do is follow me.
           All eyes on Will, but nobody moving or reacting. Whatever 
           Will was hoping for, it’s not happening.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Okay then! I’m going now!

           Still nothing. Disappointed, Will starts to walk off...

           And then, one by one, UNEMPLOYED MEN peel off from the 
           line...following after Will.

           EXT. CHRYSLER BUILDING WORK SITE - LATER

           Paul and Harry are conferring near one corner of the work 
           site. Meg stands off to the side, SNAPPING PHOTOS of the 
           progress.

           ANGLE ON THE BUILDING - a steel skeleton now rising twelve 
           stories above the street.

           ON HARRY - listening to Paul at first, but then seeing 
           something over Paul’s shoulder. 

                                 HARRY
                        Well, how about that...

           Paul turns, following Harry’s stare.

           PAUL’S POV - Will has become the Pied Piper of Manhattan, 
           leading DOZENS OF MEN toward the work site.

                                 PAUL
                             (to himself)
                        What in the hell?

           MEG’S POV - Through her camera lens: Will and the men filling 
           the frame. CLICK!

           FREEZE FRAME IN B&W - Will and the men walking toward us.

           As Will and his followers reach Paul: 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                             (to Will)
                        What is this?

                                 WILL
                        The only way to win this race is to 
                        build around the clock, but I won’t 
                        risk lives just to squeeze a few more 
                        hours out of the men we’ve got. 
                             (re: the new men)
                        So, here you go...
                                 PAUL
                        Don’t suppose you’ve asked about 
                        their experience or skills..?

                                 WILL
                        That’s really the Foreman’s job, and 
                        conveniently enough...that just 
                        happens to be you, so...
                             (off Paul; grins)
                        Plenty of work to go around though. 
                        I’ll be back later with more.

           Will gives Paul a supportive pat on the shoulder and walks 
           off alone.

           As Paul shakes his head, Harry pats him on the shoulder, just 
           as Will did.

                                 HARRY
                        You heard the man.

           And Harry walks off too, leaving Paul to face the throng.

           EXT. 5TH AVENUE - LATER

           Eating a hotdog, Harry walks alone among the tourists and 
           shoppers. ON HARRY as he spots something...then weaving 
           through the slalom of moving pedestrians to get there.

           It’s a STACK OF NEWSPAPERS. Harry lifts the top one and we 
           see what he sees:

           The headline:

           “In Race to Tallest, Bank of Manhattan Ups the Ante to 880 
           Feet”

           And the subheading:

           “New Height Would Leave Chrysler 38 Feet Short”

                                 PAPER BOY (O.S.)
                        Hey, Mister, you gonna pay for that?

           Harry drops it back onto the stack.

                                 HARRY
                        No thanks.
           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING - DAY

           PANNING SLOWLY ACROSS A DESK, we see a newspaper and it’s 
           front page headline (”...Ups the Ante to 880 Feet”)...and 
           then we settle on a BLUEPRINT.

           CLOSE ON THE MASTER BLUEPRINT LEGEND - a hand ENTERS THE 
           FRAME, using a pencil to cross off “842” and writing in “890” 
           in its place.

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        There...

           REVERSE to see Will holding the pencil. Behind him, Harry 
           looks on, placing a supporting hand on Will’s shoulder.

           A moment later, there is a KNOCK at the closed office door. 
           Will looks up as Paul pokes his head into the office. Will 
           immediately notices the shaken expression on Paul’s face.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        What is it? What’s wrong?

           Will already knows what’s coming. Off Paul...

           INT. CRAIG SEVERANCE’S BROWNSTONE - LATER

           Craig Severance stands at his mini-bar, pouring himself a 
           scotch, his back to Will, who sits in a chair by the 
           oversized fireplace.

                                 CRAIG
                        So, I assume you heard about the 
                        mishap today?

                                 WILL
                        You make it sound like a bump on the 
                        head.

                                 CRAIG
                        Taking the righteous path won’t score 
                        you any points. 
                             (takes a sip)
                        But if it makes you feel better to 
                        paint me as a demon, then feel free. 
                        I’m a big boy.

                                 WILL
                        A man who worked for you died, Craig. 
                        After working his third straight 
                        double shift. You can’t tell me you 
                        don’t feel responsible.
                                 CRAIG
                        Of course I take responsibility, and 
                        I take offense to the implication 
                        that I wouldn’t. So, why don’t we cut 
                        to it. What do you want, Will? 

                                 WILL
                        This competition that’s bubbled up in 
                        the press...it’s gotten out of hand. 
                        There doesn’t need to be any more 
                        accidents.

                                 CRAIG
                        We’re both paid by men who would 
                        never settle for second place, so 
                        tell me how you think we’re gonna 
                        resolve this. Don’t expect me to roll 
                        over. It won’t happen.

                                 WILL
                        I’m offering a real olive branch 
                        here, just between us. We’re building 
                        at heights that have never been 
                        attempted in the history of mankind.
                             (beat)
                        You agree not to add any more floors, 
                        and I’ll do the same.

                                 CRAIG
                        But the announcement I have going to 
                        the press tomorrow has me at 930 
                        feet. Didn’t you say you were at 890? 
                             (off Will)
                        You’d be forfeiting - the title and 
                        probably your career.

                                 WILL
                        I know what’s at stake.

                                 CRAIG
                        Then why do it?

                                 WILL
                        Because we’re both in unchartered 
                        waters, and I know you’re going to 
                        try to win at any cost. 

           Craig holds out his arms (”guilty as charged”).

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Then do we have a deal?

           Craig quickly thinks it over.
                                 CRAIG
                        I’ll need you to give a quote in the 
                        Times, stating that you’ve topped 
                        out.

                                 WILL
                        Done.

                                 CRAIG
                        Good. Then I want you to talk with 
                        the reporter before tonight, and I 
                        want the story to come out in a week.  
                        Timing works better for me if it hits 
                        right before we open our doors. Fair?

                                 WILL
                        Peachy. Anything else?

                                 CRAIG
                             (takes a drink, then)
                        What about Chrysler?

                                 WILL
                        I’ll talk to him. Tomorrow.

                                 CRAIG
                        Wish I could say I admire what you’re 
                        doing. You’ll come to see it was a 
                        mistake.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll show myself out.

           As Will leaves, Craig shakes his head and takes another 
           drink.

           INT. THE METROPOLITAN CLUB (NYC) - DAY

           Where the rich and rarified go to unwind... 

           Chrysler settles into his throne-like chair, looking 
           perfectly at home. Will takes in the surrounding opulence 
           like a wide-eyed child. Completely out of place and 
           underdressed.

                                 WILL
                        French baroque with Italian 
                        renaissance accents. Beautiful...

                                 CHRYSLER
                             (not looking up)
                        It’s nice.
                             (watching Will, then)
                        So how are things, Will?
           Will nods, offers a benign grin.

                                 WILL
                        Things are good. The final phase is 
                        set to begin on schedule.

           Chrysler doesn’t react. Instead, lighting his cigar.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        But there is something I was hoping 
                        to speak with you about. As you may 
                        have heard, a man fell recently...

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Not one of your men...

                                 WILL
                        No, sir.
                             (Chrysler relaxes)
                        But I think it happened because of 
                        this race, this crazed competition to 
                        be tallest.

           Chrysler waves a dismissing hand.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Nobody’s gonna hold you accountable 
                        for how they run things on another 
                        site. 

                                 WILL
                        I agree, but I do think we can ensure 
                        that neither site loses any more men.

           Chrysler appears to be barely listening, examining the tip of 
           his lit cigar.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                             (nervous; sped up)
                        If we were to just stop the 
                        competition completely, build to the 
                        height that we’ve recently stated to 
                        the press instead of increasing it 
                        every time the other side increases - 

           Will is interrupted by a waiter, suddenly appearing above 
           them.

                                 CHRYSLER
                             (to the waiter)
                        Ah, bring me a bottle of the Macon 
                        Pouilly Fuissé Cabernet and an iced 
                        tea for my friend here. Oh, and some 
                        of that bread you had last time. That 
                        was damn fine bread.
                                 WAITER
                        Very good, sir.

           The waiter disappears. Chrysler turns his head toward Will.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Anyway...you were saying? 
                             (beat)
                        About your brother?

           Will is thrown, Chrysler’s words hanging there. But Chrysler 
           doesn’t give anything away, unbuttoning his jacket, and 
           relaxing into the chair. Off Will’s confused face -

                                 CHRYSLER (CONT’D)
                        You really think I’d hire an unknown 
                        to design the highest building on 
                        Earth...a building which, by the way, 
                        will have my name over the front 
                        doors...without first learning 
                        everything there is to learn about 
                        that unknown?

                                 WILL
                        I guess not.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Look, I dislike surprises, but 
                        there’s one other thing I loathe 
                        above all else...
                             (off Will’s face)
                        Not winning.

                                 WILL
                        But sir -

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I knew all about that Bank of 
                        Manhattan tower that your ex-partner 
                        is designing downtown, even before I 
                        hired you.

                                 WILL
                        Is that why you hired me?

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I hired you for your talent, but I 
                        will say this: It didn’t hurt. Your 
                        ex-partner’s new employer is an ivy-
                        league blowhard named George 
                        Ohrstrom. George wants the title of 
                        world’s tallest for the same reason I 
                        do: Ego. For men like us, if you come 
                        in second, you’d might as well be two-
                        hundred and second.
                                 WILL
                        I’m not understanding how this 
                        involves my brother.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Simple. I hate George Ohrstrom. I try 
                        to use that word sparingly but I can 
                        use it with a clear conscience in 
                        this case. I won’t bore you with the 
                        details, but I’m prepared to do 
                        whatever it takes to ensure that his 
                        building falls short of mine. It may 
                        be petty...
                             (stops to consider this)
                        ...actually it’s not petty, it’s damn 
                        significant. He’s a man of low 
                        character, and I despise that...so 
                        winning’s gonna feel very satisfying.
                             (a puff on the cigar)
                        As for you, I’m well aware of your 
                        relationship with Severance and how 
                        things ended between you two. If I’m 
                        going to hate my counterpart in this 
                        little bake-off, I’d like my 
                        architect to have similar feelings 
                        for his. 

                                 WILL
                        Hate is a strong word.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Yes it is. It’s strong and it’s 
                        physical and it’s real. Use it, Will. 
                        And if you need to find it first, 
                        then do that, quickly. But you will 
                        deliver on what you said you’d 
                        deliver. World’s tallest, nothing 
                        less.

           The waiter delivers the drinks.

                                 WILL
                        I’d like to, Mr. Chrysler, I really 
                        would. But I can’t be involved in a 
                        race where family men are dying, just 
                        so their boss can be first to the 
                        finish line.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        You know what it takes to have a 
                        race?
                             (off Will)
                        Two sides.
                             (then)
                        It’s only a race if you race him.

                        I don’t give an elephant’s ass who 
                        finishes their building first. I care 
                        about which one, when all is said and 
                        done, is looking down on the other 
                        one. You understand me?

                                 WILL
                        I do.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Well good then. Because it’s in your 
                        interest to understand me perfectly.
                             (off Will)
                        You know, it’s incredible the kinds 
                        of friends a man accumulates when his 
                        financial resources run deep. 
                        Governors, senators, judges who serve 
                        on prison parole boards...
                             (a beat; off Will)
                        Friends who are always happy to do a 
                        favor when asked.
                             (a beat, then)
                        With great risk comes great reward, 
                        Will. Make sure we win the real race, 
                        and your brother might just find 
                        himself with a second chance.

           Will takes this in, a hopeful energy vibrating through him. 
           Imagining his brother as a free man, holding back a smile.

                                 WILL
                             (raising his glass)
                        To winning...

           Off Will...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. OFFICES OF VAN ALEN & TANNING - NIGHT

           Huddled around a drafting table with his four top ENGINEERS 
           (30’s and 40’s), plus Paul and Harry, Will rubs at his 
           bloodshot eyes.

                                 ENGINEER #1
                        We could maybe use a damper to 
                        counter the wind stress. I’ve heard 
                        of that being used a couple times.

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        Great, but we’d still be stuck with 
                        the structural load issue either way.
           The others (except Will) nod in agreement. They’ve clearly 
           been trying to tackle this for a while. A few moments of 
           quiet brainstorming before - 

                                 PAUL
                        Top section already has us closing in 
                        at a seventy-four degree angle. Could 
                        we shift the design and just start 
                        moving up at ninety degrees from the 
                        73rd floor?

                                 ENGINEER #3
                        For a bit, sure, but enough to get 
                        over 930 feet, no way. The strain...
                             (pointing at the blue 
                              print)
                        ...here and here would be a disaster 
                        waiting to happen.

           Will meets Harry’s eyes, both of them losing hope.

                                 WILL
                        You four are my top engineers. Are 
                        you honestly telling me this can’t be 
                        done?

           Will throws his pencil at the table. The engineers fall 
           silent, avoiding their boss’s eyes. 

                                 ENGINEER #1
                             (timid)
                        The top section just has us coming in 
                        at too much of an angle to add more - 

                                 WILL
                        Do you think I don’t understand the 
                        goddamn problem?! The point is to 
                        find an answer...which apparently you 
                        can’t do! Not one of you!

           Harry puts a calming hand onto Will’s shoulder.

                                 HARRY
                             (sotto; to Will)
                        Maybe we let these men get home to 
                        their families. 

           A beat. Will takes a breath and nods, knowing Harry’s right.

                                 WILL
                             (to the engineers)
                        I appreciate your hard work, 
                        gentlemen. But you should all get 
                        home now.

                             (off their hesitancy to 
                              leave)
                        It’s fine. We’re all tired and 
                        tomorrow’ll be here soon enough. 
                        Go...kiss your wives, tuck in your 
                        little ones.

           Will stands, pats each of them on the back as they head 
           toward the exit. When the last one leaves, Will shuts the 
           door softly, turning slowly to face Paul and Harry. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        There’s nothing to figure out.
                             (then)
                        We can’t win...

           INT. WALTER CHRYSLER’S BOARDROOM - DAY

           Will and Chrysler sit at opposite sides of the boardroom. 
           Will sits silently as Chrysler reads from the New York Times. 

           ANGLE ON THE HEADLINE: “Chrysler Architect Concedes Tallest 
           Crown to Bank of Manhattan” 

           After a few moments, Chrysler looks up.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Okay...just had to read it again to 
                        make sure I hadn’t lost my infernal 
                        mind.
                             (off Will)
                        I thought I was pretty clear the 
                        other day on what I expected from 
                        you, so now I’m going to give you 
                        sixty seconds, and not a single 
                        second more, to explain yourself.

           Off Will...

           EXT. BANK OF MANHATTAN BUILDING - DAY

           On a raised platform, Craig stands behind a microphone, 
           extremely pleased with himself. Looking out on the thousands 
           of faces staring back. Several streets closed off for the 
           crowds, balloons in patriotic colors framing everything in 
           site.

           ON WILL, HARRY, AND MEG - standing a block away from the 
           epicenter, the three of them leaning against another 
           building, watching the hoopla.

                                 MEG
                        And he didn’t fire you?
                                 WILL
                        Believe it or not, no.

                                 MEG
                        What did you say to him?

                                 WILL
                        I told him to trust me.

                                 HARRY
                        You told Walter Chrysler to trust 
                        you.

                                 WILL
                        Yep. Told him I had a plan.

                                 MEG
                        And do you?

                                 WILL
                        Nope. Not a thing.

           All three of them look toward the stage.

                                 HARRY
                        Look at that arrogant ass. Why don’t 
                        we just add another fifteen floors 
                        now that there’s nothing he can do 
                        about it?

                                 WILL
                        Craig’s not an idiot. And he 
                        certainly doesn’t trust me. He waited 
                        until we started construction on our 
                        top section...

                                 MEG
                        Knowing you’d be out of options...

           ANGLE ON Craig Severance - standing on the stage, waving 
           triumphantly to the crowd.

                                 HARRY
                        My god, I despise that guy.

           ON CRAIG - on the platform stage, waving his hands to quiet 
           the crowd.

                                 CRAIG
                        Hello, everyone! Thank you for 
                        celebrating this great event with us 
                        today! My name is Craig Severance, 
                        and I’m very proud to have designed 
                        what is now...
                                 (MORE)
                                 CRAIG (CONT'D)
                             (looking up toward the 
                              building’s peak)
                        ...the tallest building on the 
                        planet!

           Loud APPLAUSE from the crowd... 

           ON WILL - squeezing his eyes shut as Craig’s echoing voice 
           continues on in the b.g.. After an extended beat, he can’t 
           take it anymore, striding off. Meg and Harry let him go...

           EXT. CHRYSLER BUILDING WORK SITE - DAY

           Morning sunlight waking up Manhattan.

           Will approaches the works site’s border fence, where he spots 
           Ted and Chip, standing together, talking casually.

                                 WILL
                        Morning, Ted. How are ya, Chip.

           Both men look at Will, neither one responding. And then - 

           The two of them start CLAPPING. Will raises an eyebrow - 
           bemused, but continuing on his way.

           And as he passes each WORKER, they all stop what they’re 
           doing and, one by one, join in the APPLAUSE. Men pause their 
           conversations, they rise from their makeshift seats, they 
           stop their hammers in mid-swing...and together, they create a 
           standing ovation for Will. 

           The power of their appreciation growing in volume until it’s 
           echoing off the surrounding buildings.

           ON WILL - taking in this sincere display of gratitude and 
           respect. He looks up to the towering steel frame of the 
           almost recognizable Chrysler Building to see hundreds of his 
           MEN, joining in the CHEER, CLANGING their tools against the 
           steel beams. Anything to make noise, louder with each passing 
           moment.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                             (to Harry; shouting)
                        What is this?

                                 HARRY
                        You give a damn about them, Will. And 
                        they love you for it.

           ON MEG - clapping along with the rest. Winking at Will as he 
           looks over.
           INT. WILL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Alone in his room, Will paces, desperation in every step. 

                                 WILL
                        What’s the plan...what is it?...c’mon 
                        now...

           We stay with him as he paces...until, finally, he glances up. 
           Freezing in his tracks immediately.  

           MOVING IN on Will’s eyes. Fixated. Gripped by a thought.

           REVERSE on what he sees: MOVING IN on ALAN’S SWORD, sitting 
           on the floor in the corner of the room. Sleek and narrow, its 
           point aimed toward the ceiling.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CHRYSLER BUILDING WORK SITE - DAY

           As Will rapidly signs a series of forms, a MAN approaches 
           cautiously, fidgeting as he waits his turn. Will hands the 
           forms to a waiting assistant, who hustles off. 

                                 MAN
                        ‘Scuse me, Mr. Van Alen? I’m sorry to 
                        bother you...

           Will turns. REVERSE ON THE MAN (It’s Ned Sheuster - from the 
           opening sequence) He looks frail, unable to maintain eye 
           contact.

                                 WILL
                        What can I do for you, friend?

                                 NED
                        Name’s Ned Sheuster, sir. I do 
                        construction work. I was hoping you’d 
                        consider bringing me on.

                                 WILL
                        Any reason I shouldn’t, Ned?

           Ned looks down at the ground. The memory still hard for him.

                                 NED
                        I worked alongside the same fella for 
                        years and we were good pals -
                             (stopping himself; resets)
                        It’s just...you may have read about 
                        the accident in the papers...his name 
                        was Tom Coleman...had a wife and a 
                        young boy...
           Will sees how hard this is for Ned.

                                 WILL
                        You good at keeping secrets, Ned?
                             (off Ned)
                        ‘Cause I’ve got a doozy for you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHRYSLER BUILDING FIRE SHAFT - MINUTES LATER

           We’re in the central core of the building. A heavy steel door 
           opens, letting in a rush of sunlight to the fire shaft 
           (essentially, a 600 foot vertical tunnel, with exposed stairs 
           running along the wall, top to bottom). Will and Ned enter 
           into the dimmed light of the shaft.

                                 WILL
                        C’mon, Ned, let me show you what 
                        you’re gonna be working on.

           Ned follows Will down a few sets of stairs until they stop at 
           one of the stair landings. Will motions for Ned to look just 
           past the railing.

           As Ned turns his head, we see what he sees: The gleaming 
           silver of a sharp point. It appears to be hovering there 
           until Ned looks over the edge: The needle going down, 
           widening gradually to its base over 180 feet below them.

           Ned reaches out and touches the sharp point with his finger.

                                 NED
                        What is this?

           Will puts his arm around Ned.

                                 WILL
                        You just touched what’s about to be 
                        the top of the world, my friend.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. LEXINGTON AVE. AND 42ND STREET (NYC) - DAY

           The workers dissolving into curious onlookers and excited 
           families - a few hundred people milling around. A BRASS 
           QUARTET PLAYS a cheerful tune for the crowd.

           Harry, Meg, and Will stand among the onlookers. Meg snaps a 
           couple of photos.
                                 MEG
                             (forced optimism)
                        It’s not a bad crowd.

                                 HARRY
                        About a third the size of Craig’s.

           Meg elbows Harry.

                                 HARRY (CONT’D)
                        Which...is much more intimate. More 
                        sincere if you ask me.

           Will’s not listening, scanning the crowd, searching for a 
           face. Ned comes running up, the spark returned to his eyes.

                                 WILL
                        Hey there, Ned. How are we doing? 
                        Everything set?

                                 NED
                        Twenty minutes, sir. Thirty, tops.

           Will pats Ned on the shoulder. Ned heads off.

           Will goes back to scanning the crowd. After an extended beat, 
           he finds his mark. Will heads for him.

                                 WILL
                        Larry! Larry Hopkins!

           Larry Hopkins (from the New York Times) turns, offering an 
           indifferent wave as Will approaches.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming, Larry. I promise 
                        you won’t be sorry.

                                 LARRY
                        Listen, I’m going to be honest with 
                        you. Even though I’m here, and this 
                        is one heck of an fine structure, 
                        it’s unlikely The Times will do you 
                        any better than page seven or eight. 
                        ‘Second tallest building opens’ isn’t 
                        much of a headline. You understand...

                                 WILL
                        Front page tomorrow. You can thank me 
                        later.

                                 LARRY
                        Will, we already ran a story about 
                        you building a seventy-seven story 
                        building. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LARRY (CONT'D)
                        And I’m standing here, looking up at 
                        a seventy-seven story building. I 
                        don’t know what you think my angle’s 
                        gonna be.

                                 WILL
                        Have a little faith, will ya’ Larry?

           Larry laughs, checks his pocket watch. 

                                 LARRY
                        Okay. I like your spirit.

           EXT. LEXINGTON AVE. AND 42ND STREET (NYC) - LATER

           Will’s eyes are focused on the top of the building. He checks 
           his own watch, then looks back to the building. All nervous 
           energy.

                                 CHRYSLER (O.C.)
                        So, was I right to trust you?

           Will turns to see Chrysler a few feet away.

                                 WILL
                        With great risk comes great reward.

           Chrysler grins, recognizing his own words. 

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Or great and total failure.

           Will nods uneasily. He spots Larry, the reporter, off to the 
           side, smoking and checking his watch. Will knows it’s time to 
           roll. He weaves through the crowd, taking his place at the 
           microphone on - 

           THE PLATFORM STAGE

           WILL’S POV - he spots Meg and Harry in the crowd. They each 
           give him a reassuring nod.

                                 WILL
                             (into the microphone; 
                              nervous)
                        Well, this is it...hard to believe 
                        the day has finally arrived. So, um, 
                        thank you for being here. I know 
                        you’ve all read about the Bank of 
                        Manhattan Building, which happens to 
                        be the tallest building in New 
                        York...or anywhere else for that 
                        matter.
           ANGLE ON CRAIG SEVERANCE - watching anonymously from the back 
           of the crowd. Dripping with smug satisfaction.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        And I want to congratulate them on 
                        building something that will endure 
                        for decades...possibly, um, 
                        centuries. It’s really a beautiful 
                        building, if you haven’t seen it yet.

           ANGLE ON WALTER CHRYSLER - glancing around, uncomfortable. 
           Clearly disappointed in Will’s performance so far.

           WILL’S POV - One person in the crowd moving closer to the 
           stage. It’s Ned. Ned gives Will a simple nod.

           Will looks out to the crowd. New confidence in his voice, 
           which continues as we PAN OVER THE FACES OF THE CROWD, many 
           of them, men who’ve worked on the site. Faces we recognize.

                                 WILL (V.O) (CONT’D) 
                        But you came here today to see this 
                        building. The Chrysler Building. A 
                        building that honors the ingenuity 
                        and success of Walter Chrysler...
                             (pause for polite 
                              applause)
                        ...but maybe even more so, honors the 
                        undying hope of all of you. 
                             (beat)
                        At a time when our spirits have been 
                        tested and our families have been 
                        strained, we had no business creating 
                        a towering tribute to hope. A 
                        colossal monument to optimism for the 
                        future.
                             (beat)
                        And yet here it is.

           The crowd CHEERS loudly.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I present to 
                        you...the new tallest structure ever 
                        built by mankind. Anywhere on earth.

           Will turns his head, looking to the back of the crowd, 
           exactly where Craig Severance stands. And he winks.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                             (looking at Craig)
                        Take it away, boys!

           ANGLE ON CRAIG - his eyes narrow. He forgets to breathe.
           A SUCCESSION OF ANGLES - ON CHRYSLER, ON LARRY, ON MEG AND 
           HARRY -- all of them looking skyward.

           THE ENTIRE CROWD - all eyes looking up to  --

           THE TOP OF THE CHRYSLER BUILDING 

           Perched on the 75th floor, near the top, a DERRICK (a kind of 
           crane with a movable pivoted arm used for lifting heavy 
           objects) sits motionless, its line dipping down into the peak 
           of the building.

           And then...when nothing happens, everyone starts to look at 
           each other. Confused. Chrysler squeezes at the bridge of his 
           nose as MURMURS begin to spread through the crowd.

           ON WILL - His eyes fixed on the derrick. Trying to will it to 
           move.

           ON MEG AND HARRY - Still looking up. Their faith holding 
           fast.

                                 HARRY
                             (sotto)
                        C’mon now...

           AT THE TOP OF THE BUILDING

           The derrick’s arm moves. Barely noticeable at first, but we 
           can hear the slight HUM of a motor. And then...a sharply 
           pointed silver peak begins to poke from the top of the 
           building. 

           ON THE CROWD - one by one, the faces begin to look back to 
           the building’s apex. Some of the people pointing with 
           excitement.

           Like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, the gleaming 
           SILVER SPIRE rises. Foot by foot. Growing longer by the 
           second. Finally pausing its growth 185 feet later.

           ON WILL - exhaling the last seven years of stress. Closing 
           his eyes with relief as the crowd ERUPTS with CHEERS behind 
           him.

           ANGLE ON THE CHRYSLER BUILDING - against a blue sky, the 
           great skyscraper in its final form.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. WALTER CHRYSLER’S EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY

           Will and Chrysler sit across from each other, Chrysler’s wide 
           desk separating them. Will looks relaxed, at ease...
                                 CHRYSLER
                        Well, my boy, you must be relieved to 
                        be done with me.

                                 WILL
                        Congratulations on everything, sir.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Yeah, well...

           Chrysler stands, moves to a window.

                                 CHRYSLER (CONT’D)
                        I assume you’re here for your fee.

                                 WILL
                        No, sir. I mean, yes I do need to 
                        resolve that, but -

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I’d prefer you just talk with my 
                        accountants on that. You understand, 
                        I don’t handle those things 
                        personally.

                                 WILL
                        Of course, that’s fine. But I was 
                        hoping to talk with you about our 
                        deal.

           Chrysler narrows his eyes, looking confused. 

                                 CHRYSLER
                        What deal is that, William?

                                 WILL
                        The one involving my brother. His 
                        parole? 

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Ah, that. I remember we talked about 
                        that a bit. You understand those 
                        kinds of things take some time. I 
                        can’t just snap my fingers and 
                        circumvent the United States 
                        judiciary system.

                                 WILL
                             (growing nervous)
                        Of course, but, as you said, your 
                        connections...I mean, you mentioned 
                        friends with certain influence.
                                 CHRYSLER
                        Oh, sure, sure.
                             (sitting on the edge of 
                              his desk)
                        By the way, you had a chance to see 
                        that plot of land over on 34th and 
                        5th?

                                 WILL
                             (wary)
                        I believe I’ve passed it by...

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Don’t know if you’ve heard, but a 
                        group of political blue-bloods are 
                        getting in the skyscraper business. 
                        Constructing something they’re 
                        calling the Empire State Building on 
                        that land.

           Will nods. Uninterested.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Chrysler, but I’m not 
                        following how this applies to my 
                        brother or our deal.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I just bring it up because I heard 
                        they’re planning to go to over twelve-
                        hundred feet. We’re at one-thousand 
                        and fifty if I’m not mistaken.
                             (a beat)
                        Cement’s not even dry and we’re 
                        already looking at second place. 
                        Disappointing, don’t you think?

                                 WILL
                             (growing in anger)
                        All due respect, but we’re currently 
                        sitting in the highest room on the 
                        planet. We were the first structure 
                        to go higher than the Eiffel Tower...

                                 CHRYSLER
                        And you should be tremendously proud. 
                        There’s no reason to get excited 
                        here. I just thought we’d hold the 
                        title for more than a few months. 

           Chrysler stands, holds out his arm for Will to move toward 
           the exit.

                                 CHRYSLER (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, I appreciate you stopping by. 
           Will stands, defeated, starts moving toward the door. But 
           then it becomes too much to take. He stops suddenly, turns 
           toward Chrysler’s surprised face.

                                 WILL
                        No! I will not be handled. We had an 
                        agreement! My half was completed as 
                        promised and in its entirety. I 
                        expect the same from you.

           A beat. Then Chrysler smirks. Condescending.

                                 CHRYSLER
                        Do you even understand what I do for 
                        a living? I push people to be better 
                        than they are. It’s what I do, and 
                        I’m very good at it. You’ll be 
                        relevant thanks to me, Van Alen. Your 
                        name might actually mean something to 
                        your great grandchildren.

                                 WILL
                        You honestly believe I should be 
                        thanking you for my place in history?

                                 CHRYSLER
                        I do, in fact. But it doesn’t appear 
                        to be your intention to do that, 
                        so...

           Chrysler opens his office door.

                                 CHRYSLER (CONT’D)
                        Good day, William.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CHRYSLER BUILDING (64TH FLOOR) - DAY

           Will and Meg sit near each other on the building’s gargoyle 
           EAGLE HEADS (one of eight that look out over New York). The 
           fact that they’re 700 precarious feet above the earth 
           apparently lost on them. A gorgeous sunset lighting the world 
           around them...

                                 MEG
                             (glancing up toward the 
                              spire)
                        So, Mr. Van Alen Architect, can you 
                        show me where you etched your 
                        initials into this fine structure? 

                                 WILL
                        Nope.
                                 MEG
                        You’re not going to make me climb up 
                        there and look for them myself...

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t do it.

           Meg nods to herself, silently impressed. She watches him for 
           an extended beat as he stares out over the city.

                                 MEG
                        He hasn’t paid you yet, has he?

                                 WILL
                             (grins sarcastically)
                        Apparently, he didn’t officially 
                        approve one of the major budget 
                        items, so he said it has to come out 
                        of my fee.

                                 MEG
                        What’s he talking about? What budget 
                        item?

           A beat. Will pivots his head toward her.

                                 WILL
                        The spire.

           Meg raises her eyebrows, speechless. 

           She shakes her head, dumbfounded by the absurdity of it all. 
           After a couple beats - 

                                 MEG
                        I’m so sorry...

           Will nods to himself. Nothing else to say. 

           As a breeze flows past them, Meg hugs herself, trying to keep 
           warm.

                                 WILL
                             (starting to stand)
                        We should get you inside, let you 
                        warm up.

           But Meg stays seated, takes his hand...

                                 MEG
                        I’d love to stay a while more. I 
                        mean, if we can.
                             (off Will; beat)
                        Can we stay?
           Will lowers himself to the spot beside her. He puts his arm 
           around her, and then she rests her head onto his shoulder... 
           And that’s where we’ll leave them, the world spread out in 
           front of them. All of it, theirs... 

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Under the dim light of dawn, Will sits relaxed, his face 
           serene as his train cuts north out of Manhattan...

           EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME TIME

           At the top of the bridge’s west tower, Meg steps to the edge, 
           hundreds of feet over the East River. Lifting her eyes, she 
           spots the newest addition to the New York skyline.

           She lifts her camera to her eye...SNAP. Fulfilling a 
           promise...

           EXT. PRISON YARD (SING SING) - LATER

           Will moves across the prison yard, waving to a couple of 
           guards he recognizes. One of the guards holds up a newspaper, 
           calls out to him - 

                                 GUARD
                        Nice job, Mr. Van Alen! Was pulling 
                        for you the whole time!

                                 WILL
                        Thanks, Jimmy. You seen Terry around?

           JIMMY motions toward the cell block where a single file line 
           of prisoners are frisked one by one before stepping outside 
           to the yard...

                                 JIMMY
                        Should be coming out any minute.

           WILL’S POV - Terry steps into view, holding his arms straight 
           out for the morning pat down. 

           Terry finally spots Will, holds his arms wide -

                                 TERRY
                        Ain’t I somethin’? Standing here with 
                        the man who created the tallest 
                        building in the whole damn world. 

           The give each other a quick hug. 
                                 WILL
                        Second tallest in less than a year.

                                 TERRY
                             (oh, please)
                        What...that Empire State thing 
                        they’re puttin’ up?

           Will nods, Terry waves a dismissing hand at the air.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Who gives a damn about that? Who’s 
                        the tallest right now, Will? At this 
                        very moment?

           Will sees the energy in Terry’s eyes, feeling it. He finally 
           smiles.

                                 WILL
                        Okay...

                                 TERRY
                        You’re goddamn right, okay...
                             (checks his watch)
                        C’mon, follow me. You really need to 
                        see somethin’.

           As they walk --

                                 WILL
                        You know, Terry, I just started doing 
                        some work...I guess it’s more like 
                        giving advice...to the man who’s 
                        behind the Empire State Building.
                             (off Terry’s surprised 
                              face)
                        He’s a good man. Maybe even an honest 
                        one.

                                 TERRY
                             (smirks, then)
                        Well, you should ask the good, honest 
                        man to make his building a couple 
                        hundred feet shorter.

                                 WILL
                             (smiles)
                        Yeah...I’ll have to do that.
                             (then)
                        Anyway, Terry, he’s also a very 
                        connected man. Maybe someone who 
                        could help us...with all this.

                                 TERRY
                        Don’t worry about it, alright?
                                 WILL
                        You’re not understanding me. He was 
                        the Governor of New York, for 
                        starters. The guy knows everyone - 
                        every lawyer, every judge we could 
                        ever -

                                 TERRY
                        Let it go, will ya?

                                 WILL
                        Why? Why can’t we at least try?

                                 TERRY
                        Try? Shit, you can try all you want. 

           Terry stops, turns toward Will.

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        And who knows...maybe somethin’ comes 
                        of it. But I won’t live there, Will. 
                        I can’t. I live right here, right 
                        now. Where my big-shot brother just 
                        built the tallest structure on God’s 
                        green earth.

           Up ahead, a group of about ten PRISONERS huddle together, 
           smoking their cigarettes, passing the time.

           Will spots the group as Terry yells out to them - 

                                 TERRY (CONT’D)
                        Yo, boys! Surprise guest of honor!

           The group of about seven PRISONERS turn, smiling when they 
           recognize Will.

                                 PRISONER #1
                        Hey! Will!

                                 PRISONER #2
                             (joking)
                        Look at this guy! I look at his face 
                        all year in the newspaper, now I 
                        gotta look at it in person too?

                                 PRISONER #3
                        Congratulations, Will! 

                                 PRISONER #4
                        You were adopted, right? 
                             (re: Terry)
                        No way you came from the same loins 
                        as this numbnuts.  
           Laughter and more pats on the back for Will. Somehow, Will’s 
           one of them now. Terry checks his watch again.

                                 TERRY
                             (to Will)
                        C’mon, gotta keep moving. Almost 
                        time... 

           Terry keeps walking, toward the chain link fence, the one 
           spot where the prisoners can see beyond the stone walls. Will 
           hustles to catch up...

           AT THE FENCE

                                 WILL
                        Terry, what are we doing?

           Terry just holds his finger to his lips. And then...as 
           morning’s sunlight peaks above the horizon, lighting the 
           faces of these two brothers standing side by side - 

                                 TERRY
                             (sotto)
                        Any second now...

           Will watches Terry, following his gaze which is trained on 
           New York in the distance. 

           And then it happens. Sunlight strikes the top of the Chrysler 
           Building at the perfect angle, making it glow like a diamond.   
           Terry’s face reflects the glow, his mouth slowly curving into 
           a peaceful, satisfied grin.

           After an extended beat, Will finally turns to Terry...

                                 WILL
                             (getting it)
                        Okay...

           Terry puts his arm around Will’s shoulder. The two of them 
           viewing a distant New York...Chrysler as its centerpiece.

                                 TERRY
                        Okay...

           And as Terry tussles Will’s hair (like big brothers do), we 
           SLOWLY MOVE UP...to a height where nothing seems so far from 
           anything else. And the Chrysler Building looks out over all 
           of it...

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
