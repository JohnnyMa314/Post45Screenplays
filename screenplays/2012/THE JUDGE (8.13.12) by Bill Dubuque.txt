           EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE (CHICAGO) - DAY 

           A nine-story slab of grey granite.  An architectural 
           threat.  The fast clip of wing-tips tap-tap marble.    

           INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE-CORRIDOR - DAY  

           MIKE KATTAN, 40s, veteran prosecutor, strides, heated.

           INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE-MEN’S BATHROOM - DAY  

           Empty save for a SUIT at a urinal, back to us.  Urine 
           tickles porcelain, he exhales.  Hums.    

           The door bangs open, Kattan charges in, loud. 

                                 KATTAN
                        Palmer, you lying motherfu--

           A strong arc of PISS strafes Kattan across the knees. 
           Kattan brakes, gapes at the stain, then to-- 

           HANK PALMER, 40s, top criminal defense attorney, 
           considers the wet streak, Kattan.  Returns to the urinal.        

                                 KATTAN
                        You meant to do that.

                                   HANK
                                (urine flows)
                        No.  I don’t think I did.

           Kattan rips handfuls of paper towels, dabs at his pants.  

                                 KATTAN
                        This wasn’t some West Englewood 
                        drug sweep!  The search was good.  
                        No chance Meyers tosses it. 

                                 HANK
                        That’s why we call this an 
                        “evidentiary” hearing.              

                                 KATTAN
                        So you can smear me?  Imply  I 
                        invented a phantom witness?   

           Hank smiles, heads for a sink, begins to wash up.  His 
           silence baits Kattan. 
                                 KATTAN
                        The jaded lawyer with no respect 
                        for the law.  Original.

                                 HANK
                        I respect the law.  I’m just not 
                        in awe of it.

           Kattan gives up, eyes the piss-rags, disgusted.  

                                 KATTAN
                        You were a solid, respected 
                        prosecutor.  The hell happened to 
                        you--   

                                 HANK
                        Do your job, Kattan.  If the great 
                        state of Illinois can’t meet its 
                        burden of proof, it’s on you if I 
                        walk with a guilty client.  Now 
                        what’s the cliche you followed me 
                        in to the pisser to unload?  
                        Involve my reflection?  Maybe 
                        sleeping at night, how I do it?     
                                (his phone rings)
                        In a perfect Highland Park home 
                        next to a loving wife with the ass 
                        of a high school volley-baller.  

           Hank checks caller I.D., frowns.  Heads out.

                                 KATTAN 
                        How does it feel, Hank?  Really?  
                        Knowing every person you represent 
                        is good for it? 

                                 HANK
                        Christ, I hope so.  Innocent 
                        people scare the shit out of me.  

           INT. COOK COUNTY COURTROOM - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

           Hank and another KENNER-BLOOM LAWYER, 30s, at the defense 
           table.  The client; an antsy Insurance Company CEO, 50s.       

                                 KENNER-BLOOM LAWYER
                        A thousand says he doesn’t bite. 

           Kattan sits across the aisle, a FEMALE PROSECUTOR 
           whispers to him, glances at the defense.  Hank’s 
           Blackberry vibrates on the table.  
                                 CEO
                        If I lose, I’m going to prison.  
                        For a very long time.  Stop 
                        gambling with my life. 

                                 HANK
                        Mr. Stipe, Judge Meyers is about 
                        to walk in, take a seat, and ask 
                        if there is anything either side 
                        would like to add before he rules 
                        on my motion to suppress the files 
                        found on your home computer.  A 
                        motion he will deny-- 
                                (CEO’s face falls)
                        Meyers is elected, not appointed.

                                 CEO
                        He’s still a judge.

                                 HANK
                        And you’re the CEO of a Fortune 
                        500 insurance company charged with  
                        strategically denying coverage to 
                        terminally ill policy holders.  
                        Fraud, corruption, manslaughter...   
                        You’re an election year attack ad.  

           Hank keys his voicemail, listens.

                                 HANK 
                        But the prosecution isn’t the 
                        judge of character I am.  He’s 
                        indecisive, worried.  Wet.  Any 
                        second now that chippie will 
                        hustle upstairs where his 
                        informant -- in my opinion your 
                        former mistress -- is sitting in a 
                        spare office reading old InStyles.  
                        A mistress I need him to identify 
                        so I can disembowel her at trial.

           The three watch Kattan’s assistant stand, hurry out.  
           CEO, Lawyer turn as CHICAGO JUDGE enters.  Hank frozen. 

                                 CHICAGO JUDGE 
                        Before I rule on the defense 
                        motion, is there anything either 
                        of you would care to add?

                                 KATTAN
                        Yes, your honor...
                                 KENNER-BLOOM LAWYER
                        We didn’t shake on that.

           Loss, disbelief on Hank’s face.  He rises, unfocused.

                                 KATTAN
                        We’d like to remove any doubt as 
                        to the validity of our search and 
                        reveal the identity of our inform--   

                                 HANK
                        Approach, your honor?

           Chicago Judge waves Hank in, Kattan joins him.

                                 HANK
                        I need a continuance--

                                                          HANK
                           KATTAN
           Absolutely not--
                                              Three, four days tops.

                                 CHICAGO JUDGE 
                        Grounds?

                                 HANK
                        My mother died this morning.

                                 KATTAN
                                (exasperated)
                        My ass.

           EXT. HANK’S HOME - DAY   

           Upper middle class.  Hank’s Jaguar askew in the driveway. 

           INT. HANK’S HOME-GARAGE - DAY  

           Next to a Mercedes SUV, piles of men’s clothes lie draped 
           atop packed boxes.  Somebody moving in, more likely out.

           EXT. HANK’S HOME-BACK YARD - DAY  

           Hank drags a sputtering hose to wilting hydrangeas.  His 
           daughter, LAUREN, 6, wrestles with the kinked hose.

                                 HANK 
                                (into Blackberry)
                        Does anybody really look at prayer 
                        cards, Glen?  Pick a saint, any-- 
                                (points to hose)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANK  (CONT'D)
                        Un-kink it, Sweetie.  No, twist.
                                (back to Glen)
                        So we’re all staying at the house, 
                        right?  If I get there and find 
                        out it’s just me and the Judge, I 
                        will spray the place with shit... 
                        Look, I’ll see you guys tomorrow.       

           Hank disconnects.  Lauren grabs the flowing hose.  

                                 LAUREN
                        You have a potty mouth.

                                 HANK
                        Tell me about it.

                                 LAUREN
                        Why can’t I go with you?

                                 HANK
                        Maybe next time.

                                 LAUREN
                        Grandpa Palmer’s your daddy?

                                 HANK
                        He is.

                                 LAUREN
                        Why do you call him the Judge?

                                 HANK
                        That’s who he is.

                                 LAUREN
                        Are you sad over Grandma Palmer?

           He gently pushes her hands down, waters the roots.

                                 HANK
                        Yes, Lauren.  I am.

                                 LAUREN
                        I should go with you then.

           She grins, yields the hose, pats his trouser pocket. 

                                 HANK
                        Looking for something?
                                (she nods)
                        How do we ask?
                                 LAUREN
                        You got my Bit O’honey, old man?

           Hank pulls the candy out, she snaps it up, both happy.

                                 HANK
                        Hey.  Who loves you?

                                 LAUREN
                        You do, daddy.

           INT. HANK’S HOME-BEDROOM - DAY  

           Hank packs a suitcase, ignores his hovering soon-to-be-ex 
           LISA, 30s.  Her best days de-flowered by Hank.   

                                 LISA
                        Can I do something?  They’re my in-
                        laws, we should all--   

                                 HANK
                        I got your idiot lawyer’s letter.

                                                          HANK
                            LISA
           Hank, come on--
                                              What’d I tell you?

                                 LISA
                        You work seventy hours a week...  

                                 HANK
                        You poor thing; your soon to be ex-
                        husband has a strong work ethic.

                                 LISA
                        You’ll get her ready for school?  
                        Make sure she has clean clothes?  
                        That match?  Fix breakfast, pick 
                        her up, take her to dance, 
                        Brownies, soccer?  Get her 
                        homework done every night, her 
                        reading?  You never so much as 
                        changed one diaper when she--  
                                (voice cracks)
                        Did I screw up?  Absolutely.  Do I 
                        wish I could turn back the clock?  
                        Every day.  But I won’t let you 
                        punish her for it, Hank, I won’t.   

                                 HANK
                        “Let” doesn’t figure in this.  
                        When I find a place, we’re gone.  
                                 LISA
                        Hank--

                        And while I’m providing our

                        reconnect.  Ball your brains out.  

           Lisa quick-checks the open door for little ears.  

                                 HANK
                        Focus.  You don’t want to go head 
                        to head with me in court.  I.  
                        Don’t.  Lose.  Think that’s going 
                        to change when it’s my daughter on 
                        the line?  Whatever else you may 
                        be, you’re not stupid, Lisa.  Lean 
                        on that.   
                                (zips suitcase)
                        Still want to know if you can do 
                        something?  For me?

           She wipes her tears as he picks up the suitcase.

                                 HANK
                        Water.  The fucking.  Hydrangeas.

           INT./EXT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) - DAY  

           Rural Indiana interstate.  Hank’s rental blows past --

           Oceans of knee-high corn... grain silos and farm houses.  
           Red-tailed hawks perch on power lines, wait, watch.

           On a TWO-LANE... Faded Bible verse signs nailed to cattle 
           fences.  A weathered DOT sign: "Carlinville 5 miles."

           Trapped behind a huge sluggish tractor.  Hank slaloms 
           back, forth, considers the shoulder.

                                 HANK 
                                (into phone)
                        The local zealot kept cell towers 
                        five miles out of town, if I lose 
                        you-- so, Suze, whatta we got?

           He jerks the car back as a pick-up blurs by.  Close.
           AIR HORN blares as a semi jumps him from behind.  HOGS 
           peer at him from between slats of the passing trailer. 

                                 HANK
                        Get Cammaratta to continue Howe.  
                        If they piss and moan, just set it 
                        for trial.  What else?

           He guns it by the tractor.

                                 HANK
                        Wonderful.  Patch him through.
                        Hello?  Arthur?  Suzanne?    

           Dropped.  He no-look passes the phone into the backseat.

           EXT. COUNTRY LAKE - DAY   

           Hank ducks a tree limb, signal hunting.

                                 HANK 
                                (into Blackberry)
                        No, docket’s clear... I know it’s 
                        a fucking Fortune 500 company.  
                        Are you really reminding me how 
                        big this is, Arthur?  Me?

           He scoops a flat stone from the Earth.  Rubs dirt off it.

                                 HANK
                        No, they’re “our” billable hours 
                        and “my” reputation.  I’ll see you 
                        Monday.
                                (disconnects; sotto)
                        Forty-eight hours.  In.  Out.  Let 
                        it all just slide off your back.  

           Hank glances about.  This place has meaning to him.  A 
           past.  He side-arm whips the stone.  SPLOOSH.  No skip.  

           INT./EXT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) - DAY

           Main Street Carlinville... Store-front businesses, 
           pedestrians.  Hank reclines, slings his right arm across 
           the seat back.

           A pick-up rumbles in the opposite direction, the driver 
           raises one index finger off the wheel “hello.”  

           Hank lifts a finger in reply.  Instantly disgusted with 
           himself, he plants both hands on the wheel, straightens.  
           INT. FUNERAL HOME-LOBBY - DAY  

           Hank focuses on... A small sign, magnetic letters: Rose 
           Room, 5:00-8:00 p.m.  MARY PALMER.

           Hank unable to move. 

           INT. FUNERAL HOME-ROSE ROOM - DAY  

           Flowers.  Alone, Hank crosses... Open casket.  His eyes 
           settle on the body of MARY PALMER, 70s, hands folded.  
           His breath catches.

           He strokes her fingers.  On the edge of undone.  VIDEO 
           POV: Hank struggles, his back to us.  

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Hank. 

           Hank wipes wet eyes, turns, accepts what he sees. 

                                 HANK
                        Hey, Dale.

           POV shaky, Hank and his younger brother DALE, 30s, hug.  
           POV ends.  Dale lowers his camera, appears a tad 
           disheveled, handsome-ish, “off.”

                                 DALE
                        You look a touch outta round.  
                                (gives a second hug)
                        Her heart just kinda turned off.

           Hank’s throat lumps.  Dale has prayer cards, offers one. 

                                 DALE
                        St. Francis.  I picked.  He was 
                        her favorite.  Friend to the 
                        birds, like mom.  Gotta remember 
                        to put food out for them.  
                        ‘Specially in the winter.  He’s 
                        gentle, like mom used to be.

           Hank pretends to study St. Francis, fights tears-- 

                                 DALE
                        Ran the snakes out of Indiana.

                                 HANK
                        Again?
                                 DALE
                        St. Francis.  He scared the snakes 
                        outta Indiana.  Don’t ask me how.

                                 HANK
                        Ireland.  Out of Ireland.

                                 DALE
                        Busy guy.

                                 HANK
                        No.  Snakes are your constant.  
                        But St. Patrick, not Francis.  And 
                        Ireland.  Not Indiana. 

                                 DALE
                                (displays a card)
                        That’s French Lick.  

                                 HANK
                        It’s Italy, Dale, he’s Italian.
                                (eyes prayer card)
                        Nothing.  Trust me, nobody’s 
                        dispersing reptiles in Indiana.

           They face their mom for a beat, Hank knows it’s coming--

                                 DALE
                        Were you there?

                                 HANK
                                (smirks; loving)
                        I was not there.   

                                 GLEN (O.S.)
                        I don’t know whether to shit or go 
                        blind... 

           Hank’s older brother GLEN, 40s, ex-athlete faded to soft, 
           tired eyes, crosses the room.  FUNERAL DIRECTOR trails.     

                                 GLEN
                        Hank Palmer in Carlinville.

                                 HANK
                        Christ, Glen, what’s she feeding 
                        you?  Can you still climb a 
                        pitcher’s mound?    

           Glen with a weight-of-the-world sigh, shakes Hank’s hand.

                                 DALE
                        Glen.
           Dale extends a hand to Glen, who one-pumps it, annoyed.

                                 GLEN
                        I see you everyday, Dale. 
                                (to Hank)
                        Where’s the family?

                                 HANK
                        Couldn’t make it, school and all. 

                                 GLEN
                        Kids in Chicago go to school in 
                        the summer do they?

           Hank ignores the question, telegraphs his answer.

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        Hank, my condolences.  So, fellas--   
                                (hesitates)
                        Your mother seems to have passed 
                        without funeral insurance-- 

                                                          HANK
                            GLEN
           We’ll figure it out, Jerry.
                                              What’s the damage?

                                 FUNERAL DIRECTOR
                        Just north of fourteen thousand.

           Hank produces a black AMEX.  Glen chafes, subordinated.   

                                 HANK
                        We can settle up later.

                                 DALE
                        Not with me.  Thanks Hank.

                                 HANK
                        Where is he anyway?

           EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY  (ESTABLISHING)

           1800s era.  A silver dome.  Roman columns.  Majestic.      

                                 DEADBEAT DAD (PRE-LAP V.O.)
                        Whatta ya want to hear?  Nobody’s 
                        hiring, you can’t get spinach from 
                        a turnip.  Get whoever did that to 
                        her to pay child support. 
           INT. COURTHOUSE-COURT ROOM BALCONY - DAY  

           Hank slides down in a seat, feet up, looks out over--

           The JUDGE, JOSEPH PALMER, 70s, robed, at the bench.  The 
           COURT STENOGRAPHER types, an old BAILIFF stands in the 
           wings.  Knots of people in a mostly empty gallery. 

           Before the Judge stands a red-haired DEADBEAT DAD.  
           Across the aisle, the Deadbeat’s very pregnant EX, her  
           lawyer, C.P KENNEDY, 30s, and a carrot-top TODDLER.  

                                 DEADBEAT
                        Truth be told, Judge, I’m not 
                        entirely convinced he’s mine.

           INT. COURTHOUSE-COURT ROOM

           Everyone looks at the toddler: Deadbeat’s SPITTING IMAGE.  

           INTERCUT BALCONY (HANK) AND COURT ROOM (JUDGE)

           Judge picks at callouses on his hands, not fully engaged.

           C.P clears his throat, catches the Judge’s eye.  Hands 
           low, C.P mimics steering a steering wheel.    

                                 THE JUDGE
                        That your new truck out front?  

                                 DEADBEAT
                        Yeah.

           C.P winces.  Amused menace radiates from the Judge.  

                            HANK
                                                    THE JUDGE (O.S.)
           “Yeah” is not an 
           affirmation a man uses in 
           court.  Try again.
                                              “Yeah” is not an 
                                              affirmation a man uses in 
                                              court.  Try again.

                                 DEADBEAT
                                (snotty)
                        Yes, sir, Judge, your hon--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Keys.

                                 DEADBEAT
                        Keys?  Wh--?
                                 THE JUDGE
                        Focus!  Truck keys, c’mon, c’mon.
                        Pitch ‘em.

           Rattled, Deadbeat tosses the keys to the Bailiff.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Title in the glove box?  

                                 DEADBEAT
                        Well.  Yeah but--
                                (catches himself)
                        Yes, yes, sir, it’s in--

           Deadbeat flustered, confused.  The Judge stares at the 
           Bailiff.  A question.  C.P sees it, patient.

           Hank notices something is not right with the Judge. 

                                 BAILIFF
                                (gentle reminder)
                        Augustus, Ju--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Gus, give those to Mr. Williams’ 
                        ex-wife, please.  Then escort Mr. 
                        Williams to his ex-truck... 

           Bailiff starts to the Ex.  Deadbeat’s objection cut off-- 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You.  Are going to sign that 
                        vehicle over to her.
                                (to ex-wife)
                        And you, ma’am, are going to go 
                        down to DeVaney Motors, ask for 
                        Mike DeVaney, the father not the 
                        nimwit son, and sell your new 
                        truck back to him for whatever the 
                        “turnip” there put down on it.  
                                (dismissive)
                        That oughtta keep the cable on.   

                                 DEADBEAT
                        This ain’t fair!  How’m I suppose--   

           BAM!  The Judge slaps the bench, the room flinches.  Not 
           Hank, at the receiving end of this temper for years. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        One more word.  Go on.  Close your 
                        eyes, reach into my bag of tricks 
                        and see if you pull out “fair.” 
           Deadbeat decides otherwise, lets Bailiff lead him out.  
           Deadbeat’s Ex and her son clear their seats.

                                 EX
                        Thank you very much, judge.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (points to her belly)
                        Want me to tell you what causes 
                        that, ma’am?

           Her face burns.  She turns, half drags the boy behind 
           her.  He squints back at the Judge who bangs his gavel.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Next!  C.P, you’re up again.

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)

           Light spills through the windows of the two-story.    

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-BACK YARD - NIGHT 

           Hank and Glen at a picnic table, Dale delivers bottles of 
           beer.  Hank looks around, unaccustomed to the old yard. 

                                 DALE
                        How many people was that? 

                                 GLEN
                        Eight hundred signed the book.

                                 HANK
                        Think of the tally if the Hemmings 
                        crew could read and write.     

           Hank watches Dale break into a wide smile, his payoff.   

                                 GLEN
                        Why do you have to do that?

                                 HANK
                        Do what?  What did I do now, Glen?

           The screen door creaks, the Judge shuffles to his boys.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’m going to shower up and hit the 
                        rack.  Glen, make sure you hold my 
                        boys together tomorrow.  They were 
                        close to their grandmother. 
                                 GLEN
                        Will do, Judge.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (to Dale; gentle)
                        I have to worry about you? 

           Dale’s eyes shine, he smiles, shakes his head.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Hank.  Do me a favor.  Back your 
                        car into the driveway for the 
                        duration.  Easy to move that way. 

           The Judge leaves.  Hank watches him go, no love lost.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT  

           Hank wanders the space; neat, familiar.  A tightly made 
           bed, a sewing machine on a tiny desk.  Chest of drawers; 
           family photos slid beneath its protective glass top.  

           He picks up perfume, sniffs; the smell of his mom.   

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                        Panties and bras two drawers down.

           The Judge enters.  Hank awkwardly replaces the perfume.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-HANK’S ROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

           30-year old tattered Batman, Avengers, Teen Titans comics 
           on a nightstand.  Hank lies awake in his old single bed.  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Saran-wrapped sympathy food covers every flat surface.  
           Hank forks apple pie onto a plate.  He schleps to the 
           dated fridge, jerks open the sticky freezer door.  

           An envelope slides from freezer to pie... then, a stiff 
           cascade of frozen bills, junk mail.  A newspaper thuds. 

           Hank picks up the completed Times crossword puzzle.  WTF? 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-GARAGE - NIGHT 

           Hank selects a screwdriver from a tool-filled pegboard.  
           Behind him, a pristine ‘82 slant-back Cadillac Seville.    
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 

           Dark.  A flashlight between his teeth, Hank expertly 
           picks a liquor cabinet lock with the screwdriver.  Pops 
           it.  He checks a bottle of Jack.  Half-empty.   

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING

           Hank, dark suit, damp hair, looks into empty bedrooms.  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-STAIRWELL - MORNING

           Hank hustles down, checks his watch, head on a swivel.  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-GARAGE - MORNING 

           Hank stares at the empty, oil-stained space.      

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA - MORNING 

           Hank drives down Main, feelings hurt.  He double-takes.  
           Parked in front of a diner... the Judge’s ‘82 Seville.  

           INT. FLYING DEER DINER - MORNING 

           Busy.  The Judge, Glen, Dale at the counter, scraps on 
           plates.  Hank takes a stool, furthest from his father. 

                                 DALE
                        Hey, Hank.  You want breakfast?

                                 GLEN
                        You better hustle. 

                                 HANK
                        Alerting me to your departure 
                        might have been a reasonable thing 
                        to do.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        A lawyer’s favorite word. 

                                 HANK
                                (to Waitress)
                        Can I get some coffee here?
                                 JUDGE
                        I didn’t think this place would be 
                        your brand of bourbon.

                                 HANK
                        You would know.

                                 JUDGE
                        Pass that to your brother.

           The Judge hands Dale a folded check.  Glen almost hides 
           his satisfaction.  The Judge stands, lays down cash.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        On the house, Judge.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Albert’s college fund, Bea.

           The Judge exits, Glen, Dale follow.  Hank eyes the 
           Judge’s check for $14,100.  

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Still letting him wind you up. 

           SAM, 40-ish, fills his coffee mug.  Long hair, second-
           shift-sexy, apron over a funeral-ready black number.    

                                 SAM
                        Kept your hair obviously.  All 
                        that worry for nothing.  

                                 HANK
                                (thrown)
                        Samantha.

           INT. DINER - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

           Hank eats an omelette, Sam sits next to him. 

                                 HANK
                        Surprised you still work here.
                                (foot in mouth)
                        In the way people are when 
                        discovering a person they know has 
                        had the same job for twenty years.  

                                 SAM
                        You remind me of someone else.

                                 HANK
                        You only remind me of you.  
           She flips his tie over a shoulder, avoiding spills. 

                                 SAM
                        I’m reverse-aging.  Skin’s 
                        tighter, I see better.  Wake up 
                        and my ass is higher than it was 
                        the day before.  

           They smile, have history, a spark.  

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry about your mom.  After 
                        you left, Mary and I stayed close 
                        for quite a while.   

           She climbs off the stool, unties her apron.

                                 SAM
                        You comin’?

           He glances into the kitchen.

                                 SAM
                        The boss knows.  You think I dress 
                        like this every day?  

           EXT. CEMETERY-PARKING LOT - DAY    

           Grey.  Mourners pull out of the lot.  

           Hank and Dale follow Glen, his wife AMY, 40s, solid, and 
           their TEEN SONS to their cars.  Dale slides into Hank’s 
           rental, numb, cried out. 

           A TORNADO SIREN begins to moan, builds.  Hank eyes about.

                                 DALE
                        Tornado warning.  First Wednesday 
                        of the month.

           Hank leans his forearms against the Impala.  His POV: 

           EXT. CEMETERY-GRAVE SIDE - DAY  

           The Judge sits by the coffin, alone.  Siren ebbs, stops.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        What do you think?  Not so far 
                        from folks you’ll be alone, not so 
                        close you’ll be crowded.
                                (looks around)
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE JUDGE (CONT'D)
                        Dale will like that sycamore there 
                        won’t he?  Used to put his little 
                        face up against the smooth sides.   
                        Glen would put a tree house up 
                        there.  Hank’d burn it down.
                                (stands; emotional)
                        I’m afraid to leave, Mary.  I know 
                        you’re not in there, but... Once I 
                        do they’ll start with the shovels.  
                                (switching gears)
                        Forty-five years.  Who does that 
                        anymore?  Just you and me.  No 
                        kids, no courthouse.  Just that 
                        little place over on Spruce.  
                        How I used to make you laugh.  
                        I’ll be back tomorrow. 
                                (kisses the coffin)
                        And every day after that.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-FAMILY ROOM - DAY  

           Post-funeral.  Dale and Glen slump on the couch.  Hank in 
           the E-Z chair, reads Blackberry e-mails, feigns interest--

                                 HANK 
                        Either of your boys throw like 
                        their old man?

                                 DALE
                        He can’t throw, Hank, you broke--

                                 GLEN
                        Joe can really whip it.  Alex, not 
                        so much.

                                 HANK
                        You two might want to keep an eye 
                        out.  I think he’s drinking again.

                                 GLEN
                        What?  Bullshit.  He’s been sober 
                        twenty-eight years.

                                 HANK
                        I was at the courthouse, he forgot 
                        Gus’ name.  Gus.  I found mail.  
                        In the freezer.  Look at the man, 
                        he’s thin as a rail.  You probably 
                        don’t notice because you’re around 
                        him all the time.
                                 GLEN
                        What would we do without you?

           Message delivered, Hank shrugs.

                                 GLEN
                        Time’s your flight tomorrow?

                                 HANK
                        Not soon enough.

           The Judge appears, comment heard.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’m going for groceries.

                                 DALE
                        Want me to drive?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t know, Dale, does being 
                        widowed make me a lousy Goddamn 
                        driver?
                                (Dale cowed)
                        Hank, if I don’t see you before 
                        you leave, thanks for coming.  
                        Your mother would have appreciated 
                        it.

           The Judge departs.  Glen, Dale stink-eye Hank. 

           INT. FLYING DEER TAVERN - NIGHT 

           Country music.  Video camera POV: close-up scan of Hank’s 
           eyes, then hairline, a small pale crescent scar located.      

                                 DALE (O.S.)
                        Readers Digest? 

                                 HANK (O.S.)
                        TV Guide, Fall preview 1982.

           POV zooms out: seated at the bar, Glen nurses a beer, 
           Hank mainlines Scotch. 

                                 GLEN
                        He threw to get our attention, not 
                        draw blood.

                                 HANK
                        He talked to us like dogs to get 
                        our attention.

                        He launched periodicals for sport.  
                        Come.  Go.  Quiet.  Sit.  Speak. 

                                 GLEN
                        Hey, John Ford, give it a rest. 

           Video POV ends, Dale lowers the camera.

           Hank watches a gorgeous woman (CARLA), 20-ish, tight 
           skirt, join two women and three REDNECKS at a table. 

                                 GLEN
                        It wasn’t all bad.  Remember when 
                        we’d go fishing as kids?  

                                 DALE
                        The Zenith radio.  Paul Harvey.

                            HANK
                                                    REDNECK 1 (O.S.)
           Paul-fuckin-Harvey.
                                              Hey, man...

                                 DALE
                        We’d stay out all day... until 
                        everybody had their fish.  

                                 GLEN
                        Even if he had to hook it.  Hand 
                        us the pole, act surprised.

           Rednecks and their dates eyeball the Palmers.

                                 REDNECK 1
                        Hey, scuze me.  I know you.
                                (to Glen)
                        Don’t you run the tire and rim 
                        shop over on State?  Palmer?

                                 GLEN
                        That’s me.

                                 REDNECK 3
                                (points to Dale)
                        I know you too.  You’re the wet 
                        head always with the video camera.
                                (to Hank)
                        Don’t know you.

                                 REDNECK 2
                        Judge Palmer’s your old man?

           Glen takes a drink, knows where this is going.
                                 REDNECK 1
                        Your dad’s an asshole.

           The Rednecks, women laugh.  Carla abandons her friends, 
           takes a stool one down from Hank.

                         REDNECK 2
                                                         CARLA
                   (to Carla; laughing)
                                              It gets so old, Tommy.
           Oh, c’mon, Carla.

                                 GLEN
                        Maybe you three would like to 
                        discuss my father outside. 

           Dale jets up, grabs his bottle by the neck, weapon-ready.  

                                 HANK
                                (to his brothers)
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are we the 
                        Cartwrights?  I’m not rolling 
                        around in a parking lot... Calm 
                        down.  I know all these guys.

           Rednecks confused.  Hank swivels, leans back, faces them.

                                 HANK
                        They’re angry for a reason.  So, 
                        who has the DWI?  Plural?  Pled it 
                        out?  Suspended license?  Ah, no 
                        insurance; employment options are 
                        even more limited than your lack 
                        of marketable skills would 
                        normally dictate.  I’m guessing 
                        there’s probably a domestic 
                        violence, assault, couple failures 
                        to appear in there.  At least two 
                        resisting arrests and without a 
                        doubt an indecent exposure-- 
                                (Redneck eyes dart)
                        Which sounds creepy, but only 
                        means somebody’s tiny bladder got 
                        tired of standing in the porta-
                        potty line at the Dogwood Festival 
                        and whipped it out around a cop.  
                                (to the two women)
                        I know you, too.  Reverse cowgirl 
                        good looks betrayed by poor skin 
                        and muffin tops.  All evidence of 
                        a local diet rich in Marlboros, 
                        Mountain Dew and semen.  
           Carla claps, laughs at her slack-jawed friends.  Chair 
           legs scrape the floor, Rednecks rise.  Glen stands, Hank 
           puts a hand on his brother.

                                 HANK
                        Relax.  Probation’s revoked as 
                        soon as a punch is thrown.  Which 
                        means if this three man circle 
                        jerk wants to stay on the outside, 
                        they’re going to have to swallow 
                        my abuse.  Open wide boys.     

           Redneck 1 feints a punch, Hank doesn’t flinch.  Rednecks 
           leave, insults over shoulders.

           Glen and Dale look at Hank, impressed, a bit intimidated.

                                 CARLA
                        How ‘bout me, Houdini?  Y’know me?

                                 HANK
                        Movie star good looks.  
                        Personality plus.  Strong teeth, 
                        class act.  You’ll go far.

           INT. TAVERN - NIGHT

           Their faces scrunched, Glen and Dale drink at the bar, 
           watch a distasteful scene.  Their view...    

           At a table, Carla on Hank’s lap.  Kissing.  Deep. 

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 

           Dale burps beside a drunk Hank, Glen reverses the Impala.   

                                 HANK
                                (to Glen)
                        Back it, back, back, back...

           CRUNCH.  Glen crumples the garage door.  

                                 HANK
                        Stop.

                                 GLEN
                        Dammit, you did that on purpose.  

                                 HANK
                        No.  I don’t think I did.
                                 GLEN
                        You bang it out, smart ass.  

           Glen and Dale head inside, Hank looks at the dent.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S BEDROOM - MORNING 

           Hank leans in, scans, all clear.  He beelines for the 
           bureau, pockets his mother’s perfume.    

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA - MORNING (PARKED)

           Hank throws it in drive, glances to the rearview.  Shit.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-GARAGE - MORNING 

           Hank slams a kick into the bulge in the garage door.  
           Nothing.  He gives up, passes the Seville.  Freezes... 
           The front quarter panel dented, the grill cracked, 
           stained.  He touches it.  Sticky.  Blood?  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-GARAGE - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

           Hank, Glen, Dale stare at the Caddy.

                            GLEN
                                                          DALE
           Oh, shit.
                                              Oh, shit.

           Hank opens the Seville’s driver’s door, slides in.  His 
           brothers reduced to anxious children watching for dad.  

                                 GLEN
                        The hell are you doing?  We can 
                        see fine in here.

           Hank fires up the Caddy.  Classical music.  He switches 
           the radio station: rockabilly.  Cranks it.  

                                 DALE
                        Shh!  Hank, c’mon, man. 

           Hank adjusts the seat, back, forth, up, down... just so.  

                                 GLEN
                        Out!  Now.

                                 HANK
                        You two have Stockholm Syndrome.
           He slams the door shut, peels out.

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-DRIVE WAY - MORNING

           The brothers squat, inspect the grill.   

                                 GLEN
                        That’s gotta be a deer.  Right?

           The front door opens.  They stand, see-- The Judge.  He 
           advances, sees his car, sons.  The damage...

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Which one of you peckerwoods 
                        fucked up my car?

                                 HANK
                        Since I’m exactly the type to say 
                        “I told you so...”

                         THE JUDGE
                                                          HANK
           Who did this?  Answer me!
                                              I told you so.

                                 HANK
                        You did.  You fell off the wagon, 
                        went to the grocery store and 
                        banged up the Caddy.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (confused; angry)
                        Glen, where are the boys?

                            HANK
                                                          GLEN
           Don’t you even... 
                                              Dad, they wouldn’t drive--

                                 HANK
                        This isn’t complicated.  It’s your 
                        huge, throbbing, tumescent ego at 
                        work. 

                                 DALE
                        Hank, please stop.

           Glen grabs at Hank, he shakes him off, closes on his dad.

                                 HANK
                        You’re human.  Your wife died.  
                        The great adjudicator lost control 
                        and got drunk.  It happens.  Deal.  

                                 GLEN
                        Knock it off!
                                 THE JUDGE
                        Like your marriage? 
                                (Hank surprised)
                        She was my wife long before she 
                        was your mother.  Tell your 
                        brothers you’re getting a divorce?  
                        Lisa played hide the pickle with  
                        someone else.    

                                 HANK
                        Shut your mouth. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        And who could blame her?  You were 
                        a self-centered punk when you were 
                        a kid.  You’re an ego-maniac punk 
                        now.  Surprised it took her this 
                        long.

           Dale’s eyes dart, Glen out of his depth.  

                                 HANK
                        I won’t be back.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Happy trails.

           INT. JET-AISLE - DAY  (PARKED ON TARMAC)

           Hank settles into his seat.  Closes his eyes.  Forget it.   

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT (V.O.)
                        ...asks that at this time you turn 
                        off all electronic devices.

           His mobile chirps... I.D.: Glen.  Turn it off.  Don’t 
           answer.  Do not answer.

                                 HANK
                                (into phone)
                        Yep?

                                 GLEN (V.O.)
                                (over phone; worried)
                        I need you to come back right 
                        away.  We’ve got a real problem.

                                 HANK
                        Whatever it is, it’s your problem.  

           Holds the cell at arm’s length.  Don’t ask.  Do not ask.  
                                 HANK
                        What is it, Glen?

                                 GLEN (V.O.)
                        Dad’s been called down to the 
                        police station.  They want to 
                        question him.  
                                (hesitates)
                        They found a body.

           INT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Hank boils in, raises a hand, silences his seated 
           brothers.  He stops at the old-style perimeter bannister.   

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                        “Judge, you sayin’ I can milk her, 
                        kill her, cook her, eat her even--

           SIX COPS overflow the Sheriff’s office.  SHERIFF WHITE, 
           50s, grins at the Judge sitting in his chair, at his 
           desk, sipping coffee, holding court.   

                                 THE JUDGE
                        “...but that’s illegal?”

           Laughter.  Hank white-knuckles the bannister.  DEPUTY 
           HANSON, 40s, not a local, on task, redirects.

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Mr. Palmer--

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Judge Palmer, Deputy Hanson.

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Sir, did anyone other than you 
                        have access to your vehicle? 

                                 HANK (O.S.)
                                (loud)
                        No, no, no, no, no...

           The wall of cops turn, the Judge sees Hank, stiffens.     

           Hank swings the bannister gate open, enters on full 
           gunslinger.  More Jack Wilson than Shane.

                                 HANK
                        If you’re gonna nail his pompous 
                        ass, do it right for Christ sake.
           Glen, Dale rise, worried... Hank capable of anything.

                                 HANK
                        It’s not enough to put his vehicle 
                        at the scene, any strip mall 
                        lawyer spins that into a stolen 
                        car and reasonable doubt.  No, you 
                        need him behind the wheel.  

           Cop 1, 40s, closes on Hank, a shut-him-down expression. 

                                 COP 1
                        Hank, let’s go bud--

                                 HANK
                                (to Cop 1; quick)
                        Graduation night.  The quarry.  
                        “Both-Ways-Bobby” and your 
                        Ranchero.  Back it up, Kevin.  

           Cop 1 shrinks, Hank toxic.  Hank downshifts--

                                 HANK
                        Ask him if he was driving that 
                        night.  Where he went, the route 
                        he took.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’ve nothing to hide, I told them 
                        I went to the convenience store.

                                 HANK
                        Of course he did!  Every word out 
                        of his mouth limits his options.  
                        What about liquor?  Eighty percent 
                        of all hit and runs involve 
                        liquor.  His wife just died, why 
                        wouldn’t he take a sip, I would, 
                        you might.  But it doesn’t matter 
                        what we’d do, you need an 
                        admission from him.  Keep stroking 
                        his ego.  Prime that pump of a 
                        mouth.  I got it--
                                (snaps fingers)
                        Ask Oliver Wendell Holmes how he 
                        kept Wal Mart and Starbucks out of 
                        town, he loves telling that story.  

           The Judge rises, furious, rounds the desk, cops give way.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You do not belong here.
                                 HANK
                        So lets recap, we’ve got a dead 
                        male, car damage and, presumably, 
                        an eyewitness who puts an ‘82 
                        slant back Cadillac Seville at the 
                        scene, the approximate time of the 
                        accident.  Good news, we’re 
                        halfway to manslaughter!   

           “Eyewitness” cools the Judge.  A glance at Sheriff White.   

                                 HANK
                        Held on to that, huh?  Smart.  
                        Because up to now he’s too 
                        arrogant to exercise his right to 
                        counsel and hasn’t learned what 
                        every second year law student 
                        already knows; “if you don’t talk, 
                        you walk.”  
                                (head of steam)
                        But whatever you do, don’t let 
                        this become a custodial interview 
                        because then you’ll have to 
                        Mirandize him and maybe, just 
                        maybe, he’ll realize the laws of 
                        legal physics also apply to him 
                        and he’ll shut up.  Officers, good 
                        luck and good Goddamn day to you!

           Hank bangs out the gate, past Glen, Dale, exits.

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Hank your lawyer Judge?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No.

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Sir, we’re going to need to 
                        impound your vehicle.

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) - DAY  

           Hank drives, the Judge shotgun.  Silence dominates until--  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t remember.

                                 HANK
                        Because you were drunk.
                                 THE JUDGE
                        I was not drunk.

                                 HANK
                        Beautiful.  Tell me what happened.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t remember.

                                 HANK
                        Because you were drunk.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (detonates)
                        Because I can’t remember, you self-
                        important little prick!  Don’t you 
                        think I want to remember?  I 
                        can’t!  For all I know, I didn’t 
                        hit anyone.  Go home.  Now.  I 
                        don’t want you here.  You need a 
                        please?  Please.  Go home.

           Hank rocked by the violence of the outburst, grows angry.

                                 HANK
                        I was in the liquor cabinet.

           The Judge pantomimes SHOCK.

                                 HANK
                        What kind of recovered alcoholic 
                        keeps a stocked liquor cabinet?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        It’s a reminder.  That I’m 
                        stronger.  It holds no power over 
                        me.  I wouldn’t expect you to 
                        understand self-discipline. 

           Hank accelerates, ready to chew his own arm off.  

                                 HANK
                        Right now that cop Hanson’s on his 
                        way to the Minit Mart to ask some 
                        scared shitless high school clerk 
                        with half a joint in his front 
                        pocket if you had the odor of 
                        alcohol on you-- 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No!
                                 HANK
                        Bloodshot eyes!

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No!

                                 HANK
                        Slurred speech!

           No reply.  Great.  Hank slides to a stop.  Reverses, 
           laying rubber up the driveway.  Brakes hard.  Hank wills 
           composure, trying his level best.

                                 HANK
                        If this goes south you’re going to 
                        want to say with some semblance of 
                        a straight face that you haven’t 
                        had a drop in twenty-eight years.  
                        What’s done is done; if you hit 
                        somebody, they weaved in front of 
                        you.  I strongly suggest you dry 
                        out and practice that narrative.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (flipping the bird)
                        Narrate this.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - DAY   

           At the table, Dale watches Hank dig into a HUGE plate of 
           cake.  Worried, Glen rifles through the freezer mail. 

                                 HANK
                        If he hit him, leaving the scene’s 
                        a felony.  If they can establish 
                        he was inebriated... manslaughter.   

                                 GLEN
                        Look, no offense, Dale, but--

                                 DALE
                        None taken.

                                 HANK
                        You’ve got to wait till he offends 
                        you.  Go ahead Glen, be yourself.

                                 GLEN
                        Freezer mail’s a Dale move.  And 
                        why do you stretch to be such a 
                        jerk?  You’re outta here--
                                 HANK
                        When?

                                 GLEN
                        Soon.  And don’t tell me there’s 
                        not a part of you that doesn’t 
                        enjoy this.  

                                 HANK
                        Yeah, it’s been a real Disneyland-
                        dick-skinner of a trip home, Glen.  

                                 GLEN
                        The expert.  The savior.  Then 
                        you’ll be gone and we’ll be here, 
                        like always, driving to doctor 
                        appointments, filling the water 
                        softener, answering the endless 
                        computer questions--

           Hank grabs a freezer-burn newspaper.

                                 HANK
                        Times crossword puzzle, completed.   

           Dale shakes his head, not him, a smug look at Glen.  

                                 DALE
                        That’s not my move.

                                 GLEN
                        He’s seventy-two, he just lost his 
                        wife.  It’s stress.  He’s sober 
                        twenty-eight years.  Besides, if 
                        he were drinking again, could he 
                        do that whole puzzle?  In pen?  

                                 DALE
                        And he plays chess every Wednesday 
                        with Doc Morris.

                                 HANK
                        We know these are right? 

           The boys lean in, study the puzzle, miss the Judge strut 
           by the doorway, NAKED but for black socks, wing-tips.

                                 DALE
                                (reads)
                        Forty-seven across: “It turns into 
                        a different story.”    
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-FAMILY ROOM - DAY  

           Glen’s teen sons slouch on the couch, watch T.V.  

           Their jaws slacken as the Judge enters, naked, grabs the 
           remote.  The Judge in an edgy fog. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Cronkite’s a Pollyanna.  We watch  
                        Chancellor in this house.  

           The Judge flips channels to Jeopardy. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - DAY   

           Hank explains the clue to Dale, maybe Glen.

                                 HANK
                        A spiral staircase.  See, it turns 
                        into another story.  Turns--

           Hank notices the Judge walk by, scratching his balls.  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-STAIRWELL

           Still eating cake, Hank watches a naked Judge slowly 
           ascend the stairs.  Glen and Dale join him, dumbfounded.   

                                 HANK
                        Yeah, he’s fine.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-FRONT YARD - MORNING

           Hank on his Blackberry, connection poor.  He frowns at 
           the feel of dew on bare feet, picks up the newspaper.  

                                 HANK
                                (into phone)
                        The discovery’s not close to done, 
                        push the deposition to-- hold on--    
                                (switches lines)
                        Yeah... Lauren?  Hey, punkin’ 
                        lemme call you back... 
                                (pained)
                        One more day... yep, I’ll bring 
                        you a surprise...    

           Hank observes a police car roll up, stop at the house.   
                                 HANK
                        Daddy’s working now.  Bye baby.

           Hank disconnects, work call forgotten.  Sheriff White and 
           Deputy Hanson shuffle up the drive.  

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Hank, the blood matches.

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Manslaughter one.

                                 HANK
                        One?  Seize a meth lab lately?   
                        Inhale a little anhydrous ammonia?  

                       SHERIFF WHITE
           That’s not the whole of it, 
           son-- 
                                                          HANK
                                              Are you out of your fucking 
                                              minds?

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Victim is Mark Blackwell.  

           Hank at a rare loss for words, knows the name well. 

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Pretty amazing coincidence don’t 
                        you think?  Blackwell?

                                 HANK
                        “Amazing?”  To inspire awe, 
                        admiration, or wonder?  He’s been 
                        a judge for over forty years.  If 
                        you screwed up in that time frame, 
                        you stood in front of him.  I’d 
                        find it more worthy of wonder if 
                        he hit somebody he didn’t judge.  

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        I think you’re in denial about 
                        your father.

                                 HANK
                        I think you’re the law enforcement  
                        equivalent of a monkey fucking a 
                        milk jug.

           Hanson’s eyes dart left, Hank follows.  The Judge exits 
           the house, absorbs his son’s expression.  
           INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING (SERIES OF SHOTS)

           The Judge wipes a hand, stares at ink-stained fingers. 

           The Judge holds a sign, straightens for a mug shot.

           Hank signs a bond form, $25k.  Produces his black AMEX.

           EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY  

           Hank and the Judge stroll out.  Dale, Glen trail.

                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM (O.S.)
                        You killed him!  

           BLACKWELL’S MOM, 60s, rushes the Palmers.  A small hard 
           snarl of a woman.  Her son, BLACKWELL’S BROTHER, follows.   

                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM
                        You ran my boy down like an 
                        animal!  

           The Judge stalls, Hank moves him to Glen’s Minivan.  
           Glen, Dale shield their father from the Blackwells.

                                 DALE
                        Lady, my dad didn’t-- 

                                 BLACKWELL’S BROTHER
                                (shoulder bumps Dale)
                        Do somethin’, retard.  

                                 GLEN
                        Don’t touch him--

                                 HANK
                        Glen!  In the car!  Now! 

           Glen and Dale climb in.  Mom raps knuckles on a window.  

                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM
                        When my lawyer’s done with you, 
                        we’ll be livin’ in your house.   

           Hank empties his face, addresses her across the car roof. 

                                 HANK
                        Sorry for your loss, ma’am.

                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM
                        You will be.  And you can shove 
                        that “ma’am” shit.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM (CONT'D)
                        I recognize you.  You’re no altar 
                        boy.     
                                (with venom)
                        By the way, your mother?  Bitch.

           INT. GLEN’S CHRYSLER MINIVAN - DAY  

           The Judge flinches as spit hits his window.  Glen pulls 
           away, drives in silence.    

                                 DALE
                        Mark Blackwell.  He hurt that 
                        girl, didn’t he?

           Hank stares out his window, knows the story. 

                                 HANK
                        Hope Stevens.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Named after her favorite aunt.  
                        She was sixteen.  He was 
                        seventeen, two years older than 
                        Glen when it happened.  They dated 
                        six months.  Blackwell took a .38 
                        to her bedroom, shot the place up.  
                        He stood in court and wept like a 
                        lost child.  Said he was drunk, 
                        would never do it again.  I 
                        believed him.   

           Hank turns, his dad’s leniency unexpected.  Irritating.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Gave him one month juvenile 
                        detention plus probation.  He was 
                        released at noon on a summer day 
                        just like this one.  Glen and I 
                        were in the backyard working on 
                        his breaking ball.  It was 
                        beautiful; the bottom would just 
                        fall out of it.  While we did 
                        that...
                                (with remorse)
                        Hope Elizabeth Stevens was dying 
                        in a mosquito infested spill pond 
                        not fifty yards from her home.  He 
                        drug her there, kneeled on her 
                        chest.  In two and a half feet of 
                        water, he drowned her.
                                (hardens)
                        Stop the car.
           Glen checks his dad in the rearview mirror, uncertain.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Shitforbrains.  Am I speaking 
                        Korean?  Stop the Goddamn car. 

           Glen obliges, the Judge pops his door.  Crawls out.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I need my walk.  Nothing’s changed 
                        here.  The truth will out.

                                 HANK
                        Everything’s changed; leaving the 
                        scene, blood evidence, motive... I 
                        could convict you over coffee.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        If the blood matches and I’ve no 
                        reason to doubt it does, I hit 
                        him.  I don’t remember-- 

                                 HANK
                        The “I don’t remember what 
                        happened” defense doesn’t fly with 
                        a corpse.  We need to establish--  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        There’s no “we” here, Henry.  This 
                        was an accident.  Period.  A 
                        decent lawyer can argue this 
                        easily, and by decent I mean 
                        honest.  I retained one of that 
                        breed this morning.  For slightly 
                        less than five hundred an hour. 
                                (sincere)
                        I wish I liked you more.

           The Judge wipes the spittle from the window, walks.  

           INT. FLYING DEER TAVERN - DAY  

           Hank takes a seat at the bar, scans the room, searching.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        Who you looking for, tough guy?

           He swivels back, Sam works the bar, slides him a beer.  

                                 HANK
                                (muted surprise)
                        You.
                                 SAM
                        You’re a lousy liar.

                                 HANK
                        I am a blue-ribbon liar.

                                 SAM
                        Heard the Judge took out 
                        Blackwell.  Nice.

                                 HANK
                        The state of Indiana’s less 
                        impressed.  

                                 SAM
                        What are you going to do?

                                 HANK
                        Leave.  It’s not my business.    

                                 SAM
                        You’re a lawyer, he’s your father.  
                        How is it not your business?

                                 HANK
                        He doesn’t want me as a lawyer.  I 
                        don’t want him as a client.  We 
                        can barely stand the sight of each 
                        other.  How’s that?   

                                 SAM
                        Being a bit of a baby aren’t you?  

           Uphill.  He slugs his beer.

                                 SAM
                        He doesn’t like you.  Accept it.  
                        I was always fond of him, but who 
                        doesn’t like somebody that thinks 
                        you’re too good for his son?  You 
                        leave now and something bad 
                        happens to him, you’ll regret it.  
                        Every time you think of your mom 
                        or see Glen and Dale it’ll eat at 
                        you.  Regret’s a bitch.  

                                 HANK
                        I’ve been a lawyer for almost 
                        sixteen years.  Never met a hooker 
                        with a heart of gold, a family 
                        first mobster, or a criminal 
                        satisfied with one last score.    
                                (leans in; nasty)

                        Or... the bartender capable of 
                        solving any problem, large or 
                        small, with their unique blend of 
                        blue-collar world-weary advice.  
                        You’re forty-plus.  A waitress.  A 
                        bartender.  Want some advice, Sam?  
                        Trade school.   

           She squeezes the soda shooter, sprays his eyes with Dr. 
           Pepper.  He yelps, hands to his eyes.  Not done, she 
           pushes him, knocks him off his stool, to the floor.

           Hank lays there, stunned.  She shit-eating-grins.

                                 HANK
                        I might have deserved that.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-BASEMENT - DAY  

           Dim.  Hank descends the steps.  He squints, overhead 
           bulbs with pull strings.  Overflow of forty plus years. 

           Hank approaches a far corner, an audio/video nest; 
           shelves packed with steel cannisters of 8 mm film, VHS, 
           mini-DVs, DVDs.  At a workbench, Dale splices 8 mm film.    

                                 HANK
                        Quite the set--

                                 DALE
                                (sullen; childlike)
                        Setup I’ve got here, yes, uh-huh. 

           Hank squeezes Dale’s shoulder.  Dale shakes him off.   

                                 HANK
                        He doesn’t want me here, Dale.  
                        What do you want me to do?

           Dale no-look pulls an overhead string.  Darkness.  He 
           flips on an 8 mm projector.  A motor, a beam of light--

           Mary Palmer, 30s, pretty, silently laughs, runs from a 
           toddler on the basement wall.  Hank watches, transfixed. 

           A pre-school Glen and Hank dart in, dare their mother to 
           give backyard chase.  She does.  The children escape to 
           the safety of the unseen camera operator.  

           Mary looks directly into the camera.  Hank stares back, 
           eyes moist.  Her words easy to read: “Who loves you?”
           INT. MIDWESTERN ANTIQUES - DAY  

           Main Street.  Hank follows the Judge through a warren of 
           memorabilia... vintage farm implements, Route 66 signs. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You’re here to listen, not talk.

           C.P holds up a mercury glass vase, explains to a SHOPPER.  

                                 C.P
                        You can always tell authentic 
                        mercury glass by this double-wall.  
                                (reads the bottom)
                        Made by, right there, see?  “New 
                        England Glass Company, 1886.”

           He spots the Judge, Hank.  Embarrassed, he hands the vase 
           to the customer, calls out.  

                                 C.P
                        Mom!  I’ll be upstairs.

           INT. C.P’S OFFICE - DAY (ABOVE MIDWESTERN ANTIQUES)

           Cramped, tidy.  Framed diplomas on fake wood paneling.  
           C.P flips through a report.  

                                 C.P
                        Judge Sullivan caught it.  Know 
                        him, sir?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Tough.  Fair.  Full of himself.

           Hank bites his tongue.  The Judge catches it. 

                                 C.P
                        Appointed a special prosecutor,  
                        Dwight Dickham, out of Gary.  
                        Wonder why so far?  Preliminary 
                        hearing’s set for next Friday.
                                (looks up)
                        Wow.  We are in a pickle.

           Hank chuckles, casts his eyes about the space.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I think it’s pretty straight-
                        forward, C.P.  It was dark--
                                 HANK
                        Hold up.

           The Judge tightens, damned if he didn’t know better. 

                                 HANK
                        Law school?  

                                 C.P
                        Yes?

                                 HANK
                        Yes, you’re familiar with the 
                        concept or yes, you attended one?

                                 C.P
                        Of course.  Valpo.  

           He gestures to a diploma.  Blank stare from Hank.

                                 C.P
                        Sorry, Valparaiso.  University.  
                        And you?

                                 HANK
                        Northwestern.

                                 C.P
                        Wow.  That’s a dandy school.

                                 HANK
                        Ever defend in a jury trial?

                                 C.P
                        I have.

                                 HANK
                        Charge?

                                 C.P
                        Assault.

                                 HANK
                        Degree?

                                 C.P
                        Third.

                                 HANK
                        Verdict?

                                 C.P
                        Guilty.
           Hank motions for the rest of the story.  C.P hesitates.

                                 C.P
                        Coach Blakely broke a clipboard 
                        over his quarterback’s head during 
                        halftime at homecoming.  In his 
                        defense--

                                 HANK
                        Now he gets one.

                                 C.P
                        John junior had his helmet on. 

           Hank looks at his father, nods at C.P, this is your guy?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Jury was out for quite some time.

                                 C.P
                        You didn’t ask me about my class 
                        rank.

                                 HANK
                        Something’s telling me first.

                                 C.P
                        Wow, more sarcasm.  Third.

                                 HANK
                        Just keep selling don’t you?

                                 C.P
                        I flatter myself I would’ve 
                        finished first, but I worked 
                        thirty-five hours a week bussing 
                        tables so I’ll never know.
                                (confidence growing)
                        Summers I interned at the public 
                        defenders office in Evansville.  
                        After I graduated I clerked two 
                        years for Justice Roberts on the 
                        Indiana Supreme Court.  I don’t 
                        have a student loan to repay 
                        because my folks don’t believe in 
                        borrowing and took care of what I 
                        couldn’t.  I grew up in this shop 
                        and try to repay them by helping 
                        when I can.  That and I love them 
                        and can use the free office space.        

           Hank just stares at him.  The Judge oozes satisfaction. 
                                 HANK
                        The word “wow” isn’t your friend 
                        in court.  Stop saying it. 

                                 C.P
                        Great point.  Duly noted.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE-SIDEWALK - DAY  

           C.P vomits, breakfast hits the pavement.  Hank treks up 
           the courthouse steps, spots C.P.  Christ.   

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  (PRELIMINARY HEARING) 

           A quarter full.  Hank behind the Judge with Glen, Dale.  
           Coiled behind the prosecution, Blackwell’s Mom.  

           A woman (MARGARET STEVENS) sits apart, alone.  60s, 
           slight, a thousand yard stare etched on her face.    

                                 C.P (O.S.)
                                (halting)
                        Finally, there’s no evidence to 
                        suggest alcohol or any other 
                        substance was involved.  This was 
                        an accident, one with tragic 
                        consequences, but no more or less 
                        than that; an accident.  

           JUDGE SULLIVAN, 60s, corn-fed heartland huge, presides.  
           DWIGHT DICKHAM, 40s, special prosecutor; deceptively 
           plain, Corvette engine in a Buick body, looks on.    

                                 C.P
                        There but for the grace of God go 
                        I or any one of us in this 
                        courtroom.  Thank you, your honor.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        This is a preliminary hearing, not 
                        a trial.  See?  No dog.  No pony.
                                (to Dickham)
                        Ready to go, Mr. Dickham?

                                 DICKHAM
                        Your honor in the interest of crap 
                        cutting; if I request a change in 
                        venue you’ll say what? 

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        I’ll consider it.
                                 DICKHAM
                        And then?

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Deny it.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Ready to go. 

           Dickham makes eye contact with Hank. 

           SERIES OF WITNESSES:

           -- C.P questions Sheriff White.

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        When I approached the victim he 
                        was unresponsive.

                                 C.P
                        Offer any assistance?

                                (patient)
                        He was dead, son.

           Hank settles in for a siege.

           -- Dickham questions a notebook reading COUNTY CORONER.

                                 CORONER
                        ...massive internal damage... 
                        Injuries consistent with being 
                        struck by a car.

           Sullivan looks at C.P.

                                 C.P
                        No questions your honor.

           Hank on the edge of his seat, in a black fidget.

           -- Dickham questions Deputy Hanson.

                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Mr. Palmer stated that he drove 
                        his vehicle--

                                 DICKHAM
                        His 1982 Seville.
                                 DEPUTY HANSON
                        Correct.  The night of the 
                        accident.

           Hank leans over C.P, hisses at him.

                                 HANK
                        What are you doing?  They’ve got 
                        blood evidence.  This is going to 
                        trial, it’s a freight train of 
                        shit you cannot stop.  You’ve got 
                        to be aggressive with these 
                        people, get them on the record so 
                        you can destroy them at trial.      

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                                (interrupts Dickham)
                        Excuse me.
                                (to Hank)
                        Sir, are you co-counsel?

                         THE JUDGE
                                                        C.P/HANK
           He is not.
                                              Not really.  No.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Sit.  And zip it.

           Hank reverses himself, drops into his seat.

           -- C.P questions a nervous MINIT MART CLERK, 18.

                                 MINIT MART CLERK
                        They was both over by the Hostess 
                        rack.  I saw the Judge and... what 
                        should I call him, the dead guy?    

                                 BLACKWELL’S MOM
                        Try Mr. Blackwell, dummy.

           Judge Sullivan hard-eyes her, lets it go.  Dickham leans 
           over his backrest, motions her in.  

                                 DICKHAM
                                (whispers; close)
                        Mrs. Blackwell, justice for Mark 
                        is predicated upon me winning.    
                        Now your late son cuts an 
                        unsympathetic figure and it would 
                        be helpful if you were the silent 
                        grieving mother that potential 
                        jurors can see as the embodiment 
                        of your boy.

                        However, sympathy will be 
                        difficult to achieve with my foot 
                        up your ass or a gag in your 
                        mouth.  One of which will occur if 
                        you open that venomous pie hole of 
                        yours again.  
                                (mock sympathy pat)
                        Have a seat.  Dear.

                        Yeah.  Saw Mr. Blackwell and Judge 
                        Palmer make eye contact.

                                 HANK
                                (sotto; in pain)
                        Oh, sweet mother of God.

           Hank scribbles furiously on a legal pad. 

                                 DICKHAM
                        And then what did Judge Palmer do? 

                                 MINIT MART CLERK
                        Dropped his eggs?

           The Judge stares at the table, at a loss.  He starts as a 
           legal pad flaps through the air, strikes C.P in the head.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                                (re: Hank)
                        Out!  Bailiff, get rid of him. 

                                 HANK
                        For that?

           Gus herds Hank out.  The Judge straightens Hank’s legal 
           pad, reads: “You can’t prove eye contact.  IDIOT!”  

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY (LATER)

           Prelim at an end.  Judge Sullivan addresses the court.
                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        The court finds probable cause to 
                        hold this over for trial.   
                                (to the Judge)
                        Mr. Palmer, it’s my unfortunate 
                        duty to suspend you from the bench 
                        pending the outcome of this trial.  
                        I’ll see you folks in court.

           The Judge stoic.

           INT. COURTHOUSE-BALCONY - DAY 

           Hank watches his father, takes no pleasure in his misery.

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-DRIVEWAY - MORNING 

           Hank, boxers, pads barefoot across the front lawn.  
           Across the street, an elderly NEIGHBOR tracks him.  

           Hank scoops up the paper, locks eyes with the nosy 
           Neighbor, readies an insult--

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        It’ll be all right.

           The hostility drains from Hank, profanity swallowed.

                                 NEIGHBOR
                        You want me to collect this trash-- 
                                (waves his own paper)
                        ...before your dad gets up in the 
                        morning, you just say so.

           Hank scans the front page.  Gut check.  Headline: “Judge 
           Joseph Palmer Faces Manslaughter Trial.”  

           The Neighbor deposits his paper in a garbage can.  Hank, 
           unaccustomed to grateful. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-HALLWAY - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)  

           Hank passes in front of the Judge’s study. 

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                                (calling out)
                        Grant's victory deciding the siege 
                        of Vicksburg, 1863.

           Hank slows, confused, pokes his head into--
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-STUDY - MORNING 

           The Judge at his walnut desk, attacking a crossword.

                                 HANK
                        What?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Grant’s victory deciding the siege 
                        of Vicksburg.  1863’s redundant.  
                        Twelve letters.   

           Hank steps into a room he’s rarely been invited into.  
           Scours his memory.  Nothing.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Champion Hill.

           “Why’d you ask?” on Hank’s mind, lips.  Then, he gets it. 

                                 HANK
                        I was never a big fan of Grant.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        With the arguable exception of 
                        Lincoln, Ulysses Simpson Grant was 
                        the single greatest factor in 
                        preserving the union.  

           Hank eyes shelves lined with law books, framed newspaper 
           articles/photos of Glen as a high school pitcher.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        And you prefer which general?

                                 HANK
                        William Tecumseh Sherman.  West 
                        Point grad, had three horses shot 
                        out from under him at Shiloh.  
                        While Grant dug in, Sherman 
                        marched; burned the South’s major 
                        cities, destroyed transportation 
                        lines, communications and morale.  
                        All while suffering from clinical 
                        depression.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Batshit arsonist.

           Screw it.  Hank turns to go--
                                 THE JUDGE
                        C.P stepped down this morning.
                                (Hank freezes)
                        Said he’d assist a more seasoned 
                        attorney.  Couldn’t live with 
                        himself if his lack of experience 
                        cost the case.     

           Silence.  The Judge can’t ask, Hank can’t offer.  Eye 
           contact fleeting.  Uncomfortable.   

                                 THE JUDGE
                        How much did I pay you when you 
                        cut the grass? 

                                 HANK
                        Half of whatever minimum wage was.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Skip any meals did you?

           Hank turns, and the Judge’s last chance starts out.    

                                 THE JUDGE
                        What do you make now?

                                 HANK
                                (stops)
                        Five hundred an hour.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (incredulous)
                        Fuck me.

                                 HANK
                        What were you doing on Shelby 
                        Road?  There’s no route from the 
                        Minit Mart home where that makes 
                        sense.   

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I remember being there.  The Minit 
                        Mart.  I needed eggs.  The road 
                        home was washed out, where it dips 
                        under the train tracks.  I turned 
                        around, stopped at the light on 
                        State.  Then... I’m missing time.  
                                 HANK
                        I think you’re holding out.  With 
                        your history, you and Mark 
                        Blackwell being in the same place, 
                        same time gives Dickham a good 
                        case.  You turning Blackwell into 
                        a possum gives Dickham a great 
                        case.  You could go to prison. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        And?

           The Judge and Hank share a knowing look.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-BASEMENT - DAY  

           Hank haphazardly dumps detergent into a washing machine. 
           He shuts the lid, starts it.  

           Hank wanders the dim space, reaches Dale’s nest.  

           Checks out the 8 mm projector, a roll mounted to the 
           machine.  He hits the toggle, film un-spools crazily. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-BASEMENT - DAY  (MOMENTS LATER)

           Hank picks Dale’s video camera off the workbench.  Powers 
           it on.  Rewinds.  Play.  Watches the LCD display: 

           The camera moves down a hall, a woman’s voice, shrill, 
           berating.  Hank doesn’t recognize it, frowns.  

           Fast forward.  Stop.  Play. 

           The camera follows the Judge down a Carlinville street 
           from a distance.  The Judge climbs steps to a home. 

           Hank riveted.  DOCTOR “DOC” MORRIS, 60s, opens the door, 
           the Judge disappears inside.

           The camera circles the home, a backyard, screened porch.  
           The Judge in a rocker, the Doc obscuring the view.  The 
           Doc moves and a chessboard appears.  So does an I.V. 
           stand hung with a clear bag of fluid.  

           EXT. SHELBY ROAD - DAY  

           Hank’s Impala leans on the grassy bank.  The Judge 
           watches Hank scope the road, check the pavement, the 
           steep grade, do the math.  
                                 THE JUDGE
                        What are you looking for?

                                 HANK
                        The truth.  I’ll settle for brake 
                        marks.  Body was recovered there--
                                (points to the slope)
                        Figure impact... right here. 

           Tough moment.  Cicadas in the trees the only sound.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t see any.  Skid marks.

                                 HANK
                        No real shoulder to speak of.  
                        Police report has him on a bike, 
                        in the rain.  Who does forensics 
                        for the county?     

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Asian fella out of Columbus.

           “Asian” good enough for Hank, he wipes sweat.  

                                 HANK
                        Okay, old man, here it is: I don’t 
                        lose at trial.  I pay the mortgage 
                        with that reputation.  If I’ve got 
                        skin in the game I’m not taking it 
                        up the ass over a hit and run in 
                        East Cornhole.  No more it-was-
                        like-that-when-I-found-it crap; I 
                        want answers.  All of them.  Now.  
                        Lawyer to client; why were you at 
                        the Minit Mart?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I needed eggs.

                                 HANK
                        They’re half the price at Krogers!

                                 THE JUDGE
                        They’re the only place that sells 
                        Bit O’Honeys!  

                                 HANK
                        Did you recognize Blackwell?
                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t--
                                (off Hank’s look)
                        I can’t have.

                                 HANK
                        Look.  We both know you didn’t 
                        intentionally hit him--  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No.  Shit.  Mister Sherlock.

                                 HANK
                        But that’s the way they’ll spin 
                        it.  A few shots of Jack mixed 
                        with just the right amount of axe 
                        to grind.  I would.  I did.  
                                (beat; calming)
                        But you haven’t been drinking.  
                        Have you?  You’re sick.

           A car passes.  Tough moment for the Judge.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Cancer.  In my plumbing.  Colon.

                                 HANK
                        Ouch.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        A few more chemo sessions it’ll be 
                        in remission.  Nothing I can’t 
                        handle.  
                                (snaps)
                        All I wanted was a fucking candy 
                        bar!

                                 HANK
                        This is a good thing.
                                (off Judge’s look)
                        Here’s the upside; you buried your 
                        wife.  Took a drive, went for a 
                        snack.  You’re almost home, the 
                        road’s washed out like it is every 
                        time there’s a heavy rain.  You 
                        turn around, it’s out of your way, 
                        dark, the Caddy’s two tons of old 
                        school Detroit steel, you could 
                        hit the Bears’ front line and not 
                        know it, much less a convicted 
                        murderer, on a bike, in the 
                        pouring rain!       
                                (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANK (CONT'D)
                        They need intent for Man One.  If 
                        push comes to shove, we roll out  
                        a diminished capacity defense due 
                        to the chemo--

                         THE JUDGE
           No.
                                                          HANK
                                              Native son, public servant 
                                              for over forty years--

                         THE JUDGE
           No...
                                                          HANK
                                              Recently widowed, cancer--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Enough Goddammit!  No!  Look what 
                        that does to all the cases I’ve 
                        heard for the last year--  

                                                       THE JUDGE
                            HANK
           A year?  You’ve had this a 
           year?
                                              --everybody I sentenced 
                                              will challenge the ruling. 

                                 HANK
                        Strangers!  Who gives a shit?  You 
                        could die in prison!  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’d rather die in prison than be 
                        remembered like that!  Reduced to 
                        a physically and mentally 
                        incontinent old man on the stand.  
                        An object of ridicule.

                            HANK
                                                       THE JUDGE
           Oh, I’m not letting you 
           anywhere near a stand.
                                              U.S. Grant held this 
                                              country together--  

                                 THE JUDGE 
                        --what’s he remembered for?  Being 
                        a drunk.  Ronald Reagan oversaw 
                        the end of the Cold War.  The fall 
                        of the Berlin Wall.  But any 
                        discussion of his legacy ends with 
                        jelly beans, naps and Alzheimer's.    

                                 HANK
                        “Reagan?”  With all due... I’m 
                        gonna say this as professionally 
                        and gently as I possibly can: 
                        you’re a civil servant in a corn-
                        belt bumfuck backwater.  Nobody -- 
                        nobody -- gives a rat’s ass about 
                        your “legacy.”  Least of all, me.
                                 THE JUDGE
                        Crystal clear since you were 
                        fifteen.  But I do.  I’ve sat on 
                        the bench in that courtroom for 
                        forty-two years.  The people of 
                        this community trust me.  They 
                        trust the law.  This accident is a 
                        legal iron ball, Henry.  You can’t 
                        fuck it up.  So don’t.  

           The Judge starts for the car, wheels around, mid-road.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        And only guilty people refuse to 
                        take the stand.  Got me? 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-HANK’S ROOM - MORNING 

           A plastic storage bag on the bed.  Hank unearths a faded 
           black t-shirt.  “Metallica Damaged Justice Tour ‘88-’89.”     

           He unleashes a pair of acid washed jeans, steps in.  
           Wiggles.  Inhales.  Buttons the fly, muscles the last one 
           closed.  Saran-wrap-scrotum-hugging tight.  

           EXT. CARLINVILLE STREET - MORNING 

           Metallica ‘T’.  Baggy sweats.  Hank jogs, pace easy.  
           Past homes, yards, people.  Sights, sounds of his youth.  
           He breathes in memory lane, relaxes, enjoys... 

           A nearby tornado alarm sounds, full blare-- Hank startled 
           sideways, a braking truck screech-swerves around him. 

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - MORNING

           Hank labors, sweat soaked, more slog than jog.

           A new Toyota 4-Runner pulls onto the opposite shoulder, 
           paces him.  Sam grins from her open driver’s window.  

                                 SAM
                        Might take it easy... I only own 
                        the one black dress.

           INT. SAM’S 4-RUNNER (PARKED) - MORNING (MOMENTS LATER)

           Hank collapses into the back seat, shuts the door, fibs--  
                                 HANK
                        Thirteen point two miles.

                                 SAM
                        Had to have leather seats.  Hank, 
                        somebody I’d like you to meet-- 

           Riding shotgun, a woman swivels, all black hair and lips--  

                                 SAM
                        My daughter Carla.

                                 CARLA
                        Light a match and hold my hair 
                        back, this is your Hank?  

           Sam shoves it in gear, drives.  Hank forgets to breathe.  

                                 SAM
                        Try not to embarrass me, kid.  
                                (beat)
                        Have you two--

                                 HANK
                        Met?  Yes.  

                                 CARLA
                        At the bar.  Hank here--

                                 SAM
                        Mr. Palmer, young lady.

           Carla loves it, leans over the seat, swats his leg.

                                 CARLA
                        Mr. Palmer was verbally de-
                        constructing the Koch boys and 
                        their toady.  Ran ‘em all out.

                                 SAM
                        Girl, what is up with you?  Turn 
                        around.
                                (to Hank)
                        I see that t-shirt survived... 
                                (pause; flat)
                        What a magical week that was.

                                 CARLA
                        Oh, I smell a story.

                                 SAM
                        No, you do not.
                                 CARLA
                        I know a pregnant pause when I 
                        hear one and that pause--  

           Carla slaps her visor-mirror down, catches Hank’s eye.

                                                         CARLA
                            SAM
           My pauses are not pregnant.
                                              That pause was third 
                                              trimester--

                                 CARLA
                                (fists the air)
                        --banging on the birth canal!   

           Hank seat slides out of Carla’s eye line.

                                 HANK
                        Since when do you have a daughter?

                                 CARLA
                        November 1989.  

                                 SAM
                        She’s home for summer break.    

                                 HANK
                        Were you married?

                                 CARLA
                                (whispers)
                        Shh.  I’m a riddle.

                                 SAM
                        Carla goes to Georgetown.

                                 HANK
                                (impressed)
                        Georgetown?

                                 CARLA
                        You ever in D.C., Mr. Palmer?

                                 HANK
                        No.  You got a scholarship?  

                                 SAM
                        We going down this road again?

                                 HANK
                        Major?

           Carla turns to face him, chews her bottom lip, tucks  
           hair behind an ear.  
                                 CARLA
                        Law.  

           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-DRIVEWAY - DAY 

           The 4-Runner idles, Hank next to the open window, Sam. 

                                 SAM
                        How’s the Judge?

                                 HANK
                        An intractable pain in the ass.  

           She holds up both hands indicating a short distance.  

                                 SAM
                        Fallen apple.  Tree.   

           She grimaces, pushes his smelly self back.

                                 SAM
                        If, after you shower, you’re of a 
                        mind, maybe we could get together--
                                (self conscious)
                        --you know... 

           Carla emits a long low guttural groan of disgust.  Sam 
           ignores her.  Carla catches Hank’s eye, pantomimes 
           locking her lips, throws the “key” out the window. 

                                 SAM
                        I’ll call you.

           Sam zips away.  He pads up the drive, picks up the 
           newspaper, slings it into a neighbor’s yard. 

           INT. INDIANAPOLIS AIRPORT-CORRIDOR - DAY  

           Hank stands downstream of arriving passengers.  Smiles.  
           Lauren scurries toward him with her AIRLINE ESCORT.  

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING)- DAY  

           Lauren buckled-up shotgun.  Country through the windows.  

                                 HANK
                        All this way by yourself; you know 
                        how proud I am of you? 
                                 LAUREN
                        Yes.

           He reaches over, squeezes a Lauren-leg.  She squeals.

                                 LAUREN
                        Mommy says you’re helping Grandpa.

                                 HANK
                        I thought you should meet him.

                                 LAUREN
                        I should help too.

                                 HANK
                        Kinda what I was thinking.

                                 LAUREN
                        Mommy doesn’t let me sit up front.

                                 HANK
                        Your mother lacks my spirit of 
                        adventure. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Says I’m not tall enough yet.

                                 HANK
                        What?  Big girl like you?  Flying 
                        solo?  Madness.

           They share a smug just-between-us-girls look.

                                 LAUREN
                        Says the airbag will ‘capitate me.  
                        “Young lady, either your whole 
                        body can sit in the backseat or 
                        just your head.”    

           Hank chuckles before his self-satisfied grin fades.      

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) - DAY (LATER)

           Lauren buckled in the back seat.  She rubbernecks as Hank 
           arrives at the Judge’s house, reverses into the drive.  

                                 HANK
                        Let’s prep.  Grandpa Palmer isn’t 
                        like Grandpa Schneider.  He’s not 
                        a hugger and a kisser.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANK (CONT'D)
                        He’s not gonna take you for ice 
                        cream, not gonna read to you, 
                        don’t ask him to play.  But that 
                        doesn’t make him a-- Yes it does.  
                        It doesn’t mean he doesn’t... like 
                        you. 

                                 LAUREN
                        You don’t read to me.

                                 HANK
                                (hurt; parks)
                        I’ll read legal briefs to you all 
                        night long, see how you like that.

           Hank shuts Lauren’s door.  The front door opens, the 
           Judge steps out.  Hank instinctively pulls her close.  

           The Judge descends, eyes on Lauren.  He towers over her, 
           sizes her up, then makes a palms-up finger-beckoning 
           motion.  She lifts her arms overhead.  He scoops her up, 
           kisses the cheek of his laughing granddaughter.  

           He carries her into the house, kicks the door closed.  
           Hank processes, picks up her suitcase, starts in. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-GLEN’S OLD ROOM - NIGHT 

           Wall shelves lined with baseball trophies.  Hank tucks a 
           sleepy Lauren into the single bed.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Whose room is this?

                                 HANK
                        Your uncle Glen’s when he was a 
                        kid.  Now he has kids and his own 
                        house.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Why does he have so many action 
                        figures? 

                                 HANK
                        They’re baseball trophies. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Did he play on T.V.?
                                 HANK
                                (wiggles hand)
                        No.  He got hurt.

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m sorry.  Why didn’t he take his 
                        little men to his own house?

                                 HANK
                        I think maybe they were more 
                        important to his father.  Go to 
                        sleep now.

           Hank pecks her forehead.  Heads for the door...

                                 LAUREN
                        Mommy always sings to me.

           Damn.  He returns, sits on her bed, puts on a happy face.

                                 HANK
                        You are my sunshine, my only--

                                 LAUREN
                        That’s mommy’s song-- Sing one of 
                        your own.

                                 HANK
                                (long beat; halting)
                        “In the day we sweat it out in the 
                        streets of a runaway American 
                        dream.  At night we ride through 
                        mansions of glory in suicide 
                        machines.  Sprung from cages out 
                        on Highway 9, chrome wheeled, fuel 
                        injected and steppin’ out over the 
                        line--
                                (into it; growling)
                        Baby this town rips the bones from 
                        your back, it’s a death trap, it's 
                        a suicide rap, we gotta get out--

           Her eyes track behind him... the Judge in the doorway, 
           amused distaste for his son’s choice of bed time song.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Thought I’d say goodnight.  

           Hank rises.  The two navigate around each other, awkward.  
           The Judge motions for Lauren to scooch over, he sits.    
                                 THE JUDGE
                        You warm enough?
                                (she nods)
                        Too warm?
                                (shakes her head)

                                 LAUREN
                        Why was six afraid of seven?
                                (he shakes his head)
                        Because seven ate nine.

           Hank grins.  The Judge laughs, hard.  Lauren joins in.     

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You look like your grandmother.  

                                 LAUREN
                        Why didn’t she want to see me? 

                            HANK
           Honey, that’s not it at 
           all.
                                                       THE JUDGE
                                              Of course she wanted to see 
                                              you.

                                 LAUREN
                        Then why wouldn’t you let us come 
                        visit?

           The Palmer third rail crackles with electricity. 

                                 HANK
                        Sometimes, life gets busy.

                                 LAUREN
                                (to the Judge; low)
                        Mommy hates when he says that.

           The Judge nods, conspiratorial.  He turns to Hank.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Out.  
                                (afterthought)
                        Please.

           Hank off guard, backs up, a last look.  He exits.

                                 LAUREN
                        What was Grandma like?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Beautiful.  Tough.  Soft, hard.   
                        Kept her own counsel.  Quality.
                                 LAUREN
                        I would have liked her.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You’d have loved her.

                                 LAUREN
                        Did she sing to daddy?  When he 
                        was little? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (emotional)
                        She sang to all her children.

                                 LAUREN
                        Grandpa?  Will you sing to me?
                                (silent; mouths)
                        Please?

           He checks the room, wipes his eyes, clears his throat.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (slow; gentle)
                        “Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, 
                        dear, and he shows 'em, pearly 
                        white.  Just a jack knife has 
                        Macheath, dear, and he keeps it, 
                        keeps it way out of sight.   

           Like father like son.  She stares.  He’s animated...

                                 THE JUDGE
                        When that shark bites with his 
                        teeth, dear, scarlet billows, they 
                        begin to spread.  

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Hank listens a few feet outside the door.  Dazed. 
           Unfamiliar with the man singing to his child.   

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                        “On the sidewalk, one Sunday 
                        mornin', lies a body oozin' life.   

           Little hands begin to clap in time.  Hank retreats.  

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                        Someone's sneaking 'round the 
                        corner, could that someone, 
                        perhaps, perchance, be Mack the 
                        Knife?” 
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 

           Hank melts into the couch with a thick stack of legal 
           papers and an open Fed-ex box. 

           The Judge trudges in, plops down in his easy chair, 
           newspaper in hand.  Both read.  Silent.  Uncomfortable.    

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (re: files)
                        Chicago?

                                 HANK
                        Not exactly carrying my load at 
                        the moment.

           More silence.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Read about that Ponzi-schemer you 
                        defended last month.   

                                 HANK
                                (concerned)
                        Three years ago. 
                                (more silence)
                        Alleged Ponzi-schemer.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        He didn’t steal all those people’s 
                        life savings?  I read he did.

                                 HANK
                        He was acquitted.  So, no, he 
                        didn’t steal it.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You’re right.  Words matter.  
                        “Misplaced.”  
                                (recalling)
                        Six hundred some million?

                                 HANK
                        Who remembers?  There might be 
                        three, four lawyers in the country 
                        could have done what I did.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I told your mom I thought maybe 
                        you’d be on the Today Show.  She 
                        watched all week.  Nope.
                                 HANK
                        No.  No Today Show.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (lowers paper)
                        I wanted to say...

           Hank slaps the file down, knives out. 

                                 HANK
                        Let’s do it, old man-- 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I wanted to say that I was wrong 
                        to belittle your marriage.  

                                 HANK
                        You wanted to say it or you are 
                        saying it?

           The Judge abandons the apology, returns to his paper.   

                                 HANK
                        Sorry.

           Hank instantly infuriated that he’s apologizing.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No such thing as an easy marriage.

                                 HANK
                        You and mom did it for almost 
                        fifty years.  We couldn’t do ten. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Most can’t.  
                                (beat)
                        How was the sex?

           Hank stunned.  His father’s interest, the intimate topic.

                                 HANK
                        I don’t know... Fine.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’ve spotted your problem.

                                 HANK
                        She had a wandering vagina.  That 
                        was the problem.

           The Judge produces a superior grunt.  
                                 HANK
                        What, you’re a sex expert now?  
                        When?  You had three boys, a small 
                        house with toilet paper-thin walls 
                        and a stick up your ass.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        First of all, you three deviants 
                        were too busy churning your own 
                        butter to notice if the house were 
                        on fire.  Second, your mother and 
                        I were creative.  If one of us, 
                        usually me, was in the mood we’d 
                        use code.

                                 HANK
                        I’m begging you.  Don’t tell me.
                                (curiosity building)
                        Okay, tell me, you wanna tell me.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’d inquire if she wanted to go to 
                        the movies.  She’d know by the 
                        title if I was randy or not.
                                (Hank’s skin crawls)
                        Blazing Saddles.  Midnight 
                        Express.  Enter the Dragon. 

                                 HANK
                        Okay, okay, I got it.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        She was a woman, smart ass, not 
                        your soft place to land.  And she 
                        was up for just about anything.  

           Hank glares, the Judge lets it go.  Then doesn’t--

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (low; knife twist)
                        Willy Wonka and the Chocolate--

                                 HANK
                        Got!  It!

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You might consider giving Lisa 
                        another chance.  Or don’t.  
                        Whatever makes you happy.

                                 HANK
                        Was mom happy?
           Win.  Hank settles in with his files and pound of flesh.

           EXT. DINER (REAR) - NIGHT (LATE)

           Sam watches Hank stand on an AC unit, lever open a 
           transom window.

                                 SAM
                        When you have date night in 
                        Chicago do you break into 
                        courthouses for fun?

                                 HANK
                        We’re not on a date and you used 
                        to enjoy it.

           He hoists himself up, halfway in.  Wriggles.  Stuck. 

                                 HANK
                        Little help.

           She hangs her head, walks.

           INT. DINER-COUNTER - NIGHT

           Ambient light.  Keys on the counter.  Hank and Sam eat a 
           large slice of apple pie, two forks. 

                                 SAM
                        So, midnight, and I’m on the 
                        Dayton blacktop haulin’ ass home--

                        The Chevette?

                                 SAM
                        Dad’s Maverick.
                                (Hank winces)
                        I know right?  From the corner of 
                        my eye I see... something.  I hit 
                        the brakes and the biggest buck 
                        you’ve ever seen, twelve, fourteen 
                        points, maybe two-hundred pounds 
                        give or take, flies over the hood. 
                                (Hank’s intrigued)
                        I just sat there.  Shaking.   
                        Another second, he’s coming right 
                        through the windshield.  Carla was 
                        six, she wouldn’t remember.  I 
                        made a decision right then, right 
                        there;

                        whatever had or hadn’t happened in 
                        the past I was going to be the 
                        hero of my own story.       
                                (checks him)
                        Sound corny?    
                                (not to him)
                        Had four grand to my name.  
                        Borrowed another twelve from my 
                        grandpa, took that sixteen grand 
                        and made Dan an offer for the 
                        diner he couldn’t refuse.
                                (Hank puzzled)
                        He couldn’t refuse sixteen grand. 
                        The place was on its last legs.  I 
                        refinanced, changed the name, 
                        menu, advertised.  Bought the 
                        tavern three years later.  I also 
                        own a construction company and 
                        half a Toyota dealership in 
                        Anderson.  I’ve got money like the 
                        Colonel’s got chicken.

                                 HANK
                        Jesus, that’s impressive.  

                                 SAM
                        You think more of me now.

                                 HANK
                        Absolutely.

                                 SAM
                        We’ve known each other since third 
                        grade.  You didn’t already know 
                        enough to be impressed?

           She quiets, hurt.  Unexpected feelings rise in him, he 
           changes the subject.   

                                 HANK
                        Why didn’t you and mom stay close?

                                 SAM
                        She changed.  Not all at once, 
                        obviously, nobody does.  But one 
                        day she wasn’t fun to be around 
                        anymore.  She became hard.  I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 HANK
                        Second grade.  
                                 SAM
                        What?

                                 HANK
                        We met in second grade.  You 
                        tasted like cinnamon.  
                                (Sam confused)
                        Mrs. Jenkins class.  Kickball 
                        field, South corner, I tried to 
                        kiss you.  You fish-hooked me.

           He puts a finger in his mouth, POPS a cheek.  She melts.

                                 SAM
                        What’d we do when we broke in here 
                        and were done eating?

           She leans in, kisses him.  Heat.  Sam slides off her 
           stool, straddles him.  He rethinks, tries to pull away. 

                                 HANK
                        I’m not done with my pie.

           She shoves the plate off the counter, it shatters.   

                                 HANK
                        We need to talk--

                                 SAM
                                (kissing harder)
                        You’re such a girl.

                                 HANK
                        I just don’t want you to think 
                        this is more than it is. 

                                 SAM
                        A meaningless memory lane hump?  

                                 HANK
                                (disappointed)
                        Really?

           She squirms off him, frustrated, angry.  Horny.

                                 SAM
                        Why did we come here?  I’m a forty-
                        three year old, twice-engaged, 
                        never married, single mom.  I work 
                        fifty hours a week and rent a 
                        shitpot full of movies.  I’m never

                        seeing you here.  But I’m not 
                        naive, Hank.  I know you.

                        What is it you think you know, 
                        Sam?  I’m loyal.  A good father, a 
                        great lawyer.  I’m also, but for 
                        rare exceptions, the smartest guy 
                        in the room; I realize how that 
                        sounds, fuck it, there it is.  I’m 
                        a decent person.  I’m tired of 
                        being scrutinized.     

                                 SAM
                        How’s it feel, Hank?

           He watches her cross the diner, exit, the bell tinkling.

           INT. DOC MORRIS’ HOUSE-BACK PORCH - DAY  

           The Judge in a rocker, Lauren on his lap.  She slow-reads 
           a worn paperback; Lonesome Dove.  I.V. tube in his arm.

                                 LAUREN

                        like a chance to shoot at a

           INT. CLINIC-DOC MORRIS’ HOUSE-KITCHEN - DAY  

           Hank watches Lauren and the Judge.  Doc Morris makes tea. 

                                 DOC MORRIS
                        There’s no hard and fast rules.  
                        Everybody’s different. 

                                 HANK
                        I may need you to testify.

                        The very real possibility, the 
                        probability, that he was mentally 
                        impaired the night he hit 
                        Blackwell.

                        It’s not my call.  Or yours.  It’s 
                        his.  And he’s made it.

                                 HANK
                        You people.  As ugly and brutal as 
                        you think prison is?  It’s much 
                        much worse.  Now imagine him 
                        there; old, confused, dying.   

                                 DOC MORRIS
                        You want to call me to the stand, 
                        call me.  I’ll tell you all about 
                        the ravages of chemotherapy.  But 
                        as the Judge’s physician, I’m 
                        bound by his wishes. 

                                 HANK
                        His vanity.  When will he be done 
                        with the treatments?

                        of up to him.

                                 HANK
                        To him?  How would he know?

                                (confused)
                        What exactly did he tell you?

                                 HANK
                        That he has colon cancer.  That 
                        it’s under control.    
                                (off Doc’s look)

                        realize a trial’s a grueling

                        aren’t a pleasant person.

           Hank signals him to spit it the fuck out. 

                                 DOC MORRIS
                        Your client has stage four cancer.  
                        It did start in his colon.  That 
                        was true.  Moved to his lymph 
                        nodes.  His spine’s full of it.  
                        He’s dying.

                        He was passing blood for a year

                        cut it out, slap a bag on him.  If 
                        he’d had regular screenings...  
                        But, the Judge isn’t the type to 
                        invite a camera up his ass with 
                        any degree of regularity.
                                (eyes the porch)
                        Your mother insisted he try.  I 
                        suspect he’s still doing it for 
                        her.  I told him to say when.  
                                (faces Hank; tearing)
                        I’ve considered swapping out the 
                        chemo with water.  I’d say he’s 
                        got at most a year, maybe less.

           Hank shifts to the door, watches Lauren, his father. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Hank and Lauren eat catfish from Styrofoam.  Hank’s mind 
           elsewhere.  She holds up a hush puppy.

                                 LAUREN
                        What’s a hush puppy?

                                 HANK
                        Good for you.
           A Ka-Thump from upstairs, something/someone fallen.

                                 HANK
                        Stay.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S ROOM - NIGHT  

           Hank enters, sees the Judge crawling into his bathroom.  
           Hank rushes over, lifts the lid.  The Judge dry heaves.  

           Hank unsure what to do.  A foul smell hits him a second 
           after the Judge loses bowel control.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I can manage, get out!

           He tries to rise, falls, Hank catches him.  The Judge 
           leans against the basin, head down, sobs once--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Mary.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Lauren at the closed door.  Men argue.  She tests the 
           knob.  Locked.

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                        Not so damn hot!  

           INT. JUDGE’S ROOM-BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           A clothed Hank stands in the tub supporting his father, 
           washing the Judge’s naked butt with the shower head.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Jesus, it’s freezing, you moron.

           Hank dials it up, a juggling act.  

                                 HANK
                        Thanks for stepping into my shit 
                        storm, Hank, appreciate it.

           KNOCK-KNOCK.  Lauren.

                                 HANK
                        What is it?
                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Can I come in?

                                 HANK
                        I’ll be out in a minute, go eat.

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        I’m full.  

                                 HANK
                        In a minute, Lauren!

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Hank on the verge of exploding, checks himself.

                                 HANK
                                (to the Judge; low)
                        What are we doing?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Fixing the sink.

                                 HANK
                        We’re fixing the sink.  It leaks.

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Can I help? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Too much water, she’ll slip. 

                                 HANK 
                        There’s water all over the floor 
                        honey.  Go watch T.V., Grandpa and 
                        I will be down in a minute.

           Silent.  Hank stretches for a towel.      

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Knock, knock.

                                 HANK
                        Lauren--

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        I wasn’t talking to you.

           The Judge chuckles, steadies himself, Hank softens. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Who’s there?
                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Army.

           Hank watches the Judge attempt to respond, fail.  

                                 HANK
                        Army who?

                                 LAUREN (O.S.)
                        Army and Grandpa still going for 
                        ice cream?

           Their eyes meet.  Both amused, despite it all.

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Hank drives down Main, Lauren in back.  Both lick double-
           scoop cones.  He angles his mirror to see her.

                                 HANK
                        How’s the pink bubblegum?

                                 LAUREN
                        Good.

                                 HANK
                        So what’s going on in your life?  
                        You seeing anybody?  Entertaining 
                        any marriage proposals?  What?

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m six.

                                 HANK
                        Job offers?  

           She attempts to fit a whole scoop in her small mouth.

                                 HANK
                        Tell me about Lauren.  Likes, 
                        dislikes.  What’s the future hold 
                        for you?  Doctor?  Captain of 
                        industry?  Lawyer seems popular. 

                                 LAUREN
                        I’d like to be a model.

                                 HANK
                        I’ll buy a firearm.

                                 LAUREN
                        Or make doughnuts.  
           Hank raises an eyebrow.

                                 LAUREN
                        What I’d really like is to be a 
                        race car driver.

           His head swivels to face her, she’s serious. 

           INT. HANK’S IMPALA (MOVING)- NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)

           Lauren drives, on Hank’s lap.  Hank chews on his cone. 

                                 HANK
                        You’re a pro.
                                (beat)
                        What would you think, if when I 
                        got back, you and I live together?  
                        Just us. 

                                 LAUREN
                        When you and mommy get divorced?

                                 HANK
                        Uh-huh.

                                 LAUREN
                        Mommy would be lonely.

                                 HANK
                        What about me?  Won’t I be lonely?

                                 LAUREN
                        Daddies don’t get lonely, they 
                        marry younger mommies.  

                                 HANK
                        Turn, left, left, left.

           She jerks the wheel, he helps.  Switching topics...

                                 HANK
                        Who’s your best friend in the 
                        whole world, Lauren?

                                 LAUREN
                        Mommy.  
                                (afterthought)
                        And you.

           He rests his chin on top of her head, gooses the gas.
                                 HANK
                        Do I hear an airbag?  Kidding.  

           EXT. INDY AIRPORT-SECURITY - MORNING 

           Hank kneels, face-to-face with Lauren.    

                                 HANK
                        Just like coming here, only in 
                        reverse.  Mommy’ll be waiting.
                                (beat)
                        You good?

                                 LAUREN
                        I will be fine.

                                 HANK
                                (hugs her)
                        “I will be fine.”  You’re 
                        something else aren’t you?  

           He hands her off to her smiling ESCORT.  

                                 HANK
                        Bye baby.

           Hank watches as Lauren clears security, almost gone.

                                 HANK
                        HEY!  Lauren!

           Heads turn, NTSB personnel on alert.  He doesn’t care.   

                                 HANK
                        Who loves you?

           Lauren points at him.  Hank smiles, eyes wet, waves.

           She chews her lip, tucks hair behind an ear, turns.   
           Hank squints, smile dries.  Lip chew.  Hair tuck.  Carla.  

                                 HANK
                                (sotto)
                        Oh, fuck me.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-ATTIC - DAY  

           Hot.  Close.  Hank squats, claws into dusty cardboard 
           boxes, searching.  He pops a box, looks inside.  Bingo.  
           INT. JUDGE’S HOUSE-HANK’S ROOM - DAY  

           Hank rifles through the attic box, dumps its contents; 
           Northwestern University Law Review journals, a one-eyed 
           Teddy Bear, a stack of colorful birthday cards spill out.  

           A wallet photo spins onto the floor.  Hank pinches it up; 
           a yellowed photo of a 10 year old girl, circa 1980.  He 
           looks at the card, generic birthday greetings for a kid, 
           no inscription.  Another card.  Another photo, the girl 
           older now, a teen. He recognizes her... 

                                 HANK
                        Hope Stevens.

           He returns to his search.  Finds a Carlinville High 
           School Year Book.  He flips pages, lands on his photo, 
           Sam’s, them at a senior dance... date: February, 1989.     

           He paces, counts out months on fingers.

                                 HANK
                        February, March, April, May, June, 
                        July, August, September, October, 
                        Novem--

           Five fingers on one hand, four on the other.  Nine.  

                                 HANK
                                (rationalizing)
                        Nah, couldn’t be.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE-SIDEWALK - DAY  

           C.P leans a hand against a Courthouse wall, stomach 
           roiling.  Hank appears, grabs an elbow, steers him off 
           the sidewalk, onto grass.   He vomits, finishes.

                                 HANK
                        Always on grass, never pavement.  
                        Won’t splash your shoes that way.

                                 C.P
                        I don’t know what my problem is.  

                                 HANK
                        You’re personally invested in your 
                        client.  You feel the life in your 
                        hands.  
                                (they walk)
                        Both go away.  Trust me.
                                 C.P
                        I hope not.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  

           Dickham questions numbered POTENTIAL JURORS.  Sullivan at 
           the bench.  C.P huddles with Hank and the Judge.  

                                 C.P
                                (quietly)
                        Who exactly is our target juror?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Intelligent people who will listen 
                        to instructions and follow the 
                        evidence. 

           Hank draws a grid of the jury box with numbers and names.  

                                 HANK
                        Idiots I can persuade to swallow 
                        their own tongues; moon-landing 
                        deniers, so on, so forth.  

           Dickham addresses POTENTIAL JUROR 21, male.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        ...To answer your question, this 
                        should be one, two, days at most.  
                        But keep in mind, sir, that 
                        serving on a jury is the hallmark 
                        of our legal system.  To be judged 
                        by your peers isn’t just a right 
                        it’s a duty.  Sometimes that duty 
                        inconveniences us.   

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Anything else, Mr. Dickham?

                                 DICKHAM
                        No, your honor.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Mr. Palmer, chomp the bit no more.

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (to Hank; whispers)
                        Subtlety.  A velvet touch.  

           Hank nods, slides his grid to C.P.  He strides over to 
           the jury box.  He studies them, strikes--
                                 HANK
                        Who thinks the old man’s guilty?

           The Judge bites off a curse.  Jurors squirm.  Dickham eye-
           checks Sullivan.  Two hands go up.  Hank motions to C.P.

                                 HANK
                                (to 21)
                        What about you, sir?

                                 POTENTIAL JUROR 21
                        Hmm?  

                                 HANK
                        “Hmm?”  You think he’s guilty.

                                 POTENTIAL JUROR 21
                        No... how would, I mean--

                                 HANK
                        I wasn’t asking you a question.  
                        You said he was guilty. 

                                 POTENTIAL JUROR 21
                        What?  I didn’t.  I never--

                                 HANK
                        Out in the hall, I overheard you 
                        tell Barbara there you thought the 
                        Judge was guilty as sin.

           21 speechless, Potential Jurors look sideways at him.

                                 POTENTIAL JUROR 21
                                (looks at Sullivan)
                        I never said that.  I swear.

                                 HANK
                        You didn’t, but you see how hard 
                        it is to prove a negative?  You 
                        can say any nasty untrue thing you 
                        want about somebody.  That’s why--

                        DICKHAM
                   (stands)
           Objection!
                                                          HANK
                                              --the state has the burden 
                                              of proof!  

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Sustained.  Mr. Palmer, I’m sure 
                        your legal hijinx are a big hit in 
                        Chicago.  The Catskills even.  But 
                        I lack the patience to continually 
                        reel you in.  Got me?
                                 HANK
                        Yes sir.
                                (turns to Jurors)
                        Bumper stickers!  On your car, 
                        truck, RV?  Show of hands.   

           Sullivan sighs.  Confused faces among the Potential 
           Jurors.  Seven hesitant hands go up.  Hank points...

                        It just spells out “tolerance” 
                        with religious symbols.  

           Hank dismisses her with a grunt and a wave, points--

                        “Mensa.”

                                 HANK
                        Are you?

                        Yes.

           Hank swivels to C.P, 24 scratched out. 

                        “Merle Haggard for President.”

                                (sheepish)
                        “Certified breast inspector, have 
                        ‘em out.” 

                        “Gun control means using both 
                        hands.”

           25, 26, 27 circled.  

                        “Honor role student on board.”

           A lone hiss from the gallery.  28 scratched.  

                        “Wife and dog missing...
                                (reluctant)
                        Reward for dog.”

           A somber Judge stares at the marked up grid, listens to 
           the laughter, watches C.P circle 29.
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-HANK’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Dark.  Hank stirs, wakes to the Judge’s voice, rising.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Hank creeps.  Light seeps under the Judge’s door.  

                                 THE JUDGE (O.S.)
                                (rambling; slurred)
                        How am I to be blame?  I took... I 
                        provided didn’t I?  Didn’t I?

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Hank enters, room a mess, clothes strewn about.  A wild- 
           haired Judge rummages through his bureau, incoherent.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        What would you rather... what 
                        should I have done, Mary?  Tell 
                        me, you know every Goddamn thing! 
                        Tell me, woman, what do you want?  

           Hank crosses the room, tentative... frightened.

                                 HANK
                        Dad?

           The Judge spins, cheeks streaked with tears, eyes 
           unfocused, hands bleeding.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You read those fucking birthday 
                        cards, tell her to stop already... 
                        stop.  Stop yelling, Mary!  
                        Enough!

           Hank leads him to the bed, helps him sit.

                                 HANK
                        Sit there, Judge.  I’ll get you 
                        some water.  You want some water? 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Hank fills a glass, hands trembling, drinks.  
           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-JUDGE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT   

           Hank offers water to the Judge.  No response.  Hank holds 
           it to his mouth, his father sips.  Calms. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Your mother know you’re home?

           Hank pops open Pond’s cold cream.  Gently rubs it into 
           the Judge’s hands.

                                 HANK
                        This will make your hands soft.  
                        Feels good doesn’t it?

                                 THE JUDGE 
                        Yeah.

                                 HANK
                        “Yeah?”  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Hank.  My lawyer.
                                (Hank nods)
                        You any good?

           Hank grins.  The Judge suddenly tears up again.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Where’s my Mary?

                                 HANK
                        Hey, hey... who’s the best lawyer 
                        you ever saw?  C’mon, forty plus 
                        years, had to see some characters.
                                (Judge calms)
                        Best I ever saw?  Arthur Bloom.  I 
                        work for the man.  You’d hate him.  
                        Fearless.  Juries love him, 
                        prosecutors hate him, judges are 
                        afraid of him.     
                                (Judge blank)
                        It’s true.  He’s argued two cases 
                        before the Supreme Court.  I’ve 
                        seen Arthur object to a witnesses’ 
                        name, make veteran cops cry on the 
                        stand, poison a jury with a look.  
                        Once, hand to God, he wrapped a 
                        Bible in the flag in open court 
                        and set both on fire.  Arthur 
                        doesn’t lose.  Just like your 
                        lawyer.  Now who you got?  
           The Judge lost in himself, Hank opens his mouth to prod--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Mr. Shaw.  Traveled the county 
                        circuit.  My first job after law 
                        school.  A drifter killed a 
                        farmer, violated his wife.  Five 
                        Points road.  Corn knife.  Vile 
                        human being.  County assigned Mr. 
                        Shaw the case.  We’d take dinner 
                        to the jail.  Every night.  Mr. 
                        Shaw sat with him, prepared him, 
                        defended him.  No tricks.  

                                 HANK
                        He win?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Electrocuted.  He was dead, but 
                        Mr. Shaw had to live here.  He was 
                        spit on, threatened, people 
                        wouldn’t sit near him in church.  
                        Would have been easy to refuse the 
                        case.  But he believed in the law.  
                        I can’t say best.  But Henry Shaw?  
                        Most decent man I ever met... 
                                (yawns)
                        I’m going to sleep now.  Put your 
                        mother’s cream back where you 
                        found it.

           The Judge lies down.  Hank drags a cover across him, has 
           a last look before he hits the lights.

           INT. POLICE STATION-SHERIFF WHITE’S OFFICE - DAY  

           A picture-tube TV plays a grainy B&W surveillance tape of 
           the Minit Mart.  Hanson works a remote, Hank, Sheriff 
           White, Dickham watch.  Onscreen --

           The Judge, Blackwell... we see what might be eye contact.  
           The Judge spills eggs.  

                                 HANK
                        We’ve seen this ten times.  The 
                        Judge leaves the store, his car 
                        goes one way, Blackwell the other.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        Patience.
           Through the windows we see the Judge’s Seville pull out 
           of the lot.  Hanson fast forwards.  PLAY.  Customers 
           inside the store, traffic outside.  FREEZE.  The Seville 
           on the street, heads in the opposite direction.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        Time?

                                 HANSON
                        Four minutes forty-five.  

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                                (to Hank; sorry)
                        It’s at least six minutes from the 
                        store to the tracks.  One way.

                                 DICKHAM
                        He didn’t get to the tracks.

                                 HANK
                        And? 

           Dickham grins, knows Hank’s a pro.  Hanson confused. 

                                 HANSON
                        And he’s lying.  In his statement 
                        Judge Palmer said he reached the 
                        road under the trestle, it was 
                        washed out and he turned around.  

                                 HANK
                        You’re kidding right?  He’s lived 
                        here his whole life, you think he 
                        can’t gauge when the road’s going 
                        to wash out?  That’s it?  

                                 HANSON
                        That’s not the point--

                                 DICKHAM
                        Sheriff may Mr. Palmer and I use 
                        your office please?

           Sheriff and Hanson vacate.  No sooner does the door shut-- 

                        DICKHAM
           Ten years, he’ll do seven.  
           Offer expires when you 
           leave this room. 
                                                          HANK
                                              Drop all charges, blame it 
                                              on the locals, save face 
                                              and go home. 

                                 DICKHAM
                                (sincere)
                        I’m so glad you’re on your game.
                                 HANK
                        I have but one speed.  We done?

           Dickham closes on Hank, his hostility personal. 

                                 DICKHAM
                        I have intent now.  Premeditation.  
                        I’ll paint your father as a holier 
                        than thou prick determined to see 
                        what he considers justice served.  

                                 HANK
                        My father is a holier than thou 
                        prick determined to see justice 
                        served.  Sounds like a light day.      

           Hank heads for the door.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Thanks, by the way.  You’re the 
                        reason I became a lawyer.  You and 
                        Bobby Clemens.      
                                (doesn’t register)
                        Not important enough to remember.    
                        Fifteen years ago he was arrested 
                        by the Chicago P.D. on a marijuana 
                        bust.  Bobby was small time, what 
                        little money he made went for 
                        groceries.  You were the 
                        prosecutor.  Convinced him he’d 
                        spend the next ten years in 
                        prison.  Told him you’d cut him 
                        loose if he gave you a name, a 
                        bigger fish.  Bobby was stupid.  
                        Didn’t know his weed weight was a 
                        wrist-slappper.  So he gave you a 
                        name and you made an arrest and 
                        the paper for a day or two.  
                                (Hank remembers)
                        Bobby -- my older brother -- made 
                        a dumpster.  His throat cut with a 
                        box knife. 

           Dickham picks up the remote, rewinds the video.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        When I saw the request for a 
                        special prosecutor I made sure you 
                        couldn’t appeal on a conflict of 
                        interest charge and jumped on it. 

           The Judge appears onscreen. 
                                 DICKHAM
                        You may think Mark Blackwell’s 
                        white trash and he may be, but in 
                        the eyes of the law his life 
                        matters.  The law is the only 
                        thing capable of making people 
                        equal.  Your father is a liar who 
                        thinks he can manipulate that law.  
                        Just like his son.  I’m going to 
                        impale him on a Murder Two charge.  
                        And you get a front row seat.     

                                 HANK
                        Ever piss on an electric fence, 
                        Dickham?

           EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY  

           One hundred acres of corn beneath a bruised sky.  Two 
           fingers of lightning on the horizon.  Thunder rolls.   

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - DAY  

           Lunch abandoned quickly.  A tornado siren sounds. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-BASEMENT - DAY  

           Video POV: Gang all here.  The Judge, Glen, Amy hunker 
           down in lawn chairs with platefuls of food.  The Teens 
           mug for the camera.  Hank festers on the floor, back 
           against a wall, plate beside him, untouched.  The Judge 
           looks at him.  Problem.  Dale doesn’t miss a beat.

                                 TEEN 1
                        It’s never a tornado, why are we 
                        down here?

                                 GLEN
                        Tell that to the people in Joplin, 
                        Missouri.  Be glad your Grandpa 
                        has a basement.  

           KA-BOOM!  Dark.  Lights, AC, power off.  Silence. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        Where’s your mouth now, mister?

           Video POV ends.  A flashlight beam hits the ceiling, a 
           second, third as Glen, Amy flip flashlights on.  Beams 
           play across faces, stored holiday decorations, old bikes. 
                                 TEEN 1
                        How ‘bout it, uncle Dale?

           A chorus of Dale!  Dale!  Dale!  Applause.

           Hank sits in silence, mind elsewhere.  A weight on him. 

           A projector beam cuts the gloom, the room cheers.  Images 
           on a wall; 15 year old Glen pitches Little League, Mary, 
           a young Hank, young Dale watch from stands, clap. 

           Teens whoop at the sight of their dad.  Glen glances at 
           Hank.  Nothing.  The images change... Amy, Glen at the 
           hospital with their first baby.  The Judge, Mary proud 
           grandparents.  Mary takes the baby, cradles him. 

           The porch swing, a woman’s back to us, hair gray.  The  
           camera swings around and we see it’s recent footage of 
           Mary.  Her hands in her lap, a thousand yard stare.  Hank 
           riveted, struck by her distance, lack of warmth. 

                                 GLEN
                        Speed it up, man.

                            DALE
                                                         TEEN 2
           It’s film.  
                                              Gram looks pissed.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Next, Dale.

           Dale fumbles with the film.  Onscreen Mary notices the 
           camera, annoyed, snarls “Go away.”  

                            HANK
                                                       THE JUDGE
           I want to see it.
                                              Next, moron.

           Dale hesitates, not sure what he’s supposed to do.

                            HANK
                                                       THE JUDGE
           Let it run!
                                              Turn it off!

           Mary viciously swipes at the camera just as Dale jerks 
           the reel off.  Hank and the Judge lock eyes, blame laid.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        What the hell do you know?

                                 GLEN
                        Hank, don’t--

                                 HANK
                        I know you didn’t get close to the 
                        tracks before you turned around.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANK (CONT'D)
                        I know I got blind-sided like a 
                        park bench lawyer because you 
                        decided to hold out on me.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I told you everything I knew--

                                 HANK
                        I’m sick of you deciding how the 
                        world runs, what you should parcel 
                        out, when you should do it.   

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You want to quit, quit!  I can--

                                 HANK
                        Can what?  Can what?  Who you 
                        gonna get?  C.P.?  He can’t hold 
                        down a breakfast burrito.  Trial’s 
                        in a week.  I’m trapped!

                                                       THE JUDGE
                            GLEN
           Hank this isn’t the place.
                                              Fine, you’re fired!  
                                              Satisfied?

           The Judge charges for the steps, bangs into something, 
           keeps going, Hank in pursuit.  Glen grabs onto Hank.

                                 GLEN
                        Leave him be, he’s sick!

                                 HANK
                        Let go of me with that gimp 
                        fucking hand. 
                                (to the Judge)
                        Remember why you pulled me out of 
                        Boy Scouts?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        As punishment for blowing up the 
                        McGraw’s mailbox with M-80s.

                                 HANK
                        That, that you remember.  I was 
                        thirteen.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Old enough to know better.

                                 HANK
                        You didn’t come to my high school 
                        graduation.  Or college--   
                         THE JUDGE
                                                          HANK
           Boo fuckin’ hoo.
                                              Why?

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - DAY  

           Dim.  Wind roars.  Sheets of sideways rain.  The Judge 
           slaps his plate on the table, Hank meets him. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        The drugs, the truancy, the  
                        shoplifting!  I wasn’t going to 
                        reward your behavior!

                                 HANK
                        I graduated from law school for 
                        Christ’s sake!

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I supported you, clothed you, put 
                        a roof over your head.  Who paid 
                        for that college education I never 
                        showed up to kiss your ass over?  
                        Your mother?  She was a housewife!  
                        Why couldn’t you swallow your 
                        Goddamn pride and just come home 
                        to her? 

           Hank taken aback.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I married your mother, I didn’t 
                        marry you kids!  I was the one she 
                        blamed because you wouldn’t come 
                        home.  Me.  I didn’t recognize 
                        her.  She’d go days without 
                        talking to me and when she would 
                        it was all bile.  Was I tough on 
                        you?  Yes.  How’d you turn out, 
                        Henry?  Waiting tables?  A bum?   

                                 HANK
                        You put me in Vanderburgh.   
                                (and there it is)
                        Juvenile detention.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No.  You put yourself there.

                                 HANK
                        The prosecutor recommended 
                        community service.  
                                 THE JUDGE
                        That wouldn’t have helped you.

                                 HANK
                        I didn’t need help!

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You were high.  You rolled the 
                        car.  With your brother in it.

                                 HANK
                        I was seventeen.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        “I was thirteen”, “I was 
                        seventeen”, you took his future 
                        from him!  

           Hank clutches at his head, face, knew it was coming. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You were headed down the wrong 
                        path.  I did what I thought was 
                        right.     

                                 HANK
                        Well, you were wrong.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY  

           Blue, cloudless sky.  Shoe soles sunk in mud.  Hank 
           studies his mom’s headstone, wet dirt outlines her grave.

                                 HANK
                        I’m sorry.
                                (louder)
                        I’m sorry, mom.

           INT. FLYING DEER TAVERN - NIGHT 

           Sam enters financials on a laptop.  The doorbell tinkles, 
           Hank steps in, lugging two cardboard boxes.  

           He dumps them on a table, sits, pulls files.  She watches 
           him for a long beat.  Her first.  The love of her life.  
           She shuts her laptop.  Joins him.  

                                 SAM
                        This ain’t a library.
                                 HANK
                        Going through the old man’s files; 
                        counting, listing, separating 
                        civil from criminal, felonies, 
                        misdemeanors, violent, non-
                        violent, birth, death 
                        certificates, divorces, assorted 
                        busywork, etcetera, etcetera. 

                                 SAM
                        How far back?

                                 HANK
                        Forty-three years.

           She double-taps the table.  Files thud in front of her.  
           She begins.  He studies her, on the fence, over it...    

                                 HANK
                        You want to tell me who Carla’s 
                        father is? 

                                 SAM
                        At this point, does it matter?

           No answer.  She gestures to a box.

                                 SAM
                        You could just pull her birth 
                        certificate.

                                 HANK
                        It doesn’t list the father.

           He watches her slow burn, her assistance in jeopardy.

                                 HANK
                        I’m gonna just let it go for now.

           He nudges her files closer to her, she returns to her 
           stack.  He glances at her, grateful, attracted. 

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME - NIGHT 

           Hank walks through the house, searching.  No Judge.

           INT. JUDGE’S HOME-KITCHEN - NIGHT 

           Hank looks out into the backyard.  The Judge leans elbows  
           on the picnic table, sipping Scotch. 
           EXT. JUDGE’S HOME-BACK YARD - NIGHT 

           Hank, plastic cup in hand, joins in.  The Judge pushes a  
           bottle towards Hank.  Hank pours.

                                 HANK
                        Finally opened her up, huh?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Maker’s Mark.  Drove down to 
                        Loretto, Kentucky 1979 to buy her. 

                                 HANK
                        I almost cracked this baby open a 
                        dozen times.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Be glad you didn’t.

           Hank drinks, feels the liquor, the night breeze.

                                 HANK
                        Tastes expensive.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        It is.  Gonna tell me I shouldn’t 
                        drink?  

                                 HANK
                        You’re a big boy.  You ready for 
                        tomorrow? 
                                (Judge nods)
                        Went and saw Mom today.  Outta 
                        curiosity... how’d you two meet?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        She walked into Mr. Shaw’s law 
                        office peddling this awful daily 
                        shopper.  She wore a plaid blazer, 
                        these thick glasses, and a green 
                        skirt she always insisted wasn’t 
                        tight on her, but... 
                                (chuckles)
                        I damn near lost my mind.

           Hank smiles, appreciates the memory.

                                 HANK
                        You think there’s something else?  
                        After we die?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You asking me if I believe in God?
                                 HANK
                        Do you?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’m seventy-two with stage four 
                        cancer.  What choice do I have?  

                                 HANK
                        Mom ever cheat on you?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No chance.

                                 HANK
                        You?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Nope.  You the one lost my 
                        Freemason’s ring?  

                                 HANK
                        Guilty.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I knew it.  Why?  You were ten.

                                 HANK
                        I needed a fishing weight.

           The Judge half mutters a curse, half chuckles.

                                 HANK
                        What’d you think of Lisa?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I could take or leave her.  Do you 
                        really make five-hundred an hour?

                                 HANK
                        Five and a quarter.  When do guys 
                        stop beating off?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’ll let you know.  Did you move 
                        away just to spite us?

                                 HANK
                        You yes, mom no. 
                                (beat)
                        Why’d you change? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I didn’t.
                                 HANK
                        I have memories.  Of us.  All of 
                        us.  Vacations, playing.  You 
                        laughing, hugging us.  Me.  And 
                        then I don’t. 

           Hank knows the Judge can’t answer.  Won’t.  He drinks.

           EXT. COURTHOUSE-LAWN - MORNING 

           A tornado siren sounds.  Hank and C.P vomit.  Together.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY 

           Packed.  Sweltering.  Hank, the Judge, C.P for the 
           defense.  Glen and Dale just behind them.  Judge Sullivan 
           on the bench.  ASIAN FORENSIC SCIENTIST on the stand. 

                                 FORENSIC SCIENTIST 
                        It’s the difference between 
                        reasonable probability and 
                        statistical certainty. 

                                 DICKHAM
                        In English?

                                 FORENSIC SCIENTIST
                        It’s the victim’s blood on the 
                        Cadillac.    

                                 DICKHAM
                        Nothing further.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Mr. Palmer?

                                 HANK
                                (seated)
                        It’s his blood, your honor.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY (LATER)

           Hank questions the Minit Mart Clerk.

                                 HANK
                        Didn’t take a swing at Mr. 
                        Blackwell?  

                                 MINIT MART CLERK
                        No.
                                 HANK
                        Use profanity, rant, rave, flip 
                        him off, or display any sign of 
                        hostility?

                                 MINIT MART CLERK
                        No.

           Hank glances at the JURORS, building rapport.  

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY (LATER)

           Hanson on the stand, Dickham up.  A tripod supports an 
           enlarged photo of the accident scene stretch of road. 

                                 DICKHAM
                        Any brake marks?

                                 HANSON
                        No, Sir.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Trees, low hanging branches, 
                        weeds, anything that would 
                        obstruct Mr. Palmer’s view? 

                                 HANSON
                        It was a straight shot.

                                 DICKHAM
                        So even if a person had perfect 
                        vision, nearsighted, farsighted...  
                        they’d have a clear field of 
                        vision.

                                 C.P
                                (bolts up)
                        Objection!  Assumption of facts 
                        not in evidence.

           Hank, the Judge grin at C.P.  As does Judge Sullivan.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Sustained.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Nothing further, your honor.

           Hank strolls to the stand, in command.  A showman.  
                                 HANK
                        Deputy Hanson.  You were 
                        previously an officer in Detroit?

                                 DICKHAM
                        Objection.  The deputy’s 
                        credentials are not in question.

                                 HANK
                                (to Judge Sullivan)
                        I was going to say “welcome to 
                        Carlinville.”

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Uh-huh.

           Hank squints at the photo, points to a small road bump.

                                 HANK
                        What is that?  Right there.

           Gallery, Jurors, everybody cranes forward, squints.

                                 HANSON
                        Road kill, raccoon maybe.  

                                 HANK
                        With that tail? 

                                 HANSON
                        I dunno, a possum then.

                        DICKHAM
                                                     JUDGE SULLIVAN
           Your honor...
                                              What’s your point, Mr. 
                                              Palmer?

                                 HANK
                        That there, is a snapping turtle.    

           The crowd laughs. 

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        And?

                                 HANK
                        And Detroit can be forgiven for 
                        not knowing what running over a 
                        snapping turtle is like.  Hit a 
                        rabbit, possum, skunk, your car 
                        goes ka-bump, ka-bump.  But 
                        nailing a big snapper like him is 
                        similar to smacking into a cinder 
                        block... car goes Ka-Bam!  Ka-Bam!
           More laughter, a couple male Jurors confer, agree.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Objection; dead turtle physics are 
                        assumptions not in evidence.

           C.P reddens, the Judge nudges the young lawyer, grins.

                                 HANK
                        Your honor, the prosecution 
                        maintains that Judge Palmer 
                        deliberately ran Mr. Blackwell 
                        down.  That he couldn’t have 
                        accidentally hit him, not realized 
                        a person was struck and drove on.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        Is there a question here?

                                 HANK
                                (to Hanson)
                        My question is: any brake marks in 
                        front of that turtle?

                                 HANSON
                        No, Sir.

                                 HANK
                        Deputy, did the police receive a 
                        call at anytime last week to say 
                        “Hey, I hit something, maybe 
                        someone on Shelby Road?”

                                   HANSON
                                (grudgingly)
                        No.  We did not.

           Sheriff White parked on the stand, a T.V. plays the Minit 
           Mart surveillance footage.  The Judge’s car appears.  
           Dickham works a remote.  Freeze frame.  

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        The Judge’s Cadillac reappears in 
                        the frame approximately five 
                        minutes after he left the lot.

                                 DICKHAM
                                (hits rewind)
                        Exact time, Sheriff?
                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Four minutes forty-five seconds.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Again, when he leaves.  Oops.

           Rewound too far.  Almost out of frame, the Judge cradles 
           a carton of eggs.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        Went a little far.

           The Judge stares at the footage, sees his own image.  
           Memory flooding back...

                                                                FLASH TO:

           INT. MINIT MART - DAY (FLASHBACK)

           The Judge removes eggs from a reach-in cooler, pops the 
           top to check for cracked shells. 

                                 BLACKWELL (O.S.)
                        Hey, Judge.

           The Judge glances left -- BLACKWELL grabs a six-pack -- 
           the Judge hardens. 

                                                               RETURN TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  

           Hank notices his stricken father eyeballing the T.V.  The 
           Judge stands, dazed.      

                                 C.P
                        Judge?

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Mr. Palmer?

           The Judge collapses, C.P, Hank break his fall.  The crowd 
           gasps.  Glen, Dale race to their father.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DAY  

           Clean.  Window.  The Judge in bed, I.V. in an arm.  Doc 
           Morris sits.  Glen, Amy, the Teens hover.  Dale videos.    
                                 AMY
                        Can we bring you supper, dad?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I would like a photo of Mary.  The 
                        one on my nightstand.  Please.

           The Judge motions Dale in.  Low.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I know that camera’s a buffer for 
                        you.  You want to keep using the 
                        damn thing, use it.  But just 
                        know, you don’t need it. 

           Dale nods, tucks the camera away.  Hank and C.P step in.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        The Dream Team.  See you, folks. 

           Family files out, Doc Morris brings up the rear.  

                                 DOC MORRIS
                                (to Hank; exiting)
                        Doubt he takes much more of this.

                                 C.P
                        I’ll ask for a postponement.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        So I can enjoy this hayride a few 
                        more days?  You’re as dumb as he 
                        is.

                                 HANK
                        C.P, give me and the Almighty a 
                        minute.

           C.P edges out.  Door shuts.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I killed the bastard.

                                 HANK
                        Do not say it again.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’m seventy-two.  I know me.  I 
                        ran that man down. 
                                 HANK
                        Shut.  Your.  Mouth.
                                (beat; frustrated)
                        Do you remember hitting him?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Just a matter of time.

                                 HANK
                        A lifetime of fist-shaking ethical 
                        superiority.  Endlessly itemizing 
                        my deficiencies.  And you murder a 
                        man?  No.  This you don’t do.    

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I don’t have the energy to fight 
                        with you, Henry.

                                 HANK
                        Muster some.  It was twenty years 
                        ago.  How do you not let it go?  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        He stole from me.

                                 HANK
                        I’m good with cliches.  The 
                        integrity of the court?  Your 
                        judicial innocence?  So Hope’s mom 
                        sent you cards every year, blister 
                        up.  What’d he steal-   

                                 THE JUDGE
                        He took my sons from me.
                                (weary)
                        Never threw a ball to Glen after 
                        that day.  Not once.  Not sure I 
                        ever held Dale again, told him I 
                        loved him.  Certain I never told 
                        you.  
                                (beat)
                        If I’m your age, Henry, with a 
                        Lauren, yes, I do things 
                        differently.  But I can smell the 
                        death in my breath.  The thing is,   
                        I regret I can’t remember the look 
                        on his face before I hit him.  

                                 HANK
                        You’re not taking the stand.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I’ll fire you and C.P will do it.
                                 HANK
                        How am I supposed to defend you?  
                        I’ve sprayed reasonable doubt all 
                        over this thing, keep your mouth 
                        shut and you walk!  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I have to live here.  

                                 HANK
                        Not if you die in prison.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        See you in court, Henry.

           INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

           Bench empty.  Gallery full.  Dickham waiting.  C.P beside 
           the Judge, checks his watch, scans the crowd.  No Hank.   

           EXT. COURTHOUSE-REAR STEPS - MORNING  

           Hank sits on the steps, alone.  Thinking. 

                                 MARGARET STEVENS (O.S.)
                        Mr. Palmer?

           Margaret Stevens appears before him, in a dated dress. 

                                 HANK
                        What can I do for you, ma’am?

                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                        You can tell the Judge Hope 
                        Stevens’ mother Margaret said 
                        “thank you.”  

           Hank stands, uncertain of the message, how to proceed.

                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                        I hated your father.  I blamed him 
                        for the death of my child almost 
                        as much as I blamed Mark 
                        Blackwell.  Every year I’d send 
                        him a birthday card, a picture of 
                        Hope inside.  I’ll grant you it 
                        was cruel but I wanted him to 
                        remember her face.   

                                 HANK
                        He did.
                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                        Your mother came to my house just 
                        before Hope’s last birthday.  She 
                        asked that I stop sending the 
                        cards.  Said she had three boys 
                        and couldn’t imagine my pain.  
                        That the Judge wasn’t feeling 
                        well.  I told her to go to hell.     

                                 HANK
                        Bet that went over well.

                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                        She said I had three choices; I 
                        could stop sending the cards or 
                        two, she’d be happy to roll the 
                        card up every year, drive it back 
                        over, and twist it up my ass. 

           Margaret laughs, Hank likes her instantly.  They sit.

                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                        After Hope was gone, I’d hear the 
                        talk; her jeans were too tight,  
                        lipstick too red.  Isn’t it a 
                        shame, but what did she expect?  
                        Why didn’t her mother do more?  
                                (beat)
                        Easy to judge isn’t it?  When you 
                        don’t have the responsibility of 
                        living with it?  Fun even.
                                (emotional)
                        When the prison sent me the letter 
                        that he was being released, I was 
                        terrified.  I’d have to relive 
                        that day every time I saw him.  
                        And I did.  At the market, pumping 
                        gas, laughing with his brother.  
                        I’d see Hope, calling to me for 
                        help.  Do you think those were her 
                        last thoughts, Mr. Palmer, where’s 
                        my mom?  I never came.  
                                (Hank at a loss)
                        I was born here, my child’s buried 
                        here, I can’t just up and move.  I 
                        crawled in bed.  I was trapped.
                                (beat)
                        When I heard he was dead... I 
                        cried I was so relieved.  I caused 
                        your father pain for so many years 
                        and yet he saved my life. 
                                (she stands)
                        Your mother and I became close.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARET STEVENS (CONT'D)
                        She was a wonderful woman.  Good 
                        luck Mr. Palmer.  

           Hank rises, watches her start away--

                                 HANK
                        Mrs. Stevens -- my mom.  What was 
                        the third choice?

                                 MARGARET STEVENS
                                (smiles)
                        That she’d call her son the 
                        lawyer.  That her boy was razor-
                        sharp.  And that he’d scorch the 
                        Earth if his father needed him.        

           Hank soaks that in.

           INT. COURTROOM - MORNING

           Box fans move air.  The Judge sworn in.  Hank looks at 
           his brothers, all their hope pinned to him.     

           The Judge sits.  Hank braces.

                                 HANK
                        You’ve... Judge Palmer, you’ve 
                        been on the bench how long?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Forty-two years.

                                 HANK
                        Sir, how many violent crimes have 
                        you ruled on in that time? 

                                 DICKHAM
                        Objection, the defendant’s history 
                        as a judge is not relevant.

                                 HANK
                        Your honor, the state has 
                        introduced evidence that suggests 
                        a motive for the alleged crime 
                        related to the Judge’s duties.  
                        I’m entitled to rebut that 
                        laughable presumption.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Overruled.  
                                 THE JUDGE
                        Not something I keep track of.

                                 HANK
                        Would it surprise you to learn 
                        you’ve presided over seventeen 
                        murder trials?  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        It would not.

           C.P. hands stats to Hank.  Hank reads--

                                 HANK
                        Seventeen murder trials.  Four 
                        hundred thirty-four assaults, 
                        fifteen rapes.  Signed five-
                        thousand twenty-five marriage 
                        licences, two-thousand six divorce 
                        decrees, nineteen hundred birth 
                        certificates and one-thousand 
                        seventy-five death certificates.  
                        Twelve-thousand nine-hundred forty-
                        two civil cases. 
                                (pause for emphasis)
                        Run over any of those defendants?  

                                 DICKHAM
                        Objection.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Rein it in, Mr. Palmer.

                                 HANK
                        You just lost your wife?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.

                                 HANK
                        How long were you married?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Fifty years.

                                 HANK
                        How did she die?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        She spent the morning in the 
                        garden.  Kneeling.  She fussed 
                        over her hydrangeas.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE JUDGE (CONT'D)
                        A blood clot formed in her left 
                        leg, went to her heart.

                                 HANK
                        The day of the accident.  What did 
                        you do that morning? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I buried your mo-- My wife.

                                 HANK
                        Hard day.  How did you feel?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Tired.

                                 HANK
                        Tired, dark, raining.  Do you 
                        remember hitting the victim?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I do not.

                                 HANK
                        Sir, in your experience of forty-
                        two years, why don’t defendants 
                        testify on their own behalf?    

                                 THE JUDGE
                        They’re guilty.

           INT. COURTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The Judge still on the stand.  Dickham on the attack.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Fair to say you disliked Mark 
                        Blackwell?  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Wished him ill?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Dead?
                                 THE JUDGE
                        I did.

           The honesty stays Dickham, he glances at Hank.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Deputy Hanson testified that you 
                        told him only you were allowed to 
                        drive that car.  Not even your 
                        late wife.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        It’s my car.

                                 DICKHAM
                        So a man’s blood, a man that you 
                        hate, was found on a car that only 
                        you drive, and yet you don’t 
                        remember how it got there? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No.

                                 DICKHAM
                        A six foot one inch, two-hundred 
                        twenty pound man on a steel 
                        bicycle and you’re in the dark?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Correct.

                                 DICKHAM
                        So on arguably one of the worst 
                        days of your life, you enter the 
                        Minit Mart and see a man you 
                        hate... And minutes later you’ve 
                        altered your route and both you 
                        and that man are on the same road, 
                        same time, only you’re in a car 
                        with his blood on it and he’s in a 
                        ravine; kidneys ruptured, back 
                        broken.  And you don’t remember 
                        hitting him? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I do not.
                                 DICKHAM
                        You’re telling this court under 
                        oath, which I know you understand 
                        more than most, that a man who 
                        killed somebody on your watch, a 
                        man you released, who drowned, a 
                        sixteen year old girl, a man you 
                        hated, on the worst day of your 
                        life and you have the perfect 
                        opportunity to balance the scales 
                        of justice and your testimony is 
                        that you didn’t seize the chance 
                        and kill him?   

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (soft)
                        No.

           Dickham heads toward his seat, wound inflicted.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        No more quest--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        That’s not my testimony.

           Dickham hesitates.  Hank sees it, wills his dad to stop.  

                                 DICKHAM
                        I’m sorry?  How have I mis-
                        characterized your testimony?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        My testimony is that I don’t 
                        remember hitting him.

           Dickham pieces it together.  Hank holds his breath.

                                 DICKHAM
                        Mr. Palmer.  Judge Palmer...
                                (beat; gentle)
                        Do you think you killed him 
                        intentionally? 

           Hank and the Judge lock eyes... Jesus Christ no--

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.

           Bedlam.  Hank sinks, the crowd all white noise.  

                                 C.P
                        Objection!  Calls for speculation!
                                 DICKHAM
                        No further questions, your honor.

           Judge Sullivan gavels the crowd into submission, silence.  

                                 HANK
                        Redirect, Judge.
                                (rises)
                        So.  You think you did it?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Correct.

                                 HANK
                        But not because you remember 
                        hitting him?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        That’s right.

                                 HANK
                        Your opinion is you hit him on 
                        purpose?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.

                                 HANK
                        You’re a lawyer, you know your 
                        opinion doesn’t matter.

                                                          HANK
                         THE JUDGE
           I’ve been doing this longer 
           than--
                                              Possible you think your 
                                              intent was to hit him but 
                                              it wasn’t?

                         THE JUDGE
                                                          HANK
                                              Isn’t that why we’re here?  
           Of course it’s possible, 
           but--

           The Judge starts to respond, Hank drowns him out--

                                 HANK
                        Why is it you can’t remember the 
                        accident?

                         THE JUDGE
                                                          HANK
           My wife just--
                                              Undergoing any medical 
                                              treatment?

                                 DICKHAM
                        Objection, irrelevant.
           The Judge realizes Hank’s angle, fidgets.

                                 HANK
                        State of mind, your honor.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Overruled.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Chemotherapy.

           Rumble through the crowd, dies quickly.

                                 HANK
                        How long?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Six months.

                                 HANK
                        Chemo, that means cancer.  
                        Prognosis?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        It’s advanced.

                                 HANK
                        Why can’t you recall the accident? 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Asked and answered.

                                 HANK
                        You’re not presiding here, you’re 
                        on trial.  Did your doctor caution 
                        you against potential side effects 
                        of chemotherapy?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        He did.

                                 HANK
                        What are they?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Fatigue, nausea, weight loss, loss 
                        of appetite--

                                 HANK
                        Delusions?  Fits of anger, 
                        depression?  Memory loss? 
                                 THE JUDGE
                        Yes.  But I don’t--

                                 HANK
                        Is that why you can’t remember?

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (to Judge Sullivan)
                        How many times do you intend to 
                        let him ask me the same question?

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        He’s your lawyer, Judge.
                                (pointed)
                        And it’s not the same question.

                                 HANK
                        Focus.  What would happen to all 
                        the trials you’ve presided over in 
                        the last six months if it were 
                        determined your mental capacity 
                        was compromised?  Diminished?   

           The Judge glares at Hank, betrayed.

                                 HANK
                        They’d be declared mistrials would 
                        they not?  Have to be retried?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Potentially.

                                 HANK
                        A stain on your reputation.  You’d 
                        do anything to avoid that would 
                        you not?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        No.

                                 HANK
                        Why don’t you remember seeing 
                        Blackwell that night?

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (flustered)
                        I remember him, I just don’t 
                        recall hitting that sonofabitch--

                                 HANK
                        What do you remember?
                                 THE JUDGE
                        I remember he opened his 
                        disgusting mouth.

                                 HANK
                        What could he possibly have said?

           The Judge looks at Hank, hates him.

                                                                FLASH TO:

           INT. MINIT MART - NIGHT 

           The Judge watches Blackwell pull beer from the cooler.

                                 BLACKWELL 
                        Your wife isn’t far from Hope.  
                                (displays his beer)
                        I won’t have to walk far to piss 
                        on both graves.

           The Judge shaken.  The egg carton tips, two eggs fall... 

                                                               RETURN TO:

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  

           Quiet.  Dale wipes tears from his eyes.  Dickham watches, 
           something like regret slides over him.  Hank pushes. 

                                 HANK
                        Isn’t it true you can’t remember 
                        the accident because of the 
                        effects of chemotherapy? 

                         THE JUDGE
           No.
                                                          HANK
                                              And that your vanity won’t 
                                              allow you to admit it?  

                                 HANK
                        Because you imagine yourself the 
                        U.S Grant of Carlinville.  An 
                        overrated general and a worse 
                        president.    

                                 THE JUDGE
                        I won’t be baited--  

                                 HANK
                        A drunk!  Tecumseh Sherman, 
                        there’s your hero!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANK (CONT'D)
                        Uncle Billy off his leash and on a 
                        bender!  Below the grit line with 
                        a Bible and a blow torch! 
                                (the Judge scoffs)
                        You’ve done this for forty-two 
                        years, it can’t be the first time 
                        someone’s insulted you! 
                                (smirks)
                        Blackwell didn’t steal from you.  
                        You allowed him to take it.  You 
                        and I exist because guilty people 
                        do.  We sort trash, it’s the job.  
                        There’s no legacy here, you’re a 
                        janitor in a long black robe.  

           The Judge’s breath turns ragged, eyes flecked with hate.  

                                 HANK
                        Why did you go easy on Blackwell 
                        the first time?  Why do you of all 
                        people, of all the judges in 
                        Indiana, the one with the tightest 
                        sphincter, give him only a month?  
                        He shot up her room, that’s six 
                        months easy!  What were you 
                        thinking?  You failed that girl! 
                        After six months, maybe he cools 
                        down, maybe he doesn’t kill Hope 
                        Stev-- 

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (breaks)
                        I looked at him and saw you!

           Last thing Hank expected to hear.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Same willful disobedience.  Same 
                        recklessness.  I looked at him and 
                        saw my middle son.  My little boy.  
                                (voice cracks)
                        I watched him cry right there.  I 
                        wanted to put my arms around him, 
                        tell him it didn’t have to be like 
                        this.  I wanted someone to help 
                        him like I’d want someone to help 
                        my boy if he lost his way.  It was 
                        my chance to be that someone.  

           All the heat leaves Blackwell’s Mom.  Jurors’ eyes shine. 
                                 THE JUDGE
                                (whisper)
                        I’d like to go home now.  

           Hank fights tears as he crosses the court, grabs Bailiff 
           by the sleeve, leads him back to the stand.

                                 HANK
                        This man’s been your bailiff for  
                        twenty-two years.  What is his 
                        name?

           The Judge looks at Gus the Bailiff, can’t pull it.

                                 HANK
                        No further questions, your honor.

           EXT. COUNTRY LAKE - DAY (SAME DAY) 

           Hank sits on the bank, absorbs the lake view.  A car door 
           shuts, Sam approaches, settles next to him.  Silence 
           between them.  Blackbirds sway on cattails, sing. 

                                 SAM
                        I remember what we first did here.
                                (beat)
                        You do not taste like cinnamon.

           Hank can’t contain a grin. 

                                 SAM
                        You okay?

                                 HANK
                        Depends on the verdict.
                                (has to ask)
                        Who’s Carla’s father, Sam?

                                 SAM
                        This again.  She doesn’t know, she 
                        doesn’t care.  She’s her own 
                        person and I love that about her.  
                        Why is it so important to you?

                                 HANK
                        By my math, she was born about 
                        nine months after I split.  Which 
                        puts me in the running... or you 
                        cheated on me.  Am I on the right 
                        track so far?
                                 SAM
                        Close enough, counselor.

                                 HANK
                        Okay.  This is going to get ugly.  
                        Here it is.  I met Carla at the 
                        Flying Deer.  Tavern.  I was there 
                        with Dale and Glen.  And we, uh --

                                 SAM
                        He’s her father.

                            HANK
                                                          SAM
           He who’s her father?
                                              Glen doesn’t know.  

                                 HANK
                                (stunned)
                        My brother, Glen?

                                 SAM
                        It was the one time!

                                 HANK
                        Glen?

                                 SAM
                        You left!

                                 HANK
                        I went to a Metallica concert!

                                 SAM
                        And never came back!  He was 
                        broken, sweet, almost normal!  I 
                        needed a little normal!

           Hank speechless, angry, relieved.

                                 HANK
                        Normal?  That makes me what--

                                 SAM
                        A more superior prick never shit 
                        between two shoes!  I loved you 
                        then, I love you now.  I love how 
                        you’re simultaneously the most 
                        selfish and generous person I 
                        know.  I love how you hate a bully 
                        while you’re being one.  I love 
                        that you know every word to 
                        Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors and think 
                        you’re a good singer and you’re 
                        not, you’re awful.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        But your constant second guessing 
                        of others, the crystal ball 
                        bullshit, that, that, that hyper-
                        verbal vocabulary vomit thing you 
                        do.  I disappeared around you, 
                        Hank.  

           Silence.  Sam anxious, distance threatens to grow.

                                 HANK
                        Say it again.

                                 SAM
                        All of it?

           Hank’s mobile rings, he suddenly sobers.

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  (LATER)

           The Jurors file in.  The Judge sits motionless between 
           Hank, C.P.  Bailiff hands Judge Sullivan the decision.  

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        Madame Forewoman, have you reached 
                        a decision?

                                 FOREWOMAN
                        We have your honor.

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        In the matter of the state of 
                        Indiana versus Joseph Palmer, on 
                        the charge of murder in the second 
                        degree, how do you find?

                                 FOREWOMAN
                        We find the defendant not guilty. 

           Applause, shouts of encouragement race through the crowd.  
           C.P celebrates, Hank cautious, the Judge expressionless.  

                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        And on the lesser charge of 
                        voluntary manslaughter? 

                                 FOREWOMAN
                        We find the defendant guilty.

           Shouts of outrage, disbelief.  Dale, the Teens look to 
           Glen for answers, Amy cries.  Blackwell’s mom sobs.
                                 JUDGE SULLIVAN
                        And do you have a recommendation 
                        for sentencing?

                                 FOREWOMAN
                        We do your honor; we recommend the 
                        minimum sentence of four years.

           Hank, the Judge sit, stone-faced.  

           INT. COURTHOUSE-SPARE OFFICE - DAY (LATER)

           Hank waits his turn, watches the Judge hug a tearful 
           Glen, Dale.  Dale threatens to come unglued.

                                 DALE
                        Well, what’s gonna happen now?  
                        Are they just gonna take you--

                                 THE JUDGE
                                (grabs him; stern)
                        Listen to me, son.  Listen.  
                        You’re a strong man not a boy.  
                                (whispers)
                        I need you to look after your 
                        brother for me.  Can you do that?     

           Dale nods.  The door opens, Sheriff White steps in.

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Time to go Judge.  

           The Judge squares up, starts for the door.  Hank scoots 
           forward.  He knows this is the last time he’ll see a free 
           Judge, his father will die in prison.     

           The Judge eyes Hank with a swirl of disappointment, 
           betrayal.  Then, nothing.  The Judge just leaves.  Hank 
           frozen, overcome with emotion.

           EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE-STEPS - DAY  

           Kattan steps to a mic.  Flanked by a dozen victims, 
           family members, he calms a throng of REPORTERS, cameras.  

                                 KATTAN
                        Please... We are extremely pleased 
                        with the guilty verdict.  But the 
                        victory doesn’t belong to me, it 
                        belongs to the victims and their 
                        families.  Questions?           
           The Reporters shout, Kattan smiles. 

           INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE-MEN’S BATHROOM - DAY  

           Empty save for a suit at a urinal, back to us.  Urine 
           strikes porcelain, he exhales.  Hums.  Hank. 

           The door creaks open.  Kattan pokes his head in, enters.

                                 HANK
                        You’re learning.

                                 KATTAN
                        Should I expect an appeal?

           Hank finishes, washes up, no emotion. 

                                 HANK
                        Ninety percent of the country 
                        believe in ghosts, less than a 
                        third in evolution.  Forty percent 
                        can’t locate South America on a 
                        map even after you point out North 
                        America for them.  Thirty-five 
                        percent can correctly identify 
                        Homer Simpson and the fictional 
                        town in which he resides but less 
                        than one percent knows the name 
                        Thurgood Marshall.
                                (heads for the sink)
                        But, when you put twelve Americans 
                        together on a jury and ask for 
                        justice... something just South of 
                        brilliance happens.  They almost 
                        always get it right.  

                                 KATTAN
                        Six weeks we prepped Stipe’s 
                        mistress for the Palmer cross.  
                        She reeked of Chanel and flop 
                        sweat and you went easy on her.  
                        Might cost you your job. 

                                 HANK
                        Well, when you’re on a streak... 
                        you stick with it.

           EXT. HANK’S HOUSE - DAY   

           Beautiful blue blooms of well-hydrated hydrangeas.
           EXT. HANK’S GARAGE - DAY 

           The overhead door rises.  Hank’s over-stuffed boxes gone.

           INT. HANK’S HOME-LAUREN’S ROOM - DAY  

           Hank lies on the floor, ratchets a nut tight on a new 
           race car bed.  

                                 LISA (O.S.)
                        Hank?

           Lisa enters, takes in the unexpected scene, the bed.

                                 LISA
                        What are you doing?

                                 HANK
                        When you’re in Indy for the 500?  
                        Avoid the infield.  Trust me.

           He stops working, the answer inadequate.  Sits up.  

                                 HANK
                        You are a wonderful mother.  It’s 
                        best -- for Lauren anyway -- if 
                        she’s with you.  

           She sits on the bed, relieved, overcome.  He joins her.

                                 HANK
                        I can’t not share some of the 
                        blame for what happened to us.  
                                (beat; hard)
                        In a sixty-forty, seventy-thirty 
                        double-negative kind of way.  

                                 LISA
                                (laughs; wipes tears)
                        Can’t we just start over?  Forget 
                        it happened?  

                                 HANK
                        Increasingly freaky make-up sex 
                        for a month?  Hmm.  
                                (smiles softly)
                        A better man would say yes.  I’m 
                        not that man.  I’d remember and 
                        take it out on you.  I know me.  

           He kisses her, long, bittersweet.  And it’s over.  His 
           mobile rings, he checks I.D., fear rising.
                                 HANK
                                (into phone)
                        Hank Palmer, what’s wrong?

           EXT. INDIANA STATE PRISON - DAY (AUTUMN)

           Trees hold fall colors.  Guard towers, concertina wire. 

           INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON-SECURITY POST - DAY  

           Keys, money clip, phone in a plastic basket.  Hank is 
           wanded by a PRISON GUARD.   

                                 PRISON ADMIN (PRE-LAP V.O)
                        Sign here, here and here to take 
                        possession.

           INT. INDIANA STATE PRISON-RECEIVING ROOM - DAY  

           Hank signs the clipboard forms on his lap.  A PRISON 
           ADMIN next to him, points to the signature lines.  

           He stares at a signature: Dwight Dickham.  The words: 
           Petition for Compassionate Release.  An inner door opens, 
           an ORDERLY assists a frail Judge.

           Father and son make eye contact.  Something’s different.

           EXT. COUNTRY LAKE - DAY  (AUTUMN)

           Two bobbers on the lake.  Hank and the Judge perch in 
           lawn chairs, fish.  A cooler between them.

                                 HANK
                        You warm enough?
                                (the Judge nods)
                        Too warm?

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Knock it off.

                                 HANK
                        Glen and Dale stopped for bait.

           Hank pulls two Bit ‘O Honey bars from a pocket.  The 
           Judge’s eyes light up as he takes his, unwraps it.    

                                 HANK
                        Remember bringing these home?  
                                 THE JUDGE
                        You little gremlins inhaled ‘em.

                                 HANK
                        Till Dale jerked a filling out; 
                        ruined it for everybody.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Your mother cursed me out for it.  
                        Fuckin’ Dale.

           Both laugh.  The Judge rolls into a cough, controls it.  

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Remember what you’d say when you 
                        thought I had one on me?

                            HANK
                                                       THE JUDGE
           Where’s my Bit ‘O Honey, 
           old man? 
                                              Where’s my Bit ‘O Honey, 
                                              old man?

           Hank touched, surprised.  They chew in silence.

                                 THE JUDGE
                        You are.

                                 HANK
                        What?

                                 THE JUDGE 
                        The question you asked me.  
                        Before.  You picked the fella you 
                        work for.  I choose you.  

           Hank speechless, the biggest compliment of his life.  He 
           fumbles for his Blackberry, keys an app.

                                 HANK
                        I brought something. 

           From the phone the unmistakable voice of the late Paul 
           Harvey.  The Judge smiles, listens, reminisces. 

                                 THE JUDGE
                        Y’know... Glen could have really 
                        been something.   

                                 HANK
                                (acceptance)
                        No doubt about it.
           Harvey talks, Hank stands, walks both poles to the lake’s 
           edge, casts twice.  He turns and his face empties.  The 
           Judge slumps, eyes half open, candy bar on the ground.   

           Hank sits next to his father, listens to Harvey’s 
           signature wrap.  Over.  A breeze through dry leaves.

                                 HANK
                        It was my idea.  I told Glen 
                        better me than him, I was used to 
                        your disappointment.  I just 
                        didn’t think it’d last so long.  
                                (difficult)
                        Glen was driving that night, dad, 
                        not me.  He rolled the car.  

           He composes himself, picks up his Blackberry, dials. 

                                 HANK
                                (into phone)
                        Glen, hey, scratch the bait.  The 
                        good news is we’re done fishing...    

           INT. HANK’S RENTED MONTE CARLO (MOVING) - DAY  

           Sunglasses on, Hank drives, Lauren shotgun.  Funeral 
           procession; following a hearse through Carlinville.  

                                 LAUREN
                        I’m sad.  Are you sad?

                                 HANK
                        We’ll be all right, sweetheart.  
                        I’m just glad your grandfather got 
                        to know you.

           She turns in her seat, waves at the car behind them. 

                                 LAUREN
                        Uncle Glen’s right behind us.
                                (amazed)
                        Daddy, look at all the cars.
                                (turns back; points)
                        Why are they pulling over?

           Oncoming cars, trucks pull to the side, stop.  Hank 
           struggles to speak, moved by the dated show of respect.

                                 HANK
                        It’s what you do in a small town. 
           EXT. CARLINVILLE - DAY  

           Headlights on, vehicles snake as far as the eye can see. 

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - DAY  

           Packed.  Noisy.  Row after row of crowded tables, people 
           eating, telling stories.        

           Hank leans against a wall.  His POV: Lauren howls, chases 
           her cousins... Glen, Amy, Dale, C.P. eat comfort food.   

           Sam sidles up, leans, joins him in people-watching.

                                 SAM
                        Sorry about the Judge.

           He nods.  She slides closer.  He ignores her, the slide.

                                 HANK
                        Glen, huh?

                                 SAM
                        Not my proudest moment.  No.  

                                 HANK
                        And?  How was he?

                                 SAM
                        Really?  Absolutely no comparison.
                                (beat)
                        He was much better than you.
                                (both laugh)
                        Are we going to get over this?

                                 HANK
                        We?  There a “we” now?

                                 SAM
                        Really?  Not a smidge of a “we” in 
                        there somewhere?
                                (Hank smiles)
                        I’m closing the diner early 
                        tonight.  Should you show up 
                        around nine-ish, I might save a 
                        slice of pie for you. 

                                 HANK
                        Still love me, huh?  How sad is
                        that?
           She straightens, their eyes hold, tender.  She darts an 
           index finger into his mouth, sideswipes.  POP!  

           She turns, saunters past an approaching Sheriff White.

                                 SHERIFF WHITE
                        Got us a real shit omelette over 
                        to the courthouse.  Mistrials.  
                        Motions, legal briefs.  Christ.  
                                (huffs)
                        Not a judge in five hundred miles 
                        would consider walking into this.  
                        I’m wondering if we might not 
                        benefit from another Palmer in 
                        that chair? 

           Hank laughs, ludicrous.  He pushes off the wall, gives 
           the Sheriff a shoulder slap, walks.

           EXT. CARLINVILLE STREET - DAY  

           Hank strolls, streets less busy than usual.  Memories.  A 
           passing car double-beeps at him.  He waves.

                                 DRIVER (O.S.)
                        Palmer, you asshole!

           Hank smiles, doesn’t slow.  

           INT. COURTROOM - DAY  

           Quiet.  Empty.  Hank moves through the gallery, runs a 
           hand along hundred year old woodwork.  He steps up to the 
           bench, looks over the same grand space his father 
           commanded for over forty years.  

           He gently spins the large worn leather chair.  It turns 
           in a slow circle, stops, seat facing him.  

                                                                FADE OUT:
