                                                             OVER BLACK:

           The sound of a dog BARKING WILDLY. It’s distant at first, 
           but then the sound grows louder, and louder...

           Until we reveal...

           EXT. PLANTATION GROUNDS - DAY

           A massive WHITE PLANTATION HOUSE imposes itself, 
           intimidating the yellow grass that spreads out for acres. 

           And then we pinpoint the source of the barking: a BLACK 
           DOG sits in the middle of the grass, a mere dot in the 
           frame.

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           In front of the Plantation, an empty ROAD stretches out 
           as far as the eye can see, stately trees creeping down on 
           either side. 

           A BLACK WOMAN appears, hauling bags of feed. 

           She spots our dog, and she stops. 

           EXT. PLANTATION GROUNDS - SAME

           The dog BARKS at her. This gives her pause, until...

           She begins to BARK right back at it. 

           There’s some distance between these two, but here they 
           are, barking. It’s loud and strange and just this side of 
           surreal. Until --

           The dog gives in. The woman wins. 

           SILENCE.

           She lays down her bags of feed and slowly approaches the 
           dog, her hand outstretched. 

           The dogs sits, panting. 

                                 BLACK WOMAN
                        You a good boy or a bad one? 

           She reaches out...

           Closer...
           Closer...

           SNAP! The dog’s jaws clamp down, the woman jumps back, 
           the dog’s teeth only narrowly missing the tips of her 
           worn fingers.

           And again the dog BARKS.

                                 BLACK WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Go on n’ get -- don’t need your kind 
                        ‘round here. 

           And then there’s a SCREAM from the house.

           SUDDENLY -- 

           A WHITE WOMAN comes running through the front door like a 
           banshee. Her FINE CLOTHES are undone, cascading around 
           her body. 

           The dog takes off after her. There’s a commotion, the 
           black woman goes to follow, the dog gives chase -- 

           A MAN, maybe he’s a young man, emerges from the front 
           door, in the uniform of a UNION SOLDIER. From here on out 
           we’ll call him SOLDIER #1. He casually takes his gun, 
           aims at the running woman...

           But the white woman doesn’t see the black woman or the 
           dog or the ground or the sky. She flies away from the 
           house like nothing exists but whatever this man is she’s 
           running from... 

           The black woman stops --

           The dog runs --

           And then --

           BANG! 

           The white woman falls to the ground, inches away from the 
           black woman. She looks up, briefly, and then --

           SHE IS DEAD. 

           The black woman stares down at the body. 

           A SECOND UNION SOLDIER -- he’ll be SOLDIER #2, probably a 
           bit older -- emerges from the front door of the house. 
           His pants are undone, and he tucks his shirt in as he 
           joins his partner on the porch. 
           The black woman kneels down and holds the white woman’s 
           body in her arms. 

           Soldier #2, now fully dressed, picks up a GAS LAMP that 
           sits on the porch and with a MATCH from his pocket, he 
           lights it. He considers it for a moment, and then...

           He throws it HARD through the open door of the large 
           house. The front hall CATCHES FIRE. 

           The two men move down from the porch as the FIRE grows 
           behind them. 

           The closer they get to the black woman, the tighter she 
           holds the fallen body. And then as they move past her, as 
           if it’s an after thought, Soldier #1 puts a BULLET in the 
           back of her head.

           She falls down, dead.

           The FIRE moves fast now, it is beginning to devour the 
           house. Soon there will be nothing but dead bodies and 
           ash. 

           The dog trots over to the women, smells them.

           SOLDIER #2 turns and looks at the dog. He lets out a 
           long, low WHISTLE.

           The dog looks up. Trails after them as they walk away, 
           headed SOUTH. 

                                                          FADE TO WHITE.

           TITLE IN BLACK OVER WHITE:

                             THE KEEPING ROOM

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - AFTERNOON 

           White. Dry. Yellow. Hot. 

           Images of the landscape come in and out:

           -- A rabbit sitting in mossy grass.  

           -- Some old TREES.

           -- A PEN with a single GOAT.

           -- A FARMHOUSE, small but proud and in the middle of 
           everything, surrounded by all of its OUT BUILDINGS. 
           -- The KEEPING ROOM, a cabin-sized stand alone structure, 
           connected to the house by a LONG WALKWAY. 

           -- The BARN. 

           And then, people:

           LOUISE and MAD. 

           Louise is 16 and white. Mad is 30 and black. Both work 
           the field. Their clothes, worn and dirty. 

           It’s quiet, save for the noises of their hoes in the 
           earth. 

           Until...

           A GUNSHOT. 

           The two women start. Everything stands stock still.

           After a moment: A SQUEAL OF JOY in the distance. 

           Mad rolls her eyes. Louise smiles.

           EXT. KEEPING ROOM - DUSK

           A young woman sits on a log, a DEAD RABBIT spread across 
           her lap with a small RIFLE next to her.  

           This is AUGUSTA, early 20’s and white. 

           Slowly, the camera creeps towards her. The only noise is 
           the sound of her skinning the rabbit and her heavy, 
           excited breathing.  

           She is deliberate; she knows how to do this.

           There is an inherent violence to the act itself, pulling 
           the skin off an animal. She wipes her hair off of her 
           face leaving a line of blood where the hair once was. 

           The camera continues to push in until the dead, bloody 
           rabbit fills the screen. 

           And then --

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - EVENING

           CLOSE ON: a stewed RABBIT as it is set down on a table.
           The Keeping Room is self-contained. A little house unto 
           itself: easy to heat, easy to cool. The small room is 
           overwhelmed by a large FARM TABLE in the middle. Cabinets 
           filled with all sorts of goods line the walls. 

           At one end of the table is the fire. Pots bubble and spew 
           inside it. The family’s history hangs above the fire in 
           the form of tintypes, poppets, dried flowers, an OLD HAT, 
           and several more pots and pans. 

           It is lit up not only by the fire, but also by small gas 
           lamps that line the windows.

           The three women barely use the big house now. This room 
           is their home. If it were big enough, they’d probably 
           sleep here.

           Louise is sitting. Mad joins her. 

           Augusta sits at the head of the table. 

                                 LOUISE
                        It’s small. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It’s food.

                                 LOUISE
                        Smells good. 

                                 MAD
                        Tastes good too. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Things are fun to kill taste good. 

                                 MAD
                        Things are cooked good taste good. 

           A beat.

                                 LOUISE
                        Don’t know why you let her talk to you 
                        that way. 

                                 MAD
                        Your sister? 

                                 LOUISE
                        No. You.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Come on now -- 
           Louise looks down. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t imagine how fun it was to kill. 

                                 MAD
                        If your daddy heard you -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        He taught me. 

                                 MAD
                        For livin’, not for fun. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But, Mad -- it is fun. And hard. They’re 
                        so small. And you gotta be real quiet. I 
                        was trackin’ that creature for near an 
                        hour ‘fore I shot him. Papa said only 
                        shoot once, when you’re sure. ‘Cause once 
                        that gun goes off, everything livin’ is 
                        gone for miles. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Can we start?  

                                 MAD
                        We all goin’ to start.  

           And with that, the three women dig in. Legs rip off the 
           small, dead creature.

           Teeth TEAR into meat. It’s messy. 

                                 LOUISE
                                 (sauce on her face, food in 
                                 her mouth)
                        Tastes good. Real good. 

                        AUGUSTA
                                                         MAD
           You welcome. 
                                             Welcome.

           They look at each other.

           EXT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           From outside, we see the three gas lamps that light the 
           windows. And one by one, they go out. 

           The three women emerge through the door. Augusta, RIFLE 
           in one hand, holds a lit chamber candle in the other, 
           leading the way as the women take the walkway to the back 
           door of the Farmhouse. 
           Augusta opens the door and they go in. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           On a small table by the door are two candlesticks. 

           Mad picks them both up and hands one to Louise. They 
           light their candles off of Augusta’s candle. 

           The women disperse, candles in hand. 

           INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT

           Louise lights a small gas lamp in one of the windows. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Augusta lights a small gas lamp. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Mad lights a small gas lamp at the foot of the stairs and 
           goes up. 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A small gas lamp burns on the windowsill. Mad washes her 
           face by the light. 

           Louise gets into bed, and blows out her candle.

           Augusta enters and puts down her candle. She starts to 
           undress. Mad gets into bed and places her candle on a 
           small tin candle-holder next to the bed. 

           Augusta places her rifle by the side of the bed, blows 
           out her candle and gets into bed. 

           Mad rolls over and blows out her candle. 

           INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Augusta is the first to rise. She rubs the sleep from her 
           eyes and splashes some water on her face from a nearby 
           basin.  

           She dresses, grabs her RIFLE, and quietly slips from the 
           room.
           INT. STAIRCASE - SAME 

           Augusta puts out the gas lamp at the foot of the stairs. 

           INT. FRONT HALL - SAME

           Augusta puts out another the gas lamp. 

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Augusta puts out the last gas lamp. 

           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER

           Louise feeds and plays with the lone goat. She runs 
           around the field, he chases her.

           She laughs. 

           EXT. HORSE PEN - SAME

           Mad feeds the old horse, FERN. She pets her nose, wipes 
           some sweat from her own brow.

           EXT. WOODS - SAME

           Augusta stalks a young deer. The young deer stands alone. 

           Augusta moves. A TWIG SNAPS. 

           The deer looks in her direction -- for a moment Augusta 
           and the animal are looking right at each other. Augusta 
           moves to aim her rifle...

           And the deer runs away. 

           The sounds of RUSHING WATER overtake us and...

           EXT. CREEK - LATER

           Augusta kneels down by a creek. She dips her hand in and 
           shovels out a mouth full of water. She dips her hand in 
           again and splashes the water onto her face. 

           She looks up at the sky. 
           EXT. ANOTHER FIELD - DAY

           A make-shift cross sticks out from a mound of dirt: this 
           is a GRAVE. 

           Louise kneels down and drops some wildflowers in front of 
           the cross. She sits, cross-legged, elbow on knee, face in 
           hand, just looking at the dirt. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DUSK 

           The land sits STILL as the sun sets. 

           INT. BARN - DUSK 

           Mad and Augusta clean up below from the day’s work. 

           Louise plays in the hayloft. 

                                 MAD
                        You fixin’ to hurt yourself up there, 
                        Louise?

                                 LOUISE
                        I’m fine. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Mad’s right -- you watch them boards. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I know where the loose ones are. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        If you fall, I ain’t helpin’ you. 

                                 MAD
                        Me either. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Why don’t you just fix em? 

                                 MAD
                        Why bother wastin’ the work, ain’t no one 
                        goes up there but you. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Come on down here and help us already -- 
                        we gotta get to the Keepin’ Room, start 
                        supper. 

           Louise jumps from one board to another -- it SHAKES. She 
           teeters. Mad and Augusta look up -- a moment of fear. 
           Louise steadies herself and smiles. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Empty plates on the table. Mad holds a UKULELE and sings. 
           Louise and Augusta sing along. Augusta BANGS on the table 
           to the rhythm. Louise DANCES. 

           Augusta gets up and joins her sister. Arms linked, they 
           move about the room as one. 

           The song ends and Louise claps, child-like. 

           Augusta falls into her chair. 

           Mad starts to play another song, but this one is quiet 
           and very sad. 

                                 LOUISE
                        But we don’t know this -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Shhhh --  

                                 LOUISE
                        I want her to play -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Mad’s singin’ what she wants to sing. 

           Louise slowly concedes, sitting and listening, arms 
           crossed.  It’s a work song. It’s about God and all his 
           ghosts. Mad knows it well. 

           The song ends. It’s followed by a long silence that 
           somehow feels like it’s part of the song. 

           And then --

           There is a NOISE outside. They all start, but remain 
           quiet. Finally, Augusta is the one to stand. She walks to 
           the window and cautiously looks out. 

           DARKNESS.

           She moves to the door and opens it. It CREAKS, and she 
           looks back at Louise and Mad. They stay still as Augusta 
           moves through it. 

           Mad and Louise don’t take their eyes off the door.  

           It’s so damn quiet.
           UNTIL --

           Augusta POPS UP outside a window right next to Mad and 
           Louise. 

           Mad and Louise JUMP. 

           From outside, Augusta laughs. Mad just shakes her head. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Mad and Louise light their candles off of Augusta’s. 

           INT. FRONT HALL - SAME

           Louise puts on the gas lamp. 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Augusta gets into bed. 

           Mad blows out the last candle. 

           EXT. ROAD - DAWN

           An empty road at SUNRISE. 

           The SOUND of a horse, moving fast. 

           Then, HORSE and RIDER are seen in the distance. They 
           approach steadily as the light slowly fills in the 
           darkness around them. 

           Once they are close enough we can see that the rider is a 
           BLACK MAN in a UNION UNIFORM. He rides fast and true -- 
           he knows where he’s going. 

           BLACK RIDER and HORSE fill the frame and the pounding of 
           HOOFS become overwhelming --

           Until... 

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Louise WAKES in a sweat. She GASPS. She wakes Augusta. 

           They WHISPER, so as not to wake Mad. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        What is it? 

                                 LOUISE
                        I was havin’ a fright. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It’s alright. Only a dream. 

                                 LOUISE
                        When was the last time you went to town? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I keep losin’ track of the days -- a 
                        while, I reckon. 

                                 LOUISE
                        You should go back. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        And how you suppose I do that? 

                                 LOUISE
                        You think Fern can’t make it no more, but 
                        she can. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We done talkin’ bout this.

                                 LOUISE
                        Why you get to decide everythin’? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You know well as well why. Now back to 
                        sleep. 

           Beat. Louise lies down. 

           Augusta does too. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Can’t close my eyes. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Try. 

           Beat. Louise sits back up. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Ain’t it kill you knowin’ they might come 
                        back? Caleb said, men was comin back. 
                        What if he got word? 

           Augusta sits back up.  
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Our men ain’t desertin’ no duty. 

                                 LOUISE
                        But they was right there. In my dream. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Then go back there and no more talkin’ on 
                        it. 

           Augusta lies back down. Louise just sits there. 

           INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

           Augusta rubs her eyes as she walks out of the bedroom and 
           into the morning. She hears a NOISE and pauses. 

           She turns towards the far BEDROOM, the one they don’t 
           sleep in. She moves towards it, cautiously. 

           Through a crack, she sees a WOMAN looking at herself in a 
           mirror. She wears a fine DRESS. Her hair is so long and 
           so blonde.   

           Augusta slowly opens the door, in a trance, she’s moving 
           through a dream... 

           She thinks for a moment it could be...

           It’s LOUISE. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What? 

           Beat. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        It’s you -- 

           Louise turns towards her. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Who you think it was? 

           Augusta shakes her head back into the real moment. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        My mind wanders. 
                                 LOUISE
                        I look like her. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Thought you was a ghost. 

           BEAT. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Take it off. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We don’t need be messin’ with fine 
                        things.  

                                 LOUISE
                        Feels nice to wear a fine thing. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I best not see that dress movin’ again. 

           Augsuta leaves the room. Louise looks at herself in the 
           mirror again. She likes it. She turns and looks at 
           herself over her shoulder. 

           EXT. FIELDS - LATER

           The three women work the land together. 

           Louise still wears their MOTHER’S DRESS even though 
           Augusta has told her to take it off. 

           Mad looks at her funny and then goes back to her work. 

           Augusta looks at Mad and then at Louise.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Thought I told you to take it off. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Didn’t feel like it. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Even more ridiculous out here then it was 
                        in there. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Why you care so much? 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        You goin’ to ruin it. 

           After a moment, Louise THROWS DOWN her hoe. 

                                 MAD
                        What’s wrong with you? 

                                 LOUISE
                        I don’t want to do this no more. 

                                 MAD
                        Too bad. 

                                 LOUISE
                        She shouldn’t be talkin’ to me that way. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Louise -- 

                                 LOUISE
                        She’s the nigger, she should do it. 

           Mad just keeps working: it’s nothing new. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Like I told you, Louise -- we all niggers 
                        now. 

           Augusta resumes her work with Mad.

           Louise hesitates, and then makes a decision. She walks 
           away, her back to them. 

           Mad looks up at Augusta. Augusta doesn’t return the gaze. 

           They keep hoeing.

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER

           Louise sits alone, playing a game on the floor of the 
           room, something involving a ball and some stones. 

           She’s still wearing her mother’s dress, but she’s 
           unbuttoned the back so it falls around her shoulders. She 
           thought about taking it off, but didn’t make it that far. 

           She’s more concerned with the game now. 

           We sit with her here for a moment.  

           And then the sounds of LAUGHTER lead us to...
           INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Another night, another dinner’s mess fills the table. 

           Mad, Louise and Augusta are laughing their heads off. 
           They are in the middle of playing some kind of game. 

           Louise is seated at the table, blindfolded, she’s back in 
           her NORMAL CLOTHES now. Mad hands Louise an ONION. Louise 
           moves it around in her hands and then holds it up to her 
           face and smells it. 

                                 LOUISE
                        An onion! 

           She gleefully tears off the blindfold and puts it on Mad. 

           Louise and Augusta look around the room for something, 
           gesturing so as not to give themselves away. They dart 
           around rejecting each other’s choices in as much silence 
           as they can. 

           Augusta has an IDEA and she pulls off her BLOOMERS. 

           Louise stifles a giant laugh and hands the bloomers to 
           Mad. Mad inspects them, moves them through her hands. 

           Realizing what they are, she drops them. 

                                 MAD
                        Didn’t your mother teach you to keep ya 
                        drawers on? 

           Mad takes off the blindfold and shakes her head. 

           Louise and Augusta LAUGH. 

           Augusta puts on her bloomers. 

           Louise wraps the blindfold around Augusta’s face. 

           Mad and Louise move around the room, looking. Louise 
           pulls the MAN’S HAT down from above the fire. 

           Augusta holds it in her hands. She feels it, slowly. She 
           suddenly stops smiling and gets real QUIET. 

           She takes off the blindfold and puts the hat back above 
           the fire.  

                                 LOUISE
                        What? 
                                 MAD
                        What’s wrong? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I don’t want to play no more. 

           EXT. KEEPING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           CRACK!

           An axe and a log descend into frame, the axe held by 
           Augusta. The piece of wood SPLINTERS in two.

           Augusta resets with a new piece of wood and her axe -- 
           this is ritualistic, for her. She knocks the axe gently 
           into the piece of wood, the axe catching in it. Then she 
           raises her arms, wood and axe as one, and...

           CRACK!

           She SLAMS everything down onto the hard ground, splitting 
           the log into two perfect pieces. 

           She does this for a while, until there is a small PILE of 
           wood beside her. 

           AND THEN --

           A SCREAM not too far off. 

           Augusta drops the axe and runs around to the other side 
           of the building, where she and Mad COLLIDE. 

                                 MAD
                        It’s a mad raccoon. Louise -- 

           Augusta runs into the Keeping Room. She emerges with her 
           RIFLE and runs past Mad. 

           Mad backs into the exterior of the Keeping Room and 
           watches. 

           GUNSHOT. Mad winces. 

           Augusta comes back. Furious. 

           A beat. 

           Then, she SLAPS Mad. Mad shows no sign of pain. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I missed. 
           Augusta leaves Mad there and goes back into the Keeping 
           Room. Mad just stands there.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

           Louise writhes and sweats in the bed. 

           Mad and Augusta whisper in the corner. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We haven’t got anythin’?

                                 MAD
                        Nothin’. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You search the whole Keepin’ Room? 

                                 MAD
                        ‘Course.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Fern won’t survive the ride. We known 
                        that for months. 

                                 MAD
                        It don’t matter. Maybe they got somethin’ 
                        at the Weaver farm could help. Closer 
                        than goin’ all the way to town. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We ain’t heard from them since -- since I 
                        don’t know when. 

                                 MAD
                        It’s worth a try.  

           Louise MOANS. 

           Mad goes to her. She wrings out a cloth and places it 
           back on the girl’s forehead. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                                 (to Augusta)
                        Go. 

           The sound of horse hoofs pounding earth, gradually 
           getting louder, takes us to --

           EXT. ROAD - DUSK

           Augusta riding as fast as Fern’s old body will let her. 
           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Augusta approaches THE WEAVER FARM. It’s dark and quiet. 
           No lamps or candles here.

           EXT. WEAVER FARM - DUSK

           Augusta dismounts Fern, ties her to the fence post and 
           approaches the FARMHOUSE. 

           EXT. WEAVER FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Augusta moves to the door and knocks. It creaks open 
           under the weight of her fist. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Hello? 

           Beat.

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Mary? Clara? 

           Augusta goes inside. 

           INT. WEAVER FARMHOUSE - DUSK

           Augusta moves through the first room of the house. 

           It doesn’t look lived in. Just the opposite: this place 
           has been abandoned. No noise. Just dark and quiet. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

           CREAK. 

           Augusta goes upstairs. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS - SAME

           Augusta moves through the hallway. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Mary? Clara?

           She goes into one of the bedrooms. 
           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           She rummages through the cabinets, looking for something, 
           anything to help Louise. Problem is, she doesn’t know 
           what she’s looking for. 

           All she finds are a tintype of a baby, some sewing tools 
           and some unidentifiable dried HERB. 

           She smells the herb and sticks it in the belt of her 
           skirt, just in case. 

           She looks up and she catches a glimpse of something in a 
           mirror --

           It’s just her own reflection. She steadies herself.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Augusta moves into the final bedroom at the end of the 
           hall. She pushes the door open. 

           There is a WOMAN’S BODY lying in the bed in the corner. 

           Augusta goes to her. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        ...Mary?

           MARY lies motionless in the bed. Her eyes WIDE OPEN. 

           THE WOMAN IS DEAD. 

           Augusta SHAKES her as if she’s trying to wake her from a 
           deep sleep.

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Mary. 

           A line of blood is dried from her mouth, down her face to 
           the bed. Augusta follows the line and her eyes keep going 
           down to the floor where a bottle lies, broken. Some kind 
           of POISON. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        How long you been lyin’ this way? 

           Augusta picks up the bottle and places it on the table 
           next to the bed. 

           She rolls Mary so she is flat on her back. At first, 
           she’s not sure what to do. 
           THEN --

           She lays her arms at her sides. She closes her eyelids. 

           She steps back and looks at her work. 

           EXT. WEAVER FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Augusta walks quickly out of the house. Once outside, She 
           stops and stands for a moment, trying to catch her 
           breath.

           Is the whole world this way now? 

           EXT. ROAD - LATER

           Augusta rides. 

           EXT. ROAD - LATER 

           The first lights of town.

           Fern is tired. Augusta, too. 

           EXT. TOWN - LATER 

           It’s virtually a GHOST TOWN. Augusta had no idea.

           The only establishment open is the SALOON, which is also, 
           of course, a whorehouse. 

           As she approaches, a dog, THE DOG, is tied to the post 
           out front. He BARKS wildly just as before. 

           Augusta dismounts and ties Fern to the post. Once she is 
           off the horse, the dog quiets. 

           Augusta stands still and regards the dog.  It’s a comfort 
           after what she’s just seen. 

           Augusta moves to pet the dog and...

           SNAP!

           The dog lunges at her. She backs up -- cautious, now -- 
           and makes her way inside. 
           INT. SALOON - NIGHT 

           The RED ROOM is sparsely populated. The whores aren’t 
           what they used to be. Red velvet ROTS everywhere. 

           The few patrons that were too old or too crippled to 
           fight watch her as she moves towards a bar at the far end 
           of the room. 

           And then she sees something odd: two UNION SOLDIERS at a 
           table by the fire. She does not to look at them. Of 
           course, we know who they are: Soldier #1 and Soldier #2. 

           She makes it to the BAR. 

           CALEB, the old bartender, turns and sees her. 

                                 CALEB
                        Augusta? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Caleb.  

                                 CALEB
                                 (re: the soldiers)
                        You shouldn’t be here. 

           He glances up at them. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I know. 

                                 CALEB
                        Why then? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It’s Louise. Mad raccoon bit ‘er. 

                                 CALEB
                        I can’t help.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Doesn’t someone have some medcin’? 

                                 CALEB
                        Not round here. Not in a long time.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What should I do? 

                                 CALEB
                        You been ridin’ all night? 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yessir. 

                                 CALEB
                        On Fern? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yessir. 

                                 CALEB
                        She dead yet? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Just about. 

           Caleb grabs a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY and pours her a shot.  

                                 CALEB 
                        Drink this. 

           He slams it down in front of Augusta. She inspects the 
           glass. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You sure? 

                                 CALEB
                        Positive. 

           Augusta swallows it whole. Sputters. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Good girl. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You hear from anyone out at the Weaver 
                        place? Seen Clara?  

                                 CALEB
                        Mary was the last one I saw. Few months 
                        back. She was lookin’ for Clara. She run 
                        off. Probably went north, I said. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I just been there. Mary’s dead. 

                                 CALEB 
                        What now? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Drank herself some poison. Just lyin’ up 
                        there. 
                                 CALEB
                        God forgive her. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I closed her eyes for her. 

                                 CALEB
                        First time you see a dead body? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I seen my mother when she go.

                                 CALEB
                        You alright then? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I’m alright. 

           Beat. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Went there hopin’ for some medcin’. Found 
                        this. 

           Augusta pulls the dried HERB from her belt. 

                                 CALEB
                        Ain’t nothin’ dried sage’ll do to help 
                        Louise. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Anyone come back since last time I asked? 

                                 CALEB
                        A few injureds. A few deserters. Can’t 
                        tell you who -- too dangerous with them 
                        so close. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But no -- 

                                 CALEB
                        No. 

           Caleb gently shakes his head. 

           Augusta tries to hide how foolish she feels for thinking 
           maybe there would be good news. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        You should go. 
                                 LOUISE
                        But I can’t go back with nothin’. All 
                        that ridin’ and nothin’ for Louise? 

           MOLL, a whore, sits a few stools down. She has overheard 
           their entire conversation. 

           It’s hard to tell if she’s young or old, but if there 
           wasn’t a war on, you can be sure she’d be beautiful.

                                 MOLL 
                        Hi. 

           Augusta just looks at her. 

                                 CALEB
                                 (re: Moll)
                        You can say hi. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        ...Hi. 

                                 MOLL
                        Caleb? 

           Moll doesn’t take her eyes off Augusta. 

                                 CALEB
                        Moll? 

                                 MOLL
                        Can I speak to ya? 

           Caleb gives Augusta a look and then motions for Moll to 
           follow him into the back.

                                 CALEB 
                                 (re: the soldiers)
                        Don’t you look at ‘em.  

           Augusta watches them as they walk back behind the bar. 
           She fiddles with her empty glass, draws circles with her 
           finger on the bar.  

           Behind her, the SOLDIERS look right at her. 

           But Augusta doesn’t look back. 

           Moll and Caleb return. 

                                 MOLL
                        There ain’t no medcin’. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Already knew that. 

           Moll pours two shots. She hands one to Augusta. She 
           clinks her glass to Augusta’s and they shoot them down. 

                                 MOLL
                        You put her in the tub. You boil that 
                        water beyond boilin’. Don’t worry bout 
                        burnin’ her. Got that? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yes ma’am. 

                                 MOLL
                        You close her in that hot room and no 
                        matter how much she screams, you don’t 
                        let her out. Only once she stops 
                        screamin’ you open that door, cause she’s 
                        liable to of passed out. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Alright. 

                                 MOLL
                        You got vinegar? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yes ma’am. 

                                 MOLL
                        After you let her out, you put that 
                        vinegar on that wound as much as she’ll 
                        let you. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’ll work? 

                                 MOLL
                        There’s a chance. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Alright. 

                                 MOLL
                        You ready for her to die? 

           Augusta shakes her head. 

           Moll pours them two more shots. They down them. 

                                 MOLL (CONT’D)
                        She’s young, so it might work. But you 
                        get ready. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Alright. 

                                 MOLL
                        Where you ridin’ to? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Due east. Not far, but far enough. 

                                 MOLL
                        What you ridin’? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        A dead horse.  

           Moll gets up and motions for Caleb to follow. Augusta 
           watches them go. 

           This time, Augusta can’t help herself. She turns to see 
           if the SOLDIERS are still there. 

           And they are staring STRAIGHT AT HER. Soldier #1 SMILES. 

           Augusta quickly turns away. She overhears Caleb and Moll 
           arguing.

           And then, Moll returns. 

                                 MOLL
                        You’re gettin’ Martin. He’s a good ride.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Why you bein’ so nice to me? 

                                 MOLL
                        I knew your Daddy. He was a good man. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        He was alright. 

                                 MOLL
                        You look just like ‘em.

           Moll pours them one last shot. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Everyone says I look like my mother. 

                                 MOLL
                        I never met her. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Hardly knew ‘er myself. 
           They shoot the drinks. 

                                 MOLL
                        You best get goin’. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Thank you. 

                                 MOLL
                        You take care now, alright? 

           Augusta nods. She gets up. The soldiers follow her like a 
           dog following a piece of meat. It is near impossible for 
           her not to look, but she manages to make it outside 
           without giving in. 

           EXT. SALOON - LATER

           Augusta waits outside for Caleb to bring around her new 
           horse. She pets Fern on the nose, whispers to her. 

           The DOG sits. Real quiet. Just staring at her. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You know I know better now.

           He WHIMPERS a little, calling her near.  

           She crouches down, cautious. He’s calmer. They regard 
           each other for a moment as if there was nothing else 
           breathing but this girl and this dog. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        No fun being tied up, I know. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Suppose not.

           It’s SOLDIER #2. Augusta stands up fast. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I only bite as much as he does. 

           Augusta looks away.  

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        And he don’t bite. 

           Pause. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        He tried to bite me not a while ago. 
                                 SOLDIER #2
                        But he didn’t, did he?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        No. I reckon he didn’t. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Battle. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Pardon? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        His name. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Oh. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        We found him on his own a few years back.  
                        Up in Virginia. He’s a good dog. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Can’t tell with him all tied up. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        No? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It’s when they can run you know what they 
                        are. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        You got dogs? 

           Augusta shakes her head.

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        I like dogs more than I like people. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It don’t make no difference to me, 
                        really. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Dogs or people? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s right.  

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        What’s a girl like you doing on your own? 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        I got lots of people. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I don’t see nobody. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I said I got lots of people.

           Caleb comes round with Martin, the new horse. 

                                 CALEB
                        Here’s your horse. 

           Caleb puts the horse between Augusta and the Soldier. The 
           Soldier is now blocked from her view.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        That’s a mighty fine horse for such a 
                        young girl. 

                                 CALEB 
                                 (shooting him a look)
                        You go on now, Augusta.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What about Fern? 

                                 CALEB
                        I’ll take care of Fern. 

           Augusta mounts Martin. 

           Martin starts to move, and Soldier #2 keeps his eyes on 
           her. He bends down and runs his hand along Battle’s head. 
           He and Caleb share another look.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT 

           Augusta rides Martin.

           In the background, we hear a GUNSHOT. 

           And then ANOTHER. 

           Augusta stops the horse. Listens intently.

           ANOTHER.

           And then Augusta kicks Martin, and he’s off -- now 
           there’s just the sound of the night, the girl, and the 
           horse.
           EXT. ROAD - LATER 

           Augusta rides FAST. 

           Suddenly something CATCHES her dress. She GASPS. 

           She turns as her dress RIPS, leaving a patch behind in 
           the fingers of a tree. 

           She turns back, looking ahead, riding FASTER. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER

           Augusta slows as she approaches the lights of the FARM. 

           Mad is waiting outside for her. 

                                 MAD
                        Where you get that horse?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Whore gave it to me. 

                                 MAD
                        I knew your Daddy wasn’t just playin’ 
                        cards. 

           INT. BATHROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Mad and Augusta stand on either side of the bathroom 
           door. STEAM pours through the cracks in the wood and 
           under the door.  

           Louise is SCREAMING.

           This goes on for some time. 

           And then, after a bit, it’s over. It’s quiet. 

           Mad and Augusta look at each other. They wait another 
           beat. And Mad opens the door. 

           Steam is EVERYWHERE. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Louise lies in bed, red-faced and breathing deeply. 

           Mad lies next to her. 
           Augusta sits in a chair next to the bed, looking out the 
           window.

           Augusta goes to Louise and lifts the skirt of her 
           nightgown. The WOUND shines purple and black. She takes a 
           cloth, dabs it with vinegar and applies it to the wound. 

           Louise MOANS, but doesn’t wake. 

           EXT. FIELDS - LATER 

           Two dead CHICKENS lie on the ground. 

           Augusta and Mad look down like GIANTS at the chickens. 

                                 MAD
                        Must be the raccoon. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Means we can’t eat em, right? 

                                 MAD
                        Probably best not to. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - MID-DAY

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What do you mean there’s nothing to eat? 

                                 MAD 
                        You hit anything today?

                                 AUGUSTA 
                        No. Didn’t have no --

                                 MAD
                        We should talk ‘bout that goat again. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        His name’s Pete. 

                                 MAD
                        I know his name. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Then don’t call him ‘that goat.’

                                 MAD
                        Just cause you give him a name don’t mean 
                        we can’t eat him. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        We need the milk. 

                                 MAD
                        We need the meat. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We got turnips and carrots. 

                                 MAD
                        How long you think that goin’ to last? 

           They stand in silence for a moment.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We got anything to drink? 

                                 MAD
                        Yeah. Goat’s milk. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s not what I meant. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME

           CLOSE ON: A JAR OF MOONSHINE as Mad sets it down on the 
           table. She and Augusta both stare at it for a moment. 

                                 MAD
                        Jesus ain’t goin’ be happy bout this. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I think there’s lots of things Jesus 
                        ain’t happy ‘bout right now. 

                                 MAD
                        Lord forgive me. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You never had this before? 

                                 MAD
                        No ma’am. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I’ll show you.

           Augusta gets two glasses. Mad pours. Augusta raises her 
           glass. Mad raises hers. 

           Augusta downs hers. Slams down the glass. 

           Mad downs hers. Slams down the glass. 
                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the worst thing I ever tasted. 

                                 MAD
                        But you --

           Augusta grins. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER

           Mad and Augusta are now DRUNK. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Gets easier more you drink. 

                                 MAD
                        Gets real easier. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I like the way I feel. 

                                 MAD
                        Bill was the only one your Papa let drink 
                        it. He would come back at night just 
                        stinkin’ from it.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You was with him? Bill?

           A beat.

                                 MAD
                        I was. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You wanted to have his babies. 

                                 MAD
                        Oh, lord.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You miss him? 

                                 MAD 
                        I do. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Was he --

           Augusta stops herself. 
                                 MAD
                        Go on -- with this moonshine in me I’m 
                        fixed to answer any question you got. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You real sad? 

                                 MAD
                        We all real sad. 

           Augusta gets a dreamy girl look on her face like she’s 
           fixing to ask something blue. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What’s it like? 

                                 MAD
                        Oh no. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You said you’d -- 

           Mad motions for Augusta to pour her another shot. 

           Augusta pours. Mad drinks. 

                                 MAD
                        What you wanna know? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What’s it like? What’s it feel like? 

                                 MAD
                        You’ll know. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But what if I won’t? 

                                 MAD
                        You’ll know when your husband takes you -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What if all the men kill all the other 
                        men? What if it’s the end of the world 
                        and we the only ones left. 

                                 MAD
                        It’s not the end of the world -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I think about all the women sittin’ in 
                        houses right now were supposed to be 
                        taken, but ain’t. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AUGUSTA (CONT'D)
                        Learned how to shoot a gun fore they 
                        learned how to bed. Learned how to be men 
                        ‘stead of wives.

           Mad hears her. She thinks about it. 

                                 MAD
                        It’s scary. It feels good, but it’s 
                        scary. It hurts! But good hurts. Like 
                        ridin’ a horse. Or shootin’ a gun. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You didn’t ever shoot no gun -- 

                                 MAD
                        Well, what does it feel like? 

           Augsuta thinks. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Feels powerful -- 

                                 MAD
                        Yeah -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        And it hurts -- 

                                 MAD
                        That’s right -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But you like it --  

                                 MAD
                        That’s what I’m talkin’ bout -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        It’s like shootin’ a gun --

                                 MAD
                        Yes ma’am --

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Alright.

           A beat. She SMILES.

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Least I done that! 

           They LAUGH and CLINK glasses and shoot some more 
           moonshine. A silence overtakes the room, but it’s 
           comfortable and soft. Until --
           A NOISE, directly behind them. They turn to see...

           LOUISE. 

           She’s just standing there. Like a GHOST. 

           Augusta and Mad stare at her. 

           Louise tries to speak. She can’t quite do it. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        What is it Louise? 

                                 MAD
                        What you need? 

           Pause. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I’m... hungry. 

                                 MAD
                        Did she say -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        -- hungry? 

           Mad and Augusta break into noises of RAPTURE. Shouting 
           and hollering and dancing around the room. Louise, 
           standing stock still at the center of it all, even 
           manages a smile. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        She’s hungry! 

                                 MAD
                        What did you say?! 

                                 LOUISE
                        I’m hungry. 

                                 MAD
                        Say it again! 

                                 LOUISE
                        I’m hungry! 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER

           Mad is at the stove, cooking FURIOUSLY. 
                                 MAD
                        I’m gonna cook you somethin’ so good, 
                        Louise. Come back from the dead stew, 
                        that’s what. Come-back-from-the-dead 
                        stew!

           Augusta is sitting next to Louise.  She stares at her. 
           Louise just looks ahead. 

           Mad starts to sing a song while she cooks. It’s about -- 
           of course -- come-back-from-the-dead stew. 

           Augusta touches Louise’s hair like something you’re not 
           supposed to touch. Louise looks at Augusta and smiles.

                                 LOUISE
                        You thought I was gone? 

           Augusta can’t say the word -- YES -- she can only nod. 

           Augusta puts her head on the table, Louise puts her head 
           on Augusta’s head. They both watch as Mad cooks and 
           sings.  

           Augusta smiles a contented, drunken smile. 

           EXT. ROAD - DUSK 

           CLOSE ON: The red tongue of a tired of a dog, PANTING.

           It’s Battle.

           And then we widen out to reveal Soldier #1 and Soldier #2 
           as they come walking up behind him. Soldier #2 walks 
           ahead of Soldier #1, who lags behind holding a bottle of 
           WHISKEY and a BLOODY LIP. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Didn’t realize you needed your mouth to 
                        walk proper. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Whore damn near bit my lip off. I feel 
                        dizzy. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Just keep drinking that whiskey. It’ll 
                        stop hurting soon. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Ain’t enough whiskey in this bottle fix 
                        what I got. 
                                 SOLDIER #2
                        No one suffers but you. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        If you’d a been bit we’d still be sitting 
                        back at the whorehouse stead of moving. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Don’t quite know that I’d call what 
                        you’re doing moving. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        You sure we’re going the right way? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Road only goes one way.  

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        How do you know it’s the right road in 
                        the first place? 

                                 SOLDIER#2
                        Battle knows. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Maybe we should stop and look at the map.

                                 SOLDIER#2
                        Maybe you should quit acting like she bit 
                        off your foot.  

           Battle suddenly stops and sits. 

           Soldier #1 and Soldier #2 stop their bickering and take 
           notice of his stillness. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        What is it, boy? 

           Battle whimpers. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        You got something there? 

           Battle YELPS. 

           Soldier #2 looks at Soldier #1, who is now just sitting 
           down in the center of the road. 

           Soldier #2 shakes his head and goes over to where Battle 
           sits, still calling to his master to come look. 

           As Soldier #2 approaches Battle, he looks up and sees 
           what the dog sees: 
           A SWATCH OF FLOWERED FABRIC 

           is caught in the branches of a tree. 

           Soldier #2 grabs the fabric off of the tree, holds it to 
           his nose and, breathing deep, takes in the smell.

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        What’s he got? 

                                 SOLDIER #2 
                        Let’s just say we don’t need no map. 

           INT. BEDROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN 

           Mad and Louise sleep. Augusta groggily wakes, and holds 
           her head: her first HANGOVER. 

           She gets out of bed and splashes water on her face from 
           the basin. And then something MOVES behind her...

           It’s just Louise having a restless sleep. Augusta gazes 
           out the window... 

           Outside is the pre-morning sky, the silhouettes of trees 
           in still dark light, and...

           SMOKE.

           Augusta leans closer to the window. 

           Indeed, it is smoke -- a thin stream of it -- and it is 
           not too far away. And at the base of the smoke, a small 
           FIRE.

           Augusta, eyes locked, grabs her rifle from the bedside. 
           She sits in a rocking chair, rifle in hand, looking out 
           the window. 

           EXT. CREEK - THE NEXT DAY

           A series of images:

           -- Trees rustle and sway. 

           -- The creek moves, hitting rocks and dragging sticks. 

           -- Augusta runs down the hill to the creek with a BUCKET.  

           -- Mad helps Louise slowly down the hill and helps her 
           sit down. Augusta hikes her skirts and stands in the 
           water. 
           -- Mad sits with Louise as Augusta fills the bucket and 
           hauls it to where the others sit. Augusta fills the ladle 
           with the cool drink and Louise sips it down. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATER

           Augusta carries the full buckets of water on her 
           shoulders. Mad supports Louise. 

           Augusta stops. Mad and Louise walk past her. She looks 
           off in the distance, dumbstruck. 

           There’s that SMOKE again. Even closer, now.

           EXT. FIELDS - MORNING 

           Augusta walking quickly. 

                                 MAD (O.S.)
                        Augusta! Augusta! 

           Augusta gets to the GOAT FIELD. Mad is standing over 
           something. 

           THE GOAT IS DEAD. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        We gotta find that raccoon.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Wait -- 

           Augusta bends down and inspects the goat more closely. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Gimme’ that stick. 

           Mad retrieves a nearby stick. Augusta takes the stick and 
           pushes the goat’s head to the side with it and...

           ITS NECK has been SLIT from one side to the other. 

                                 MAD
                        What -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Wasn’t no raccoon did this. 

                                 MAD
                        Probably not them chickens neither. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        No -- the chickens was the raccoon. 

                                 MAD
                        What now? 

           Augusta starts to speak and stops herself. She thinks. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Just say it. 

                                 MAD
                        Say what? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You did this. 

                                 MAD
                        What? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You wanted him dead - you been wantin’ to 
                        eat him and now you blamin’ a raccoon? 

                                 MAD
                        I ain’t kill nothin’ without you. 

           Augusta pushes Mad. Mad grabs her hands. Holds tight.

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        Catch yourself, Augusta. 

           Augusta loosens her grip. Mad drops Augusta’s hands. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        If it wasn’t you, what then? 

                                 MAD
                        This farm is cursed. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MAD
                        White girls get things kept from ‘em. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I don’t like what you’re implyin’ -- 

                                 MAD
                        I seen the ghosts of this house with my 
                        own two eyes. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Ain’t got no ghosts. 

                                 MAD
                        There are monsters in this world you 
                        don’t know ‘bout. 

           Augusta considers this.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We should eat it.

                                 MAD
                        I wouldn’t. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Augusta and Louise furiously eat the GOAT. Mad just sits 
           and watches. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You sure you don’t -- 

                                 MAD
                        Nuh-uh. 

           They go back to it. It’s more than a little disgusting.

           Over this image, the sound of a horse breathing fast 
           takes us to --

           EXT. TOWN - DAY 

           It’s empty, as before.

           The Black Rider and his horse come down the road through 
           town. They reach the Saloon. 

           EXT. SALOON - DAY

           The body of CALEB, the bartender, lying in the street, 
           DEAD. The Black Rider goes to him, rolls him over, knows 
           even before he sees him that he’s dead. He shakes his 
           head. 

           There is a horse lying DEAD not too far off from where 
           Caleb lies. The Black Rider moves to the horse. He comes 
           around the front and sees it’s proud, dead face. 

           The Black Rider bends down. 
                                 BLACK RIDER
                        ...Fern? 

           He looks up, eyes searching.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Augusta shakes Mad AWAKE. 

                                 MAD
                        What -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Shhhhhh. 

                                 MAD
                        Why you wake me up just to be quiet? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Just listen. 

           They listen together. NOTHING.

                                 MAD
                        I’m goin’ back to -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Just wait. Please. 

                                 MAD
                        Probably just some a them ghosts you 
                        white people got in here. 

           They wait. Nothing. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        I’m goin’ back to sleep. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Please just wait. Come have a look with 
                        me.

                                 MAD
                        If I come downstairs with you and we look 
                        around, then we go back to sleep? 

           Augusta nods. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        Alright. 
           INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Augusta, gun in hand. Mad right behind her. They quietly 
           make their way down the stairs. 

           They hear a NOISE. It’s coming from outside. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Augusta and Mad move in the darkness. 

           The sounds of a struggle: 

           RIP! 

           A SNARL as flesh and bone TEAR. 

           Augusta rounds the corner of the house and sees a 
           CREATURE tearing ANOTHER CREATURE apart. It’s dark, but 
           she’s sure as sure that it’s the RACCOON. 

           Augusta AIMS, SHOOTS and HITS. The menace WHIMPERS and  
           COLLAPSES. Augusta runs towards it. 

           The raccoon is dead, but not because she killed it. It’s 
           dead because the dog she just shot had devoured it. 

           THE DEAD DOG IS BATTLE. 

           Augusta backs away in fear. 

           She runs into someone, CRIES OUT --

           It’s MAD. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We gotta get inside. 

                                 MAD
                        Was it the raccoon?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yes -- but somethin’ else too. 

                                 MAD
                        What? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We gotta get inside now, Mad.

           And suddenly in the distance we hear DRUNKEN singing -- 
           men’s voices, melodies in the night. 
                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Battle! PHFT! PHFT! Battle!

           Augusta runs inside the house. Mad follows --

           INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Augusta and Mad run upstairs.

           INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 

           They wake Louise. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Get up. 

                                 LOUISE
                        No. 

                                 MAD
                                 (to Augusta)
                        You tell me what’s goin’ on. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        There’s men comin’. Soldiers. 

                                 MAD
                        And how is that bad? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yankees. 

                                 MAD
                        What make you think that? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I just shot their dog!  

                                 MAD
                        How you know what dog belong to what 
                        Yankees? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I tell you once we’re safe, alright?  

                                 MAD
                        Safe from what? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                                 (almost to herself)
                        I knew it when I saw that goat, and I 
                        didn’t --
                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        You shot my dog! 

           Augusta motions to Mad and Louise to sit still and quiet. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                                 (louder)
                        You shot my dog!

                                 SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                                 (singing)
                        He was just a dog. 
                        Same as you and me.

           Pause. 

                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT’D)
                                 (singing)
                        And you went and shot him. 
                        Couldn’t let him be. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        He is singing but he only sings when he’s 
                        real drunk or real mad and right now, 
                        he’s both!

           A beat. He is waiting for some kind of response. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Young lady we got guns ain’t been used in 
                        days. And they are itching to fire. 

           And then it’s quiet. The women whisper, and fast: 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Where are the other guns? 

                                 MAD
                        What?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        The guns --

                                 MAD
                        I think they in the shed.
                                 (remembering)
                        Oh! And that small one in the box 
                        downstairs --

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We need to get all of ‘em and bring ‘em 
                        back. 
                                 MAD
                        Bring ‘em back where? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Here.

                                 MAD
                        Why you wanna stay here? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Where else we goin’ to go? 

                                 MAD
                        Keepin’ room. Only safe place there is on 
                        this land. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We ain’t leavin’ this house. 

                                 MAD
                        Too many doors and windows and rooms --

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We ain’t leavin’ -- 

                                 MAD
                        And why not? If they is soldiers like you 
                        say -- what can we do? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We goin’ to fight. 

                                 MAD
                        We goin’ to fight the Union army? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        S’only two men. 

                                 MAD
                        How you know that? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I suppose I don’t -- 

                                 MAD
                        Louise, come with me --  

                                 AUGUSTA
                                 (angry, now)
                        You ain’t takin her. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I don’t want to fight nobody, Augusta -- 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        And what happens once they find you down 
                        there? What happens when you’re in the 
                        Keepin’ Room and they come through and 
                        you just sittin’ there --

                                 MAD
                        They don’t know nobody’s here. That’s why 
                        we gotta hide and the Keepin’ Room, it’s 
                        safe and small. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        They know we’re here. I shot their dog. 
                                 (a beat, and then she tells 
                                 them)
                        They followed me. 

                                 MAD
                        What -- 

           Suddenly, a SOUND from downstairs -- 

           A WINDOW BREAKS. 

           Louise goes to SCREAM. Mad covers her mouth. 

           Once they are still, Augusta moves to the door. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You lock this behind me. And don’t you 
                        dare go to no Keepin’ Room. 

           She goes out. Louise tries to stop her. Mad pulls her 
           down. 

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Augusta creeps through the house. We hear the Soldiers 
           drunkenly singing just outside the wall of the house as 
           she moves from one room to another.

                                 SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                                 (singing)
                        His dog is gone. 
                        He can’t go on. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (O.S.)
                        You best stop that singing before I turn 
                        this gun on you. 
           INT. ANOTHER ROOM - NIGHT

           Augusta opens a window. She looks out towards the front 
           of the house, points her gun down, looks from side to 
           side. 

           She can’t see the soldiers. 

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER 

           Mad and Louise sit huddled in the corner. 

           A SHARP KNOCK. 

                                 AUGUSTA (O.S.)
                        It’s me. 

           Mad opens the door. Augusta slips in and quickly closes 
           the door behind her. 

                                 LOUISE
                        You alright. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I can hear ‘em but I can’t see ‘em. 

                                 MAD
                        I still says it’s ghosts. 

           Another window downstairs BREAKS. 

                                 AUGSUTA
                        You know ghosts who break windows? 

           Augusta stands. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What are you doin’? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Do you want them to come up here? 

                                 LOUISE
                        No. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Then I gotta go. 

           Augusta goes. 
           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

           Augusta stands at the top of the stairs. Takes a deep 
           breath and makes her decision. 

           She smells something. Once she’s at the bottom of the 
           stairs, she darts to --

           INT. FRONT HALL - SAME

           A small fire BLAZES on the floor just inside the broken 
           window. The gas lamp has been shoved onto the floor and 
           there it has broken and set a fire.

           Augusta drops the gun and looks around for something to 
           put out the fire. There’s nothing. Thinking fast, she 
           pulls off her nightgown and puts the fire out with it. 

           Once it’s out she picks up the gun again. 

           She moves through the house now, NAKED, gun in hand. 

           Another window BREAKS. She moves to the nearest HALLWAY 
           and hides in the darkness. 

           In the WINDOW:

           A HAND creeps through the broken glass and goes to open 
           the window from inside. 

           From the shadows, Augusta takes aims at the hand. She 
           tries to steady herself best she can and when she’s 
           ready, she takes a long deep breath...

           And SHOOTS. 

           The hand RECOILS as the bullet passes through the tender 
           area between the thumb and forefinger. 

                                 SOLDIER #1 (O.S.)
                        Jesus!

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Augusta holds the gun. Listening. Waiting.   

           A SHOT is fired back -- it hits the wall near her. She 
           GASPS. Soldier #1 yells something to Soldier #2 about his 
           hand, and then their voices recede from the side of the 
           house.
           Augusta WAITS. She is FROZEN in place. She waits until 
           she can’t hear the Soldiers anymore. And then she waits 
           just a bit more. 

           Cautiously, she moves to the window. She opens what’s 
           left of it and hangs outside, holding the gun tight. She 
           looks to her right...

           NOTHING.

           To her left...

           NOTHING.

           They’re gone...

           CRASH!

           Soldier #1 runs at the side of the house and grabs at 
           Augusta with his now very bloody hand. She quickly pulls 
           herself inside and slams the window down on his hand -- 

           He lets out a SCREAM --

           INT. FRONT HALL - SAME

           Augusta is running fast. She grabs the gas lamp. 

           She digs around underneath a table and pulls out a small 
           box. It’s nothing special, filled with mostly trinkets 
           and odds and ends, things that may have belonged to her 
           mother, a long time ago...

           And then she finds it: a small PISTOL. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Soldier #1 holds his arm to his chest. He is moving 
           quickly, but comes to rest on an exterior wall of the 
           house. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                                 (under his breath)
                        Shit shit shit!

           He breathes deeply, his gun at the ready. 

           Suddenly Soldier #2 comes around the side of the house. 

           Soldier #1 STARTS and AIMS...
                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Drop your gun, it’s me. 

           Beat. He does. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        How bad? 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        Women takin’ all kinds of parts of me 
                        today. 

           He shows his hand. It’s bad. Soldier #2 winces at the 
           site of it. 

           Decisive, he crouches down next to Soldier #1 and puts 
           down his gun. He takes the tail of his shirt from his 
           pants and rips part of it off at the bottom. He wraps the 
           scrap around Soldier #1’s hand. 

                                 AUGUSTA (O.S.)
                                 (from inside the house)
                        I will use this gun again! 

           Soldier #2 looks to Soldier #1 as if to say: 

           You got it in you to keep going? 

           Soldier #1 nods. Soldier #2 gets up and helps him up.

           They grab their guns. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 
                                 (loud)
                        No more games. We’re coming in.

           He motions for Soldier #1 to be quiet and points towards 
           the roof.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Augusta hears words but isn’t sure exactly where they are 
           coming from, or where the men plan to enter the house.

           There’s a real racket outside now --

           BANG!

           They seem to be kicking the walls. Are they trying to 
           kick them in?
           And then the sound of a BODY falling and hitting the soft 
           earth below... and then a pause... and then that banging 
           on the walls again...

           And then she puts it together: 

           THEY ARE CLIMBING THE HOUSE.

           Augusta runs to the stairs and then realizes something 
           and heads back down. Quickly, she puts out the other gas 
           lamps and runs back up. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Augusta knocks on the bedroom door. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Open up! It’s me! 

           Mad opens the door. 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           This conversation happens VERY quickly:

                                 LOUISE
                        What’s happening? Where are your --

                                 AUGUSTA 
                                 (to Mad)
                        Do you know how to use a gun? 

                                 MAD
                        What --

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Do you know how to use a gun -- 

                                 LOUISE
                        Why are you naked? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        There was a fire. I had to put it out. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What? 

           Augusta opens a wardrobe and pulls on a pair of bloomers 
           and a camisole as she talks. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Watch. You take the powder and put it in, 
                        then you take the ball and put it in. 
                        Then, you pull this part back and you 
                        wait and when you’re ready, you push this 
                        as hard as you can. 

           Mad takes the PISTOL. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Wait. But don’t wait too long. 

                                 MAD
                        Alright. 

           Now there is BANGING on the walls downstairs. Some shouts 
           and conversation. And suddenly we realize...

           The men continue to CLIMB THE HOUSE. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Are they --

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You got that? 

                                 MAD
                        Yes. 

           Louise is scared. She doesn’t understand what’s 
           happening. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        And remember, don’t shoot unless you’re 
                        sure or else -- 

                                 MAD
                        I know what else. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Now -- I’m gonna need to you to run. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Where we goin? 

                                 MAD
                        The Keepin’ Room. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s right. 

           Mad nods. 
                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Mad was right. Ain’t safe here. 

                                 LOUISE
                        But you said -- 

           BANG!

           The soldiers are SO CLOSE. They can almost hear them 
           breathing. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Mad, you take that gun and you take my 
                        sister and you run as fast as you can and 
                        you get to the Keepin’ Room. And once you 
                        there, you stay with that gun, ready to 
                        shoot.

                                 LOUISE
                        What about you? 

           The men have reached the second floor. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Gonna’ make sure they don’t see where you 
                        went.

                                 LOUISE
                        But -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Louise. Go.

           Louise nods. She takes the small gas lamp to light their 
           way. Augusta opens the door. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 

           Mad and Louise quietly slip out and run down the stairs 
           to the back door. They open it and ease into the night, 
           leaving the door open behind them.

           From outside, the sound of the soldiers climbing and 
           banging seems to suddenly CEASE. 

           Mad and Louise disappear from sight. 

           Augusta moves quietly towards the open door, her GUN 
           leading the way. We stay with her, the door growing 
           larger on frame with each step she takes... 

           She doesn’t see anyone. She doesn’t hear anyone. Or was 
           that a -- no, it can’t be... 
           It’s just sound of her footsteps as she moves...

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

           Augusta moves across the long walkway to the closed door 
           of the KEEPING ROOM. Still only the sound of her feet... 

           Noiselessly, she opens the door... 

           It’s EMPTY. 

           A TERRIFYING SCREAM comes from the front of the house. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

           Augusta RUNS around to the other side of the house. 

           The front door is OPEN. She goes inside. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME 

           The sounds of STRUGGLE pour down the stairs. 

           She knows she has to be strategic. QUIET. 

           But quite suddenly she is overwhelmed... she can’t take 
           it... 

           She starts to cry... 

           She stifles her heavy breath... 

           She stands in silence, alone. 

           She hears people upstairs. The muffled noises of Louise 
           or Mad trying to CRY OUT. 

           CRASHING. BREAKING. CRIES.  

           She steadies herself and moves towards the stairs. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - SAME 

           Augusta goes up the stairs. 

           A CREAK. A PAUSE. 

           And then --

           SHE IS RIPPED OUT OF FRAME FROM BEHIND. 
           But the camera continues to move up the stairs, creeping 
           upwards as if we are following Augusta on what is now the 
           journey of a ghost. It comes to rest in front of the 
           bedroom door, where the muffled sounds of a struggle can 
           be heard from within. 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Soldier #1 is on one side of the room, Louise is on the 
           other. He moves towards her, she moves away. She is very 
           weak.

           The small gas lamp sits next to the table. 

                                 SOLDIER #1
                        If you don’t stop moving, I might just 
                        shoot you. 

           Louise stops moving. 

                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to shoot you. 

           Louise moves away again. 

                                 SOLDIER #1 (CONT’D)
                        If you don’t want me to shoot you, why 
                        don’t you come and sit right here, on the 
                        bed. 

           Louise gives up and moves to the bed. 

           He holds the gun in one hand -- the hand that hasn’t been 
           shot up -- and RIPS her nightgown off with the bandaged 
           one. It doesn’t rip all the way, so he TEARS at it again. 
           Some of the blood from his hand gets on her skin. 

           Louise is SHAKING. 

           He pushes her back on the bed. He pulls down his pants 
           and begins to RAPE her. 

           She CRIES out. He pulls the upper part of her nightgown 
           up and stuffs it in her mouth. She GAGS. 

           He continues to hold the gun as he rapes her. 

           She tries to rise up, but she is so weak, and he is a 
           man. He pushes her back down. He holds her down with the 
           hand with the gun in it. 

           Finally, she submits. 
           This is not something to look at, not ever.

           But there is one small moment, just one, where it doesn’t 
           feel wrong to Louise, when she goes to a place in her 
           mind where she realizes that this -- this -- is what it 
           feels like to have a man inside you. And it feels good. 

           A GUNSHOT rings out from outside just as he finishes. 

           It’s over. 

           He moves off of her. After a moment we hear her slow, 
           wheezing breaths. 

           Continuing to hold the gun, he stands, pulls up his pants 
           and flattens his shirt inside them. He walks over to the 
           window. Looks out. Sees nothing. 

           Louise doesn’t move. 

           He slowly walks over to the mirror. Smooths his hair. 

           He takes some water from the basin and splashes it on his 
           face. He looks at Louise, behind him in the mirror. 

           He looks at her lying there. He looks at the blood around 
           her. She sees it too. 

           He walks by the bed, looking at her, and keeps walking 
           towards the door. Their eyes meets for a moment. Usually, 
           they don’t look at him after. It unnerves him, looking in 
           her eyes. 

           He shakes it off. He’s proud. Like a hunter after the 
           kill. He opens the door, steps out, and -- 

           BANG! 

           He is shot right in the HEAD. 

           Mad stands there, shaking, PISTOL aimed straight out. 

           After a moment, Louise stands and moves towards the open 
           door. HALF alive, nightgown HALF off, BLOOD EVERYWHERE.  

           She takes Mad’s gun and tries to shoot him again. The gun 
           doesn’t go off -- 

           CLICK! CLICK CLICK!

           But it only had the one bullet. She struggles to pull the 
           Soldier’s gun out of his hand, finally gets it and shoots 
           him in the head. 
           And then she takes the butt of the gun and bashes his 
           face in with it. 

           ONCE. 

           TWICE. 

           THREE TIMES. 

           Mad wrestles with Louise. 

                                 MAD
                        Enough. Enough. 

           Louise resists. Mad wrestles on. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        Enough. 

           Finally, Louise submits. 

           Augusta comes running up the stairs. She stops when she 
           sees the soldier dead on the ground and the women beside 
           him.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You sure learned to use that fast. 

                                 MAD
                        Where’s the other one? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        He got Daddy’s gun. And part of me too. 

           Augusta motions to her leg. She’s been SHOT. The back of 
           the leg.  There’s blood everywhere. She swoons a little. 

                                 MAD
                        Let’s go to the Keepin’ Room. 
                                 (pause)
                        This time, we go together. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mad, Augusta Louise come through the door. Mad and Louise 
           hoist Augusta up between them. 

           They put her down on a chair. Louise collapses into the 
           one next to her. 

           Mad runs to one of the cabinets and pulls out some 
           muslin. She also pulls out the big jug of MOONSHINE. 
           She puts them both down on the table. 

           Augusta stretches her leg out, pulls up the bloomers. 

           Mad pours the moonshine on the wound. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        AAAGGGHHH.

           Then, Mad rips the muslin with her teeth and winds it 
           around Augusta’s wound. 

           Louise is still wearing the bloody, torn nightgown, but 
           she’s wrapped it around herself in such a way that it 
           hides what needs to be hidden. 

           Augusta sits back down. Mad sits too. 

           Augusta pours three shots of moonshine. She puts one down 
           in front of Louise. 

                                 LOUISE
                        You want me to drink this? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yes. 

                                 MAD
                        You mind your sister and drink up. 

           The three women take the shot and SLAM down the glasses. 

           Louise sputters. Coughs. 

                                 LOUISE
                        More. 

           Augusta pours Louise another shot. 

           Louise drinks it down. Sputters less. 

           It’s quiet for a moment. 

                                 MAD
                        At my second farm, there was this one 
                        shed we wasn’t allowed at. All the other 
                        sheds had their jobs. One for feed. One 
                        for tools. But there was this one shed 
                        that we was told never to go in. Not to 
                        play near it. Not to get curious. We made 
                        up all sorts of stories bout it. Gold. 
                        Monsters. God. Then, one day when I was 
                        ‘bout 10 the man told me to go to the 
                        shed. ‘
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAD (CONT'D)
                        Til then, I had never known what 
                        happiness was. I was goin’ to the shed. I 
                        would get to know. I walked to the shed, 
                        my heart comin’ out my dress, I was gonna 
                        get to know, I was gonna get to know. I 
                        was gonna be the one to tell all the 
                        others. 

           Beat. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        I open the door. Only thing in there was 
                        a low cot and no windows. I stood in 
                        there a minute so unsure. So sad that 
                        that was all. Wonderin’ why we wasn’t 
                        supposed to know for so long. And then 
                        the man come in. And he had me. He was so 
                        big and I was so small. So small that I 
                        didn’t even know what was happenin’. That 
                        was the first time. And there were many 
                        more. Some times they cut the baby out. 
                        Other times, they kept ‘em. I don’t know 
                        where they are now. 

                                 LOUISE
                        You don’t think -- 

                                 MAD
                        You might. 

           Louise looks down. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        There are many kinds of monsters. You 
                        never know which one goin’ be yours. Wish 
                        I could say I killed mine. You put a 
                        bullet in yours today. 

           Louise looks at Mad in a way she never has. 

           Mad raises her glass to Louise and drinks. Augusta is in 
           a trance. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                                 (to Augusta)
                        You alright? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Yeah.  

                                 MAD
                        Your daddy never did -- don’t you worry. 
                        He hit us, sure, but never that. 
           Augusta nods. 

           And then they hear a NOISE outside. A man’s feet pounding 
           on the earth. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        We best be sure that door is locked. 

           And then --

           BANG! 

           A GUNSHOT. And ANOTHER. Right outside the door, but not 
           at it. 

           Augsuta moves to check the door. She stays real close to 
           it. The women don’t dare to breathe. 

           Until...

           The door knob RATTLES... 

           All of this happens VERY FAST:

           Mad stands right behind Augsuta, clutching her pistol -- 

           Augusta motions for Mad to hand her the pistol, she 
           places it right at the center of the door -- 

           Louise backs into the corner -- 

           Augusta looks back at her sister and at Mad, both shaking 
           with fear --

           BANGING on the door. 

           Augusta SHOOTS. 

           The bullet tears through and -- 

           THUD. 

           SILENCE. 

           Augusta looks back at Mad and Louise again. She puts her 
           ear to the door. There is no sound.

           She presses her eye to the hole made by the gun. 

           We see the BOOTS of a Union Army soldier pointing toes-up 
           towards the sky. 

           And then...
           Augusta’s face cracks into a SMILE. She begins to laugh a 
           crazy, hysterical laugh. Louise smiles too, and begins to 
           echo Augusta’s laugh. It’s almost as if she is controlled 
           by her.  

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        You don’t even know if he all dead yet.  

           Augusta stops. So does Louise. 

           Cautiously, Augusta opens the door. The BODY lies before 
           her. She walks out, gun at the ready.

           Mad and Louise wait behind in the Keeping Room. 

           EXT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME

           Augusta peers down through the darkness and sees a BLACK 
           FACE staring back up at her. Eyes WIDE. 

           It is the face of the BLACK RIDER. 

           THIS IS BILL. 

           Augusta drops the pistol and backs up into...

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME

                                 MAD
                        What is it? 

           Augusta just keeps moving backwards. Mad stands and goes 
           to the body. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Don’t!

                                 LOUISE
                        What? What’s wrong? 

           EXT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME

           Mad stands staring down at Bill. 

           She doesn’t move for a LONG moment. She stands there, 
           staring, weighing, realizing... 

           Until finally... 
           She kneels down, and kisses him real hard on the mouth. 
           She looks down and takes the pistol out of his belt, 
           stands up, goes back inside, and closes the door.  

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME 

           Mad walks back past Augusta and sits at the table. 

           Augusta is shaking now. She just looks at Mad. 

           A LONG PAUSE. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Say somethin’. Please. Just say somethin’ 
                        Mad. 

           Mad remains silent. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What’s goin’ on? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I’m just gonna keep havin’ to say words 
                        cause I can’t bear this quiet. 

                                 MAD
                                 (to herself, real quiet)
                        He come back. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s not what I’m... please, Mad -- 

                                 MAD
                        It ain’t bout you. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But I -- 

                                 MAD
                        I ain’t angry with you, Augusta. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Wha --

                                 MAD
                        I’m angry cause I came right close to 
                        killin’ him myself.  

           Augusta moves right next to Mad. Mad grabs her hand real 
           hard. 

                                 LOUISE
                        We wanted him dead, right? 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Hit me or hurt me or somethin’. 

                                 MAD
                                 (biting back feeling)
                        Glad you done it ‘stead of me. He would 
                        never forgive me if I’s the one who done 
                        it.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But it didn’t even have to be -- 

                                 MAD
                        What? You want me to sit here cryin’?  
                        Talk ‘bout how much I love Bill? How I 
                        can’t believe he made it all the way here 
                        just to die? What’s the purpose in that? 
                        How that goin’ to get us through this 
                        night? 

                                 LOUISE 
                                 (realizing what happened)
                        Wha --  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Mad -- 

                                 MAD
                        There’s another man come through that 
                        door any second. Ain’t no time to think 
                        on such things.

           Beat. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Bill? He came back -- he was goin’ to -- 

                                 MAD
                        When you goin’ to learn what don’t happen 
                        don’t matter?

           Augusta motions to Louise to be quiet. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        You just go on.  

           Mad takes out Bill’s gun. Holds it. Regards it. Puts it 
           in the waist of her skirt. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We best block up that door, ‘case that 
                        other one come back. 
                                 MAD
                        We ain’t goin’ to wait for him. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What we goin’ to do?

                                 MAD
                        We goin’ out there to hunt him. And we 
                        ain’t come back here ‘til he ours.   

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           We’re WIDE on the farm and the surrounding buildings. 
           Maybe we see two tiny figures, creeping. But it could 
           just be a trick of the eye. 

           And save for the symphony of southern bugs... 

           It’s DEAD QUIET. 

           And then on the side of the frame, we see...

           Soldier #2 moving through the darkness. Gun up. Ready to 
           catch those girls.

           SLAM! 

           The door to the farmhouse shuts.

           He turns. Goes to it. Enters, cautiously. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Soldier #2 moves quietly through the house, gun at the 
           ready. 

           He hears FOOTSTEPS going up the stairs. 

           INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

           He moves up the stairs. 

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           He looks into one room. It’s EMPTY. 

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Another room. EMPTY. 
           But did he hear something at the other end of the house? 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           In the back of the dark room he sees a man sitting in a 
           chair with his back to the door. A gas lamp blazes next 
           to him. 

           Soldier #2 immediately holds up his gun, ready to shoot 
           if the man is an enemy. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        That you, Henry?

           No response. Can’t be Henry then. He raises his gun. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        Who are you? 

           Still nothing. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        I said: who are you? 

           And still nothing 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        You the man was shooting at me before? 

           Silence. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        I got a gun ready to fire right through 
                        the back of your head if you don’t answer 
                        me. 

           He’s scared now, but --

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        Answer me! 

           In a moment of bravery, he kicks the chair around with 
           his boot, gun pointed but shaking in his hands. 

           His breathing STOPS. 

           It is Soldier #1 -- HENRY -- propped up in the chair, 
           head blown straight through and bashed up, and what’s 
           left of his eyes are WIDE and WILD. 

           Soldier #2 muffles his own scream by shoving his fist in 
           his mouth. 
           There’s a note pinned to his chest that simply reads: 

           YOU NEXT. 

           Over this he hears:

           The VOICES of girls singing outside the house. Maybe it’s 
           one of the songs they sang earlier.

           Soldier #2 is shaking. He is bewildered. 

           FEAR in his eyes. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Soldier #2 comes stalking into the night. 

           The flash of a FIGURE runs in-between two out buildings. 
           He tries to see where it went, but it’s too fast. 

           Then ANOTHER FIGURE off to the side. 

           He doesn’t know which way to go. 

           And ANOTHER. He starts towards it, but then it’s gone. 

           A WAIL -- coyote like, something not quite animal but not 
           quite human -- emanates from the trees. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Who are you? You tryin’ to scare me? Show 
                        yourself, coward!

           The SINGING starts again, and somehow... it’s coming from 
           the trees.

           He moves towards the trees where he thinks the singing is 
           coming from. He gets real close to it -- it’s loud now -- 
           and then suddenly it STOPS. 

           He hears something coming --

           WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP!

           And out from the darkness comes a horse -- MARTIN -- 
           GALLOPING straight for him. 

           At first he’s too bewildered to move, but he gets his 
           wits about him just in time to jump out of the way and 
           falls to the ground as Martin gallops past him and 
           disappears into the dark. 

           He shakes his head and looks around. And then --
           Like an apparition, there’s Louise. She’s a good distance 
           away, but it’s most certainly her. They hold each other’s 
           gaze for a moment...

           And then she’s GONE.

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        I see you, girl!

           Louise runs as fast as she can into --

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Soldier #2 cautiously enters. It’s dark in here. He can’t 
           see her. 

           He moves slowly, carefully, gun at the ready. 

           A VOICE from above --

                                 LOUISE (O.S.)
                        Please don’t shoot. I don’t have a gun. 

           He turns in the direction of the voice. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Where --

           And then the voice is suddenly SOMEWHERE ELSE. 

                                 LOUISE (O.S.)
                        I’m scared. There’s another man lose on 
                        the farm. He’s trying to kill us, too. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        How you movin’ round like that?

                                 LOUISE (O.S.)
                        I’m scared. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        You seen the man’s face? 

                                 LOUISE
                        He’s everywhere. 

           And now the sound of CLIMBING. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        You goin’ up to the hayloft? 

                                 LOUISE (O.S.)
                        Your friend had me. 
           Soldier #2 gropes around in the dark until his hands land 
           on A LADDER. He looks up to the hayloft and slowly begins 
           to climb.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Did he now? 

                                 LOUISE (O.S.)
                        If I let you, do you promise not to shoot 
                        me? Will you protect me from the other 
                        one? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I have to find you first. 

           CREAK.

           Louise’s feet carefully move across the boards of the 
           hayloft. 

                                 LOUISE (OS)
                        Ain’t goin’ to let you find me less you 
                        promise. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Alright. I promise. 

           Louise LIGHTS a MATCH and holds right up near her FACE. 

           She is facing him. She waves it out. 

           Soldier #2 catches a glimpse of her EYES. He moves 
           towards her, she moves back. 

           Another MATCH: 

           Her LIPS. 

           She waves it out. Moving backwards, now.

           He advances. 

           Louise’s feet, walking backwards, so lightly. 

           Another MATCH: 

           Her HAIR. 

           She waves it out. Still moving backwards. 

           His feet, approaching. 

           One last MATCH:
           She is SMILING, beckoning. 

           He steps towards her and... 

           THERE’S NOTHING THERE.

           There’s no floor. The board is gone. He FALLS, emits a 
           GUTTURAL sound, some CLATTERING, and then --

           THUD. He hits the ground. 

           His gun on the ground beside him. 

           A foot kicks the gun away. A hand reaches down and grabs 
           it. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        This belongs to my daddy. 

           Augusta and Mad face the Soldier, who looks up at them, 
           directly into the barrel of the gun. Louise joins them. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mad, Augusta and Louise sit by the fire looking at 
           something across the room, guns trained. 

           Soldier #2 sits in a chair, feet bound and a rope wrapped 
           around his chest. He’s broken now, close to done. 

           He holds a glass of moonshine, the only thing to ease the 
           pain. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        This is fine moonshine. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Our daddy made it. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Your Papa made fine moonshine. 

           Silence. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        Mighty fine of you to give me some sips 
                        before I go. 

           The women just stare at him. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        Who was that other man shooting at me? 
                                 MAD
                        That was Bill. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        He was wearin’ one of ours. 

                                 MAD
                        He was. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Funny that. 

                                 MAD
                        I reckon. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Where is he now? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I killed him. Thought it was you. 

           Soldier #2 cracks a smile and then bursts into a full on 
           LAUGH. It is just him laughing for a good long moment. 

           Then, he settles and stops. 

           Again: SILENCE.

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        He kill my partner? 

                                 MAD
                        No. That was me. 

                                 LOUISE
                        And me. 

                                 MAD
                        He was already dead. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I made him real dead. 

           Mad pauses. 

                                 MAD
                        That you did. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        How long you girls been on your own? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Long enough.  
                                 SOLDIER #2
                        You do alright. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We do alright. 

           As she speaks, Augusta gets up, goes over to the fire, 
           pulls down the HAT from the game of Blind Man. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        You know, this is my favorite room. 
                        Always been my favorite place on this 
                        whole land. This room. And I guess since 
                        I never been anywhere else, that means 
                        this room is my favorite place in the 
                        whole world. 

           She puts on the hat. 

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        My daddy built this room. Bill and 
                        Nathaniel too. And I intend to stay here. 
                        Ain’t no one gonna’ make it otherwise. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I ain’t gonna.  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You got that right. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Me an’ him, we were scouts. Sent on ahead 
                        to cover the outlying land, send messages 
                        back to the coming regiments. Sherman’s 
                        marching all across this state and he’s 
                        not taking prisoners. None of us are. 
                                 (beat)
                        Georgia’s fallen. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You kill that bartender? And that whore? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Sure did. But I’m not going to be the one 
                        to kill you. But someone just like me 
                        will. Someone who looks like me, hates 
                        your land like me, he’ll shoot you right 
                        in the head. All three of your pretty, 
                        little heads. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Too bad you ain’t goin’ live to see if 
                        you’re right or not. 
                                 SOLDIER #2
                        You know how many battles I fought in? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Don’t seem like many. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        No. It don’t. But it was. And yet, here I 
                        sit -- 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        -- here you sit -- 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        -- shit. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s what you get for bein’ bad. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        North ain’t bad. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Didn’t say it was. Said you was. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        And you, are you good? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Don’t know anymore. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Used to though, right?  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Sure did. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        And when was that? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Back when all the men was where they 
                        belonged. Made the world seem correct. 
                        And then all things got moved and once 
                        all things got moved didn’t seem to be a 
                        right and a wrong no more. Didn’t seem to 
                        matter. Doesn’t matter, does it? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I killed that bartender and that whore. 
                        You going to kill me. Someone going to 
                        kill you too. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Maybe. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I’m just glad it’s not going to be me. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What now?  

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Glad I don’t have to be the one to put 
                        the bullets in. Might even say I was 
                        starting to like you. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You tryin’ to get let go -- I know. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        I know she won’t let me outta here alive. 

           He looks at Mad. 

                                 SOLDIER #2 (CONT’D)
                        I’m just telling you I like you. Say 
                        something true before I die.

                                 AUGUSTA
                                 (a beat)
                        I am sorry ‘bout your dog. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Thank you. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        That’s a true thing. 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        He was a good dog. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You bout finished your drink? 

                                 SOLDIER #2
                        Just abou --

           Augusta shoots him in the head. Louise screams. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Why did you --  

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I was startin’ to like him too. 

           Mad and Louise are speechless. 
                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        Now, what we gonna do with these bodies? 

           A jarring THUMP takes us to --

           INT. STAIRCASE - LATER

           Mad and Augusta lug Soldier #1 down the stairs by his 
           feet.

           THUMP.

           THUMP.

           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER

           By the light of the moon, Augusta digs a big, messy HOLE. 
           Louise sits to the side, watching. The body of Soldier #1 
           lies by her side. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER

           Mad drags Soldier #2 by his boots. A trail of blood 
           behind him.

           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER

           Mad drags the body around the side of the house. 

                                 MAD
                                 (shouting)
                        Come help! 

           Augusta hauls herself out of a SECOND HOLE she’s been 
           digging and runs to help Mad carry the body the rest of 
           the way. They dump him next to Soldier #1. 

           They stop in front of the hole. They look down. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        Them’s good holes. 

           Augusta nods. 

           With their feet, Mad and Augusta push the body of Soldier 
           #1 into the ground.
           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER

           Mad and Louise work on filling in the first hole.

           Augusta sits by the body of Soldier #2, getting ready to 
           push him in. She looks at his face. She touches his nose. 
           She looks at his jacket and pats his pockets. She pulls 
           out a small purse with some coins and a TINTYPE of a 
           young woman. 

           She looks at the woman’s face. She holds the picture 
           close to hers. She puts it back. She finds a few bullets, 
           too. Takes them. 

           She looks at him one last time and then, with all her 
           might, she rolls him in.

           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER

           Mad and Augusta shovel the dirt on top of the second 
           hole. Louise sits by.

           INT. SHED - NIGHT

           Mad is standing inside over Bill’s body. They dragged him 
           in there to hide him from Soldier #2. 

           Augusta walks in. Mad doesn’t turn, she just feels 
           Augusta behind her. 

                                 MAD
                        Don’t know what I want to do with it. 

           Beat. 

                                 MAD (CONT’D)
                        Don’t want to bury it. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You can think on it if you want. 

                                 MAD
                        As long as I just leave ‘em there, it’s 
                        alright. 

                                 AUGSUTA
                        Then leave ‘em. 

                                 MAD
                        How strange he show up here dressed up 
                        like a Yankee. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        Disguise maybe? 

                                 MAD
                        No, I reckon he joined up. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        With them -- 

                                 MAD
                        Maybe he was free even. 

           Augusta understands. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        And he came back. 

                                 MAD
                        Let’s dig him a hole. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        But you -- 

                                 MAD
                        If you don’t make me put him in the 
                        ground, I might never stop standin’ right 
                        here. 

           EXT. GOAT FIELD - LATER 

           The women stand over the now filled up, make-shift 
           graves, looking at their work. 

           The THREE GRAVES: mounds of dirt swelling up out of the 
           earth, side by side. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I remember when this field was full of 
                        goats. 

                                 MAD
                        Seems like lives ago. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I reckon it was. 

                                 MAD
                        We should say a prayer. 

           Mad bows her head and closes her eyes. Augusta and Louise 
           do the same.
           After a moment, Augusta opens her eyes and looks up 
           again. The sky is getting just a bit brighter. The sun’s 
           not up, but it’s no longer night. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        We best get inside. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER 

           Louise sleeps in the corner. Mad and Augusta talk by the 
           fire. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You think if Bill made it back... maybe? 

                                 MAD
                        Don’t get your hopes high. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I know, but -- 

                                 MAD
                        Ain’t goin’ to tell you again. 

           This next bit in hushed whispers:

                                 AUGUSTA
                        What are we gonna do if she’s got a baby? 

                                 MAD
                        Take care of her. Like always. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You know how to cut ‘em out? 

                                 MAD
                        That’s a Godless thing to say. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Sorry. 

           Beat.

                                 AUGUSTA (CONT’D)
                        We stayin’ here? 

                                 MAD
                        We are. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Then we goin’ to need to go out to the 
                        garden, get all the food we can. Ain’t no 
                        animals left. 
                                 MAD 
                        I’ll go. You stay with Louise. 

           Augusta nods. 

           Mad takes the rifle and heads outside. 

           Augusta looks over at Louise. Watches her sleep. 

           Augusta looks at her gun. Runs her fingers across it. 

           AND THEN -- 

                                 MAD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Augusta! 

           Augusta starts. 

                                 MAD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Augusta come out here!

           Augusta wakes Louise.

                                 LOUISE
                                 (waking)
                        What? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Come on. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

           Mad stands on a hill overlooking the land. As Augusta and 
           Louise approach, they know exactly why she called out. 

           The three women stand, looking out. And then we see:

           THE WORLD IS ON FIRE. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Looks like the sky’s on fire. 

                                 MAD
                        Looks like the whole world’s on fire. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        They comin’. 

           INT. KEEPING ROOM - SAME

           The three women sip moonshine. 
           A pile of carrots, turnips and beets fills the table. 

           The faint SOUNDS OF WAR approaching in the distance. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        This is all the food we got. Can’t go 
                        outside no more. 

                                 LOUISE
                        You sure we shouldn’t run? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Where to? Ain’t nothin’ safer than these 
                        walls.

                                 MAD
                        Ain’t nothin’ safe. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        This room is the best hope we got. This 
                        is our home and we gonna’ defend it. 

                                 LOUISE
                        This our home. 

           Louise takes Mad’s hand. She holds tight. Mad holds tight 
           back. She knows what Louise is trying to say even if 
           Louise doesn’t know quite how to say it. 

                                 MAD 
                        So we just sit? 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        No. 

           A resounding RIP takes us to --

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - JUST BEFORE DAWN

           Augusta takes wooden SHUTTERS off the side of the farm 
           house. 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Louise PULLS NAILS out of whatever she can.

           INT. SHED - SAME

           Mad GATHERS tools. 
           INT. KEEPING ROOM - DAWN 

           The women furiously BOARD UP the windows. 

           Louise holds boards as Mad nails them. 

           Augusta looks wildly around the room and then moves 
           towards the TABLE.

           Augusta shoves everything off of it, sending the mess 
           flying around the room. 

           She tries to upend the table, but she can’t do it. 

                                 LOUISE
                        How many you think they is? 

                                 MAD
                        More than we can count. 

           BOOM!

           A cannon erupts in the distance.

           Louise and Mad get back to work. Augusta goes back to the 
           table, takes a deep breath --

                                 LOUISE
                                 (frustrated)
                        What if we didn’t stay here? What if we 
                        went?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Went? 

                                 LOUISE
                        Out there -- 

                                 MAD
                        They’re comin’ -- and fast.

                                 LOUISE
                        So? 

                                 MAD
                        The entire union army walking right for 
                        us and you just wanna walk right back? 

                                 LOUISE
                        They walkin’ here either way. Don’t see 
                        what a few bullets and boards is goin’ to 
                        do to keep ‘em out. 
                                 AUGUSTA
                        We can hold ‘em. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Keepin’ Room’s just walls, Augusta, ain’t 
                        nothin’ more than that. 

           Augusta goes back to trying to lift the table. 

                                 MAD
                        Three dresses comin’ ‘gainst the Union 
                        army don’t mean nothin’.

           Augusta resumes the struggle. She puts her whole body 
           into the lifting, as if blocking the door with the table 
           will save them. She grunts. The table lifts a little and 
           then falls back to the ground. 

           Augusta stands there. Mad and Louise watch her. 

           She leans on the table. Breathing heavy. 

                                 AUGSUTA
                                 (realizing)
                        What if it was men ‘stead of dresses? 

           Augusta looks up, meeting Louise’s gaze. 

           And then the SOUND of digging -- 

           EXT. GOAT FIELDS - LATER

           EARTH flies everywhere. 

           Augusta stands in one of the graves. They’ve dug it up. 
           Mad stands above, helping her lift the body out. 

           Louise stands by. She’s sweating. Shaking a little, even. 

           The two bodies of the white soldiers lay on the ground in 
           front of the dug up holes and piles of dirt. 

           Augusta looks at Mad. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You ready for Bill? 

           Mad looks at Augusta.
           EXT. GOAT FIELDS - LATER

           Augusta and Mad pull Bill’s body out of the unearthed 
           grave. They take a few heavy breaths.

           Mad takes him in one last time.

                                 MAD
                        It’s funny how people look the same 
                        whether they dead or alive. 

                                 AUGSUTA
                        What do you mean? 

                                 MAD
                        He gone. But he don’t look so bad...

                                 AUGUSTA
                        He look dead. 

                                 MAD
                        But he look gooooood. 

           Augusta smiles a deranged, exhausted smile. 

           Mad runs her hand down his face. 

                                 AUGUSTA
                                 (smiling)
                        Alright. 

           INT. BEDROOM - DUSK

           Mad, Louise and Augusta in the bedroom. 

           Augusta stands in front of the mirror in full UNION 
           UNIFORM. Mad stands behind her, the same. 

           Louise is still getting into the borrowed clothes. She 
           struggles. Her symptoms are starting to show. 

           She shakes it off and moves to join Mad and Augusta in 
           front of the mirror. They look at themselves, all dressed 
           up as men. Soldiers. 

           The uniforms are too big, of course, but the women wear 
           them well. 

           As they speak, they keep looking in the mirror. 
                                 LOUISE
                        Had a dream the other night Papa and 
                        Nathaniel were comin’ back. It’s funny it 
                        was Bill instead. Don’t you think? 

                                 MAD
                        Don’t know that funny’s the right word. 

                                 LOUISE
                        What is the right word? 

                                 MAD
                        Don’t think there is one. 

                                 LOUISE
                        We goin’ to kill em or join em? 

                                 MAD
                        Guess we’ll have to see what fits. 

                                 LOUISE
                        So we just go? 

                                 MAD
                        It was your idea. 

                                 LOUISE
                        I think we just go. 

                                 MAD
                        Alright. 

                                 LOUISE
                        Strange, isn’t it? We don’t know them and 
                        they don’t know us but we want to kill 
                        each other. 

           The sounds of GUNS and CANNONS grow closer. And then the 
           sound of men’s voices emerge from the din.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        ‘Fore they left, I asked daddy why the 
                        war was happenin’. He said it was the 
                        season. Just like there’s summer, spring, 
                        and winter and fall... there’s war.

           Louise wipes her brow. Augsuta and Mad exchange a look. 

           The three women look at themselves in the mirror. They 
           aren’t women anymore. 

                                 AUGSUTA
                        Let’s go. 
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s dark now. 

           The three women emerge from the house. Each has a gun. 

           The sounds of war grow louder, nearly consuming them, 
           nearly consuming all of us.

           They walk on, away from the house.

           Louise looks at Augusta, their eyes locked for a moment. 
           Augusta looks at Mad, their eyes meet and then they look 
           ahead again, toward the road. 

           They are all feeling the exact same feeling in the exact 
           same way: they are all at once afraid and unafraid.

           A few men appear, UNION SOLDIERS. Running across the 
           road. The women walk on, unrecognized for what they are. 

           A few more guns. A few more cannons. 

           They keep a steady pace. 

           And slowly, slowly, EVER SO SLOWLY, the camera RISES UP 
           into the night sky...

           UP, UP, UP...

           Into the air, above the women, above the road and the 
           Keeping Room and the Farm and the Barn and all of the Out 
           Buildings...

           And settles into the night sky. 

           FIRE. 

           CRACKLING. 

           HOLLERING. 

           BARKING. 

           GUNSHOTS. 

           MEN ARE EVERYWHERE. 

           They creep up over the land like zombies.

                                                          THE END.
