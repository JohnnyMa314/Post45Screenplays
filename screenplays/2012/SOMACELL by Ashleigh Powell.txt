           OVER BLACK:

           THUD. THUD. THUD. THUD.

           A steady, pulsing rhythm. Deafeningly loud. Each jolt shaking 
           our seats.

           FADE IN:

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

           A dark, dank space lit only by a few bare light bulbs 
           swinging from the ceiling. Bodies crowd around, making a  
           cramped and sweaty. ALL MEN --

           Scarred. Muscled. Tattooed. 

           THUD. THUD. THUD. THUD.

           That sound is their FISTS smacking into the CONCRETE WALLS. 
           Beating out a rhythm with calloused, bloody knuckles. 

           A WARCRY. 

           One man steps into the center of the circle. He wears a 
           MOHAWK and carries a barbed CAT O’ NINE TAILS.

           Another man steps up to meet him. He has a PORT-WINE STAIN on 
           the side of his face and sports a homemade pair of PANTERA 
           CLAWS. 

           THUD-THUD-THUD-THUD.

           The rhythm gets faster, building to a frenzy as Mohawk and 
           Port-Wine circle each other in the ring. Echoing like a TRAIN 
           is rumbling through this dark space. Louder, louder, then --

           SILENCE. The equivalent of a bell at a boxing match. 

           Port-Wine LUNGES with his claws. 

           Mohawk DODGES and WHIPS his cat o’ nine tails into PORT-
           WINE’s back. Cheers erupt as flesh tears.

           Mohawk readies his whip again. But this time the barbs CATCH 
           in Port-Wine’s thick cargo pants. Mistake. 

           Port-Wine KICKS his leg back, YANKING the Cat O’Nine Tails 
           from Mohawk’s grip. Then he advances. Claws gleaming.

           Mohawk raises his fists... But flesh and bone is no match for 
           a blade.
           Port-Wine CHARGES, BLOCKS Mohawk’s swing, and 

           THRUSTS HIS CLAWS up into Mohawk’s ribs.

           Blood gurgles up out of Mohawk’s mouth as he slumps to the 
           floor. Hands reach out and pull his body into the circle.

           Port-Wine raises his arms in victory and

           THUD. THUD. THUD. THUD.

           The crowd calls for a new contender. Into the circle steps:

           A WALL OF MUSCLE with a pattern of CIGARETTE BURNS on his 
           back. He holds a simple, household HAMMER.

           This is PIKE. 

           Port-Wine looks at the hammer and grins. He raises one 
           Pantera claw to his face and LICKS OFF THE BLOOD. 

           Pike gazes back with no expression. But he jostles the hammer 
           in his hand. Feeling its weight, testing his grip. As if he 
           finds the motion soothing.

           The wall-pounding raises to a deafening roar -- THUD-THUD-
           THUD-THUD -- then:  silence. Time to fight.

           Pike and Port-Wine circle each other. Port-Wine fakes a few 
           JABS with his claws. Taunting. But Pike doesn’t flinch. 

           Instead, Pike starts WALKING TOWARD HIM. Calmly. Casually. 
           Hammer still at his side. 

           Port-Wine doesn’t know what to make of this, but he raises 
           his claws, pulls back, and readies to SWING --

           But as he lunges into a DEADLY THRUST, his claws hit nothing 
           but air. In that split second, Pike 

           DROPS TO THE GROUND

           And SWINGS the clawed end of his hammer into Port-Wine’s 

           ACHILLES TENDON.

           Port-Wine goes down SCREAMING.

           Pike stands, arches the hammer back, ready to send the blunt 
           end into the wine-stain target on his opponent’s face, when -- 

           A pair of 

           EXPENSIVE HEELS 
           steps into the circle. 

           The heels belong to DELANEY THOMAS (30s):  polished, 
           professional, and not at all terrified of the THUGS 
           surrounding her. 

           In fact, she appears frustrated more than anything else. And 
           her eyes land on Pike with all the fury of a mother about to 
           scold a child.

                                 DELANEY
                        What is this, Pike? 

           Pike WHEELS. His eyes go WIDE -- the first emotion we’ve seen 
           from him.

                                 PIKE
                        The fuck are you doing here?! 

                                 DELANEY
                        When I told you to find a hobby, 
                        this is not what I meant. I thought 
                        we were making progress. 

           A THUG reaches out from the crowd to GRAB Delaney. Without 
           even looking, she 

           SNAPS EVERY FINGER IN HIS HAND. How did she do that?! 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        How can I help you if you won’t 
                        help yourself? It’s not enough for 
                        me to want you to have a better 
                        life if you don’t want it, too. 
                        This road you’re on... it only 
                        leads to one place. But it doesn’t 
                        have to. You can change.

           The hammer sags in Pike’s hand. For some reason, this 
           mountain of a man is quailed by a petite professional woman.

           But Port-Wine has had enough. With a cry of rage, he RISES up 
           onto his one good leg and LUNGES for Pike while his back is 
           turned. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Look out!

           With lightning reflexes, Delaney SWIVELS Pike out of the way, 
           just in time to miss Port-Wine’s swipe.

           But a HUSH falls over the crowd. 
                                 PIKE 
                        Oh fuck...

           Delaney follows his gaze to her own RIGHT SHOULDER, where one 
           of Port-Wine’s blades has 

           IMPALED HER through the collarbone, and out the other side.

           Port-Wine looks just as shocked as anybody. He releases his 
           grip on the pantera claw, leaving it hanging from Delaney’s 
           shoulder.

           On instinct, Pike WHEELS and PUNCHES Port-Wine in the face. 
           It’s a powerhouse hit. Port-Wine falls to the floor in an 
           unconscious heap. 

           Delaney YANKS the blade out of her shoulder in one fluid 
           motion. The pantera claw clatters to the floor.

           She looks at the blood blossoming through her blouse. Winces 
           through the pain. Grits her teeth. Angry now.

                                 DELANEY
                        Great.

           She turns back to Pike. Fuming. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Just. Get your shit together. 

           And with that, she turns and storms back through the crowd. 
           The thugs around her STEP ASIDE, bewildered and awed. 

           Pike just stares after her. Utterly stunned.

                                 PIKE
                        Yo... Yo!
                             (calling after her)
                        Mrs. T!

           EXT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

           Delaney SHOVES open the door and steps out into the morning 
           sun. She leans against the building, blood soaking her shirt, 

           then moves to touch the WATCH on her left wrist --

           Which is unlike any type of watch we’ve ever seen. ITS FACE 
           IS BLANK. Which means it’s something else entirely...

           -- but she can’t move her right arm. Damn knife wound. 
           Instead, she lifts her left wrist up to her right hand. And 
           when her fingers touch the blank watch face, it
           LIGHTS UP, a brilliant blue. 

           Delaney closes her eyes. And when she opens them, she’s in:

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           [Here the color palette becomes more diffused -- duller and 
           darker.]

           A blank white room -- sterile, like a hospital. 

           Delaney is sitting in a rolling chair wearing a sleek

           METALLIC HEADBAND. 

           She takes it off and rubs her shoulder -- which is totally 
           FINE. No blood, no stab wound. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Ow.

           Beside her, PIKE is asleep in what appears to be some kind of 
           hospital bed. Electrodes monitor his vital signs. His wrists 
           and ankles are CUFFED to the sides of the bed frame. And he 
           wears a metallic HEADBAND just like hers. Except --

           Pike’s headband is wired to a PLASMA SCREEN mounted above his 
           bed. Onscreen, we see footage of him exiting the abandoned 
           building where she just was, searching for her. 

           It’s as if Delaney was just inside Pike’s mind.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You okay? 

           The room is full of beds just like Pike’s. In each one, a 
           sleeping man or woman wears the same electrodes, handcuffs, 
           and metal headbands. 

           Plasma screens are mounted above each bed. Some show scenes 
           of drug use, domestic violence, physical confrontations, etc. 
           But most show typical, boring aspects of everyday life:  
           driving to work, grocery shopping, watching tv, etc..

           This is no hospital, and these aren’t patients. 

           It’s a prison. Full of convicts.

                                 VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Delaney?

           The VOICE emanates from an intercom mounted on the ceiling. 
           Delaney gets up. Still rubbing her shoulder.
                                 DELANEY
                        Stabbed.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Again?

           Delaney just rolls her eyes. 

           She exits the White Room and strides down the...

           HALLWAY 

           to the

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM 

           A temple dedicated to the gods of TECHNOLOGY. Floor-to-
           ceiling plasma screens stream live feeds from hundreds of 
           convicts, just like the ones we saw in the White Room.

           And in the far corner, surrounded by a bank of dozens of 
           monitors, operating an instrument panel more complex than any 
           commercial aircraft’s, is the high priestess herself:

           JINX (20s), the alterna-hot tech-guru who keeps this whole 
           place functioning. Mostly. 

                                 JINX
                        So we talking graze, flesh wound, 
                        or swiss cheese?

           Delaney pours a cup of coffee. Wincing at the weight of the 
           mug on her sore arm. She takes a seat at a table -- the 
           surface of which doubles as a TOUCHSCREEN DEVICE. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I want to see his file.

           Jinx’s fingers fly over her keypad. In seconds, a FILE icon 
           appears on Delaney’s table-screen. 

                                 JINX (THE VOICE)
                        You know Bo’s gonna love this. 

                                 BO (O.S.)
                        Love what? 

           In walks BO (40s), a rough, gruff, bear of a man. 

           Delaney doesn’t look up. But she does pull a crumpled $20 
           bill out of her pocket and place it on the table. 
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        You’re shitting me.

           Delaney ignores him. She opens the digital file and starts 
           scanning through. We see MUG SHOTS of Pike, CRIME SCENE 
           PHOTOS of a murder, and various police report documents.

           Specifically, a LOG of dates, times, and events.

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        Leg? Stomach? Don’t tell me face 
                        again. 

                                 DELANEY
                             (reading documents)
                        Shoulder.

                                 BO
                        Ouch. What, you dress like a bull’s-
                        eye in there? 

                                 DELANEY
                        He’s regressing.

                                 JINX
                        Here we go...

                                 BO
                        And this is... J104? The guy with a 
                        hammer for a security blanket?

                                 DELANEY
                        Pike. He hasn’t had an incident in   
                        weeks. No fights, no outbursts, 
                        nothing. He was making progress. 
                        Working toward a breakthrough. So I 
                        thought. Turns out he’s just found 
                        another outlet. He’s just. 
                        Regressing.

           Bo looks at her, looks at Jinx. Time to put the jokes aside 
           and have a serious talk. He sits.

                                 BO
                        Delaney. We’ve talked about this--

                                 DELANEY
                        So why you feel the need to bring 
                        it up yet again--

                                 BO
                        There’s a word for Pike and 
                        “regressing” ain’t it. Violence is 
                        in his blood. He’s a lifer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        A bottom-feeder. He’s never gonna 
                        change. Most of them aren’t. A 
                        criminal’s a criminal no matter how 
                        many second chances they get. Much 
                        as I like taking your money, you 
                        realize that, maybe you stop 
                        getting stabbed. Or shot.

                                 JINX
                        Also strangled. That one time.

           Delaney doesn’t answer. Just stares hard at the file.

                                 BO
                        You think I’m a hard-ass. 

                                 DELANEY
                             (reluctant)
                        That’s not true.

                                 BO
                        Yeah you do. You think I’m a cold, 
                        heartless hard-ass who has no 
                        feelings. Jinx, you think I’m a 
                        hard-ass?

                                 JINX
                             (smirks)
                        The hardest.

                                 BO
                        Well maybe I am. But. Ask me how I 
                        sleep at night. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You want to know what I think? I 
                        think everyone is capable of 
                        change, as long as one person is 
                        capable of believing in them.

           She picks up her coffee to go.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                             (to Jinx)
                        Prep N319’s uplink for me. 

                                 BO
                        Sure. Run off to the Golden Boy.
                             (as she’s leaving)
                        Since when did prison become “No 
                        Convict Left Behind”?

           Delaney looks back at him. Sheer exhaustion in her eyes... and 
           also raw determination.
                                 DELANEY
                        Since SomaCell.

           INT. HALLWAY

           Delaney moves down the hall and pulls open the door to:

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           Delaney pulls a swivel chair over to the bed labeled N319. A 
           man in his 30s sleeps soundly. Underneath the shaggy hair and 
           beard-stubble is a handsome man with chiseled features. This 
           is MASON.

           The plasma screen over his bed shows Mason in a RACQUETBALL 
           COURT, working up a sweat. 

           Delaney takes a seat and attunes her HEADBAND to the proper 
           frequency. She adjusts it on her head. Leans back. 

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Hey. Don’t let him get to you.

                                 DELANEY
                        Never do.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Who cares what he thinks. Get shot 
                        all you want, not like it matters. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx?

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Oh. Right. Initiating uplink... 
                        now.

           Delaney closes her eyes. And when she opens them:

           INT. RACQUETBALL COURT - DAY 

           [Again, that hyper-saturated color palette, which we will 
           learn is the hallmark of a virtual world.]

           Delaney is now clad in workout gear with her own racquetball 
           racket. She KNOCKS on the glass door of Mason’s court and 
           lets herself in. 

                                 MASON
                        Almost thought you stood me up.  
                                 DELANEY
                        And miss the chance to kick your 
                        ass? Never. 

           Mason just grins. In this virtual world, his hair is trimmed, 
           his face clean-shaven, and his eyes simultaneously piercing 
           and playful. 

                                 MASON
                        We’ll see. I’ve been practicing. 

           Mason serves and Delaney rebounds expertly. They volley back 
           and forth, and what starts as a casual warm-up quickly 
           escalates into a fierce competition.

           But in between the grunts and shouts of game play, Delaney 
           makes an effort to insert some conversation. As she SLAMS the 
           ball into the front wall:

                                 DELANEY
                        How’s the job?

           Mason RETURNS with ease, sending her diving into the corner 
           for her next shot:

                                 MASON
                        Soul-sucking as ever. Same old 
                        routine. 
                             (as Delaney rebounds)
                        Nice! You?

           SLAM! Mason returns. SLAM! Delaney counters.

                                 DELANEY
                        Good days and bad, I guess.

                                 MASON
                        And today?

           SLAM! Delaney swings with all she’s got. The ball RICOCHETS 
           off the wall and PELTS Mason in the thigh. Point, Delaney.

                                 DELANEY
                             (grins)
                        Shaping up to be a good one. 3-1. 

           She readies her next serve...

           INT. GYM SMOOTHIE BAR - LATER

           Gym patrons clad in their skimpiest summer workout gear 
           sample the monthly special -- “AUGUST BERRY BASIL BLAST”.
           Dripping sweat, Delaney and Mason share a booth and a couple 
           of post-workout smoothies. There’s a casual ease between 
           them. Closeness. Chemistry.

                                 DELANEY
                        So... no homicidal fits of rage?

           She’s kidding. Mostly.

                                 MASON
                        You mean besides when you kick my 
                        ass at racquetball? 

                                 DELANEY
                        I gave you fair warning.

           Mason sips, contemplating:

                                 MASON
                        No, you know. Life is good. Not 
                        exciting or glamorous, really... 
                        But I’m happy, I’m healthy. Another 
                        year or two, I think I’ll make 
                        Executive. Do you ever get that 
                        feeling sometimes, where you just 
                        know you’re on the right path?

           Delaney smiles, but it’s a little wistful. Bittersweet. If 
           this guy only knew what path he was really on...

                                 DELANEY
                        Yeah, totally. I get it.
                             (back to business)
                        How about the ladies? Anyone 
                        special yet? 

           Mason shrugs, suddenly shy. 

                                 MASON
                        Um. What? 

                                 DELANEY
                        I seem to recall a little blond 
                        number, started at your firm a few 
                        months ago? Katie... Kathy...

                                 MASON
                        Kelly? The receptionist? I told you 
                        about her? Um. I dunno. I guess 
                        she’s cute, I just haven’t 
                        really...

           Wait, is he blushing?
                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to talk about this.

                                 DELANEY
                        Come on... Why not?

           Yep. Definitely blushing.

                                 MASON
                        Because. You and me, we’ve known 
                        each other, what? Forever? I dunno. 
                        It’s just too... weird.

                                 DELANEY
                        Talking to your best friend is 
                        weird.

                                 MASON
                        About this, yeah. I don’t know. Can 
                        we just drop it? Please?

           And suddenly -- it’s awkward. There’s a thick sexual tension 
           that didn’t exist a moment ago. 

           Mason COUGHS. Delaney SHIFTS UNCOMFORTABLY in her seat. The 
           silence hangs over them...

                                 DELANEY
                        Well. Girls aside. I’m glad you’re 
                        happy. You deserve it. 
                             (off his look)
                        I mean it. Mason. You’re a good 
                        guy. Which, believe me, is 
                        something I so rarely see anymore. 

           Now it’s Mason’s turn to shift uncomfortably. 

                                 MASON
                        Thanks. I guess. 
                             (gets up)
                        I’m gonna grab a water for the 
                        road. You want one--?

           Suddenly -- 

           The overhead lights BLINK, FLICKER, and GO OUT. But it’s not 
           just the lights. For a brief moment, in the darkness, it’s as 
           if everything DISAPPEARS -- the booth, the walls, the other 
           gym patrons. 

           As if Mason and Delaney are standing in a VOID.

           Only for a moment. Then the lights FLICKER on, and 
           everything’s as it should be.
                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        What the... Did you? Did you see 
                        that? 

           Delaney springs up out of her seat. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I have to go. I’m sorry.  

                                 MASON
                        That was... Jesus. What was that? 

           But Delaney’s already out the door. And as soon as she gets 
           away, she touches the BLANK FACE of her wristwatch. The face 
           LIGHTS UP and -- within moments -- Delaney is...

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           [And again, the color palette here is diffused and washed 
           out, a trademark of the real world. Damn, it’s depressing.]

           ...opening her eyes back in the White Room. To find BO 
           standing over her, watching Mason’s plasma screen and 
           SCOWLING. But Delaney has other things on her mind --

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx?! What the hell was that?!

                                 BO
                        Just what I was wondering.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        I know, I know... I don’t know.

           Delaney tears off her headband and storms out of the White 
           Room with Bo on her heels. 

           INT. HALLWAY

                                 BO
                        “Anyone special in your life?”

                                 DELANEY
                        You’re observing me now? 

           Delaney SLAMS into:

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM 

           Where Jinx is on the FLOOR under her desk, FLASHLIGHT in one 
           hand, studying the complex network of circuits and wires. 
                                 DELANEY
                        Well?

                                 JINX
                        Short circuit... blown fuse... 
                        faulty receptor... Should I keep 
                        going? ‘Cause all I have right now 
                        is a laundry list of possibilities. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Do you have any idea how much 
                        irreparable damage this could cause 
                        to his psyche?

                                 JINX
                        It’s fucking Roger. Like I can’t 
                        tell he just downloads porn all 
                        night. Every morning I come in, 
                        it’s the same -- no bandwidth, 
                        memory for shit, and a sticky 
                        keyboard.

                                 BO
                        Mentioning the vic by name? You 
                        trying to bait him or something?

           On the touch-screen table, Delaney calls up Mason’s file. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I don’t have to answer to you.

                                 BO
                        Well you damn sure need to answer 
                        to somebody!

           As before, we see Mason’s mug shot, police documents, and 
           crime scene photos -- the battered body of a once-cute 
           “little blonde number”:  KELLY CONNORS. 

           Delaney WHEELS on Bo:

                                 DELANEY
                        Twenty-four hours. That’s how far 
                        away Mason is from completing his 
                        fifth cycle. And his supposed 
                        “murder victim”? Barely on his 
                        radar. He’s happy, healthy, well-
                        adjusted. Just like every other 
                        time. The whole time I’ve been 
                        working with him, he rarely even 
                        breaks the speed limit. He’s not a 
                        violent criminal. He’s a regular 
                        guy, just like you. 
           A few taps of his fingertips and Bo enlarges a photo of Kelly 
           Connors’s battered body. 

                                 BO
                        Yeah? A regular man do something 
                        like this?

                                 DELANEY
                        He pleaded “not guilty” during his 
                        trial. Maybe he’s innocent. 
                             (before Bo can counter)
                        And even if he’s not -- he’s been a 
                        model citizen from day one. If 
                        anyone deserves a sentence 
                        reduction, it’s him.

                                 BO
                        And you’re gonna say as much to the 
                        Board tomorrow?

                                 DELANEY
                        That’s right. 

                                 BO
                        Because he’s such an upstanding 
                        guy. And not at all because you 
                        can’t wait to see your “best 
                        friend” on the outside.

           Delaney’s eyes seethe into Bo’s.

                                 DELANEY
                        There’s a line. That you are very 
                        close to crossing. 

           They simmer and glare. Neither one backing down. ‘Til Jinx 
           pipes up:

                                 JINX
                        Um. Everything’s intact on this 
                        end. I’ll check the White Room. And 
                        all the wiring in between. Isolate 
                        the focal point. Give me three 
                        hours, maybe four, it’ll be like 
                        this never happened. 

           Delaney looks away first. Gathers her things. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You’ll call me if there’s a 
                        problem?
                                 JINX
                        So you can lend your valuable 
                        expertise? 
                             (off her look)
                        Sure. Whatever. 

           Delaney heads for the door, but not before Bo can get in one 
           last jab:

                                 BO
                        It’s not that I don’t care, ya 
                        know. It’s that you care too much.

           INT. DELANEY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Delaney pulls up to the driveway of a modest colonial-style 
           townhouse. She tries to pull INTO the driveway, but there are 
           already TWO CARS taking up space.

                                 DELANEY
                             (remembering)
                        Ohhh... shit.

           She reverses and parallel parks by the curb. Leans her head 
           back against the headrest. Knows she’s in trouble. Sighs.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Delaney walks in with a big SMILE plastered to her face.

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m so sorry--

           SHEILA and TOM, couple-friends, jump up from their seats in 
           the living room to hug her.

                                 TOM
                        Hey! She made it!

                                 SHEILA
                        We brought this amazing smoked 
                        Gouda. You have to try it.

           Delaney spies a platter on the coffee table -- cheese and 
           crackers, most of them gone. She is very, very late. 

           As if she didn’t feel bad enough, here comes PAUL with a sour 
           grimace to rub it in. He leans in, feinting to kiss her 
           cheek, but really HISSING into her ear:
                                 PAUL
                        The wine?

           Shit. Another thing to feel sorry for. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Great.

           He turns to Sheila and Tom. The fake smile of a dinner host.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Well. Let’s break out the bubbly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Dark soda BUBBLES AND FIZZES into an elegant glass. 

           We’re in:

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Delaney, Paul, Sheila, and Tom sit around the dinner table. A 
           lavish meal spread out in front of them. Refilling their 
           glasses with soda because Delaney forgot the wine.

                                 DELANEY
                        --and the technology is just 
                        amazing. A single implanted chip 
                        that uses everything from 
                        interactive mapping software to 
                        real-time web-interfacing to the 
                        convict’s own personal memories to 
                        create a fully-functioning 
                        replication of the world as we know 
                        it. It’s... incredible.

                                 TOM
                        So. What’s the sickest shit you’ve 
                        ever seen?

                                 SHEILA
                        Tom!

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s really not like that. 

                                 SHEILA
                        “Criminals. They’re just like us.”

                                 DELANEY
                        They are. That’s what so many 
                        people don’t understand. 
                                 SHEILA
                        Reliving the exact same crimes over 
                        and over again? 
                             (shudders)
                        I can’t even stand reruns on TV.

                                 DELANEY
                        Well. They don’t. Not if we’re 
                        doing our job. A lot of these guys -
                        - and women -- it all comes down to 
                        a couple of mistakes. A few bad 
                        decisions. If we can help them see 
                        that, we can help them change.

                                 PAUL
                        Delaney’s their voice of reason, if 
                        you can believe that. 

           Sheila and Tom share a glance. There’s some obvious tension 
           at this table. So Tom goes for the joke:

                                 TOM
                        I dunno. You ask me, half the fear 
                        of getting locked up was the ass 
                        rape.

           But Delaney’s on a roll now; there’s no stopping her:

                                 DELANEY
                        The simple fact is, the old system 
                        didn’t work. SomaCell is less 
                        expensive, more humane, and more 
                        effective as a tool of 
                        rehabilitation. When they look back 
                        on us in the history books, it’ll 
                        be like emerging from the Dark Ages 
                        into the Renaissance.

           Delaney just realizes she’s given an impromptu impassioned 
           speech. No one is really sure how to respond. 

           Sheila tentatively raises her glass.

                                 SHEILA
                        Well. Here’s to the Renaissance.

           They all raise their glasses of soda. Paul shoots Delaney a 
           look across the table.

                                 DELANEY
                        And speaking of books... Paul’s 
                        starting his next novel.
           Sheila and Tom pounce on the new topic. With the conversation 
           turned in his favor, Paul sports the first genuine smile 
           we’ve seen all night.

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - DINING ROOM - LATER

           The guests are long gone, the remnants of dinner pushed to 
           one side of the table. Delaney has documents spread out in an 
           arc around her. Looks like she’s in for a long night. 

           A robe-clad Paul saunters in, starts clearing away dishes.

                                 DELANEY
                        No, leave it. You worked so hard. 
                        I’ll clean up. 

                                 PAUL
                        You’re not coming to bed? 

           Shuffling papers:

                                 DELANEY
                        Got the Parole Board tomorrow. I 
                        want to make sure I’m prepared, 
                        but... something’s missing.

           Paul comes over, rubs her shoulders.

                                 PAUL
                        Mmm. I’ve been saying that for 
                        months.

                                 DELANEY
                        An intake form. It has to be in 
                        here somewhere... This guy has a 
                        real shot, though. The cleanest 
                        record I’ve ever seen. His whole 
                        cycle reads like one giant 
                        breakthrough. It could be you in 
                        there, you know?

           That’s a loaded statement. Paul notes a photo in one of the 
           documents -- Mason. Attractive guy. He bends down, nuzzles 
           her neck.

                                 PAUL
                        Lucky for you, I’m right here.

           Delaney leans into him, and soon they’re kissing. Paul moves 
           his hands over her shoulders, down the front of her blouse, 
           but when his fingers find that top button --

           Delaney pulls back. 
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 DELANEY
                        I really should... I mean there’s 
                        just so much to go over. And I have 
                        to find this form.

           Paul stiffens. Even as a writer, he’s not a man who takes 
           rejection well.

                                 PAUL
                        Right. Let’s avoid the real issue 
                        instead. Classic Delaney.

                                 DELANEY
                        Paul...

                                 PAUL
                        You know what I was thinking, when 
                        I was standing in line at the 
                        grocery store this afternoon, 
                        buying everything for this dinner 
                        you forgot? Maybe I should come 
                        back here with a gun. Empty out all 
                        the registers. Shoot up the aisles. 
                        Maybe that might actually get your 
                        attention. 

           Paul storms off.

                                 DELANEY
                        Paul!

           A door SLAMS deeper within the house. 

           Delaney sighs. She could go after him. But she goes back to 
           studying her documents instead.

           We hold on Mason’s photo... could that really be the face of 
           a killer?

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Delaney walks in, dressed in her best SUIT, carrying the 
           stack of files she was poring over the night before. 

           Jinx is still wearing her clothes from the night before. Hair 
           a mess, eyes bleary. She smirks at Delaney’s polished outfit.

                                 JINX
                        Big day. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Wait... did you go home last night? 
                                 JINX
                        Glitch took longer than I thought. 
                        Crafty fucker. Was a systems 
                        router, totally shat itself. Easy 
                        enough fix once I found it. But 
                        yeah. I’ve basically been crawling 
                        around inside our circuit panels 
                        all night. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Jesus. You need coffee?

                                 JINX
                        Way past coffee at this point. Got 
                        any human adrenal gland?

                                 BO (O.S.)
                        How ‘bout donuts?

           Bo walks in carrying a baker’s dozen. And -- what’s that? A 
           smile? He flops the box on the table with a flourish while 
           Delaney and Jinx gape.

                                 JINX
                        This is... new. 

                                 BO
                        Consider this a mea culpa. For 
                        yesterday. 
                             (to Delaney)
                        Lemme make it up to you. We’ll go 
                        to a bar. Have a few laughs, a few 
                        beers. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You hate bars.

                                 JINX
                        And laughter.

                                 BO
                        But I like beers. Seriously, I feel 
                        like an asshole.

           Delaney grabs a BEAR CLAW from the box, rips into it. 

                                 DELANEY
                             (mouth full)
                        You’re forgiven. Give me 10 minutes 
                        of quiet time and you’re a saint. 

           She sits down with her file folder, desperately scanning 
           every piece of information one last time. 
           Bo gazes at her -- something in between sympathy and sadness.

                                 BO
                        Ya know, no matter what happens, 
                        you’re a damn fine Specialist. 
                        You’re doing the best you can. 

           But Delaney just keeps scanning.

                                 DELANEY
                        Your one shot at sainthood and it’s 
                        slipping away...

                                 BO
                        Alright, alright. I know how to 
                        shut my mouth.

           Bo grabs two donuts and shoves both into his mouth at once.

                                 JINX
                        Gross... but effective. 

           Delaney’s focus zooms in on the documents, closer and 
           closer... 

           And when we finally ZOOM OUT, we see she’s --

           INT. HALLWAY 

           Walking and reading. Using every last second. She pushes open 
           the door to...

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           ...and strides over to Mason’s bed. She pulls over the 
           rolling chair, straps on the HEADBAND. 

           But she’s not ready yet. She frantically flips through the 
           last few pages, trying to absorb it all --

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Guaranteed you’ve memorized it. 
                        Come on. You’re gonna be late. 

           But Delaney can’t put it down yet...

                                 JINX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        DeLAAA(ney)--

                                 DELANEY
                        Okay, okay.
           Delaney puts the file down. Leans back in her chair.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Initiating uplink...

           Delaney closes her eyes. And when she opens them, she’s in:

           INT. BOARDROOM - DAY [SATURATED]

           A simple, austere room. Two folding chairs placed before a 
           table. Three bigger, more expensive chairs behind the table. 

           And Mason pacing frantically. When he sees Delaney, his face 
           is torn between panic and relief.

                                 MASON
                        I don’t know what happened. I woke 
                        up, used the bathroom. Got a 
                        shower. And when I walked out into 
                        my living room, it wasn’t my living 
                        room. It was... this. I mean... I’m 
                        dreaming, right? I must be. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I know this must be very confusing 
                        for you. 

                                 MASON
                        I tried to go back, but the doors. 
                        None of the doors work. 

           Mason laughs. It’s short and unnatural. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Mason. Do you trust me?

           Mason looks at her. Grasping for any life raft to cling to. 

                                 MASON
                        You’re my best friend.

                                 DELANEY
                        Then I want you to listen to me. 
                        Let’s have a seat. And no matter 
                        what happens over the next few 
                        minutes, the best thing you can do 
                        is just keep sitting quietly. Okay?

                                 MASON
                        Are you kidding? Is this a joke?

           Delaney takes a seat in a folding chair. Mason paces around, 
           then gives up. He takes a seat next to her. Jittery. Antsy.
           Suddenly, the DOORS OPEN and three PEOPLE walk in. Two men 
           and a woman. All as somber and severe as this room.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Who are they? I swear those doors 
                        didn’t work a minute ago.
                             (louder, to the SomaCell 
                              Reps)
                        Who are you?

           They ignore him. They take their seats behind the table, the 
           men on either side of the woman. Both men wear pins their 
           suit lapels bearing the SOMACELL SYMBOL.

           They unlock briefcases. Open files. Check documents. 

                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #1
                        This is the fifth cycle review of 
                        Convict N319 Mason Grant, 
                        incarcerated June 5, 2015 for the 
                        murder of Kelly Connors. 
                             (a nod to the woman)
                        The Honorable Judge Wilcox 
                        presiding. 

                                 MASON
                        What?!

           The woman behind the table, Judge Wilcox, nods at Delaney. 

                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        How long have you overseen him? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Almost four months, Your Honor. 
                        Five cycles, approximately three 
                        weeks in duration. And he’s 
                        achieved a breakthrough each time.

                                 MASON
                        I’m not a murderer! I didn’t kill 
                        anyone! What is going on here?!

                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        And how would you describe Mr. 
                        Grant’s behavior during this most 
                        recent?

                                 DELANEY
                        Exemplary. No displays of violence 
                        or excessive agitation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DELANEY (CONT'D)
                        He has broken no laws, committed no 
                        crimes, initiates minimal contact 
                        with Miss Connors, and has 
                        displayed the behavior of a model 
                        citizen in all aspects of his life.

           Mason looks at her. As if seeing her for the first time.

                                 MASON
                        Delaney? 

                                 DELANEY
                             (deep breath; she’s 
                              prepared a speech)
                        Given the fact that Mr. Grant has 
                        no previous criminal record, and 
                        the circumstantial nature of the 
                        charges that were brought against 
                        him, it’s my recommendation that-- 

           The two SomaCell Representatives lean across the table with 
           one another to confer. One Representative slides a document 
           over to the Judge. She reads it and frowns.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        It is my recommendation that we 
                        implement a standard sentence 
                        reduction of six months, and 
                        reevaluate the terms of--

                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #1
                        Thank you, Mrs. Thomas. We’ve heard 
                        enough.

           Mason’s eyes WIDEN at the mention of “Mrs. Thomas”. But 
           Delaney won’t be deterred. 

                SOMA-CELL REPRESENTATIVE #2
                                                         DELANEY
           That will be all, Mrs. 
           Thomas.
                                              --of rehabilitation upon 
                                              completion of his next cycle!

                                 DELANEY
                        Excuse me! As Mr. Grant’s 
                        Specialist, I thought my opinion 
                        might be of some use in this 
                        hearing! I’m prepared to cite 
                        examples of his proven ability to 
                        function and thrive within 
                        society...

           Judge Wilcox smiles -- it may or may not be genuine. 
                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        Counselor. We appreciate our 
                        Specialists’ opinions a great deal. 
                        Your insight into this case has 
                        been extremely valuable in helping 
                        shape our decision. 

                                 DELANEY
                        But--

                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        Please allow us a moment to confer.

           Delaney relents. A sinking feeling growing...

           As Judge Wilcox and the two SomaCell Representatives talk 
           amongst themselves, Mason leans over to her:  

                                 MASON
                        You’re married??

           The Reps and the Judge finally separate. 

                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        With a violent crime of this 
                        nature, four months seems an 
                        insufficient period for effective 
                        evaluation. Your dedication is to 
                        be commended, Counselor. Let’s 
                        reevaluate after Cycle 10. 

                                 DELANEY
                        What?

                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #1
                        After a thorough deliberation, we 
                        have determined that Convict N319 
                        Mason Grant, incarcerated June 5, 
                        2015 for the murder of Kelly 
                        Connors, will continue to serve an 
                        unaltered sentence of life in 
                        prison--

           Delaney LEAPS out of her chair.

                                 DELANEY
                        No--

                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #1
                        --and reboot for Cycle Six 
                        effective immediately.

           As the Judge and the Reps get up to leave, Delaney becomes 
           frantic.
                                 DELANEY
                        I’d like to appeal--

                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #2
                        Denied.

                                 DELANEY
                        I can prove to you--

                                 JUDGE WILCOX
                        Thank you, Counselor.

           And they disappear through the doors. Leaving Mason 
           absolutely terrified.

                                 MASON
                        Delaney... What’s going to happen 
                        to me?

           Delaney begins to SHOUT, as if to the air around her:

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx!! Wait! Just a minute!

                                 MASON
                        I didn’t do anything. I didn’t kill 
                        anyone. I would never... you know I 
                        wouldn’t. You know me!

                                 DELANEY
                        I know. Just... listen--

                                 MASON
                        Help me. I’m innocent, I swear. 
                        Please...

           Delaney just HUGS him. Hard. Because it’s all she can do. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You’re going to be okay. I promise. 

           But suddenly there’s a

           FLASH OF WHITE

           And Delaney finds herself in:

           INT. GYM SMOOTHIE BAR 

           They were just here yesterday, but something’s different. The 
           big sign advertises:  “4TH OF JULY SPECIAL -- STAR-SPANGLED 
           STRAWBERRY!”
           That’s because it isn’t “yesterday” -- it’s 3 weeks in the 
           past. The start of Mason’s next CYCLE.

           Mason walks past, then stops -- does a double-take and smiles 
           wide when he recognizes her. 

                                 MASON
                        Delaney Thomas? No way!

           Mason is utterly relaxed. Casual. No trace of fear or 
           confusion on his face -- because he doesn’t remember. 

           His memory, like the setting, is back to square one. As if 
           nothing ever happened. 

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Mason. Grant. God, how long has it 
                        been? You go here? 

                                 DELANEY
                        I... yeah. Small world. 

                                 MASON
                        Oh, man. Wow. I actually have to 
                        go. We’ve got a new receptionist 
                        starting today, I drew the short 
                        straw for orientation, it’s a whole 
                        totally unexciting thing I can’t 
                        believe I’m babbling about. But can 
                        we get lunch? I would love to 
                        just... catch up. Hey. You okay?

           In a word? No. Shocked, wrecked, angry, frustrated. 
           Definitely not okay. She tries to smile through it, but it’s 
           all just too much.  

                                 DELANEY
                        Oh. Yeah, I’m... lunch would be 
                        great.

                                 MASON
                        Still the same number, right? Hey, 
                        they’ve got a great racquetball 
                        court here. You play? 

                                 DELANEY
                        A bit.

                                 MASON
                        We’ve gotta play. I have to -- but, 
                        wow. Really great seeing you. I 
                        mean it. What are the odds, huh?
           As soon as Mason leaves Delaney HEAVES a deep breath. She 
           touches the blank face of her watch. Can’t get out of here 
           fast enough. 

           INT. WHITE ROOM [DIFFUSED]

           Delaney opens her eyes. Blinking away tears. Her expression 
           hardens.

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           As soon as she enters, she can see it written all over Jinx 
           and Bo’s faces:  pity.

                                 BO
                        Hey, you did everything--

                                 DELANEY
                        Who’s next? 

                                 JINX
                        I mean, they were total assholes--

                                 DELANEY
                        On the list, who’s up?

           Delaney’s expression is clear:  drop it.

                                 JINX
                        Umm. You can check in on Pike? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Let’s do it. He ready now? 

                                 JINX
                        Yeah, I guess, if--

           Delaney storms out.

                                 JINX (CONT’D)
                        --you are.

           Jinx and Bo share a look.

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           Delaney takes a seat, straps in. All business.

                                 DELANEY
                        Need a pit stop before I make 
                        contact.
                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Where to?

                                 DELANEY
                        Toy store.

           A pause.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Umm--

                                 DELANEY
                        Whenever you’re ready.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        You’re the boss. Initiating 
                        uplink... now.

           Her eyes close, and when they open again she’s:

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY [SATURATED]

           A low-rent home in a low-rent neighborhood. Bars on the 
           windows. Paint peeling off the walls. A beat-up car on cinder 
           blocks in the driveway. And a detached SHED in the back.

           Delaney, PACKAGE in hand, heads around to the back of the 
           house toward the dilapidated storage unit. 

           When she gets close, we can see thousands of tiny SPIKES 
           poking out of the shed walls at uneven intervals. Nails, 
           hammered into the wood from the inside.

           Delaney knocks twice, then enters--

           INT. SHED

           --to find Pike, HAMMER in hand, pounding nails into an old 
           car tire. THUNK. THUNK. THUNK.

           Everything in this shed -- tables, chairs, walls, floor and 
           ceiling -- has been riddled with nails. He’s taken OCD to a 
           whole new level. 

           THUNK. THUNK. THUNK. Pike works slowly, methodically, as if 
           in a trance. This is his zen. 

           He doesn’t even look up when Delaney enters.

                                 PIKE
                        How’s the arm?
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           An overhead light FLICKERS and BUZZES.

                                 DELANEY
                        Why? Got a guilty conscience?

           Pike doesn’t answer. He only looks up when Delaney sets her 
           PACKAGE on a nail-studded table.

                                 PIKE
                        What’s that?

                                 DELANEY
                        Open it and find out. 

           Pike gets up. But he doesn’t go for the package. Instead, he 
           steps to her. Invading her space. Trying to intimidate her.

           But Delaney doesn’t waver.

           Finally, Pike smiles. Backs off.

                                 PIKE
                        Long as I’ve known you, you never 
                        been afraid a’ me. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Maybe one of these days you’ll stop 
                        trying to change that.

                                 PIKE
                        Maybe. 

           Now Pike goes for the package. Opens it. And frowns.

                                 PIKE (CONT’D)
                        The fuck is this?

                                 DELANEY
                        Call it an experiment. 

           Pike pulls off the wrapping to reveal:  

           A PLASTIC HAMMER. A harmless child’s toy.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        You ever see those fake plastic 
                        cigarettes that are supposed to 
                        help people quit smoking? 

                                 PIKE
                        You want me to smoke this?
                                 DELANEY
                        I want you to use it. Only when 
                        you’re out in public. Leave the 
                        real one at home and try this 
                        instead.

                                 PIKE
                        You want me to go out and walk 
                        around in public with a Playskool 
                        toy?

           Once again, the overhead light FLICKERS and BUZZES. For a 
           moment, everything in the back of the shed

           DISAPPEARS 

           into a DARK VOID.

           Delaney’s eyes narrow. The glitch is back.

                                 DELANEY
                             (mutters)
                        Shit. 

                                 PIKE
                        Are you outta your mind? 

                                 DELANEY
                        I have to go. I’m sorry. Just think 
                        about it. You owe me.

           She makes her way out of the shed as fast as she can--

                                 PIKE (O.S.)
                        The fuck I do--

           --and goes for her watch. Hoping she’s not too late.

           But as it lights up with that BLUE GLOW: 

           Objects around her FLICKER and DISAPPEAR -- a parked car, a 
           tree, a house -- just like they did during the glitch 
           yesterday.

           The world around her starts to SPIN. Delaney staggers. 
           Nauseous and woozy. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx...?

           HER VISION BLURS OUT OF FOCUS. 
           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           From Delaney’s POV: 

           At first, everything is WHITE. Then shapes begin to 
           materialize, blurry silhouettes:  

           Her feet. A metal bed frame. She must be lying in bed. 

           And someone is standing at the foot of the bed. Pacing 
           frantically. It’s all very blurry, but it looks like

           BO.

           And he’s saying something -- red-faced and yelling -- but his 
           words are muffled and garbled, as if she’s listening to a 
           conversation underwater:

                                 BO
                             (distorted)
                        Whaddayou mean you don’t know?!

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                             (distorted)
                        ...I’m trying...

           Delaney tries to sit up, but something restrains her. She 
           turns to her side to see:

           HER WRIST IS HANDCUFFED TO THE BED FRAME. What the fuck??

           Bo notices her movement. Sees she’s awake.

                                 BO
                             (distorted)
                        Oh shit--

           But then the room starts SPINNING again. Her vision BLURS 
           once more. And the next time Delaney opens her eyes, she’s:

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY [DIFFUSED]

           Sitting in her swivel chair next to Mason’s bed. Exactly 
           where she’s supposed to be. 

           Except that Bo is hovering over her. A concerned mother hen. 

                                 BO
                        Hey. Delaney? 

           Delaney yanks off her METALLIC HEADBAND, turns, and 

           VOMITS 
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           onto the floor.

           Jinx comes CHARGING into the room. No trace of smirk on her 
           face. Only genuine fear.

                                 JINX
                        She’s out? You’re out. Oh my god. 
                        I’m so sorry.

           Delaney looks around. All the convicts sleeping in their 
           beds. Everything just as she left it. Normal.

                                 DELANEY
                        What... happened?

                                 JINX
                        I thought I fixed it. I swear I 
                        fixed it. I thought it was just the 
                        router, but it must have--

                                 DELANEY
                        The glitch?

                                 BO
                        How bout we get you some water. Lie 
                        down for a few minutes.

           Delaney rubs her wrists. Can’t shake the feel of those cuffs.

                                 DELANEY
                        I thought I was...

           But she doesn’t like the way Bo and Jinx are looking at her. 
           Nervous. Scrutinizing.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        ...nothing. Nowhere. I didn’t know. 
                        Like a void.

                                 BO
                        Damn mind machines. Wrong switch 
                        gets flipped, suddenly you’re on 
                        Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride. Least you 
                        know it was all in your head.

           Delaney looks around. Everything as it was before. Everything 
           as it should be.

                                 DELANEY
                        ...Right. Back to reality. 

           But though she tries to shake it off, that small seed of 
           UNCERTAINTY has been planted. A FEAR that the world as she 
           knows it could be all in her head. 
           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - LATER

           Delaney lays on a sofa with a cold compress over her face. 
           Jinx enters quietly, trying not to disturb her.

                                 DELANEY
                        You don’t have to tip-toe around 
                        me. I’m fine.

                                 JINX
                        What? This is how I walk.
                             (no bullshit)
                        I just... I’m not used to fucking 
                        up, okay?

                                 DELANEY
                        Everyone makes mistakes.

                                 JINX
                        Not when they’re in charge of other 
                        people’s brain waves. You sure 
                        you’re...?

                                 DELANEY
                        Stop. Asking.

                                 JINX
                        Okay, but. You should really go 
                        home. I’ve killed all the uplinks 
                        ‘til Tech gets here. Called Roger 
                        in, too. You know what that does to 
                        me.

                                 DELANEY
                        No problem. Just have to observe 
                        and report the old fashioned way.

                                 JINX
                        Yeah? What’s that?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Delaney and Bo sit back to back in their rolling chairs in 
           the middle of the room, eyes fixed on the MONITORS of their 
           respective convicts, jotting notes on the tablets in their 
           laps. Literally -- observe and report.

                                 BO
                        Gives a whole new meaning to 
                        reality tv.
           The monitor Bo is watching belongs to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. 
           Onscreen, she’s working a checkout line at a grocery store. 
           She opens the cash drawer to deposit some bills and hand a 
           customer their change. 

           But when she shuts the drawer, she leaves it the SLIGHTEST 
           BIT OPEN. Perfect for pilfering later. She SMILES up at the 
           next customer.

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        Come on, Yolanda...

           Suddenly, onscreen, the STORE MANAGER walks by. Without 
           missing a beat, Yolanda BUMPS the drawer with her hip, 
           snapping it all the way shut.

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        Unbelievable. 

           Delaney is watching PIKE’s monitor. On it, he’s nursing a 
           drink at a bar. His free hand wrapped around the toy plastic 
           hammer. Delaney smiles. Progress. 

                                 DELANEY
                        What?

                                 BO
                        She’s about to swipe the till. Then 
                        boss man comes around, she aborts 
                        the plan.

                                 DELANEY
                        And that’s a bad thing because...

                                 BO
                        Come on, you preach this to me all 
                        the time. It’s not just the action 
                        that counts-- 

                                 DELANEY
                        --it’s the motivation. 

                                 BO
                        Exactly. Only reason she’s not 
                        hands-deep in that register is she 
                        doesn’t want to get caught. Got 
                        nothing to do with her sense of 
                        right and wrong. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Oh ye of little (faith) -- are you 
                        fucking kidding me?!
           Onscreen, a BARFLY cracks a joke about Pike’s hammer. Pike 
           responds by SLAMMING him into the bar and SHOVING the hammer 
           down his throat. So much for progress. 

           Delaney THROWS her tablet, startling Bo. Angry doesn’t begin 
           to cover it.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Why do we bother? Why do we bend 
                        over backwards to help them when 
                        they won’t even help themselves?

           Bo’s not used to seeing her like this. He goes for the old 
           standby, a joke:

                                 BO
                        Hey. It’s job security.

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s impossible, is what it is.

                                 BO
                        Not impossible. Exhausting maybe. 
                        Frustrating for damn sure. But 
                        every now and then you get that one 
                        percent. Like Mason. That makes it 
                        worth it. You taught me that. 

                                 DELANEY
                        And even then, look where it gets 
                        you.

                                 BO
                        Yeah, I heard about that. Tough 
                        break with the board. But hey, I 
                        don’t pretend to know the ins and 
                        outs of what the big guys upstairs 
                        do, and neither should you. Guy’s 
                        as good as you say he is, he’ll get 
                        his due. 

           Delaney looks at him... remembering something. Gets up. 

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DELANEY
                        Back in a minute. Twenty bucks says 
                        mine commits a misdemeanor before 
                        yours.

                                 BO
                        You obviously don’t know Yolanda.
           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Delaney finds Jinx relegated to the outside of her panel set 
           up while a few TECH SUPPORT GUYS tinker with the controls. 
           ROGER (20s), the skinny, slimy night-shift tech, hovers 
           nearby, “supervising”. 

           Delaney motions her over, and she’s happy to comply.

                                 JINX
                        Fucking Roger. He actually asked me 
                        if I tried “turning it off and 
                        turning it back on again.” 
                        Douchetard.

                                 DELANEY
                        Got something you can help me with 
                        in the meantime.

           Jinx perks up. Hates being at loose ends as much as Delaney.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        When I was going through Mason 
                        Grant’s files last night, I was 
                        missing one report. His official 
                        statement, whatever he gave to the 
                        police when he was arrested. 
                        Nowhere to be found.

           Jinx calls up the network on the touchscreen table surface. 
           Her fingers fly as she quickly opens a series of subfolders 
           and scans through titles.

                                 JINX
                        Huh.

           She tries a new approach -- opens a dialogue box and searches 
           using a series of command codes.

                                 DELANEY
                        Should be an addendum to the intake 
                        form. He pleaded innocent; I’m sure 
                        it’s lengthy.

           Jinx types a series in computer code. GRUNTS.

                                 JINX
                        You’re right. There’s nothing in 
                        his file. You check The Stacks? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Not yet.
                                 JINX
                        It’s The Stacks or submitting an 
                        official request to corporate. I’d 
                        pick the option with the least 
                        number of rats.

           INT. THE STACKS - DAY

           A dark and dusty room in the bowels of the SomaCell facility -
           - what you’d expect of a storage closet. In the digital age, 
           this is where the dinosaurs go to die.

           Delaney turns on an overhead light, illuminating:

           Rows and rows of FILING CABINETS, drawers arranged in 
           alphabetical order. Each one corresponding to a convict 
           currently or previously incarcerated in this SomaCell 
           facility. 

           Delaney goes to the “G” section, pulls open the drawer -- 
           sending a DUST CLOUD wafting up -- and searches through ‘til 
           she finds the file -- “Grant, M.” 

           She flips through the pages. Finds the intake form. One 
           phrase jumps out at her:  ...see attached...

           Twin puncture wounds dot the top corner where a staple used 
           to be. But...

           No document is attached. 

           She flips through more pages. Maybe they got separated 
           somehow. But when she gets to the end... nothing. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Dammit.

           She returns the file to its drawer. Which is when: 

           The overhead light begins to FLICKER. 

           Delaney freezes. Watches as the light sputters and struggles. 
           Unnervingly similar to what happened during the glitch.

           Is this just a faulty light, suffering from lack of use? Or 
           could it be something more? A sign that the world around her 
           isn’t what she thinks?

           She’s instantly overcome with a terrifying thought. 

           Slowly, dreading every step, she moves further down the row 
           of cabinets:  H... I... J... all the way to:
           T.

           She opens the drawer. Her fingers trace over the folders as 
           she scans the names printed on the dividers: 

           “Terry, W.”

           “Thatcher, S.”

           “Thirwell, J.” 

           Then... no. It can’t be.

           “Thomas, D.”

           Oh shit oh shit oh shit. Delaney’s breath HITCHES in her 
           chest. She hadn’t realized she was holding it. 

           She slides out the file. Her fingers trembling. Flips it open 
           to see:

           “Dwayne Thomas. E012.” And a mug shot of some stringy-haired 
           hillbilly.

           Not her.

           Delaney slumps against the shelf. Weak with relief. Until:

                                 BO (O.S.)
                        I can take a hint, ya know.

           Delaney quickly returns the disc to its place on the shelf. 
           Feeling foolish as Bo saunters in.

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        The pleasure of my company’s worn 
                        thin, all you gotta do is say so. 
                        Don’t have to hide out. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I was just... Mason Grant’s 
                        official statement is missing from 
                        his file. Electronic, hard copy, 
                        everything. 

                                 BO
                        You still on this, huh?

                                 DELANEY
                        I want to hear his side of the 
                        story. Maybe it’ll help me figure 
                        out where I went wrong. 

           Bo gives her a long, hard look for a minute.
                                 BO
                        So it’s a corporate request then, 
                        huh? Why don’t you let me take care 
                        of it. I know one a’ them pencil 
                        pushers. He’ll cut through the 
                        bullshit. 
                             (off her look)
                        Don’t act so surprised. I am 
                        capable of random acts of kindness 
                        once in a blue moon. Now how ‘bout 
                        that beer? On me. Day like today, I 
                        know I could use it.

           But Delaney’s still on edge.

                                 DELANEY
                        Thanks. But I think... I’m just 
                        gonna turn in. Rain check?

                                 BO
                        You got it.

           Bo starts to leave when Delaney, suddenly contemplative, 
           stops him. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You ever wonder... When they’re in 
                        their cells. Do you think they ever 
                        know?

           Bo blanches at the thought.

                                 BO
                        Jesus. You’re right. Last thing you 
                        need tonight is a drink. Go home, 
                        get some sleep, yeah?

                                 DELANEY
                        Yeah.

           But it looks like sleep is the farthest thing from her mind. 

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Paul sleeps soundly on his side of the bed, but Delaney 
           tosses and turns. 

           She’s laying on her side, but she can’t get comfortable. She 
           tries to roll over, but something STOPS her. She tries again. 
           But it’s as if she’s STUCK somehow.

           Delaney’s eyes open. 
           She sees the problem -- her ARM is dangling over the side of 
           the bed, and for some reason, she can’t lift it up. 

                                 DELANEY
                        No...

           Delaney inches toward the side of the bed. Terrified of what 
           she’ll see when she looks down. And sure enough, when her 
           eyes peek over the edge, she sees:

           Her wrist is handcuffed to the bed frame.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        No no no no...

           And as she looks around, Delaney sees she’s not in her 
           bedroom at all. She’s in:

           THE WHITE ROOM. 

           Cuffed to her bed in the dark with a room full of other 
           sleeping convicts. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        NO!

           Delaney YANKS her cuffed arm as hard as she can, and --

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME

           -- JOLTS up in bed. Her bed. Her bedroom. Paul isn’t asleep 
           beside her but, these days, that’s reality.

           It was all a dream.

           Her arm hangs limply by her side -- leaden dead weight, no 
           circulation. She’s been sleeping on it. That’s why she 
           couldn’t move it. Not because she was handcuffed.

           She rubs her arm awkwardly. Trying to get the blood flowing. 
           Takes a deep breath. Shivers.

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Delaney softly pads down the hall. A BLUE GLOW emanates from 
           the study, slightly eerie. But she peeks inside and --

           It’s just Paul. Asleep at his computer. 

           She quietly shuts the door.
           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A tea kettle heats on the stove. As Delaney reaches to grab a 
           coffee mug from the kitchen cabinets... 

           Ouch! 

           Her shoulder’s still a bit tender from the “stab wound” she 
           sustained a few days ago. 

           She rubs the tender spot as she turns back to the stove. And 
           when she looks up:

           PAUL IS STANDING IN THE ENTRYWAY. WIELDING A PLUNGER.

                                 DELANEY
                        God!

           He regards her, bleary-eyed and on edge. Slowly lowers the 
           plunger.

                                 PAUL
                             (re:  the plunger)
                        I heard noises. It was the first 
                        thing I could find. Can’t sleep?
                             (off her look:  clearly)
                        That parole case?

           Delaney considers. And, because it’s a much simpler, easier 
           answer, she nods. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Denied. Flat out, no chance to 
                        appeal. I barely got two words in. 
                        You should have seen Bo’s face. I 
                        never knew pity could look so 
                        condescending.

                                 PAUL
                        That guy... I will never understand 
                        why his opinion matters so much to 
                        you. 

                                 DELANEY
                        It doesn’t! I’m just saying... 
                        Mason swears he’s innocent. He 
                        seems innocent. I just wish I knew, 
                        one way or the other. 

                                 PAUL
                        Too bad you can’t go back. See how 
                        it happened the first time. I’m 
                        employing this flashback device in 
                        my manuscript...
           But his voice fades as Delaney tunes him out. His words have 
           SPARKED something. Delaney is suddenly WIDE AWAKE.

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Much like last night, Delaney sits at the table with Mason’s 
           case files spread out before her. But this time, she’s 
           concentrating on two documents in particular:

           On one side, Mason’s INTAKE LOG -- 

           A detailed list of his day-to-day activities in the real 
           world leading up to the day he committed his crime. 

           Every convict in the SomaCell system has an Intake Log; it’s 
           how their information is gathered to make their virtual world 
           so lifelike. 

           On the other side, Mason’s CYCLE ONE LOG --

           Delaney’s detailed notes regarding Mason’s day-to-day 
           activities during his first SomaCell Cycle. 

           She’s WORKING BACKWARDS, from the last day to the first, 

           hilighting differences 

           between the two logs. On the back pages, nearly every entry 
           is highlighted. Toward the middle, the highlights become 
           fewer and farther between. In the first few pages, hardly any 
           entry is highlighted. The takeaway being:

           Mason clearly did something during his first cycle that 
           changed his path. 

           Delaney gets to the first page of each log. The first few 
           days of the cycle. She highlights one final entry -- 

           This is the event where the two time lines begin to deviate.

           In the real world, on Day Two of the log, Mason’s accounting 
           firm gave him a new client, ALLIED VENTURE PARTNERS (AVP) -- 
           three weeks before he allegedly killed Kelly Connors. 

           In Mason’s SomaCell Cycle One, Day Two, he never received AVP 
           as a new client. And what was the difference? According to 
           Delaney’s log --

           “7am -- Delaney/Mason Racquetball.

           9:45am -- Late for work.”
           She CIRCLES this entry. If she wants to find out what 
           happened to him, this is where she needs to start.

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Delaney sits in a swivel chair next to Pike’s bed. Metallic 
           headband on. But she’s nervous. Sweating. Breathing hard. 
           Fingers tapping on her thighs.

                                 JINX (0.S.)
                        You have nothing to worry about. 

                                 DELANEY 
                        I know.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        The whole system’s been checked. 
                        Got a gold star of approval. Ding-
                        dong the glitch is dead. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m fine. This is me trusting you.

           Delaney takes a deep breath. Closes her eyes.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Initiating uplink... now.

           But Delaney’s hands involuntarily CLENCH into fists until...

           EXT. COMMUTER PARKING LOT - DAY [SATURATED]

           Hammer in hand, Pike walks down rows of cars like aisles in a 
           grocery store. Whenever he finds a car with a HOOD ORNAMENT, 
           he PUMMELS it off with his hammer.

           That is, until Delaney steps into view.

                                 DELANEY
                        Also not what I meant by a new hobby. 
                        I see our experiment didn’t work.

                                 PIKE
                        Worked just fine, you ask me. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You know they design those toys 
                        specifically to prevent choking.
                             (off Pike’s shocked 
                              expression)
                        Eyes everywhere, Pike.
           Pike takes a swing at another hood ornament, but Delaney 
           stays his arm.

                                 PIKE
                        Man, day in, day out. I never had 
                        no one stay on me the way you do. 
                        You ever think you got too much 
                        time on your hands?

                                 DELANEY
                        Nope. I just think you’re worth my 
                        time.

           That gets to him. Not too many people care about Pike -- in 
           this world or the real world.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        You’re mad at the world, huh?
                             (Pike doesn’t answer)
                        Some days, so am I. You know what I 
                        find helps?

                                 PIKE 
                        What’s that?

                                 DELANEY
                        Talking.

           She gently, but firmly, takes his hammer. Then hooks her arm 
           in his as they start to walk.

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY [DIFFUSED]

           Delaney disengages from Pike’s virtual world. Over the 
           intercom:

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        See? Smooth like buttah. Prepping 
                        N319’s uplink now...

                                 DELANEY
                        Actually. Hold off. 

           Delaney’s met by silence -- Jinx is surprised. 

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Okayyyy...

           INT. GYM SMOOTHIE BAR - DAY [SATURATED]

           Mason sits at a booth facing the entrance. Half his smoothie 
           already gone. Waiting. 
           He checks his watch -- nearly twenty minutes past the hour.

           A WOMAN walks in. He glances up. Hopeful. 

           Not Delaney. 

           Mason SIGHS. He knows when he’s been stood up. 

           He walks over to the counter. Borrows a pen and a napkin. 
           Writes a brief note, and hands it to the CASHIER. We can see 
           him describing Delaney:  If she happens to come in...

           As the cashier smiles politely and takes the note, we

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY [DIFFUSED]

           Delaney is watching this action play out on one of the many 
           monitors that lines the walls. Her expression is conflicted; 
           she hates standing him up, but she has a plan. 

           ONSCREEN -- Mason is now at the office, in the middle of a 
           board meeting. And sure enough, his boss passes him a file:

           Allied Venture Partners. 

           Delaney smiles. Intake log in hand, she makes a small CHECK 
           MARK next to the first highlighted entry. So far, so good.

           Jinx comes in, and hands her a thick ENVELOPE.

                                 JINX
                        Special delivery. 

                                 DELANEY
                        What is it?

                                 JINX
                        I had to guess? The corporate 
                        lawyers covering their asses over 
                        your little “on the job incident”. 
                        Just in case expensive lawsuits 
                        happens to be a symptom of a TBI.

           Delaney rips it open. Sure enough, inside is a multi-page 
           document full of LEGALESE. About the only phrase she 
           understands is “workman’s compensation”. At least the 
           stationary heading is pretty -- some kind of leaf logo.

           Jinx notices what she’s been doing, taking notes on Mason’s 
           screen.
                                 JINX (CONT’D)
                        Whatsa matter? Golden Boy lost his 
                        glow?

                                 DELANEY
                        Just... trying something new.

           MONTAGE - DELANEY MAKING HER ROUNDS

           We follow Delaney as she checks in with (almost) all of her 
           convicts:

           -- Attending a NA meeting with one WOMAN. 

           -- Helping an OLDER MAN balance his budget. 

           -- Breaking up a BAR ROOM BRAWL, trying to pull PIKE off a 
           guy whose hand he has just NAILED TO THE BAR.

           And finally, we see her sitting in front of Mason’s bed, 
           watching his monitor. No contact.

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Delaney watches Mason’s monitor on the wall of screens while 
           Jinx and Bo lounge nearby. 

           ONSCREEN -- Mason is in his office, poring over accounts. 
           Totally mundane. 

                                 JINX
                        I’m surprised more accountants 
                        don’t shoot up their co-workers. 
                        I’m feeling a murderous rage just 
                        watching him.

           But Delaney isn’t biting. Jinx smirks, tries again.

                                 JINX (CONT’D)
                        I don’t get it. Isn’t your whole 
                        job supposed to be making sure they 
                        don’t follow the same path that got 
                        them in here?

                                 BO
                        Hey. Ease up.

           Delaney finally turns back to them. 
                                 DELANEY
                        Just taking a page from the Book of 
                        Bo. “Thou shalt not take a personal 
                        interest.”

           Bo beams. Proud. He’s gotten through to her.

                                 BO
                        Amen. 

           Jinx just rolls her eyes.

           INT. WHITE ROOM - NIGHT 

           Delaney sits in front of a convict’s bed, watching the action 
           unfold onscreen, making notes into her tablet. 

           Bo sticks his head in the door -- holding his jacket and 
           satchel. Quittin’ time.

                                 BO
                        Good night for a drink. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Every night’s a good night for a 
                        drink with you.

                                 BO
                        C’mon. How ‘bout that rain check?

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m gonna finish up a few things 
                        here. 

           Bo regards her.

                                 BO
                        Ya know “overtime” ain’t in the 
                        SomaCell vocabulary. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Another time. 

           Fine. As Bo heads out:

                                 BO
                        Nobody likes a martyr.

                                 DELANEY
                             (grumbles)
                        Least of all the Grand Inquisitor.
           She listens as his footsteps ECHO down the hall, fainter and 
           fainter. Then she gets up and heads into:

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           Straight for Mason’s bed. She pulls a chair over. Watches his 
           monitor intently.

           ONSCREEN:  

           Mason is pulling a late night as well. Still at the office, 
           inspecting documents bearing the AVP logo. 

           RECEPTIONIST KELLY pops her head in to say good night. 

           IN THE WHITE ROOM:

           Delaney stiffens. But...

           ONSCREEN:

           Mason barely acknowledges her. Dismisses her with a few 
           words. He’s preoccupied -- working with a calculator, adding 
           in figures from a spreadsheet. Something’s not gelling. 

           On the spreadsheet, he CIRCLES a figure:  $40 million.

           Next to it, he writes in his own:  $25 million?

           A case of missing money?

           He makes a phone call, tapping his pencil impatiently. 
           Something’s not right. 

           IN THE WHITE ROOM: 

           Delaney checks Mason’s intake log. The next entry shows: 

           “DAY 8 -- 8:45am -- Followed on his way to work?”

                                 DELANEY
                        Now it gets interesting.

           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - NIGHT

           Delaney walks in to find most of the house dark.

                                 DELANEY
                        Paul?

                                 PAUL (O.S.)
                        Working.
           She heads toward the study. There’s Paul, typing away on his 
           laptop, iPod earbuds in his ears. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You eat dinner--

           He doesn’t look up. Just WAVES A HAND at her dismissively.

                                 PAUL
                        Working!

           Delaney takes in this sad, sorry scene. Is this her 
           boyfriend? Is this her life? 

                                 DELANEY
                        When exactly was it you started to 
                        resent me?

                                 PAUL
                        Really? We’re doing this now? 

                                 DELANEY
                        There was this accident at work the 
                        other day. Some glitch while I was 
                        coming out of a SomaCell. And for 
                        just a second I couldn’t be sure 
                        what was the dream and what was 
                        reality. But you know how I can be 
                        sure, without a doubt, that this is 
                        the real world? Because why in hell 
                        would I imagine a marriage like 
                        this?

           Paul just glares at her.

                                 PAUL
                        Good. Thank you. Because now I’ve 
                        lost my fucking train of thought. 
                        Are you done?

           The question hangs heavy between them. This has escalated 
           into more than just another fight, and they both know it.

                                 DELANEY
                             (quietly)
                        Are you? 

           Paul doesn’t answer. Just turns back to his computer.
           INT. DELANEY’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Delaney stands at the stove where the tea kettle is heating. 
           Thin wisps of STEAM rise up from the spout. She watches, 
           entranced. Zoning...

           FLASH! 

           A room of white. Her feet exposed before a plain metal bed 
           frame. A blur of activity just beyond the bed. 

           FLASH!

           Bo’s frantic, muffled yells, and Jinx’s distorted reply:

                                 BO
                        Whaddayou mean you don’t know?!

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                             (distorted)
                        ...I’m trying...

           Delaney GASPS as she snaps out of it. Sweating and short of 
           breath.

           The tea kettle is now whistling, a THICK WAFT of steam 
           chugging up from the spout.

           Delaney studies it. Almost unconsciously, her hand moves to 
           her shoulder, rubbing the spot where she was stabbed in 
           Pike’s virtual world. An idea forming...

           Slowly, deliberately, she places her hand directly into the 
           tea kettle steam. 

           And holds it there. But after a few seconds:

                                 DELANEY
                        Ahh!

           She YANKS her hand away. Rubs it against her clothes. Feeling 
           silly and foolish... but not exactly comforted.

           When she glances up, PAUL IS THERE. Looking contrite.

                                 PAUL
                        No. I’m not... I don’t want to be 
                        done.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Off Delaney:  wary. 
                                 DELANEY
                        The Paul I know doesn’t apologize.

                                 PAUL
                        Hey. I’m trying here. I mean it -- 
                        I’ll try.

           He comes to her and wraps her in a hug. But she’s a bit stiff 
           in his arms. A bit hesitant. 

           She turns her hand over to see an angry red blotch on her 
           palm. Wondering... Then giving in. She hugs him back.

                                 DELANEY
                        We’ll both try. 

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Delaney sets herself up for an uplink to Mason’s virtual 
           world. Slides on the headband, leans back in her chair. One 
           last look at her tablet -- Mason’s intake log:

           “DAY 8 -- 8:45am -- Followed on his way to work?”

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Just couldn’t stay away. I knew it. 
                        All that sexy number crunching.

                                 DELANEY
                             (cross)
                        Whenever you’re ready.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Ooh, retract those claws, kitty. 
                        Might want to remember who has eyes 
                        everywhere. Initiating uplink... 
                        meow. 

           Delaney closes her eyes and opens them in:

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY [SATURATED]

           Delaney casually leans against a column, eyes trained on the 
           steps of a nearby entrance. People stream up and down the 
           stairs. Soon she spots:

           Mason. Hurrying down the stairs.

           But Delaney doesn’t approach him. She moves a bit to make 
           sure the pillar obstructs her from his view. 

           She’s following him. And hoping she’s not the only one. 
           Mason moves through the sizeable line of people going through 
           a turnstile. 

           Delaney scans the sea of faces around him:  men and women 
           business attire. Young mothers pushing strollers. Shaggy-
           haired kids wearing iPod earbuds.

           Mason casually glances behind him as he digs in his pocket 
           for change. When he SPOTS a nondescript 

           MAN IN A SUIT 

           in line behind him, he FROWNS. Clearly unsettled.

           Bingo.

           Mason gets through the turnstile and pushes his way through 
           the crowd. Behind him, the Man In A Suit hurries to keep 
           pace. And behind him, Delaney follows.

           Mason keeps glancing over his shoulder. Clocking the Man In A 
           Suit behind him. Growing more distressed as the Man edges 
           closer.

           A crowd of people shuffle into a TRAIN and Mason bobs and 
           weaves through them. Making his way to the back. 

           The Man In A Suit pushes his way in as well. And Delaney 
           slips in near the front, careful to keep her distance.

           TING! Chimes announce the train is about to leave the 
           station. The doors begin to close. And that’s when:

           Mason suddenly 

           DARTS 

           off the train.

           The Man In A Suit scrambles to follow him. Delaney, too, 
           leaps out of the train and searches the crowd...

           There -- boarding a train on the OPPOSITE SIDE of the 
           platform. Just as it’s about to leave.

           Both the Man In A Suit and Delaney SPRINT to catch him.

           The Man In A Suit barely SLIDES THROUGH the doors to an 
           adjacent train car.

           Delaney RUSHES to do the same, but --

           TING! The doors WHISK closed.
                                 DELANEY
                        Shit.

           The train starts to move... She’ll lose her tail if she 
           doesn’t think of something quick.

           Delaney races to the end of the Man In A Suit’s train car, 

           PIVOTS and JUMPS --

           landing with feet firmly planted on the LINK-AND-PIN COUPLER 
           that’s hitching his and Mason’s cars together. Precariously 
           balanced above the open track below.

           She braces herself as the train picks up speed. Dares a 
           glance through the car window...

           WHERE MASON IS STANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE. 

           He hasn’t spotted her... yet. He’s too busy scanning the 
           passengers in his car for the Man In A Suit. But it’s only a 
           matter of time. 

           Delaney tries ducking down, but her 

           FOOT SLIPS, 

           and she barely catches her balance. One of her SHOES FALLS 
           OFF and gets SUCKED UNDER the train.

           She needs a new plan. Fast.

           Up ahead -- there’s LIGHT fast approaching. They’re going 
           above ground. Delaney’s eyes travel up to the top of the 
           train car...

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        No problem. Sure...

           As the subway train ROCKETS into the light, the city RUSHING 
           past --

           EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN 

           -- Delaney prepares for the climb. 

           Another quick glance into the train car:

           Mason’s still not looking her way. But somebody else is -- a 
           YOUNG BOY gazing at her in amazement. 

           Delaney smiles at him, puts a finger to her lips:  Shhhh.
           The Young Boy just gapes.

           Delaney carefully pivots her feet. Gets a firm GRIP on the 
           outside of the front car. And starts PULLING HERSELF UP. One 
           wrong move and she’s a splat on the pavement.

           INT. MASON’S SUBWAY TRAIN CAR

           The Young Boy yanks on his FATHER’S coat, pointing wildly out 
           the window at Delaney. His father doesn’t even look up -- 
           just fishes in his pocket and hands the boy a piece of candy. 

           But the boy does catch Mason’s attention, and he looks out 
           the window just in time to see 

           A PAIR OF SHAPELY SWINGING LEGS (with no shoes)

           disappearing up over the top. 

           Mason moves to the window, but the legs are already gone.

           EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN ROOF

           Delaney flattens herself against the top. Breathless and 
           exhilarated. Virtual world or not, this is a RUSH.

           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Fresh off the train, Mason briskly weaves through the crowd 
           coming out of the subway entrance. Still behind him, the Man 
           In A Suit. And, further back, a barefoot, wind-blown Delaney. 

           Mason looks back at the Man over his shoulder. They lock eyes 
           for just a moment. Then Mason drops all pretense and 

           RUNS. 

           Across four lanes of traffic. And the Man follows.

           Delaney runs, too -- paying no attention to the TRAFFIC 
           around her. Even 

           LEAPING ONTO THE HOOD OF A CAR 

           so as not to break her stride. 

           Up ahead:

           Mason reaches his office building. A corporate high rise with 
           a revolving door. 
           The Man is closing in fast. This is it. He can duck inside to 
           safety. Or...

           Mason SNATCHES a passing WOMAN’s COFFEE CUP. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Hey!

           He PIVOTS, TURNS, and SMASHES THE COFFEE CUP

           into the front of the Man’s suit.

           The crowd FANS OUT wide to avoid the splatter. Gasps and 
           cries all around. All eyes on Mason and the Man.

                                 MASON
                        Oh man! I am so sorry. Look at that!

           Mason’s hands grab the Man’s jacket lapels. Ostensibly trying 
           to pat him dry. But his grip is strong, his eyes cold and 
           steady. Do. Not. Mess with me.

           The Man is drenched. Scalded. And pissed at all the unwanted 
           attention. Squirming to get away.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Here, let me help you...

           The Man wrenches himself free. Grumbles:

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        No problem.

           And moves away. Disappearing into the crowd. 

           Mason watches him go. Pleased with himself. Then spots a 
           familiar face --

                                 MASON
                        Delaney?

           He looks again, but the face is gone. No one there after all. 
           Victorious but unnerved, he heads into his building. 

           Meanwhile:

           Delaney has kept moving. Still on the tail of the Man In A 
           (Coffee-Stained) Suit. Who is now angrily barking into a CELL 
           PHONE. She keeps her distance. 

           Watches as he disappears into another CORPORATE HIGH RISE. 
           She charges in after him, but --
           INT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE

           -- finds herself in a queue to pass through a metal detector. 
           A SECURITY GUARD behind a desk bearing a simple LEAF LOGO 
           DESIGN checks ID BADGES as people pass through. 

           The Man steps through the metal detector while flashing his 
           badge. One Security Guard chuckles.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Rough morning?

           The Man ignores him. Stalks to the elevators. 

           Delaney cranes her neck to track him, but the doors slide 
           shut and he’s gone.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am?

           Delaney realizes she’s at the front of the queue.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Your badge?

                                 DELANEY
                        Oh. I’m... meeting someone. 
                             (plays a hunch)
                        Allied Venture Partners.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        What? There’s no company here by 
                        that name.

           Shit. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You know, I think I just... got the 
                        wrong building. 
                             (pushing her way back 
                              through the queue)
                        Excuse me.

           EXT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE

           Delaney emerges into the morning sun. Looks around to get her 
           bearings -- notes the CROSS-STREET SIGNS. 

           She catches her breath, and LEANS heavily against the 
           building. Dizzy with adrenaline. 
           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY [DIFFUSED]

           Delaney opens her eyes to find Bo standing over her. Less 
           than pleased.

                                 BO
                        The fuck was that? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Everywhere I look, Bo. Suddenly, 
                        there you are.  

                                 BO
                        I just witnessed, what? Half a 
                        dozen violations? Do you have any 
                        idea how much shit you could get 
                        in? That is a man’s mind, not your 
                        public playground.

           Delaney gets up, brushes past him.

                                 DELANEY
                        You gonna report me?

                                 BO
                        Jesus, Delaney. I’m trying to help 
                        you. But I can’t do that if you 
                        won’t help yourself.

           Delaney PAUSES. She knows those words too well. She says them 
           all the time. To her convicts.

           She struggles to regain her composure.

                                 DELANEY
                        You want to help me? Where’s his 
                        statement? 

                                 BO
                             (evasive)
                        I’m workin on it.
                             (as she walks away)
                        Where are you going?

                                 DELANEY
                        Early lunch. Wanna follow me there, 
                        too?

           But she strides out of the room before Bo can reply.
           EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

           Delaney parks her car at a metered spot and narrowly avoids 
           traffic as she crosses the street. She glances up at the 
           STREET SIGNS when she reaches the other side:

           The exact same cross-streets she noted in Mason’s virtual 
           world. And, sure enough, directly in front of her is:

           THE CORPORATE HIGH RISE. In the flesh. So to speak.

           Delaney studies the exterior -- only numbers above the 
           rotating door. No list of the companies within. 

           She strides through the rotating doors...

           INT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE

           ...and goes straight for the SECURITY GUARDS. A different man 
           than the one in Mason’s virtual world. But the desk, with 
           that LEAF LOGO DESIGN stenciled on the front, is the same.

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                        Ma’am?

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m ah, looking for Allied Venture 
                        Partners.

           The Security Guards shrug.

                                 SECURITY GUARD #2
                        No one by that name.

           She strains to see into the lobby. Those elevators leading 
           up, up, up to... who? If Allied Venture Partners isn’t here, 
           then who is? 

           And what do they want with Mason?

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                        Sure you’re in the right place? 

           This time, the LEAF LOGO DESIGN on the desk catches Delaney’s 
           eye. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m sorry. Thank you.

           She’s seen that design before... but where? 
           EXT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE 

           The answer comes to her as soon as she steps out onto the 
           sidewalk. She stops, digs through her purse, and pulls out...

           The document from SomaCell’s corporate lawyers detailing 
           their worker’s compensation policy.

           That exact same LEAF DESIGN graces their stationary heading.

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - DAY

           Delaney returns, sets down her things, and nods at Jinx.

                                 DELANEY
                        Bo around?

                                 JINX
                        He’s under. Room One. 

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Delaney walks in to find Bo reclined in a chair next to the 
           bed of an OLDER MAN. The monitor above the Older Man’s bed 
           shows:

           In the virtual world -- the two are fly fishing. Not talking 
           much, but enjoying the simultaneous solitude and company. The 
           Older Man’s hands SHAKE badly. Symptoms of withdrawal.

           But that’s not what Delaney’s here for. She’s here for --

           BO’S TABLET. 

           Resting in his lap. But how to do this discreetly, under 
           Jinx’s watchful eye? 

           Her gaze travels to the convict in the next bed over. A 
           MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, B221. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx, are you seeing this?

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Bo’s drool? I can’t unsee it. It 
                        haunts me.

                                 DELANEY
                        B221. She always tachycardic? 
                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        What?? I’m showing a normal heart 
                        rate.

                                 DELANEY
                        120 is normal?

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Shit! Why am I not seeing this?!

           Delaney takes this as her cue. Leans in over Bo and deftly 
           swaps her tablet for his. It only takes a second. 

           Jinx BURSTS into the room. Running at full speed.

                                 DELANEY
                        Huh. You’re right, it’s back to 
                        normal now. Another glitch?

           Jinx doubles over, winded.

                                 JINX
                        She’s okay?

                                 DELANEY
                        Seems fine. 

                                 JINX
                        Can you keep an eye on her?

           Delaney smiles. A helpful colleague lending a hand.

                                 DELANEY
                        Happy to.

           Jinx walks away, still wheezing:

                                 JINX
                        These fucking machines... are 
                        giving me... Tachycardia. 

           As soon as she’s gone, Delaney dives in to Bo’s tablet. A 
           quick glance up at the convict’s monitor shows:

           ONSCREEN -- Bo and the Older Man are packing up their gear.

           Shit. She better hurry.

           She pulls up his email account. Sent box. Scrolls through the 
           past week of history. 

           What she finds is largely unremarkable. It’s what she doesn’t 
           find. No email to request to corporate regarding Mason 
           Grant’s official statement. 
                                 DELANEY
                        Busted. 

           ONSCREEN -- Bo and the Older Man say their goodbyes. The 
           Older Man gets into his pick-up, starts driving away. Bo’s 
           hand moves to the WATCH on his wrist.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           Delaney acts fast: 

           Closes out of the email. 

           Reaches down to swap the tablets back just as...

           BO’S EYES OPEN to see Delaney standing over him. 

                                 BO
                        Jesus Christ!

           Delaney deftly makes the switch. Bo is none the wiser, still 
           recovering from the shock.

                                 DELANEY
                        You know you drool when you’re 
                        under.

           Bo removes his headband. Rubs his eyes. Cranky.

                                 BO
                        Okay, I get it. No one likes a 
                        hoverer. Shit. 

           Delaney offers him a hand, helps him out of his chair.

                                 DELANEY
                        So tonight. How about that beer?

           Off Bo:  surprised and pleased.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Delaney and Bo share a booth and a pitcher that’s down to its 
           final dregs. From Bo’s glassy eyes and animated gestures, we 
           can guess that it wasn’t split 50/50. 

                                 BO
                        ...But the worst is this religious 
                        nut. E492. Grover Osgood. One of 
                        those Old Testament “I am the hand 
                        of a vengeful God” whack jobs. 
                        Thinks I’m his goddam priest. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BO (CONT'D)
                        I gotta bless him, hear his 
                        confession, quote scripture and 
                        shit. Me. Half the time I just make 
                        something up. Even quoted a Rocky 
                        movie once. He don’t know the 
                        difference.

           Delaney commiserates. But her gaze is shrewd. Deliberate.

                                 DELANEY
                        I was a nutritionist once. No one 
                        that girl trusted more than me. 
                        Though I did not prescribe the 
                        mountains of cocaine she shoved up 
                        her nose. No matter how effective 
                        they were for weight loss.

           Bo snorts. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        We wear a lot of hats, don’t we? 
                        Sister, aunt, best friend. 
                        Neighbor, teacher, baby sitter. 

                                 BO
                        I’m just waiting for the day one a’ 
                        these punks calls me Grandpa. Shit. 

           And here it comes -- the punch line:

                                 DELANEY
                        Colleague. We’re colleagues, aren’t 
                        we?

                                 BO
                             (oblivious)
                        Brothers in arms, sure. No stronger 
                        bond. 

           But one look at Delaney’s face and Bo wishes he was sober. 
           This is not going to be the friendly, after-hours chat he had 
           in mind.

                                 DELANEY
                        What I want to know is. Why you 
                        would lie to me about helping with 
                        Mason’s case.

           He’s a deer in headlights. Grasping for straws.

                                 BO
                        Why -- what? 
                                 DELANEY
                        The statement.

                                 BO
                        I’m workin’ on it. I told you. You 
                        know how these fuckin’ 
                        bureaucracies operate--

                                 DELANEY
                        Bullshit. 

           They stare each other down. Neither willing to back off. 

                                 BO
                        That what this is? An 
                        interrogation?

                                 DELANEY
                        What is it about that one document 
                        that’s so significant you would go 
                        out of your way to keep it from me?

                                 BO
                        Nothing! Okay? Not a goddamn thing. 
                        It’s a bunch of conspiracy theory 
                        bullshit from a guy who broke the 
                        law and don’t wanna pay the 
                        consequences.

                                 DELANEY
                        Then why can’t I see it?

                                 BO
                        I thought you were over this! I 
                        really did. Thought you’d had a 
                        fucking breakthrough--

           THEY BOTH FREEZE. 

           The implications of what he’s just said hangs in the air 
           between them. The question that’s been gnawing at her, 
           finally answered.

                                 DELANEY
                             (slowly)
                        A breakthrough.

           Bo struggles to repair the damage. 

                                 BO
                        I mean... you know what I mean. How 
                        long I been on you about boundaries 
                        and shit?
           Delaney’s world is crashing down around her. And yet, she’s 
           sitting calmly in the wreckage.

                                 DELANEY
                        Everywhere I look. There you are.

                                 BO
                        Because we work together.

                                 DELANEY
                        You always could get under my skin 
                        like nobody else. Your opinion 
                        mattered so much. Because that’s 
                        all any good convict wants, right? 
                        To please her Specialist?

                                 BO
                        Look, everybody thinks about it. 
                        Everybody wonders. 

                                 DELANEY
                        How many cycles?

                                 BO
                        You can’t do what we do and not 
                        wonder--

                                 DELANEY
                        How many cycles, Bo?

                                 BO
                        THERE AIN’T NO FUCKING CYCLES! I’M 
                        TELLING YOU, THIS IS REAL!

           But that look in his eyes -- it’s fear. Delaney gets up from 
           the table. Still eerily calm.

                                 DELANEY
                        I have to go. 

                                 BO
                        No, hey. Not like this. Talk to me, 
                        come on. At least -- I’ll take you 
                        home. Delaney!

           But Delaney walks away.

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Delaney wanders in a daze. Her face an emotionless mask. 
           Trying to process the horrifying truth... 
           Almost without realizing, she leaves the sidewalk and steps 
           out into 

           THE STREET. 

           Walking directly down a lane of traffic. Staring impassively 
           at the cars that 

           SCREECH, SWERVE, and HONK 

           to avoid her. 

           Frightened, angry drivers yell obscenities she doesn’t hear. 

           She keeps walking, the look in her eyes DESPERATELY WILLING 
           someone -- anyone -- to make contact. 

           But soon all the cars around her have come to a halt. Sirens 
           WAIL in the distance, growing closer. And another sound is 
           approaching too. The deep, resonant RUMBLE of --

           A SUBWAY TRAIN. 

           Delaney watches the train pass overhead. And makes a 
           decision.

           INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

           The station is nearly empty as Delaney positions herself on 
           the link-and-pin coupler between two train cars. 

           Only a few solitary souls in the cars on either side of her. 
           Either they don’t see her, or they don’t want to see her. 
           Like most subway patrons, they’ve perfected the art of 
           keeping to themselves.

           The train starts moving. And somehow, in this reality, 
           everything is HEIGHTENED --

           The roar is LOUDER. 

           The train is FASTER. 

           The coupler more NARROW, and harder to balance on. 

           The stakes seem higher here, the consequences more permanent. 
           But Delaney is determined. 

           EXT. SUBWAY TRAIN

           When the train goes above ground, Delaney makes her move:
           But the metal is SLIPPERY under her hands. The wind WHIPS at 
           her violently. She struggles and strains to pull herself to 
           the roof...

           And she makes it. Balancing precariously. Watching the world 
           blur past her. 

           She chances a glance over the side. On this stretch of track, 
           above a CONCRETE RAVINE, it’s a long way down. 

           Which is just what she wanted. 

                                 DELANEY
                        UNH!

           A breath rips out of her -- a deep, gutteral noise of inner 
           turmoil.

           If she’s going to take a leap of faith, the time is now.

           Delaney hesitates... hesitates... 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        AHH!

           JUMPS.

           The train drowns out her screams as she plummets toward the 
           ground. Her limbs flail until -- 

           SMACK!

           She hits the ground with a sickening CRUNCH. 

           Her body LIES STILL in the concrete ravine. A thin, dirty 
           stream of water trickling past. 

           No one walks away from a fall like this. And yet...

           Delaney stirs. Not only is she alive, not only is she 
           conscious, but she’s virtually unharmed.

           Cut, scraped, bloody, bruised -- sure. But she should be 
           dead. And she would be --

           If this was the real world.

           She pulls herself into a sitting position. 

           And finally, that calm reserve breaks. A hundred emotions 
           flood through her as tears fall:

           Intense, unabashed RELIEF to be alive.
           And the suffocating DEFEAT that none of this -- her job, her 
           marriage, her life -- is real. 

           This new knowledge, it’s a baptism by fire. The pain of this 
           rebirth is etched on her face. Along with --

           A RECKLESSNESS we’ve never seen before.

           The tears stop falling, and Delaney begins to

           LAUGH.

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           MOANS and CRIES of pleasure emanate from the bank of monitors 
           that, in the daylight hours, is Jinx’s domain. But it’s not 
           Jinx whose slack face is bathed in the screens’ pale glow.

           It’s Roger, the night-shift tech. Just as Jinx suspected, 
           watching PORN.

           That is, until a WAD OF CASH suddenly drops onto his desk.

           Roger startles. Hits the PAUSE button, stopping the cries and 
           moans. And looks up to see --

           Delaney.

                                 ROGER
                        I wasn’t...

                                 DELANEY
                        I trust you can be discreet.

           INT. WHITE ROOM - NIGHT

           A quick series of shots:

           -- Chair wheels SCREECH across the floor.

           -- A metallic headband SLIDES over Delaney’s head.

           -- Her long eyelashes FLUTTER closed.

           Soon she’s:

           EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT [SATURATED]

           Knocking on an apartment door. Nervous. Anxious. 
           Anticipating.
           When the door opens, it’s MASON on the other side. Disheveled 
           from sleep. Holding a BASEBALL BAT. Which he DROPS the second 
           he realizes it’s Delaney on his doorstep. 

                                 MASON
                        Delaney? How did you--

           But then she’s kissing him. With the hunger and urgency of 
           unbridled passion. 

           When they finally pull away, they’re panting for breath.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe... it’s you.

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s not. Not really.

           And then they’re on each other again. Lips and hands that 
           can’t move fast enough. Clothes peeling off. And as they 
           stagger deeper into the apartment, Mason

           SLAMS

           the door shut behind them.

           INT. MASON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Delaney and Mason lie in a tangle of sheets. Mason strokes 
           her arm.

                                 MASON
                        That was... unexpected. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Unexpected good?

                                 MASON
                        Unexpected great. Much more fun 
                        than when the FedEx guy comes 
                        around.
                             (beat)
                        When you didn’t show at the gym--

                                 DELANEY
                        I really am sorry.

                                 MASON
                        --I was worried I’d never see you 
                        again. Because I knew, I felt, we 
                        have this... connection. I can’t 
                        explain it. But. I feel it. Is that 
                        weird?
           Delaney smiles. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Not weird. I feel it, too. 
                             (changing tactics)
                        I saw you the other day, actually. 
                        On the street.

                                 MASON
                        You should have said something!

                                 DELANEY
                        Didn’t seem like the best time. 
                        There was a man with you. Looked 
                        like some kind of altercation? I 
                        don’t know, but I remember coffee 
                        was involved.

           Mason gets it.

                                 MASON
                        Oh. That. That was... a strange 
                        day.

           Delaney pulls away from him slightly. Props herself up so 
           they’re face to face. No more pillow talk. It’s time for a 
           serious discussion.

                                 DELANEY
                        Mason. Do you trust me? 

                                 MASON
                        Of course I do. You’re my--
                             (laughs)
                        Jesus. I was about to say you’re my 
                        best friend. I’m not a clinger, I 
                        swear. Usually I’m at least... 
                        eight percent more suave.

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m serious.

                                 MASON
                        Okay, yeah. I trust you. 
                        Absolutely.

           She pauses. How to say this...

                                 DELANEY
                        I need you to tell me what’s going 
                        on with Allied Venture Partners. 
                                 MASON
                             (startled)
                        How do you know about--?

                                 DELANEY
                        All I know is that you found 
                        something... unusual. And in trying 
                        to make sense of it, you’ve 
                        stumbled into something else. 
                        Something dangerous. That’s why you 
                        thought you were being followed the 
                        other day. And why you answered the 
                        door with a bat. 

                                 MASON
                        I’m not crazy. 

                                 DELANEY
                        No. But you are in danger. Whatever 
                        it is you’re on to, the people 
                        behind it will go to any lengths 
                        necessary to cover it up. Believe 
                        me. They will ruin your life. 

           Mason looks at her:  confused. Frightened. Overwhelmed.

                                 MASON
                        ...How about some coffee?

           INT. MASON’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Coffee’s on the table, but it’s just a formality. Instead, 
           Delaney and Mason’s attention is focused on a paper trail of 
           documents.

           Starting with -- financial reports. Mason points to different 
           charts and graphs as he explains:

                                 MASON
                        Venture companies like AVP usually 
                        have a few limited partners they 
                        can “call” capital from when 
                        needed. Partners who’ve agreed in 
                        advance to fund a certain amount on 
                        demand. That way, a new investment 
                        comes up, they can pounce right 
                        away. So there’s a drawdown account 
                        with money sitting in it, waiting 
                        to be invested -- here. That has 
                        $40 million, according to AVP’s 
                        internal books. But...

           Delaney checks an adjacent account statement.
                                 DELANEY
                        $25 million. Where’s the rest?

                                 MASON
                        Exactly. So I do a little digging. 
                        Find out it’s been moved to a second 
                        account. Problem is, that account is 
                        empty. The funds were wired out in 
                        three precise $5 million increments, 
                        two days apart. A little over a week 
                        ago. To some... looks like a foreign 
                        bank by the routing number. Not one 
                        I recognize.

                                 DELANEY
                        So what does that mean?

                                 MASON
                        I didn’t know yet. I called AVP’s 
                        chief accountant. He tells me the 
                        numbers make no sense, he’s never 
                        even heard of this second account. 
                        Maybe it’s a new investment? He 
                        hands me off to some portfolio 
                        manager who knows even less. Then, 
                        two days later, I get a call from 
                        the co-head of the firm, saying he 
                        “appreciates my diligence” but it 
                        is, in fact, a non-issue. New 
                        investment, blah blah blah. Bottom 
                        line being -- drop it. And that’s 
                        when I notice the car parked 
                        outside my house at all hours of 
                        the night. And strange men in suits 
                        following me on the subway. 

                                 DELANEY
                        You get the name? Of the new 
                        investment? 

           Mason sets another paper on top of the pile. A single page of 
           company letterhead. Across the top:  “VERDANT R&D” and 

           THE LEAF LOGO. Just like at the Corporate High Rise. Just 
           like on the letter Delaney received.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        I know this company. The man who 
                        was following you... he works 
                        there. 
                                 MASON
                        You know anything else about it? 
                        Because the intel I’ve got could 
                        fill a Post-it. It’s a company on 
                        paper only. A shell. 

           And now would be the time for coffee. Delaney takes a long, 
           slow sip. She’s stumped. 

                                 DELANEY
                        This is big. It must be. This is 
                        why I...
                             (thinks better of it; 
                              trails off)
                        Got involved. 

           Mason studies her.

                                 MASON
                        Hey. Are you okay? I mean, if 
                        you’re in trouble...

                                 DELANEY
                        We both are. Unfortunately. Quite 
                        possibly for the same reason. And 
                        I’m going to figure out why.

                                 MASON
                        Whoa, wait. If these guys are as 
                        dangerous as you say they are--

                                 DELANEY
                        It won’t be a problem. You trust 
                        me, right?

                                 MASON
                        You make it sound like you’re 
                        invincible.

           She smirks at him. If he only knew...

                                 DELANEY
                        But in the meantime, I need you to 
                        lay low. Act normal. Just go about 
                        your daily routine like nothing’s 
                        changed.

                                 MASON
                             (alarmed)
                        You think... what? They’re 
                        watching?

                                 DELANEY
                        More than you know. 
           Mason takes her hand. Worried. Protective. 

                                 MASON
                        When will I see you again?

           They lean into each other...

                                 DELANEY
                        Soon. I promise. 

           ...and share a deep kiss. But when they pull away:

                                 MASON
                        Delaney?

           DELANEY’S POV: 

           Extreme TUNNEL VISION. As a sudden DARKNESS encroaches Mason 
           and his kitchen get farther and farther away, until:

           INT. WHITE ROOM [DIFFUSED]

           Delaney is JOLTED back into reality (so to speak). Roger 
           anxiously hovering over her.

                                 DELANEY
                        Are you crazy?! Killing an uplink 
                        mid-stream--

                                 ROGER
                        You said discreet. Thought you’d 
                        want to know, your boy Bo just 
                        showed up. Only six hours early for 
                        his shift. He always such an 
                        overachiever?

           Delaney gets it. Scrambles out of the headband. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I was never here.

                                 ROGER
                        Do I look like the career suicide 
                        type?

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Bo lumbers down the hallway. The booze may not have worn off, 
           but his mission has sobered him.

           He passes the Control Room. No one there. He GRUNTS and keeps 
           going. Almost to the White Room. 
           He turns a corner and 

           SMACKS

           right into Roger.

                                 ROGER
                        Whoa! Easy, big guy.

                                 BO
                        You seen Delaney? She been in here?

                                 ROGER
                             (nervous)
                        Why would I have seen Delaney? 

           Bo just BRUSHES PAST HIM. Faster now, with growing suspicion. 

           Roger calls after him:

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Everything okay?

           He FLINGS OPEN the door to the White Room and finds...

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           Nothing. The room is empty. 

           Bo GRUNTS again. Examines the MONITOR over Mason’s bed -- 

           ONSCREEN:  

           Just Mason sitting at a table full of documents. Boring and 
           mundane as ever. Except...

           There are two cups of coffee on the table.

           IN THE ROOM:

           Bo scans the room again. Even bends down and CHECKS UNDER THE 
           BEDS. Nothing. No one here. 

           But his eyes linger on the SWIVEL CHAIR -- shoved into a far 
           corner. STILL SLIGHTLY TURNING.

           Bo races back to the hallway.

                                 BO
                        DELANEY!
           INT. STAIRWAY - SAME

           But Delaney’s already long gone. She takes the stairs two and 
           three at a time, then BURSTS through a door into the:

           INT. PARKING GARAGE

           She hurries to her car. Not a run, but a walk that’s too 
           brisk to be casual. 

           She slides behind the wheel. Safe. For the moment.

           But what now?

           EXT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE - DAY

           Delaney stares up at the looming building glinting in the 
           bright morning sun. It’s time for answers.

           A couple deep breaths:

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s not real.

           INT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE - DAY

           Delaney moves to the front of the metal detector queue. Two 
           SECURITY GUARDS looks up expectantly.

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                        Badge?

                                 DELANEY
                        No badge. Just visiting. 

           Security Guard #2 picks up a clipboard with an approved list 
           of visitor names.

                                 SECURITY GUARD #2
                        Name?

                                 DELANEY
                        Oh. I didn’t say anyone was 
                        expecting me. 

           Before Security Guard #2 can set down his clipboard, Delaney 

           TWISTS, SPINS, and UPPERCUTS

           into his throat. As he goes down, she GRABS HIS TASER and
           DROPS TO THE FLOOR

           just as Security Guard #1 LUNGES to TASE her. Delaney

           THRUSTS 

           her taser into Security Guard #1’s GROIN, 

           LEAPS to her feet, and 

           RUNS FOR THE ELEVATORS. 

           Screams and shouts from the people in the queue behind her as 
           Security Guard #1 RADIOS for backup. 

           INT. ELEVATORS

           As the doors WHISK closed behind her, Delaney scans the 
           DIRECTORY:

           “Verdant R&D. 28th Floor.” Bingo. 

           She braces herself as the elevator jolts to life, traveling 
           up, up, up--

           DING! A sudden stop. Floor 15. That’s no good.

           The doors WHISK open on -- a PUDGY BUSINESS MAN, mid-bite on 
           a donut. He chokes in surprise when he sees Delaney 

           POINTING THE TASER at his gut.

                                 DELANEY
                        I’d wait for the next one.

           The man just nods as the doors WHISK closed once again.

           Delaney taps her foot impatiently, watching the floor buttons 
           light up as the elevator passes:

           Verdant R&D. What could it be?

           Her adrenaline pumping. Every nerve firing. 

           Whatever awaits her, at least she’ll finally have some 
           answers.
           DING! The 28th Floor. 

           The elevator doors WHISK open to reveal:

           INT. 28TH FLOOR

           Nothing. 

           Delaney staggers out of the elevator, in shock.

           There’s nothing.

           And we’re not talking an empty office -- bare carpets, 
           unpainted walls, unadorned windows. 

           There’s literally NOTHING HERE:

           It’s a smooth white space. You can’t even call it a room; 
           there’s no height, width, or depth to it at all. The spatial 
           equivalent of a blank piece of paper before the artist’s had 
           a chance to draw. 

           The 28th floor doesn’t exist. Because it was never created. 
           An intentional gap in the programming.

           Delaney sinks to her knees.

           The full, insurmountable weight of her situation finally 
           sinking in... 

           And that’s when the doors BURST OPEN and

           A BATTALION OF POLICE 

           swarm inside. GUNS trained on her. 

           And not one of them seems to notice the peculiarity of their 
           surroundings.

                                 POLICE
                        Hands on your head! Don’t move! Put 
                        the weapon down! Etc.

           Delaney does as she’s told. Taser down. Hands on her head. 
           Too tired to fight.

                                 DELANEY
                             (in a daze)
                        You going to shoot me? Wouldn’t be 
                        anything new.

           They SLAP cuffs on her wrists and MANHANDLE her to her feet.
           INT. POLICE INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

           Delaney sits on the wrong side of the table. DETECTIVES 
           staring her down. 

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        You understand, you’re facing some 
                        serious charges here.

                                 DETECTIVE #2
                        We want to help you. But we can’t 
                        do that if you don’t talk to us. 

           Delaney just laughs. Hollow-eyed. Defeated.

                                 DELANEY
                        You want to help? Why? Because 
                        that’s your job? You take pride in 
                        what you do? Always have? You’re 
                        both full of shit. You’re not real. 
                        None of this is real.

           Detective #1 leans over to Detective #2:

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        We screen for drugs?

                                 DELANEY
                        I want Bo. 
                             (calling)
                        Bo!

                                 DETECTIVE #2
                        Who? We’ve got a lawyer on his way--

                                 DELANEY
                        Booooooooooo--

           Startled and perplexed, the Detectives get out of there and--

           INT. POLICE STATION

           --SLAM the interrogation room door shut behind them.

                                 DELANEY (O.S.)
                        --oooooooooo!

           Detective #1 just shakes his head.

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        Je-sus.
                                 DETECTIVE #2
                        It’s the weather. Brings all the 
                        crazies out of the woodwork. 

           Inside the interrogation room, Delaney goes quiet. They turn 
           back to look through the small window inset in the door -- 

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           A MAN is now in the interrogation room with Delaney. It’s Bo.

                                 DETECTIVE #2 (CONT’D)
                        What the shit?!

           Detective #1 grabs the door. Tries to shove his way back 
           inside. But it’s STUCK.

                                 DETECTIVE #1
                        How’d he get in there?

           INT. POLICE INTERROGATION CELL

           Bo and Delaney clock the cursing and screaming on the other 
           side of the door -- where a CHAIR has been wedged up under 
           the handle. 

           Delaney’s amused. Bo, not so much.

                                 BO
                        Are you out of your goddam mind?! 
                        What were you thinking??

                                 DELANEY
                        Not just an empty office space. A 
                        total void. as in, a gap in the 
                        programming. Why would they do that 
                        unless they had something to hide?

                                 BO
                        They?

                                 DELANEY
                        SomaCell! They’re involved somehow. 
                        They must be.

           Bo reels.

                                 BO
                        Jesus. Are you hearing yourself? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Mason was onto something big before 
                        he got arrested.

                        Some kind of corporate fraud... 
                        something. And now the very system 
                        that sentenced him, that is denying 
                        him parole, is also covering up 
                        whatever it is he found. Do you 
                        understand the implications here?

                                 BO
                        Delaney...

                                 DELANEY
                        An innocent man! Truly innocent. 
                        Locked away for the rest of his 
                        life in such a way that his 
                        knowledge is sure never to get out. 
                        And me. The one person who could 
                        potentially discover his secret, 
                        suddenly I’m in a SomaCell, too? 
                        Bo, you know me! Am I a criminal?

           Bo’s expression is pained. He doesn’t want to say it.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        What did I do? What was my crime? 

                                 BO
                        You know I can’t--

                                 DELANEY
                        Was it murder? I killed somebody? 
                        The same way Mason “killed” Kelly 
                        Connors? Think! 

           Bo leans heavily against the wall. Sighs. 

                                 BO
                        You know what we’re supposed to do. 
                        In situations like this.

           Delaney stops her tirade. Stunned.

                                 DELANEY
                        You can’t. 

                                 BO
                        It’s standard protocol. 

                                 DELANEY
                        A reset? Now? You’d send me back to 
                        square one after everything I’ve...
                             (pleading)
                        No. Listen to me. You have to wake 
                        me up.

                                 DELANEY (CONT'D)
                        It’s the only way! Something is 
                        very wrong here. If Mason is 
                        innocent, If I’m innocent -- how 
                        many others are, too? 

                                 BO
                        What you’re asking... 

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m right about this. It’s the 
                        system that’s wrong. But there’s 
                        nothing I can do about it without 
                        your help. 
                             (beat)
                        Please.

           Bo’s face contorts into a grimace. 

                                 BO
                        I’m sorry. I just. I can’t.

                                 DELANEY
                             (venomous)
                        That’s right. I forgot. A 
                        criminal’s a criminal. 

           Bo’s fingers go to the WATCH on his wrist. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Bo! Please! You have to help me! 

                                 BO
                        You think I’m so cold. So callous. 
                        I’m trying to help you. I wish you 
                        would see that. 

           The watch emanates a soft BLUE GLOW --

                                 DELANEY
                        WAIT!

           -- and Bo DISAPPEARS. 

           She is totally. Utterly. Alone.

           INT. HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

           A cold, callous prison cell. Delaney sits in a dark corner, 
           hugging her knees to her chest.

           A POLICE OFFICER walks by, making the rounds. His eyes are 
           all sympathy when they fall on her. Delaney’s not the sort 
           they typically get in here.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You sure there’s no one you wanna 
                        call?

           She just looks up at him. Someone to call. If only.

                                 DELANEY
                        You’ve heard that saying. If a tree 
                        falls in the forest, and no one’s 
                        around to hear it...

           The sympathetic gaze turns wary. Maybe she’s not as normal as 
           she looks after all. He moves on. 

           Once again, Delaney’s alone. In the dark. With her thoughts. 
           In her thoughts. She hangs her head in despair.

           Where can she possibly go from here?

           And that’s when:

           The lights down the hallway FLICKER. 

           Delaney looks up. She knows that sign all too well.

           The room begins to TILT, to SPIN...

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        No. 

           Delaney clutches her head, trying to make it stop.

           Objects around her DISAPPEAR into a void... 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t go back. I can’t go back. I 
                        can’t --

           Her vision BLURS, everything goes DARK... And suddenly:

           INT. WHITE ROOM 

           Delaney wakes up. Strapped and cuffed to a hospital-like bed. 
           Tubes in her arms, monitor beeping a steady rhythm. 

           Her skin sallow, her frame thin, her hair greasy. Like she’s 
           been under for months.

           Delaney blinks. Disoriented. Confused. A familiar face 
           standing over her, but not the one she expected.

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx?
                                 JINX
                        Welcome home. We don’t have much 
                        time.

           The room is dark. Business hours long past over. 

           Jinx unhooks her tubes, removes the monitors, slides off her 
           metallic headband. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Where is...?

                                 JINX
                        Bo went home hours ago. I gave 
                        Roger the night off. It’s just us 
                        for now, but we don’t have long. Be 
                        careful when you stand. Your 
                        legs... Well, it’s been awhile 
                        since you’ve used them.

                                 DELANEY
                        Bo -- he told you...?

           Jinx tries to steady her as she struggles to stand.

                                 JINX
                        Please. Eyes everywhere, remember?

           Delaney pauses. Gripping Jinx’s shoulders. Eyes locked.

                                 DELANEY
                             (emphatic)
                        You believe me. 

                                 JINX
                        I believe that if we don’t hurry, 
                        it won’t matter.

           She supports Delaney as they head out the room down the 

           HALLWAY

           Slowly, at first, but gaining momentum. Until Delaney 
           abruptly STOPS. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Wait. We need Mason.

           Jinx just rolls her eyes.

                                 JINX
                        I had a feeling you might say that. 
           INT. WHITE ROOM

           Delaney stands over Mason’s bed. She holds his hand. A flurry 
           of emotions coursing through her. 

                                 DELANEY
                        I’m ready. 

           No answer. Delaney’s eyes dart to the ceiling -- the overhead 
           speaker system.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Jinx?

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Umm. Before we go through with 
                        this. I just want to make sure 
                        you’re prepared.

                                 DELANEY
                        All set. Let’s go.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        I know in your world you guys had a 
                        very... special relationship.

                                 DELANEY
                             (sharp)
                        I’m his Specialist.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Right. See. The thing is, Delaney -- 
                        you’re not. 

                                 DELANEY
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        I mean, you were. But when 
                        everything happened, when you got 
                        your own SomaCell, you couldn’t 
                        exactly care for him anymore, could 
                        you? For any of them. What I’m 
                        saying is, he was reassigned. 
                        Whatever bond you think you have... 
                        he’s not going to remember you. 

           Oh. Shit.

                                 DELANEY
                        Not... at all?
                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Maybe on some subconscious level. 
                        The way a smell can evoke an 
                        emotion. But for all intents and 
                        purposes -- you’ll be a stranger to 
                        him. You understand, right? 

           The best thing in her life, and it’s about to be taken away 
           from her. As if she ever really had it at all. But... what 
           choice is there?

           She studies Mason’s sleeping face. Reaches out with her free 
           hand and strokes his cheek -- a far cry from the smooth skin 
           she remembers.

                                 DELANEY
                        Yes. I understand. Thank you.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Okay. Let’s wake up Sleeping 
                        Beauty. 

           Delaney lets go of Mason’s hand. Places it by his side.

                                 JINX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Disengaging... stand by.

           Delaney’s eyes go to the screen above his bed.

           ONSCREEN -- he’s sleeping peacefully. 

           At least the transition will be easy. 

                                 JINX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Uplink’s terminated. Give him a few 
                        minutes. He’ll be with us shortly.

           Delaney looks around while she waits. Her eyes go across the 
           room to 

           PIKE’S BED. 

           And what she sees on his video screen is horrifying:

           ONSCREEN -- Pike is in a dark, bare cell. No windows. No 
           furnishings. Locked inside a STRAIGHTJACKET. Staring vacantly 
           as he BANGS HIS HEAD against the wall in a rhythmic pattern. 
           Over and over again.

           As Jinx walks in:

                                 DELANEY
                             (appalled)
                        My god. What did they do?
                                 JINX
                        What was easiest. As far as the 
                        board’s concerned, he’s a lifer.

                                 DELANEY
                        But... he was making progress. 

                                 JINX
                        Yeah. With you as his Specialist. 
                        Nobody else could deal with him. 
                        Nobody else wanted to.

                                 DELANEY
                        So they just leave him there? Day 
                        and night? That’s inhumane! It’s 
                        torture!

                                 JINX
                        Not if it isn’t real. Their words. 

                                 MASON (O.S.)
                        Wh--?

                                 DELANEY
                        Mason?

           Mason’s eyes flutter. Blink open. Slowly gaining focus... but 
           not understanding.

                                 MASON
                        Who are you?

           His voice is scratchy and hoarse from months without use.

           It’s a question that pains her to the core, but Delaney 
           smiles through it.

                                 DELANEY
                        A friend.

           He looks up at her, eyes wide and pleading:

                                 MASON
                        I didn’t... kill anyone.

                                 DELANEY
                        I know. 

           Suddenly --

           ALARMS WAIL. LIGHTS FLASH. The entire facility going into 

           LOCKDOWN MODE. 
                                 JINX
                        This. This is why I said hurry. 

           Delaney looks around frantically for something -- anything -- 
           that could be used as a weapon. No luck.

                                 DELANEY
                        Tell me you have a gun. A taser. A 
                        pepper spray key chain.  

                                 JINX
                        Umm... there’s a toolbox and a 
                        first aid kit in the control room.

           Off Delaney:  an idea forming.

           INT. WHITE ROOM

           From an UNSPECIFIED POV:

           Our vision is BLURRY and UNCLEAR, but as things begin to 
           FOCUS, we see:

           We’re in some kind of hospital bed. Two pairs of wrist and 
           ankle restraints on the floor beside us. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           PIKE. Groggily blinking awake. To find a HAMMER resting in 
           his lap. 

           INT. SOMACELL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           DING! The elevator doors WHISK open and 

           A DOZEN SOMACELL AGENTS

           file out. 

           Guns trained. Boots echoing on the linoleum floor. Poised and 
           ready for combat. 

           The LEAD AGENT motions them to start a SWEEP. 

           They methodically branch out down the different hallways. 

           The LEAD AGENT leads his team down the main hall. They move 
           into position as they reach the first White Room door. The 
           Lead Agent expertly reaches for the handle, when --

           THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN and
           PIKE LUNGES OUT, 

           RIPPING the CLAWED END of the hammer through the Lead Agent’s 

           THROAT.

           Blood SPURTS from the Lead Agent as Pike DIVES TO THE FLOOR. 

           In one fluid motion he 

           POUNDS the hammer’s FACE into the next Agent’s RIGHT ANKLE, 

           then 

           TEARS into the Agent’s LEFT ANKLE with the CLAWED END.

           The Agent goes down screaming. 

           The LAST AGENT behind him AIMS HIS GUN, but Pike

           THROWS THE HAMMER into his face,

           sending him TOPPLING backwards onto the floor.

           Pike leaves the hammer buried in the agent’s face. Grinning, 
           he stoops down, and picks up the first two agents’ GUNS. 

           Upgrade. 

           INT. SOMACELL CONTROL ROOM - SAME

           Sporadic SCREAMS and GUNFIRE echo out from the hallway.

           As Jinx grabs a HARD DRIVE from her set-up, Delaney and Mason 
           keep lookout by the door. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Now or never. 

           They open the door and enter the--

           HALLWAY

           --making their way as quickly and quietly as possible to the 

           STAIRWELL DOOR. 

           The hall is empty. The walls riddled with bullet holes. The 
           floor slippery with streaks of blood. 

           But as they reach the door and Delaney moves to ease it open:
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

           SHICK-SHICK! A gun cocks behind them. 

           They slowly turn around to see -- 

           PIKE. Covered in blood in guts, very little of it his own. 
           Aiming at Delaney’s head. 

           She’s never been afraid of him... but she is now. And he 
           knows it.

                                 DELANEY
                        Pike...

           Pike holds... holds... 

           Eyes locked with Delaney’s. He may not remember her, but 
           there’s a glimmer of something unspoken passing between them. 
           There’s hope...

           BANG! Pike shoots. 

           Delaney, Mason, and Jinx all FLINCH, 

           but the bullet wasn’t meant for them. It’s gone behind them, 
           THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW inset in the stairwell door. 

           Delaney pushes open the door and is met with RESISTANCE. 

           She peeks her head in and looks --

           to find the lifeless body of a SomaCell Agent slumped on the 
           other side.

           Pike saved them.

           Their eyes lock once more. This time Delaney’s are full of 
           GRATITUDE. No trace of fear. And when Pike sees this, his 
           expressions softens into something... human. There’s hope for 
           him yet.

           DOWN THE HALL 

           An injured agent limps from one room to another. Desperately 
           searching for safety. 

           Without a word, Pike turns and goes after him. Leaving 
           Delaney and her friends in peace. 

           INT. PARKING GARAGE

           The stairwell doors FLY OPEN and Delaney, Jinx, and Mason 
           come bursting out. Delaney now carries the dead SomaCell 
           agent’s GUN.
           There’s Jinx’s car, ready and waiting. 

           But there’s a man standing in the way. 

                                 JINX
                        Bo?

           It is Bo. Gun raised, ready to fire. 

           Delaney levels her pistol at him, too. It’s a standoff.

           The look in his eyes -- sorrow.

                                 BO
                        What did you do? 

                                 DELANEY
                        You gonna shoot us, Bo? You gonna 
                        shoot me?

           Delaney advances. Testing his limits.

           Both guns hold steady as Delaney moves closer. Closer. Until 
           she’s standing directly in front of him. 

           AND SHE LOWERS HER WEAPON.

           An open target.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have to help me. You 
                        don’t have to believe me. But if 
                        you’re not going to do those 
                        things... Then get the fuck out of 
                        my way.

           Bo doesn’t move. 

           Gun levelled. Eyes hard. Unwavering...

           THEN HE LOWERS HIS WEAPON, TOO. 

           He sighs. 

                                 BO
                        Ah, shit. Yer gonna have to clock 
                        me a good one. 

           Off Delaney:  full of gratitude.

                                 DELANEY
                        Thank you.

           And with that, she PISTOL WHIPS him across the face.
           WHUMP! Bo goes down cold.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go. 

           Everyone follows as Jinx runs for her car. 

           Four car doors SLAM SHUT 

           while tires SCREECH 

           as the car PEELS OUT. 

           INT. JINX’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jinx drives while Delaney has swiveled around in the front 
           passenger seat to get a good look at the back -- where Mason 
           sits, dazed and overwhelmed.

                                 MASON
                        So Allied Venture Partners is 
                        connected to SomaCell through a 
                        shell company called Verdant R&D. 
                        And they set me up for murder? 

                                 DELANEY
                        I don’t know how deep the 
                        connection goes. 

                                 MASON
                        Then let’s go to the police.

                                 DELANEY
                        Too risky. As far as they’re 
                        concerned, we’re fugitives. And we 
                        won’t know anything for sure until--

                                 MASON
                        We get into that high rise. And 
                        we’re just going to, what? Walk 
                        right into a trap?

                                 JINX
                        Would certainly give you a front 
                        row seat. 

           Off their confused faces, Jinx pulls something out of her 
           pocket. An external hard drive.

                                 MASON
                        What is that? 
                                 JINX
                        Thanks to Roger’s unsavory 
                        nocturnal habits, I took it upon 
                        myself to start a back-up system. 
                        Of all our files. And you know who 
                        I thought might be interested in 
                        our little home movies? John Q. 
                        Public.

                                 MASON
                        You really think this will work?

                                 DELANEY
                        I think it’s our best option. 

           Mason gazes out the window, deep in thought.

                                 MASON
                        Huh. 

                                 DELANEY
                        What?

                                 MASON
                        That building. I don’t remember it. 
                        Must be new. 

           Delaney follows his gaze. Frowns. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Jinx? How long have I been under? 

           Jinx doesn’t answer. Intensely focused on the road. Too 
           focused. 

           The truth of her situation sinking in:

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        How long??

           EXT. DELANEY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jinx’s car pulls to the curb across the street.

                                 JINX
                        This is a bad idea. Such a bad 
                        idea. There isn’t even a word that 
                        can adequately describe how much 
                        this is a bad idea.

           But Delaney’s not listening. Single-minded in her mission, 
           she gets and SLAMS the door behind her. 
           As she strides up the driveway, Mason hurries after her.

                                 MASON
                        Hey! Ah, Delaney!

           Delaney ignores him, until he GRABS HER ARM and physically 
           stops her.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Wait a minute. Just... just look!

           That’s when Delaney realizes: 

           There are three cars in the driveway, one we recognize as Tom 
           and Sheila’s. Lights shining from the downstairs windows. 
           It’s another dinner party.

           Through the dining room window, they see Sheila and Tom at 
           the table engaged in playful conversation.

           MOVEMENT comes from the kitchen window. 

           Mason PULLS Delaney behind a row of shrubs where they won’t 
           be seen. They watch as:

           THROUGH THE WINDOW --

           PAUL uncorks a fresh bottle of wine. Suddenly a YOUNG WOMAN 
           wraps her arms around him from behind.

           He turns and kisses her deeply, SPILLING some wine in the 
           process. They laugh it off as he grabs a dish towel. Wearing 
           the first genuine smile we’ve ever seen.

           IN THE YARD -- 

           Delaney fights and struggles as Mason HOLDS HER in a tight 
           grip. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Let go! Let go of me! That is my 
                        husband in there!

                                 MASON
                        Not anymore, it’s not. Listen. I 
                        know I don’t know you, but I do 
                        have this feeling. Something... I 
                        don’t know, familiar. We were 
                        friends in my SomaCell, right?

                                 DELANEY
                        Something like that.
                                    Cherry (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MASON
                        Right. Well a friend would tell you 
                        that this, what you’re about to do, 
                        it’s a mistake. It won’t help 
                        anything. It won’t change anything. 
                        And even if it could, now is not 
                        the time. 

           Delaney stops struggling. Her body shudders. Is she crying? 
           In the darkness it’s hard to tell.

                                 DELANEY
                        We had our problems. Everyone does. 
                        But we were going to try. We 
                        promised each other we would try...

           Mason gets up. Extends a hand to Delaney. 

                                 MASON
                        And maybe you still can. But first, 
                        we have to get our lives back.  

           She hesitates... takes one last look at the place she used to 
           call home... 

           And takes Mason’s hand. 

           INT. CORPORATE HIGH RISE - DAY

           Delaney and Mason take their place in the back of the queue 
           as people pass through the metal detector. 

                                 DELANEY
                             (low)
                        On my mark. Punch to the throat. 
                        Grab the taser. Easy.

                                 MASON
                        You’re sure about this?

                                 DELANEY
                        Let’s just say it’s not my first 
                        time.

           The line starts moving again. Delaney and Mason are almost to 
           the front. 

           Delaney glances at Mason. He looks nervous. Keeps fidgeting. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Steady...
           Security Guard #1 starts to wave them on, then abruptly 
           stops. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                        Hold up. You got your badges?

           Delaney tries to catch Mason’s eye: Now. But just as she’s 
           about to give him a nod--

                                 SECURITY GUARD #2
                             (suddenly suspicious)
                        Wait a minute. Mrs. Thomas? Mr. 
                        Grant?

           Delaney eyes the Security Guard’s TAZER. Ready for 
           anything...

                                 MASON
                        Yes...?

                                 SECURITY GUARD #2
                             (pleasant)
                        You’re on the list. 28th floor. 

           But she wasn’t quite ready for that. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Delaney and Mason stand in silence, watching the floor 
           buttons light up:

                                 MASON
                        So I was thinking... when this is 
                        over...

                                 DELANEY
                        Look. Whatever you think you feel 
                        for me, it’s a lie. Residual 
                        stimuli left over from a chip 
                        implanted by SomaCell. It isn’t 
                        real.

                                 MASON
                        Yeah, no. I get that. It’s just... 
                        I’d like the chance to get to know 
                        you. For the first time.

                                 DELANEY
                        When this is over? 
                                 MASON
                        Right.

           Delaney considers.

                                 DELANEY
                        I’d like that too.

           This is it --

           DING! The 28th floor. The doors slide open to:

           INT. CORPORATE OFFICE SUITE

           A luxurious suite, all chrome and glass, with a breathtaking 
           view of the city. 

           And a MAN IN A SUIT waiting to greet them. 

           The same man who followed Mason in his virtual world.

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        This way please.

           Not exactly the welcome they were expecting. Delaney and 
           Mason share a look:  what choice do they have?

           They follow. 

           The Man In A Suit ushers them into a

           PRIVATE OFFICE

           and shuts the door behind them, leaving them alone with...

           A MAN in his 50s. Dapper and benign in an expensive suit. A 
           LIAISON. 

                                 LIAISON
                        Mrs. Thomas. Mr. Grant. Tell me. 
                        Was this what you were expecting to 
                        find?

                                 MASON
                        And you are? 
                                 LIAISON
                        A man with answers. That is what 
                        you’re here for, isn’t it? Instead 
                        of running, instead of self-
                        preservation, you chose a quest for 
                        truth. Very noble of you. Though 
                        knowledge does come with a price. 
                        You realize, of course, this is 
                        where your journey ends. 

           He holds out a DOCUMENT. Delaney warily takes it.

                                 DELANEY
                             (surprised)
                        Mason’s intake form? 

                                 LIAISON
                        I think you’ll find his testimony 
                        rather... predictable at this 
                        point.

                                 DELANEY
                        He didn’t kill anyone. He was 
                        framed. By SomaCell. And so was I.

                                 LIAISON
                             (smiles)
                        Is that what you think?

                                 DELANEY
                        But you’re only half right. Our 
                        intentions aren’t entirely noble. 
                        Part of it’s a quest for truth, 
                        sure. Mostly though... we just 
                        wanted to see your face. 

           The Liaison’s smile falters momentarily.

                                 LIAISON
                        I’m sorry?  

           Mason nods at a giant FLAT SCREEN mounted on one wall.

                                 MASON
                        Nice TV you got there. You might 
                        want to turn it on. 

           Suddenly -- the Man In A Suit BURSTS into the office.

                                 MAN IN A SUIT
                        Channel Four. 

           Curious, the Liaison turns on the TV which is set to a news 
           station, where a somber ANCHORWOMAN addresses the camera:
           ONSCREEN --

                                 ANCHORWOMAN
                        --footage from an anonymous source 
                        that provides us with what could be 
                        the world’s first exclusive look 
                        inside the Department of Justice’s 
                        much-lauded but highly controversial 
                        SomaCell rehabilitation program. 
                        Let’s take a look.

           The screen cuts to footage of a scene we recognize:

           FOOTAGE --

           Of Bo and Delaney inside the police interrogation cell.

                                 DELANEY
                        Mason was onto something big before 
                        he got arrested. Some kind of 
                        corporate fraud... something. And 
                        now the very system that sentenced 
                        him, that is denying him parole, is 
                        also covering up whatever it is he 
                        found. Do you understand the 
                        implications here?

                                 BO
                        Delaney...

                                 DELANEY
                        An innocent man! Truly innocent. 
                        Locked away for the rest of his 
                        life in such a way that his 
                        knowledge is sure never to get out. 

           BACK TO THE ANCHORWOMAN --

                                 ANCHORWOMAN
                        The person they’re referring to is 
                        Mason Grant, charged with the 
                        brutal murder of his co-worker late 
                        last year. Throughout the trial, 
                        Mr. Grant professed his innocence--

           The Liaison FLIPS to another channel...

                                 ANCHORMAN
                        --shocking allegations of false 
                        imprisonment--

           And another channel...

                        --what could be a powerful blow to 
                        the justice system--

           And another channel...

                                 CO-ANCHOR 
                        --more on this story as it 
                        develops.

           The Liaison PAUSES the TV. His expression sours. 

                                 DELANEY
                        And that’s just the tip of the 
                        iceberg. We have it all on tape. 

                                 MASON
                        Your man following and threatening 
                        me. A paper trail of embezzled 
                        funds--

                                 LIAISON
                        All in a virtual setting. None of 
                        that is real. 

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s real enough. That “virtual 
                        setting” determines the fate of 
                        hundreds of thousands of 
                        incarcerated citizens in this 
                        country. Either it’s real enough to 
                        serve as hard evidence, or the whole 
                        system is a sham. Either way, the 
                        program’s over. Everything SomaCell 
                        has built -- done. 

                                 LIAISON
                        Interesting.
                             (beat)
                        But let me shed some light on the 
                        situation as I see it. Two escaped 
                        convicts, one wildly implausible 
                        story, and zero credibility given 
                        the trail of bodies they’ve left in 
                        their wake.   

                                 MASON
                        What bodies...?

           The Liaison changes channels once again. This time to a 
           SECURITY FEED of

           THE DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY --
           Where both security guards and half a dozen civilians have 
           been slaughtered.

           Delaney and Mason REEL. 

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jesus. 

                                 DELANEY
                        It’s your word against ours. 

                                 LIAISON
                        Wrong again, I’m afraid. 

           Suddenly -- 

           BAM BAM BAM! Bullets RIP INTO MASON’S BODY from behind, where 

           THE MAN IN A SUIT has drawn a weapon of his own. He pivots 
           and FIRES at Delaney, but

           Delaney DIVES FOR COVER behind a desk. 

           As Mason sinks to the floor, the Man In A Suit CHARGES 
           forward. But Mason 

           GRABS him, sending him 

           SPRAWLING, the gun flying out of reach. 

           The gun lands almost equidistant between Delaney and the Main 
           In A Suit. Simultaneously, they 

           LUNGE 

           for it, blocking it from view as

           BANG! 

           The gun goes off. But who did it hit? 

           The Man In A Suit rolls to his side and -- BLOOD BLOSSOMS on 
           his expensive shirt. 

           Delaney rolls over as well. Gun in hand. 

           The sight of Mason’s bullet-riddled body gives her a cold 
           resolve. She picks herself up. Trains her gun on the Liaison. 
           Her hands are steady. Confident and callous. 

                                 LIAISON (CONT’D)
                             (smiles slightly)
                        Still think you were framed for 
                        murder, Mrs. Thomas?
                                 DELANEY
                        No. You’re right. I’m guilty as 
                        charged.

           BAM! A kill shot. Right between the eyes. Blood pools on the 
           floor around the Liaison’s still corpse.

           Delaney drops the gun and RUNS to Mason. Kneels over him, 
           surveys the damage. 

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        Oh god. 

           He coughs and sputters. A bloody mess. 

                                 MASON
                        Delaney...

           Delaney hastily removes her outer shirt. 

           Presses it into his wounds. 

           Desperately trying to stop the bleeding.

                                 DELANEY
                        You’re okay... you’re okay...

           But then his hand GRASPS her arm. Firmly.

                                 MASON
                        Delaney.

           Delaney pauses. Looks into his eyes. And realizes, with 
           HORROR:

                                 DELANEY
                        You’re okay.

           It’s true. Despite lethal bullet wounds, Mason is calm and 
           collected, breathing steadily. Impossible.

           Unless...

           CLOMP-CLOMP. Two polished shoes suddenly step up beside 
           Delaney. She gazes up to see:

           Bo.

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        No. 

           Wearing that unmistakable SomaCell wristwatch.

           SHE’S STILL IN HER VIRTUAL WORLD. She has been this whole time.
                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        No!

           She recoils from him. Refusing to believe...

                                 DELANEY (CONT’D)
                        None of it? None of it was real? 
                        This whole time?

                                 BO
                        I’m so sorry. 

           But she’s not giving up. She LEAPS to her feet and SPRINTS 
           for the elevator. She slams her palm into the elevator call 
           button, again and again and again.

           DING!

           The elevator doors slide open to reveal:

           A blank wall.

           Delaney SCREAMS in anger and agony. POUNDS her fists against 
           the wall. 

           And when she turns back around, everything’s different:  The 
           corporate office. The bodies. Mason. Gone. 

           And in their place:

           A simple, austere room. Two folding chairs placed before a 
           table. Three bigger, more expensive chairs behind the table. 

           And, sitting in those chairs, two SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVES 
           and a JUDGE.

           The parole board.

           Bo reaches out to her, beckoning. 

                                 BO (CONT’D)
                        Delaney, it’s time.

           But Delaney is frozen in place. He takes a seat without her.

           The board members unlock briefcases. Open files. Check 
           documents. 
                                 SOMACELL REPRESENTATIVE #1
                        This is the thirty-fourth cycle 
                        review of Convict V625 Delaney 
                        Thomas, incarcerated November 14, 
                        2015 on charges of murder in the 
                        first degree, assault with a deadly 
                        weapon, possession of an illegal 
                        firearm, aiding and abetting a 
                        known fugitive, and conspiracy 
                        against a federal institution.
                             (a nod to the judge)
                        The Honorable Judge Cole presiding. 

           Behind the table, Judge Cole addresses Bo. 

                                 JUDGE COLE
                        Counselor. How long have you 
                        overseen Mrs. Thomas? 

                                 DELANEY
                        Just over two years, Your Honor. 

           Delaney REELS. Two years?!

                                 JUDGE COLE
                        And how would you describe Mrs. 
                        Thomas’s behavior during this most 
                        recent cycle?

           Bo takes a deep breath. And when he speaks, his voice is 
           heavy with emotion. 

                                 BO
                        I regret to inform the board that, 
                        despite my attempts at 
                        intervention, Mrs. Thomas did not 
                        achieve a breakthrough, and was not 
                        successful in deviating from the 
                        path that originally lead to her 
                        incarceration. 

                                 JUDGE COLE
                        Counselor, in the time you’ve been 
                        working with her, as Mrs. Thomas 
                        ever successfully completed a cycle 
                        completely divergent from her 
                        original path?

           Bo glances at Delaney. As if ashamed of some betrayal.

                                 BO
                        No, Your Honor. 
                                 JUDGE COLE
                        In your opinion, is she capable of 
                        true rehabilitation?

           Bo hesitates. Really considering the question. After all, 
           this is Mr. “Once A Criminal, Always A Criminal.”

                                 BO
                        Your Honor... a friend a’ mine once 
                        said that everyone is capable of 
                        change, as long as one person is 
                        capable of believing in them. 
                             (beat)
                        So yeah. I do think I’ll be able to 
                        reach her. One day.

           Judge Cole and the two SomaCell Representatives confer...

                                 JUDGE COLE
                        Your conviction is admirable, 
                        Counselor. We can only hope that 
                        one day it’s rewarded. Best of 
                        luck, and we’ll reevaluate upon 
                        completion of Cycle 35. 

           Bo nods. 

                                 BO
                        Thanks, Your Honor. Gentlemen. 

           The Judge and SomaCell Representatives make their way to the 
           elevator. Delaney just stares at them as they brush past her 
           and hit the call button. 

           The elevator DINGS immediately -- doors whisk open and close 
           behind them.

           Leaving Delaney and Bo alone. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Bo. You have to--

                                 BO
                        No. You listen to me. There’s one 
                        way out of this, just one. And 
                        you’re the only person who can make 
                        it happen. What have I told you 
                        over and over again? You have to 
                        stop caring. 

                                 DELANEY
                             (realizes)
                        You mean Mason. 
                                 BO
                        Forget him. I don’t care if you’re 
                        fucking soul mates, you wanna get 
                        outta here, he’s just a number. Do 
                        you understand? You sever that 
                        tie... none of this shit happens.

                                 DELANEY
                        I can’t--

                                 BO
                        It’s your life I’m talkin about 
                        here! A convict is a convict. A 
                        convict is a convict -- 
                             (shakes her)
                        -- say it!

                                 DELANEY
                        You don’t really believe that. And 
                        if you can’t do it, how can I?  

           And in that moment, Bo realizes he’s just going to lose her 
           all over again. 

           With nothing else to do, he wraps her in a hug. If ever we 
           thought he didn’t care, our doubts can be laid to rest.

                                 BO
                        A convict is a convict. A convict--

           Suddenly, we FLASH TO:

           INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

           Delaney opens her eyes. Removes her metallic headband. Rubs 
           her shoulder. 

                                 DELANEY
                        Ow.

           Beside her, in his hospital-like bed, PIKE sleeps soundly.

                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        You okay? 
                             (beat)
                        Delaney?

           Delaney gets up. Still rubbing her shoulder.

                                 DELANEY
                        Stabbed.
                                 JINX (O.S.)
                        Again?

           Delaney just rolls her eyes. 

           As she’s about to leave the room... 

           BO ENTERS.

                                 DELANEY
                        I owe you twenty bucks. Shoulder. 
                             (off his look)
                        What’s wrong with you?

           He struggles for composure.

                                 BO
                        Under the weather is all. Not to 
                        worry, it’ll pass.

                                 DELANEY
                             (distracted)
                        He’s regressing. Pike.

                                 BO
                        Well you know what they say. If at 
                        first you don’t succeed. Try, try 
                        again. 

           Bo puts his arm around her. But as they walk out of the White 
           Room, we gradually

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           The scene is actually framed within a TV MONITOR. We’ve been 
           watching this whole thing play out ON SCREEN. 

           As we continue to pull back, we see the monitor is in a--

           WHITE ROOM

           [With a subtly altered color palette; the first time we’re 
           truly seeing the real world.]

           --mounted above a hospital-type bed, where the REAL DELANEY 
           is locked in a deep, coma-like slumber. Wearing a metallic 
           headband, hooked up to various vital sign monitors. Wrists 
           and ankles cuffed to the bed.

           Just one of a dozen convicts, all sleeping peacefully. Their 
           lives playing out over and over on the monitors above them.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
