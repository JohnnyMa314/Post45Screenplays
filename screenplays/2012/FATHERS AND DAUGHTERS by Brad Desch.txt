           Title:  Briarwood, Kentucky. 1985.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

           A small, secluded hospital. Late summer.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           JAKE DAVIS, late 30s, is in a tie and jacket. He sits on a
           neatly made bed.

           He may not be particularly handsome, or perhaps he is, but
           there is something about him-- a presence, a charm that is
           unmistakable.

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

           A NURSE in silent white shoes walks down a spotless corridor.
           From the faces of the patients she passes we suspect this
           might be a mental hospital.

           She pokes her head into the staff lounge. Nods to a DOCTOR on
           the phone. He hangs up and joins her in the hall.

           They walk in silence.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           The doctor and nurse enter Jake’s room.

                                 NURSE
                        Jake, it’s time.

           Jake gets up from the bed. The doctor shakes his hand.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We expect great things.

           Jake smiles politely.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Again.

           INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

           Jake sits in the back of a limousine. Lost in his thoughts.
           EXT. BACK ROADS - DAY

           The limousine cruises down a country road. A BOY, 6, sits by
           a fruit stand. He has no customers.

           INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DAY - JAKE’S FLASHBACK

           A stylish, prewar apartment. More literary than lush.

           Jake tosses up KATIE, a beautiful 2-year-old-girl.
           She giggles hysterically.

           Jake kisses her and she kisses TRISH, Jake’s wife and her
           mother. The three of them make a little kissing triangle.
           Life is good.

           EXT.  HIGHWAY - DAY (1985)

           The limousine rolls along the highway. An overhead sign
           reads, AIRPORT. The car moves into that lane.

           EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

           The DRIVER hands Jake his bags.

                                 DRIVER
                        Good luck to you, sir.

                                 JAKE
                        You too.

           A SKYCAP, a dignified older black man, approaches Jake.

                                 SKYCAP
                        Where you goin’?

                                 JAKE
                        New York.

                                 SKYCAP
                        The big city.

                                 JAKE
                        You ever been?

                                 SKYCAP
                                (laughs)
                        Oh, no.
           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           Jake is asleep. A copy of Time in his lap.

           A YOUNG WOMAN in a University of Kentucky sweatshirt
           approaches him.

                                 WOMAN
                        Excuse me? Hi...

           Jake opens his eyes.

                                 WOMAN
                        I hate to do this. But are
                        you Jake Davis?

                                 JAKE
                        No.

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re not?

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t even know who that is.

                                 WOMAN
                        He’s this really famous writer.

           She holds out a novel, Leaving The Dance by Jake Davis.

                                 WOMAN
                        I have to read it for my
                        lit class.

           Jake shrugs.

                                 WOMAN
                        You sure?

           The woman flips the book around. On the back cover is a large
           picture that is obviously Jake.

                                 JAKE
                        Sorry.

                                 WOMAN
                                (nasty)
                        Don’t be. They say he
                        went nuts.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT - JAKE’S FLASHBACK

           A lone car speeds along an icy country road.
           INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jake and Trish are in the middle of a vicious argument.
           A 3-year-old Katie sits frightened in back.

                                 TRISH
                        You were flirting!

                                 JAKE
                        I was talking to her!
                        Jesus Christ!

                                 TRISH
                        I know the difference
                        between talking and
                        flirting.

                                 JAKE
                        Do you?!

                                 TRISH
                        Do you?!

           Jake takes a turn hard. He drives much too fast.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY (1985)

           Jake stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 3, who sits between her PARENTS
           and sings to herself while she colors in a coloring book.

           Her father gently rubs her neck. “All happy families...”

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT - JAKE’S FLASHBACK

           The car has flipped over. There’s an ambulance, a police car
           and blood everywhere.

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           A bandaged Jake and Katie sit silently in a hospital waiting
           room. Jake holds his daughter’s hand tightly.

           A SURGEON walks towards them. Shakes his head no.

           INT. MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Katie plays loudly in the apartment. Jake barely notices.

           He’s unshaven, looks awful. A bowl of soup sits untouched.
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Jake shaves carelessly. Cuts himself. A drop of blood plops
           into the sink water. Jake stares at his bleeding cheek.

           He purposely cuts himself deeper. Red drops ripple the water.

           INT. MAHANATTAN APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

           A large suitcase sits in the living room. Jake’s sister-in-
           law, ELIZABETH, and her husband, WILLIAM, wait by the door.

           Jake kneels down to talk to a 3-year-old Katie.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m going away. But I’ll
                        be back soon.

                                 KATIE
                        Will you be back tonight?

                                 JAKE
                        Not tonight, honey.

                                 KATIE
                        Tomorrow?

                                 JAKE
                        You’re gonna stay with Aunt
                        Elizabeth and Uncle William.

                                 KATIE
                        I want to stay with you.

           Katie hugs him tightly.

                                 JAKE
                        You will. When I come back.

                                 KATIE
                        Where are you going?

           Jake fidgets with his hands.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m going to visit with
                        some people.

                                 KATIE
                        I want to come!

                                 JAKE
                        Not this time.
           Katie won’t look at him.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie...

           She continues to look away.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie...

           She reluctantly turns to him.

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll be back before you
                        know it... Let me see
                        your bravest face.

           Katie makes a stern face. Jake holds her tight.

                                 JAKE
                        I love you a trillion trillions.

                                 KATIE
                        I love you more than the
                        last number.

           Jake squeezes her. Won’t let go.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jake...

           William taps his watch.

                                 JAKE
                                (whispers)
                        You’re my Potato Chip,
                        you know that?

           Katie nods.

                                 JAKE
                        You and nobody else.

           Katie smiles. This secret information makes her happy.
           Jake hugs her again. Can’t let go.

           INT. LAGUARDIA AIRPORT - DAY (1985)

           TED, Jake’s agent and best friend, picks him up.

                                 TED
                        Hey!!

           They hug affectionately.

           INT. LIMO - DAY

           The car battles airport traffic.

                                 TED
                        You look good.

                                 JAKE

                                 JAKE
                        Jesus Christ!! Always with
                        the pressure!! I’ve been
                        back five fucking minutes.

           Jake laughs.

                        a son-of-a-bitch.

           The car crosses the Triboro bridge. The view of the Manhattan
           skyline is spectacular.

           Jake nods.

           INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           The apartment we saw in the flashbacks.

           Jake looks around. Picks up a picture of him, Trish and
           Katie. Everything is as he left it-- and yet it’s not.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jake takes a very hot shower. Steam everywhere. He scrubs
           himself fiercely.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           Jake has a towel wrapped around his waist. Wipes the steam
           from the mirror. Studies himself.

                                 JAKE
                        You got old and ugly.
           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jake dresses. The TV is on. There’s a news story about
           President Reagan and the Soviet Union.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE DRIVE - NIGHT

           Jake hails a taxi.

                                 JAKE
                        79th and Fifth.

           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - DAY (2012)

           A lovely fall day. We can tell it’s the present because of
           the abundance of iPads, laptops, cell phones.

           A cell rings with the theme music to Sponge Bob.

           Katie Davis, now 32, diligently highlights a text book.
           Gorgeous and serious-- there’s a palpable sadness to her
           which only enhances her beauty.

           EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - CAMPUS - LATER

           Katie walks across the quad. EVAN, a business school student,
           approaches her.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, Katie, wait up.

           She doesn’t stop. Evan has to scurry to catch her.

                                 EVAN
                        What’s goin’ on?

                                 KATIE
                        Studying.

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know why you waste
                        your time as a fucking grad
                        student in psychology.

           Katie picks up her pace.

                                 EVAN
                        Listen to people whine
                        about their fucking
                        problems all day.
                                 KATIE
                        I notice you like to say
                        fuck a lot.

                                 EVAN
                        So?

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve often thought men who
                        say it, don’t generally do it.

                                 EVAN
                        Are you always this mean
                        to guys who want to go
                        out with you?

                                 KATIE
                        Pretty much.

           INT. FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT - NIGHT (1985)

           A luxurious apartment that says wealth and privilege.
           The doorbell rings. A 5-year-old Katie opens the door.

                                 KATIE
                        Daddy!!!

           She leaps into his arms.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie...

           They hug tightly.

                                 KATIE
                        You smell like you.

                                 JAKE
                        I missed you every
                        second of every day.

           Katie won’t let go. Jake walks in carrying her.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey, Andrew, Michael!
                        How are my ball players?

           Jake has presents for ANDREW and MICHAEL, 8-year-old twins.
           They open them quickly, a basketball and two New York Knicks
           jerseys. The boys dribble the ball.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Not in the house.
           They stop instantly.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Welcome back, Jake.

           William forcefully shakes his hand.

                                 JAKE
                        How’s the law?

                                 WILLIAM
                        Always good.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I have coffee and dessert
                        in the dining room.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - MANHATTAN - NIGHT (2012)

           A lovely, airy apartment on Central Park West. Not your
           typical grad student dwelling.

           Clothes are strewn on the floor. Katie and Evan are
           post-coital. Evan tries to keep from grinning-- can’t.

                                 EVAN
                        You don’t really like me,
                        do you?

                                 KATIE
                        Not so much.

                                 EVAN
                        So why’d you sleep
                        with me?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 EVAN
                        Tell me.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s the difference?

                                 EVAN
                        Tell me!

                                 KATIE
                        I didn’t have a chance
                        to get to the gym.

           Evan ponders this.
           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT (1985)

           Katie sits in Jake’s lap-- smiles ear to ear. Jake puts his
           coffee cup down.

                                 JAKE
                                (to Katie)
                        Why don’t we get some
                        pajamas for tonight and
                        tomorrow we’ll come
                        back and...

           Elizabeth turns to DOTTIE, a black maid in uniform.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Would you get them ready
                        for bed?

           Andrew and Michael go off.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Katie, you too, darling.

           Katie looks at her Dad.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie’s sleeping at home
                        tonight.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’d like to discuss a
                        private matter.

           Katie looks at Jake. He’s silent.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        It’s time to get your
                        pajamas on, dear.

           Katie again looks at Jake. A long moment.

                                 JAKE
                        Put your pajamas on, sweetheart.

           She reluctantly heads to the bedroom.

                                 JAKE
                        And then pack what you
                        need for tonight.

           Katie lights up. Hurries off.

           William pours Jake more coffee. Pauses for effect like the
           high-priced lawyer he is.
                                 WILLIAM
                        18 months away.

                                 JAKE

           William is annoyed at being corrected. Jake picks up on this.

                                 JAKE
                        And I want you both to know
                        how much I appreciate your
                        taking care of Katie.
                        She looks terrific. I’m
                        indescribably grateful.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We have a safe, happy home
                        here.

                                 JAKE
                        Yes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I imagine it’s quite an
                        adjustment being back
                        in Manhattan.

                                 JAKE
                        I missed the city terribly.
                        Missed Katie more.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Miss Patricia?

           William shoots Elizabeth a look.

                                 JAKE
                        Being back doesn’t solve
                        that.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jake, I want to propose
                        something to you. And just
                        hear me out. Do me that favor.

           He has Jake’s attention.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Let Katie sleep here tonight.
                        You get settled. Get your sea
                        legs so to speak. And then in
                        a week or a month or whenever
                        you’re ready-- have Katie
                        come live with you.
                                 JAKE
                        That’s not necessary.

                                 WILLIAM
                        It’s no hardship for us.

                                 JAKE
                        I really am fine.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We enjoy having Katie here.

                                  JAKE
                        It got late.

           Jake stands up ending the conversation.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        We’d like to adopt Katie.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Elizabeth God-damnit!!

                                 JAKE
                        What?!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ve never felt comfortable
                        hiding our intentions. Jake
                        loves Katie. Even a writer
                        as gifted as he is, can’t put
                        into words how much. And that’s
                        why he wants what’s best for her.
                        Why he understands her happiness
                        must come before his. Even at
                        the expense of his.

                                 WILLIAM
                        She’s happy here. She loves
                        Andrew and Michael. You should
                        see how the three of them...

                                 JAKE
                        Katie is my daughter!!

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’re very comfortable.

                                 ELIZABETH
                                (corrects him)
                        We’re filthy rich. Staying at
                        Briarwood for a year and a
                        half I imagine you ran through
                        a lot of your money.
                                 JAKE
                        That’s none of your concern.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Of course you’d see her all
                        the time-- whenever you like.
                        And it would free you up to
                        concentrate on your writing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        And your lady friends.

                                 JAKE
                        You just can’t help yourself,
                        can you?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Apparently not.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Think it over, that’s all
                        we ask.

                                 JAKE
                        You’ll have to kill me first.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Then perhaps we should go for
                        a drive.

           INT. TAXI - NIGHT

           Katie leans her head on Jake’s chest, all smiles. Jake’s
           obviously still rattled from the conversation.  

           INT. JAKE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jake’s in a t-shirt and pajama bottoms. Brushes his teeth.

           Suddenly he spits out his toothbrush. White paste all over
           his mouth.

           He starts to involuntarily rub his hands together and quickly
           rock back and forth.

           EXT. SOCIAL SERVICES AGENCY - HARLEM - DAY (2012)

           A rundown social services agency with bars on the windows.
           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           DIEGO, a 4-year-old Hispanic boy, is in Katie’s dowdy office.
           He has drawn an elaborate picture of a house and a large sun.

                                 KATIE
                        That’s beautiful, Diego.
                        I’ve never seen purple
                        trees like that before.

           Diego beams.

                                 KATIE
                        But I’m afraid our time is
                        up. We’ll have to continue
                        next week.

           Diego’s smile disappears.

                                 KATIE
                        Hey, I need a New York-sized hug.
                                (Diego hugs her)
                        You are the world’s best hugger,
                        you know that?

                                 DIEGO
                        Five more minutes?

                                 KATIE
                        I’ll see you next time.

           Katie hands him his picture to take home. Diego’s upset.

                                 KATIE
                        C’mere.

           Katie takes his picture. She grabs the sun and pretends it’s
           in her hand.

                                 KATIE
                        Open your mouth.

           He does. She puts “the sun” in his mouth.

                                 KATIE
                        There’s no way you can frown
                        with the sun in your mouth.
                        Go ahead. Try.

           Diego tries to frown but starts to laugh.

                                 KATIE
                        And every time you laugh
                        sunshine comes out.
           Diego laughs more.

                                 KATIE
                        See? I’m getting a tan.

           He covers his mouth playfully. Leaves happily.

           INT. STAFF LOUNGE - LATER

           Katie drinks coffee in the makeshift lounge. Watches the
           horror of the day on CNN.

           DR. ANN CORMAN, the head of the agency, comes in.

                                 DOCTOR CORMAN
                        Have a sec?

           INT. DR. CORMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 DOCTOR CORMAN
                        A case just got transferred
                        to us-- a 5-year-old girl,
                        Lucy Carter. Her father died
                        when she was an infant, drug
                        overdose. Her mother was a
                        prostitute murdered by a
                        john almost a year ago.

                                 KATIE
                        Where’s she living?

                                 DOCTOR CORMAN
                        Foster parents on 133rd Street.
                        She hasn’t spoken a word since
                        her mother’s funeral.

           Katie’s eyes nearly pop out.

                                 KATIE
                        She hasn’t talked for a year?

           Doctor Corman shakes her head no.

                                 KATIE
                        How was her speaking before?

                                 DOCTOR CORMAN
                        A chatterbox.

                                 KATIE
                        Any physiological...
                                 DOCTOR CORMAN
                        Not a thing... I thought
                        you might be interested.

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           LUCY CARTER, 5, is a beautiful black girl. She sits on the
           floor where she has drawn several pictures.

                                 KATIE
                        Which one’s your favorite?

           Lucy doesn’t say a word.

                                 KATIE
                        Just point.

           Lucy doesn’t respond.

                                 KATIE
                        I like them all, but I
                        think I like this one best.
                                (points to a picture)
                        I love what a deep, dark blue
                        the ocean is... Is that the
                        ocean or just a lake?

           Lucy is silent.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, it’s beautiful
                        whichever it is. Lucy,
                        we’re done for today.
                        Can you put the crayons
                        away, please.

           Lucy puts the crayons in a metal tin.

                                 KATIE
                        I really enjoyed spending
                        time with you. I’d like to
                        see you twice a week if
                        that’s OK with you?

           Lucy says nothing.

                                 KATIE
                        Since you don’t object,
                        I’m going to schedule you
                        for an hour on Tuesdays
                        and Thursdays.
           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Katie pulls out a photo album. She pages through a bunch of
           pictures of her and Jake when she was 5.

           She smiles ear to ear in all of them.

           INT. CAMPUS BAR - LATER

           Katie sits at the bar in a sexy halter top. Downs a beer.
           Three empty bottles in front of her.

           A GUY approaches.

                                 GUY
                        Four beers, huh?

                                 KATIE
                        You must be a math major.

                                 GUY
                        Not even lite beer. Unusual
                        for a girl.

                                 KATIE
                        I have self-destructive
                        tendencies.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The guy from the bar, pants around his ankles, pounds away at
           Katie on her living room floor. He SCREAMS in ecstasy.

           INT. BAR - DAY (1985)

           William sits at a table. Jake walks in, sits down without
           saying a word.

           A WAITER comes over.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Scotch. Neat.

           The waiter looks at Jake. Jake shakes his head no.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Elizabeth can be... difficult.
                        No one knows this better than
                        I do.

           Jake’s silent. He isn’t going to make this easy.
                                 WILLIAM
                        Jake, it’s not even two
                        years since she lost her
                        sister. They were very close.

                                 JAKE
                        Trish hated Elizabeth.

                                 WILLIAM
                                (smiles)
                        Sisters sometimes say things.

                                 JAKE
                        Found her controlling, selfish,
                        judgemental...

           William’s smile fades.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’re two very bright men--
                        let’s speak frankly. We
                        proposed something which
                        you’ve let us know is of
                        no interest. We won’t bring
                        it up again. But there is
                        another matter to address.

           William takes a thick folder from his briefcase.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Last fall they weren’t letting
                        you receive mail or take calls.
                        So without direction from you,
                        we had to make a decision about
                        school for Katie. Andrew and
                        Michael are at Collegiate which,
                        as you know, is only for boys.

           The waiter appears with William’s scotch. He takes a
           surprisingly long swig.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Katie got in everywhere we
                        applied. I’m sure being your
                        daughter didn’t hurt.

           William hands Jake a glossy booklet for THE BREARLEY SCHOOL.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We accepted an offer at
                        Brearley. If there’s a better
                        girls’ school in the country
                        it’d be news to me.
           Jake pages through the booklet. Pictures of white, preppy
           girls in bows looking intellectually challenged.

                                 JAKE
                        They wear uniforms.

                                 WILLIAM
                        They have an 80% acceptance
                        rate to the Ivy League.

                                 JAKE
                        William...

                                 WILLIAM
                        You can be as progressive as
                        you want, but the public schools
                        are a jungle. At PS 75-- your
                        neighborhood school-- a second
                        grader was stabbed to death last
                        year. By a fifth grader. Is that
                        what you want for Katie?

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll figure something out.

                                 WILLIAM
                        School starts Tuesday-- what
                        are you going to figure out
                        by then?

           Jake is at a loss. William slides the folder towards Jake.
           Jake stares at the booklet for a long minute.

           He begins to rock in his seat and quickly rub his hands
           together. He suddenly looks like a very troubled man.

           William is shocked to see this. After a moment, Jake stops.
           William continues as if nothing happened.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Do you have any idea how hard
                        it is to get a child into a good
                        private school in Manhattan?
                        Everybody who applies is rich,
                        connected and underhanded.

                                 JAKE
                        I said I’ll figure it out!!

           Jake stands up.

                                 JAKE
                        We’re not raising my daughter
                        by committee.
           He throws a five dollar bill on the table.

                                 JAKE
                        Let me buy you a drink.

           INT. PSYCHIATRIST’S OFFICE - DAY

           DOCTOR BARRET, 50, is a leading Manhattan psychiatrist.

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        How long has the hand
                        rubbing and rocking
                        been going on?

                                 JAKE
                        Shortly after the accident.
                        Almost two years.

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        And they never observed it
                        at Briarwood?

                                 JAKE
                        It never happened in public
                        before. Only when I was alone.

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        You didn’t tell the
                        doctors?

                                 JAKE
                        I wanted to come home.

           The doctor takes his glasses off. Rubs his eyes.

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        Well, the good news is hand
                        rubbing is inconsistent with
                        epilepsy. And I don’t think
                        we have to seriously concern
                        ourselves with autism.

                                 JAKE
                        What then?

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        The most benign interpretation
                        is it’s just an idiosyncratic
                        response to stress.

                                 JAKE
                        And a less benign
                        interpretation?
                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        Jake, I’m not a big believer
                        in labeling behavior.

           Jake stares at him insistently.

                                 DOCTOR BARRET
                        Brief psychotic breaks.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S APT - FIFTH AVENUE - DAY (2012)

           Elizabeth’s apartment is as immaculate as it was 27 years
           earlier.

           But Elizabeth, now in her 60s, has aged badly.

           She and Katie have brunch. JAY, a young Filipino housekeeper,
           fills their coffee cups.

                                 KATIE
                        Thank you.

           They eat in silence. Finally:

                                 ELIZABETH
                                (an invitation)
                        I’m going to visit Andrew in
                        Washington next weekend.

                                 KATIE
                        Finals are coming up.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Another time.

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.

           They continue to eat.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Remember little Richie Merkel
                        from down the hall?

                                 KATIE
                        Uh-huh.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        He was visiting his parents
                        the other day. He’s now a
                        strapping young man.

           Katie shows no interest.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        He asked about you-- always
                        does. He’s in his last year
                        at Yale Law School. A very
                        nice boy.

                                 KATIE
                        What would I do with a
                        nice boy?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Probably the same thing
                        you do with the other boys
                        after a few drinks.

                                 KATIE
                        You raised me.

           EXT. PS 75 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY (1985)

           Jake and Katie stand outside the dreary school. She is one of
           a few white faces in a sea of black students.

           They wait their turn to go through the metal detector.
           Katie sets the alarm off. They make her go through again.

           She sets it off again. A FEMALE POLICE OFFICER frisks her.

           Katie looks at her father in distress. He fakes an
           encouraging smile.

           INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

           Jake and Katie sit in a crowded office. It’s chaos. Unclear
           who, if anybody, is in charge.

           Jake gets up. Approaches MISS SNYDER, a morbidly obese woman
           in a sleveless top.

                                 JAKE
                                (attempting charm)
                        Hi there...

                                 MISS SNYDER
                                (not looking up)
                        We’ll call you.

                                 JAKE
                        We’ve been here three hours.
                        She’s missed half the day.
                                 MISS SNYDER
                        Ain’t missing much.

           CHARLES, a hulking teenager, struts into the office.

                                 CHARLES
                        I forgot my class again,
                        Miss Snyder.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        Room 304, Charles.

           Charles heads out.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        It’s that way.

           She points in the opposite direction.

                                 CHARLES
                        Oh yeah.

           He looks threateningly at Jake as he passes.

                                 JAKE
                        He goes to school here?

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        For the last 11 years.

                                 JAKE
                        Look, I’m not asking for
                        special treatment or anything,
                        but I am a little famous.

           She stares at him. No idea who he is.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        Not that famous.

                                 JAKE
                        I’ve won two Pulitzer Prizes.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        Is that like a Grammy?

                                 JAKE
                        Well, yeah, in a way.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        You know Prince?

                                 JAKE
                        Prince of...?
                                 MISS SNYDER
                        Prince! The man who rocks
                        my world.

           She sings a couple bars of “Purple Rain.” She actually has a
           beautiful voice.

                                 JAKE
                        No, I don’t know Prince.

                                 MISS SNYDER
                        We’ll call you.

           Jake sits down. A WOMAN with no warmth in her face appears.

                                 WOMAN
                        Katie Davis.

           They get up.

                                 WOMAN
                        You in room 108.

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll walk you.

           Katie is terrified. They start towards the classroom.

                                 WOMAN
                                (to Jake)
                        You not allowed.

           Jake bends down to kiss Katie goodbye, but the woman has
           already whisked her away. Katie turns back in despair. Jake
           blows her a kiss.

                                 JAKE
                        Have a great first day!

           As she turns the corner, his face drops-- fights off tears.

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY (2012)

           Katie watches as Lucy finishes a jigsaw puzzle.

                                 KATIE
                        Only a couple more pieces.

           Lucy concentrates on the puzzle. Connects the last piece.

                                 KATIE
                        That’s great, Lucy! Are you
                        proud of yourself?
           Lucy is silent.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, I’m proud of you!
                        You’re amazing at puzzles.
                        Should we read a book
                        before you go?

           Lucy gets up and picks an “Olivia” book from a bookshelf.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re a big Olivia fan,
                        aren’t you?

           Lucy remains silent.

                                 KATIE
                        Me, too. Let’s see what kind
                        of trouble she’s gotten
                        herself into this time.

           INT. DR. CORMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Corman is all business.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        So how’s it going with Lucy?

                                 KATIE
                        I think it’s going great.
                        She’s highly cooperative,
                        holds eye contact longer...

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        She was highly cooperative
                        when she came here.
                                (knows the answer)
                        Is she talking?

                                 KATIE
                        It’s a process.

           Dr. Corman smiles condescendingly.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        I’m going to transfer the
                        case to Doctor Weinberg.
                        She’s a very experienced...

                                 KATIE
                        I think that’s a mistake.

           Dr. Corman is surprised at the challenge.
                                 KATIE
                        Lucy never knew her father.
                        Her mother was a prostitute
                        and drug addict. Do you
                        know how hard it is for
                        her to establish trust?
                        We’re making progress.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Not the kind I can put
                        in her 60 day report.

                                 KATIE
                                (accusatory)
                        Oh.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        This is not about trying to
                        impress the state agency that
                        just happens to fund us in a
                        time of severe cutbacks! And
                        it’s also not about protecting
                        your precious doctoral student ego.

           Katie stares defiantly.

                                 DR. CORMAN 
                        It’s about helping this little
                        girl who’s suffered such severe
                        trauma she can’t even speak anymore.
                        Who will live an unbearably bleak
                        life unless we connect with her
                        and soon. We’ve failed her and
                        we have to fix this.

                                 KATIE
                        We have not failed her!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Katie, you’re a very bright
                        young woman and you’re going
                        to be an exceptional psychologist
                        someday. But it’s a flaw, and
                        not a small one, to not know
                        when to admit defeat and move on.

           Katie sits fuming.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        You’re to inform Lucy that
                        Tuesday’s session will be
                        your last. At the end of the
                        session, Dr. Weinberg will
                        come in and introduce herself.
           Katie gets up. Heads to the door.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Katie...

           She turns around.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Good intentions are a wonderful
                        thing. But in life we have
                        to produce results.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

           Katie runs along the Central Park loop-- she’s a serious
           runner.

           She runs past a playground at the edge of the park crowded
           with CHILDREN. She stares at 3 BLACK GIRLS Lucy’s age playing
           jump rope and laughing.

           Katie runs faster, faster, faster. Almost as if trying to
           outrun her anger.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Katie comes home with a bag of groceries. She pulls a pan
           out. Pours some olive oil in it. Puts it on a flame.

           Turns on the radio. She pulls out some peppers. Starts to
           chop them.

           The Rolling Stones’Wild Horses comes on the radio.

           She stops chopping. Smiles and listens to the song for a long
           minute. She suddenly BURSTS into tears-- really loses it.

           INT. BANK STREET SCHOOL - DAY (1985)

           A progressive private school across from the Columbia campus.
           The perfect place for a writer’s daughter.

                                 JAKE
                        Jake Davis for Laura Garner.

                                 WOMAN
                        She’ll just be a minute.
                        Can I get you coffee, tea, water?

                                 JAKE
                        I’m good, thanks.
           She smiles warmly.

                                 WOMAN
                        Have you seen today’s
                        Times yet?

           She offers him the newspaper.

           INT. LAURA GARNER’S OFFICE - DAY

           LAURA GARNER, 45, is smart and funky.

                                 LAURA
                        The Shipleys’ are a very
                        active family here.

                                 JAKE
                        Ted’s terrific. Great agent.
                        Better friend.

                                 LAURA
                        I should tell you, Leaving
                        The Dance changed my life.

                                 JAKE
                                (flirty)
                        For the better, I hope.

                                 LAURA
                        But I’ll tell you what I told
                        Ted on the phone. We’d love
                        to have someone like Katie
                        at school here. And we want
                        to support single fathers
                        like yourself. But we’re
                        absolutely full.

                                 JAKE
                        Always room for one more.

                                 LAURA
                        There are only so many seats.

                                 JAKE
                        She’ll stand.

                                 LAURA
                        Mr. Davis...

                                 JAKE
                        Jake.
                                 LAURA
                        Jake... as much as we’d
                        love to have the daughter
                        of a Pulitzer Prize winning
                        novelist here...

                                 JAKE
                        Two. Two Pulitzers.

           Jake smiles. He’s obviously charming her.

                                 LAURA
                        Look, I shouldn’t tell you
                        this, but a little girl’s
                        father just got transferred
                        to London this morning. We
                        actually do have an opening.

                                 JAKE
                        That would be fantastic!!

                                 LAURA
                        I have a waiting list as
                        long as both my arms!
                        There’d be a revolt. And
                        probably a lawsuit. Why
                        didn’t you apply last fall?

                                 JAKE
                        There must be some way...

           We can see the wheels turning in Jake’s head.

                                 LAURA
                                (ending the conversation)
                        I’m really sorry. But we do
                        accept students again for 6th
                        grade. And I love your books.

                                 JAKE
                        What about faculty?

                                 LAURA
                        What about them?

                                 JAKE
                        Faculty get priority for admission?

                                 LAURA
                        Well, yes, but...

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll teach creative writing
                        to seniors.
                                 LAURA
                        We’re not budgeted for...

                                 JAKE
                        A dollar a semester.

                                 LAURA
                        Jake, I appreciate...

                                 JAKE
                        The craft of the short story.
                        Focus on student work and
                        study of the masters-- Twain,
                        Hemingway, Roth and maybe a
                        piece I’m currently working on.

                                 LAURA
                        You really want to teach
                        creative writing to twelfth
                        graders?

                                 JAKE
                        I really want my daughter to
                        attend Bank Street.

                                 LAURA
                        And you’ll write recommendations
                        for their college applications?

                                 JAKE
                        For any student who shows talent.

           She eyes him suspiciously.

                                 JAKE
                        Talent being generously defined,
                        of course.

           She studies Jake. Opens her purse. Takes out a dollar.
           Hands it to him.

                                 LAURA
                        We’re paid up through
                        the Fall.

           EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

           Jake carries Katie’s knapsack and lunch box. The two of them
           hold hands as they walk past the storefronts.

                                 JAKE
                        You know what my favorite
                        part of the day is?
                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 JAKE
                        Right now. Taking you
                        to school.

           Katie beams.

           EXT. BANK STREET SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           They’re now in front of the school.

                                 JAKE
                        Don’t learn everything you
                        need to know today. Leave
                        some stuff for tomorrow

                                 KATIE
                                (giggles)
                        OK.

                                 JAKE
                        I need a New York-sized hug.

           She gives him a huge hug.

                                 JAKE
                        Love you so much.

                                 KATIE
                        Love you more.

           Katie sees a FRIEND.

                                 KATIE
                        Allison, hi!

           The two girls hold hands as they go through the doors.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - DAY

           Jake types away. The phone rings. He ignores it.
           It finally stops. After a minute, starts ringing again.

                                 JAKE
                                (to the phone)
                        I’m fucking working!!

           The phone continues to ring.
                                 JAKE
                        Hello?... Oh, hey, William...
                        Uhm, sure, we’d be happy to
                        come to dinner...

           Jake gives William the finger over the phone.

                                 JAKE
                        Thursday night? I’m on this
                        writer’s panel... Katie has
                        soccer on Saturday-- she’ll be
                        tired afterwards. Sunday I’m
                        taking her to the theatre...
                        She misses the boys, too.
                        We’re just very... Hey, can
                        I call you back, I’m right
                        in the middle of... Yeah,
                        yeah, we’ll definitely make
                        dinner happen.

           Jake hangs up.

                                 JAKE
                        Not in this lifetime.

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY (2012)

           Katie shows Lucy a drawing from a children’s book.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s a beautiful pink bike,
                        isn’t it?

           Lucy’s silent.

                                 KATIE
                        I used to have a pink bike
                        when I was a little girl...
                        Have you ever ridden a bike?

           Nothing.

                                 KATIE
                        Do any of your friends have bikes?

           Still nothing.

                                 KATIE
                        Lucy, I know you’re scared.
                        But you know me. And you know
                        you’re totally safe here.
                        It’s time... You’re ready for
                        this. Have you ever ridden a bike?
           Katie gets off her chair. She’s now on her knees in front of
           Lucy.

                                 KATIE
                        C’mon Luce... it’s just me.
                        Just Katie.

           Katie waits for a very long minute. Nothing.

                                 KATIE
                                (defeated)
                        Go collect your things.

           Lucy does. Comes sit back down.

                                 KATIE
                        Lucy, listen... I have
                        something  important to
                        tell you.

           Katie stares at Lucy-- she’s so innocent, frightened,
           vulnerable.

                                 KATIE
                                (can’t say it)
                        I want you to have a
                        great weekend, OK?

           Lucy smiles.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DUSK

           A late fall day. The trees are now bare and gloomy. A cold,
           hard rain comes down.

           Katie runs the loop in the deserted park.

           INT. KATIE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Katie eats a dinner of yogurt out of the cup. Reads The New
           Yorker between spoonfuls. Her lonely little life.

           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Katie can’t sleep. Stares at the ceiling.

           INT. PSYCHOLOGIST’S OFFICE

           Katie sits with CAROLYN, her fortyish shrink. Katie stares
           off into space, lost in her thoughts. Finally:
                                 KATIE
                        I don’t love.

           Carolyn’s silent.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve never actually said
                        that out loud before.
                                (smiles)
                        See, we are making progress.

                                 CAROLYN
                        But you have loved.

                                 KATIE
                        Once. A very long time ago.

                                 CAROLYN
                        So you know you can love.

           Katie shakes her head no.

                                 KATIE
                                (taps her heart)
                        There’s nothing inside here
                        anymore. I’m like an old, empty
                        well-- dried up and barren.

           Katie is lost in her thoughts.

                                 KATIE
                        You know why I fuck all
                        these guys?

                                 CAROLYN
                        Why?

                                 KATIE
                        Not so I can feel love or
                        intimacy or even sexual
                        satisfaction. But just so
                        I can feel... something.

           Carolyn just stares at her.

                                 KATIE
                        Besides, I figure someone
                        should enjoy my being on
                        the planet.

                                 CAROLYN
                        But they’re men you don’t
                        even like.
           Katie nods.

                                 CAROLYN
                        What would you do if you met
                        a man you actually did like?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know. Probably make
                        him regret the day he ever
                        laid eyes on me.

           INT. BANK STREET CLASSROOM - DAY (1985)

           A seminar room of 12 SENIORS. A bohemian girl, MADISON, reads
           her story in a sleep-inducing monotone.

                                 MADISON
                        Her eyes were little black
                        pools of India ink that
                        matched her skirt and
                        her mood...

           The other students fight head-bobs.

           We now see Jake working on an elaborate doodle of a man stuck
           in a prison cell filled with school desks. The man is trying
           to hang himself.

                                 MADISON
                        And while Trey might have
                        stolen her virginity that
                        sultry summer night in East
                        Hampton, she vowed someday
                        she’d be a virgin again.

           Madison has finished.

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you, Madison, that was
                        lovely. So what did we like
                        about the story?

           Not a single hand goes up.

                                 JAKE
                        Well, there’s a lot of good
                        things I responded to...

           INT. TED SHIPLEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           The dark-wood bookshelves and beautiful Oriental rugs of a
           first-tier New York literary agent.
           Jake walks in, all smiles.

                                 JAKE
                        I have a gift for you for
                        helping get Katie into
                        Bank Street.

                                 TED
                        That’s not necessary.

           Jake takes an overstuffed manilla envelope out of his
           satchel. Throws it on Ted’s desk.

                                 TED
                        What the...

           Ted opens the envelope eagerly.

                                 JAKE
                        You don’t think I spent
                        all my time down there
                        basket weaving?

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY (2012)

                                 KATIE
                                (reading)
                        “Just what could Olivia
                        be thinking?”
                                (to Lucy)
                        What’s Olivia thinking?

           Lucy says nothing. Katie shows her the picture.

                                 KATIE
                        She’s thinking I’d make a
                        pretty good opera singer
                        myself... Do you think
                        she’d make a good opera
                        singer? For a pig, I mean?

           Lucy remains silent. Katie closes the book.

                                 KATIE
                        Can you put the book back
                        on the shelf?

           Lucy does and sits back down. Katie pauses. Takes a deep
           breath. Here goes:

                                 KATIE
                        Lucy, I’ve had so much fun
                        with you the past couple
                        months. It’s been such a
                        pleasure to get to know
                        you and read together
                        and draw pictures.

           Lucy looks at her attentatively.

                                 KATIE
                        And I was telling my friend
                        Carla, who also works here,
                        what a joy it was spending
                        time with you and she said
                        she would love to play with
                        you, too. She’s very nice
                        and she can’t wait to meet
                        you. So she’s going to come
                        by in a few minutes and say
                        hi and from now on when you
                        come, you’ll see Carla
                        instead of Katie, OK?

           Lucy stares at Katie, looks very upset.
                                 KATIE
                        It’s gonna be fine.

                                 LUCY
                        No.

                                 KATIE
                        What?!

           Lucy pauses. Swallows. Remembers how to talk.

                                 LUCY
                        I want to stay with you.

           EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

           Katie walks home. For the first time, she seems light and
           happy.

           She passes the Bank Street School. Stops to watch a SEA OF
           PARENTS chatting while they wait to pick up their children.

           She stares at a man who looks a lot like Jake.

                                                        Dissolve To:

           EXT. BANK STREET - DAY (1985)

           A different SEA OF PARENTS chat waiting to pick up their
           children.

           Jake mingles with the COSMOPOLITAN MOMS and JAMAICAN NANNIES.
           He’s positively beaming.

           A 5-year-old Katie comes out of the doors and makes a beeline
           for him. He picks her up. Throws her in the air.

                                 JAKE
                        I have great news!

                                 KATIE
                        What?!

                                 JAKE
                        Daddy sold a book today.

           Katie is obviously disappointed this is the news.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that good?
                                 JAKE
                        It’s the best. It means you
                        can have any toy on the planet.

           Now Katie is excited.

                                 KATIE
                        I want a bike! Pink! With a
                        basket and bell. And streamers
                        dangling from the handlebars.

                                 JAKE
                        Then that is what you
                        shall have.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - DAY

           Upbeat MUSIC underneath.

           Jake teaches Katie how to ride a bike. He’s got boundless
           energy as he runs along beside her holding her new pink bike.

           EXT. RIVERSIDE PARK - LATER

           Jake’s wiped. Katie still hasn’t gotten it. He runs with her
           until he can’t hold on to the bike anymore. He collapses on
           the ground.

           Katie keeps pedaling. She’s riding by herself for the
           first time!

           Jake springs up like a jack-in-the-box. He jumps up and down.

                                 JAKE
                        Go!! Go Katie Go!!

           He turns to a COUPLE walking by.

                                 JAKE
                        That’s my girl!! That’s my daughter!!

           The couple smiles politely, but looks frightened.
           Jake waves at Katie.

                                 JAKE
                        Go baby go!!

           Katie waves back proudly and promptly falls.
           INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Katie with a large band aid on her face sits at the table.
           Jake brings out two plates of steaming pasta.

                                 KATIE
                        We had spaghetti last night.

                                 JAKE
                        This is linguine. Whole
                        different thing.

           Katie gives him a look. 

                                 JAKE
                        Get the menus.

           Katie is off in a flash to get the take-out menus

                                 JAKE
                                (shouts)
                        But we’re having Mexican.

                                 KATIE (O.S.)
                        Chinese.

                                 JAKE
                        And you’re paying. I got
                        it last time.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Katie happily tears open a steaming egg roll. She watches her
           father eat a Moo Shoo pancake. Stares at him adoringly.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - NIGHT

           Jake types. Katie wanders in.

                                 KATIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 JAKE
                        I’m writing a new book.

                                 KATIE
                        What’s it about?

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t know yet.
                                 KATIE
                        I know what it can be about.

                                 JAKE
                        What?

                                 KATIE
                        Me. You could write a
                        book about me.

                                 JAKE
                                (smiles)
                        Maybe I will.

           INT. KATIE’S ROOM - BEDTIME

           Katie’s in her pajamas. Jake finishes reading a fairy tale.

                                 JAKE
                        And the Prince and Princess
                        lived...

                                 KATIE
                        Happily ever after.

                                 JAKE
                        OK. Lights out.

           Jake turns on her night light before turning off the lamp.

                                 KATIE
                        Am I a princess?

                                 JAKE
                        Of course you are.

                                 KATIE
                        What does a Princess do?

                                 JAKE
                        Well, they, you know...
                        go to royal balls-- that
                        sort of thing.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve never been to a ball.

           Jake stares at Katie. Turns on the clock radio. The Rolling
           Stones’ Wild Horses plays.

           Jake picks up a princess tiara from Katie’s dress-up shelf.
           Gently places it on Katie’s head.
                                 JAKE
                        May I have this dance,
                        Princess Potato Chip?

                                 KATIE
                                (giggles)
                        Yes, you may.

           They dance beautifully together, both beaming.
           A magical moment!

           INT. KATIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Katie’s all tucked in bed. Jake strokes her face.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m so proud of you,
                        you know that?

           Katie smiles.

                                 JAKE
                        I love you a trillion trillions.

                                 KATIE
                        I love you more than the
                        last number.

           Jake gets up to leave.

                                 KATIE
                        Daddy...

           Jake turns around.

                                 KATIE
                        This is the best day I ever had.

                                 JAKE
                        Me too, Katie. Me too.

           INT. DOWNTOWN LOFT - NIGHT (2012)

           A loft party in Tribeca. Katie looks drop-dead gorgeous. She
           sits with AMANDA, who has a pretty face, but is heavy.

                                 AMANDA
                        Do you realize you could sleep
                        with any guy here? I don’t care
                        if they have a girlfriend. If
                        they’re married. Queer. You could
                        have them horizontal in 5 minutes.
           Amanda looks around the crowded room.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’d say about a third of the
                        guys here would do me.

           Looks around again. Pushes up her tits.

                                 AMANDA
                        Half would do me. A third
                        would date me.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know why I let you
                        drag me to these things.

                                 AMANDA
                        We’re celebrating Lucy
                        speaking!

           They clink drinks.

                                 AMANDA
                        Besides, you spend too much
                        time alone.

                                 KATIE
                        I like being alone.

                                 AMANDA
                        Not me. I’m a people person.
                        The only thing I think about
                        when I’m alone is how fat and
                        single I am. And that just
                        makes me want to eat more which
                        makes me fatter and more certain
                        to stay single. Better to be here
                        breathing in the second-hand smoke
                        and hoping to chat up the one in
                        three guys who won’t be repulsed by
                        the sight of me naked in daylight.
                                (beat)
                        What’s the clinical term for me?

                                 KATIE
                        Female.

           Katie gets up.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m gonna get another beer.
                        You want to come with?
                                 AMANDA
                        No thanks. I’m just gonna
                        sit here and look thin
                        and mysterious.

           EXT. PARTY - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Katie pulls a bottle of beer out of a tub filled with ice.
           Sips it. Looks out at the glowing city.

           CAMERON, early 30s, handsome, arty, confident approaches.

                                 CAMERON
                        They say every sip of beer
                        kills a thousand brain cells.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve known many very smart
                        people in my life. And not
                        one of them was happy.

           Cameron clinks the bottles.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’ll drink to that.
                                (drinks)
                        Cameron. Cameron Knowles.

                                 KATIE
                        Katie.

                                 CAMERON
                        What, we’re not gonna be
                        on a last name basis? That’s
                        a grave insult in my homeland.

                                 KATIE
                        Where’s your homeland?

                                 CAMERON
                        Connecticut.

           Katie laughs.

                                 KATIE
                        You have the funny,
                        sensitive thing down
                        pretty good, don’t you?

                                 CAMERON
                        I get by.

           Katie’s charmed. Puts out her hand.
                                 KATIE
                        Katie Davis.

                                 CAMERON
                        Nice to meet you,
                        Katie Davis.

                                 KATIE
                        Same here.

                                 CAMERON
                        No, you’re not sure if it’s nice
                        to meet me yet. And that’s OK.
                        You’re under no obligation to buy.

                                 KATIE
                        Good. Because I relish my freedom.

           Katie tries to say it flirty, but the truth seeps out.

                                 CAMERON
                        Something tells me that’s true.

           Katie’s feelings are hurt. She looks out at the city.
           Cameron stands there. She’s much too beautiful to give up on
           that easily.

                                 CAMERON
                        You know, my favorite writer
                        is Jake Davis. He and his wife
                        had one child before she died
                        in a car accident-- a daughter
                        named Katie.

           Katie stares at him.

                                 CAMERON
                        I guess it’s a pretty common name.

                                 KATIE
                        Six in the Manhattan phone book.

                                 CAMERON
                        Only one Cameron Winston
                        Knowles III. What are the odds?

           Katie smiles.

                                 CAMERON
                        But Jake Davis is amazing.
                        He’s the reason I became a writer.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re a writer?
                                 CAMERON
                        Filmmaker. But, you know...

           Katie makes the slightest grimace.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, no, don’t give me that face.
                        That’s the face my parents made
                        when I told them I was turning
                        down the Wharton School to make
                        a documentary called, “A Day in
                        the Life of Central Park.”

                                 KATIE
                        I think people should do
                        what makes them happy.

                                 CAMERON
                        You sound like a shrink.
                                (beat)
                        You are a shrink.

                                 KATIE
                        One more year for my doctorate.

           Cameron stares at her.

                                 CAMERON
                        God, you’re gorgeous.

                                 KATIE
                        Is that important?

                                 CAMERON
                        It doesn’t suck.

           Cameron continues to study her.

                                 CAMERON
                        The thing is-- you’re just
                        about the right age to be
                        Jake Davis’ daughter.
                        Have you ever read him?

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t read much fiction.

                                 CAMERON
                        His most famous book is actually
                        about his life with his daughter
                        when she was little. It’s called
                        Fathers and Daughters. You didn’t
                        have to read it in college? I
                        thought everybody did.
           Katie shrugs.

                                 CAMERON
                        The main character is a
                        5-year-old girl called
                        Potato Chip. He used to
                        call her his Potato Chip.

           Katie stands very still.

                                 CAMERON
                        He dedicated the book to
                        her. He wrote, “To Katie,
                        My Potato Chip, who I love
                        more than the last number.”

           Katie starts to shake. Tears run down her cheeks.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh my God!!

           INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT (1985)

           A standing-room-only CROWD. Jake reads from behind a podium.

                                 JAKE
                        And it was then he realized
                        the moon held grudges-- and
                        even the tulips were bitter.

           Jake looks up. He’s finished. Thunderous applause.

                                 BOOKSTORE MANAGER
                        You can pre-order Bitter Tulips
                        downstairs. Mr. Davis has also
                        graciously agreed to sign copies
                        of his previous books which we’ve
                        conveniently made available...

           INT. BOOKSTORE - LATER

           A long line of PEOPLE wait for Jake to autograph his books.

           NANCY, a beautiful 30-year-old in a tight t-shirt and no bra,
           hands Jake a book.

                                 NANCY
                        Make it out to Nancy, who I’m
                        about to fall in love with.

           Jake writes, “To Nancy, Best Wishes. Jake Davis.” She leans
           in towards Jake so he can get a nice peek.
                                 NANCY
                        They taste as good as they look.

           INT. NANCY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jake fucks the shit out of Nancy who screams in ecstasy.

           INT. SHAKE SHACK - NIGHT (2012)

           Katie and Cameron down burgers.

                                 CAMERON
                        How close is the book to what
                        really happened?

                                 KATIE
                        It’s a lot funnier in the book.

           INT. CAMERON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They finish making love in Cameron’s tiny bedroom. Cameron
           bolts up, goes to his overflowing book shelf.

           He rifles through some books, finds Fathers and Daughters.
           Hands the book and a pen to Katie.

                                 CAMERON
                        Sign it?

           Katie does.

                                 CAMERON
                        “To Cameron, who almost
                        brought me to orgasm.”

           Cameron laughs.

                                 CAMERON
                        I guess I’m not showing
                        this off to anyone.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - DAY (1985)

           Music BLASTS. Jake’s totally in the zone. He wears an old
           brown sweater and types away singing wildly off key.

           We hear a banging on the floor. It’s the downstairs neighbor
           complaining about the noise.
                                 JAKE
                        It’s going good, Mrs. Herzog.
                        You have to respect the muse.

           We hear even louder THUMPS from below. Mrs. Herzog obviously
           doesn’t respect the muse. Jake turns the music up louder to
           cover the thumping noise-- continues typing away.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - LATER

           The music is off. Jake types furiously. It looks like he
           hasn’t moved in hours. The phone rings. He looks at the
           clock. 3:20.

                                 JAKE
                        Shit!!

           He races out without stopping to put a jacket on.

           INT. BANK STREET - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Katie sits by herself. She’s not happy. Her TEACHER
           straightens up. Jake hurries in.

                                 JAKE
                        The train got stuck at
                        96th street. Some idiot
                        pulled the emergency brake.

                                 KATIE
                        You still have your
                        writing sweater on.

                                 JAKE
                                (busted)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 KATIE
                        You said you would set the
                        alarm when you’re working!

                                 JAKE
                        I forgot. Katie, I’m so sorry.

                                 KATIE
                        I hate being the last one
                        picked up.

           INT. JAKE’S DINING RO0M - NIGHT

           Katie and Jake eat silently. Katie’s obviously still mad.
           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jake tucks Katie in.

                                 JAKE
                        I’m sorry about pick-up
                        today.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s OK.

                                 JAKE
                        Once the book comes out,
                        money shouldn’t be so tight
                        and I was thinking maybe
                        I’d hire a part-time nanny.
                        She could pick you up from
                        school. Spend some time
                        with you in the afternoon
                        when I’m working.

                                 KATIE
                                (hurt)
                        You don’t want to get me
                        from school anymore?

                                 JAKE
                        Katie, No! I love getting
                        you from school. Spending
                        time with you is my favorite
                        thing in the world. I just
                        need to work, that’s all.

                                 KATIE
                        And this will help you work?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah.

                                 KATIE
                        Then OK.

           EXT. HUDSON RIVER - DAY (2012)

           Katie and Cameron run along the water. The Hudson gleams in
           the background.

           EXT. BATTERY PARK - SUNSET

           Katie and Cameron are stretched out on the grass. Share a
           bottle of water.
                                 KATIE
                        So you really turned down
                        the Wharton School to make
                        a documentary on Central Park?

                                 CAMERON
                        I did. It’s actually a felony
                        where I grew up in Greenwich.

                                 KATIE
                                (laughs)
                        Did the movie get released?

                                 CAMERON
                        7 theaters in 6 cities. It
                        did $128,431 which-- for a
                        non-Michael Moore documentary--
                        isn’t half bad.

           Katie smiles.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’ve won a grant to do my
                        second documentary on the
                        life and thought of Erich
                        Fromm. So there’s not much
                        chance of me topping my
                        previous box office record.

                                 KATIE
                        But you love it.

                                 CAMERON
                        I do.

                                 KATIE
                        My father loved his work.

                                 CAMERON
                        But I’m sure not half
                        as much as he loved his
                        little girl.

           Katie smiles, flattered and embarrassed at the same time.

           Cameron goes to take her hand. Katie looks awkwardly at him.
           Clearly uncomfortable with this.

                                 CAMERON
                        You know, I have seen you
                        naked.

                                 KATIE
                        They’re two different things.
                                 CAMERON
                        I hope so. I hold hands
                        with my grandmother.

            Katie laughs. Now surrenders her hand.

                                 KATIE
                        I think I like you
                        Cameron Knowles.

                                 CAMERON
                        I think you should.

           Cameron gently takes her hand and suddenly pulls her on top
           of him. Kisses her passionately.

           Katie shrieks and laughs, kisses him back. The sun sets over
           the water. A nice moment.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Cameron stares-- clearly shocked by Katie’s gorgeous
           apartment overlooking the park.

                                 CAMERON
                        You live here?!

           Katie shrugs.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m never gonna be able
                        to get an erection.

           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An intense lovemaking scene.

           Katie and Cameron have an incredible sexual connection.

           They fondle and touch each other not only passionately but
           tenderly as well.

           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Cameron and Katie are post-coital. They eat chinese food out
           of paper cartons in bed. Watch an old black and white movie.

           Cameron stops eating. Takes Katie’s hand. Shakes it gently.

                                 CAMERON
                        Hey...
                                 KATIE
                        Hey...

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY (1985)

           STACEY, 24, is a very pretty grad student.

                                 STACEY
                        When I heard Jake Davis
                        was looking for a part-time
                        Nanny I jumped out of my seat.
                        You’re my very favorite author.

                                 JAKE
                        Well, you’d be spending most
                        of your time with Katie,
                        my 5-year-old daughter.

                                 STACEY
                        I love kids. I’ve been
                        baby sitting since I was 12.
                        Worked as a camp counselor
                        3 summers in college.

                                 JAKE
                        And now you’re a grad student
                        at Columbia?

                                 STACEY
                        I’m getting my MFA in creative
                        writing.

           Jake makes the same grimace Katie made with Cameron.

                                 STACEY
                        But I would never ask you to
                        look at my work or anything.
                        I know how busy you must be.

                                 JAKE
                        So basically the job is
                        from 3 to 6. You’d pick up
                        Katie at school and take
                        her to the park or bring
                        her back here and play
                        quietly in her room. I
                        write until 6. And then I
                        get dinner together. We
                        generally have pasta.

                                 STACEY
                        I love to cook!
           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Stacey shows Katie how to spice chicken.

                                 STACEY
                        This is Paprika. You just
                        want to put a shake or two
                        on it. You try.

           Katie does.

                                 STACEY
                        Yeah, that’s it. Now we
                        stick it in the oven until
                        it’s golden brown.

           We hear Jake’s typewriter banging away in the study.

                                 STACEY
                        You hear that? That’s the
                        sound of genius. Do you
                        know what a genius is?

                                 KATIE
                        No.

                                 STACEY
                        Your father is the greatest
                        living American writer.

           Katie shrugs.

                                 STACEY
                        And I am cooking his dinner.

           A shiver goes through Stacey.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jake and Katie are cuddled on the sofa watching “His Girl
           Friday.” They share a bowl of popcorn.

                                 JAKE
                        That’s Cary Grant.
                        Wasn’t he handsome?

                                 KATIE
                        Not as handsome as you.

           Jake eyes Katie. She’s apparently serious.

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah, I suppose that’s true.
           Katie snuggles in tighter. Stuffs another handful of popcorn
           in her mouth. Good times.

           INT. CAMERON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (2012)

           In the middle of Cameron’s tiny living room is a full-sized
           ping pong table.

           Cameron and Katie play with a paddle in each hand. Katie
           returns a shot and Cameron slams it home.

                                 CAMERON
                        And Knowles leads Davis 17 to 5
                        at the East Village Invitational.
                        The crowd goes wild for their
                        home-table champion.
                                (as though a crowd)
                        Knowles! Knowles! Knowles!

                                 KATIE
                                (laughs)
                        Will you just serve?

                                 CAMERON
                        The crowd has Davis rattled.

                                 KATIE
                        Cameron!

           Cameron picks up the ball with the paddles. Fakes serving
           with one paddle and serves with the other. They volley.

           Cameron again slams a shot for the point.

                                 CAMERON
                        And it looks like there’s no
                        stopping Knowles. Davis is
                        running out of tricks.

                                 KATIE
                        See the next time you get laid.

                                 CAMERON
                        Oh, she plays her trump card!
                        Knowles is going to have to
                        ratchet it up a notch.

           He picks up a remote. Turns on a massive sound system.

           We now hear a CROWD OF THOUSANDS chanting Knowles!!
           Knowles!! Knowles!!

           Katie laughs. Tosses her paddles on the table.
                                 KATIE
                        I give up. What does the
                        loser have to do?

                                 CAMERON
                        You could start by taking
                        off your shirt.

           Katie unbuttons her top. Tosses it on the ground.

           She’s wearing a sexy black bra. Cameron stares at this
           gorgeous, half-naked woman in his living room.

                                 CAMERON
                        Jesus H. Christ.

           INT. CAMERON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           They’ve finished making love. Cameron gently kisses her
           breasts, belly.

                                 CAMERON
                        You know, a lot of guys think
                        the first couple times they
                        sleep with a woman are the
                        best. But not me. I think
                        it gets better and better
                        the more we do it.

           He continues to kiss her body softly, tenderly.
           Katie looks uncomfortable. Cameron picks up on this.

                                 CAMERON
                        What?

           Katie brushes it off.

                                 CAMERON
                        What?

                                 KATIE
                                (embarrassed)
                        You know how many guys I’ve
                        slept with more than once?

           Cameron stares at her.

                                 KATIE
                        Two. You and a psych
                        professor from junior year.

           Cameron stops kissing her.
                                 CAMERON
                        That’s fucked up.

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah.

                        insisting-- insisting-- that
                        in 10 years everyone’s gonna
                        be writing on computers.

                        And?

           Ted throws a literary journal on the desk. Jake reads it
           eagerly.

                                 JAKE
                        This is awful!!

                        Not like this.

           Jake continues reading. His eyes nearly pop out.

                                 JAKE
                        He didn’t get it at all.

                                 TED
                        No.

                                 JAKE
                        Are there others?

           Ted nods.

                        Same.

                        What about the Times?

           Ted shakes his head no.

                                 TED
                        If it starts to sell...

                                 JAKE
                        Are they slashing the
                        marketing budget, too?

           Ted nods.

                                 JAKE
                        If they don’t get behind
                        it, I’m dead in the water.
                        Everyone’ll know they
                        think it’s shit.

                                 TED
                        I fought like a bastard!
                        They don’t care what you’ve
                        done. They’re a bunch of
                        bean counters-- it’s all
                        just product to them.

                                 JAKE
                        There must be something I
                        can do.

                                 TED
                        Well...

           Jake looks upset.

                                 TED
                        You’re an important writer!

                        and they’ll buy your book.

                                 JAKE
                        I can’t leave Katie.

                                 TED
                        Couldn’t she stay with
                        your in-laws?

           Jake is silent.

                                 TED
                        Jake, you selling books
                        is good for Katie.

                                 JAKE
                        I can’t leave her again.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Jake eats a sandwich over a plate at the counter.

           He suddenly picks up the plate. Hurls it against the wall.
           It smashes into a thousand pieces. It feels good.

           He grabs a dish out of the sink. Slams it against the
           counter. He wants more.

           Picks up a mixing bowl. Eyes a glass cabinet full of china.

           He throws the bowl. Hits the cabinet dead center.

           China comes spilling out.

           He now grabs the entire cabinet-- pulls it off the wall. It
           smashes into a million pieces on the floor.
           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY (2012)

                                 KATIE
                        What do you think of when
                        you think of your Mom?

           Lucy’s silent.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s just me.

           Lucy looks at her. Finally:

                                 LUCY
                        Scared.

                                 KATIE
                        Why scared?

                                 LUCY
                        Because.

                                 KATIE
                        Because...

                                 LUCY
                        Because when I love
                        someone they leave me.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - WESTCHESTER - DAY

           A black town car rolls along a crowded stretch of highway.

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           We now see Katie in the back in a nice skirt. She carries a
           bouquet of flowers.

           EXT. LOCAL ROADS - CONTINUOUS

           The car winds through local streets.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The limousine stops in front of cemetery gates. A DRIVER
           steps out, opens the passenger door.

                                 DRIVER
                        Miss, how long do you need?
                        An hour?
                                 KATIE
                        Less.

           EXT. GRAVESITE - DAY

           Katie stands in front of her mother’s grave. We see her
           mother’s tombstone: PATRICIA DAVIS 1949 - 1982.

           She kneels down. Pulls some roses out of the bouquet. Places
           them by her mother’s tombstone. She now takes the rest of the
           roses and turns to the tombstone next to her mother’s.

           We see JAKE DAVIS 1948 - but Katie’s body blocks us from
           seeing what year he died.

           She puts the rest of the roses on his grave.

                                 KATIE
                        Hey guys...

           Katie pulls a few weeds from the lawn.

                                 KATIE
                        So I have news. I’m
                        seeing this guy I really
                        like. Bet you never
                        thought you’d hear
                        that come out of my
                        mouth. But Cameron’s
                        different from anybody I’ve
                        ever met. He’s smart and
                        funny and gentle and--
                        just a great guy...
                        He scares the living shit
                        out of me.

           EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY (1985)

           Jake and Katie are all dressed up.

                                 JAKE
                        You sure you want to go
                        to Elizabeth and William’s
                        Christmas Party? Because we
                        don’t have to. FAO Schwartz
                        is just 20 blocks south.

                                 KATIE
                        You’ve already bought me a
                        million toys.
                                 JAKE
                        What kid doesn’t want more
                        toys for Christmas? Tell
                        me something...

                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 JAKE
                        Who are you and what
                        have you done with the
                        real Katie?

           Katie laughs. They’re now at the entrance of William and
           Elizabeth’s apartment building.

                                 JAKE
                        Last chance. The sky’s the limit.

                                 KATIE
                        You don’t love Aunt
                        Elizabeth and Uncle
                        William, do you?

           INT. WILLIAM & ELIZABETH’S APARTMENT - DAY

           The apartment looks gorgeous-- all decorated for Christmas.
           SERVERS IN UNIFORMS stand behind elegant tables of food.
           Katie plays with a BUNCH OF KIDS.

           Jake talks to a woman, SARAH, in a corner of the living room.

           A MAN looks over at William who gives him the slightest nod.
           The man now approaches Jake.

                                 MAN
                        Jake Davis, right?

                                 JAKE
                        Yes.

                                 MAN
                        Big fan of your work.

                                 JAKE
                        Thank you.

                                 SARAH
                        I’m gonna make sure my kids
                        aren’t overdosing on sugar
                        cookies. Great meeting
                        you, Jake.
                                 JAKE
                        You too.

           Sarah leaves.

                                 MAN
                        Hey, sorry about your last
                        book. That must have been
                        rough the way the critics
                        pounded you.

                                 JAKE
                        I have no idea why God made
                        critics or cockroaches, but
                        I’m sure He has His reasons.

                                 MAN
                        I mean, they HATED your book!
                        HATED it! How do you get past
                        something like that?

           Jake stares at the guy. What’s up his ass?

                                 JAKE
                        You pick yourself up, dust
                        yourself off and move on.
                        Excuse me.

           The man grabs Jake’s arm.

                                 MAN
                        You get over killing your
                        wife the same way?

           Jake DECKS the man. He goes down hard on the floor.

           PEOPLE SCREAM!!!

           William and Elizabeth exchange almost imperceptible smiles.
           Jake catches this-- realizes he’s been set up.

           INT. JAKE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The room is dark. Jake sits on the corner of his bed,
           perfectly still. He looks deeply upset.

           We suddenly see Jake’s whole body jerk-- he now starts to
           rock back and forth worse than we’ve ever seen it.

           He rubs his hands wildly.

                                 JAKE
                        Fuck! Fuck!
           He falls on the floor. Tries to steady himself. Can’t.

                                 JAKE
                        Weak!! Weak!!

           INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (2012)

           Katie and Cameron stare at a brilliant early Picasso.
           Cameron reads the card next to it on the wall.

                                 CAMERON
                        Picasso was 22 when he painted
                        this. Why even bother, you know?

           Katie rubs his back supportively.

                                 KATIE
                        Not everyone who makes it as
                        an artist, makes it by 22.

                                 CAMERON
                        How old was your father when
                        he won his first Pulitzer?

                                 KATIE
                        Older than 22.

                                 CAMERON
                        He was 24.

                                 KATIE
                                (smiles)
                        Almost 25.

           Cameron smiles back, but he’s obviously upset.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m not a wannabe, Katie.
                        I swear to God I’m gonna
                        make it as a filmmaker.

                                 KATIE
                        I know you will.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m gonna be able to
                        support you, I promise.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t care about that.

                                 CAMERON
                        But I do.
           Katie kisses him sweetly.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, I do have a pretty
                        good track record as a muse.

           INT. KATIE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Very late. Cameron works away on his laptop. We notice an
           intensity and determination we haven’t seen before.

           Katie comes in in a night gown. She was obviously asleep.

                                 KATIE
                        Aren’t you coming to bed?

                                 CAMERON
                                (typing away)
                        In a bit.

                                 KATIE
                        I have something for you.

           Katie hands him a beautifully-wrapped box. Cameron looks at
           it curiously.

                                 KATIE
                        Go ahead.

           Cameron opens it-- it’s the old brown sweater we saw Jake
           wearing when he was writing and forgot to pick up Katie.

                                 KATIE
                        My father used to write
                        wearing this. He wrote
                        almost all of Fathers
                        and Daughters in it.
                        I want you to have it.

                                 CAMERON
                        Katie...

                                 KATIE
                        It’ll bring you luck.

                                 CAMERON
                        I can’t.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s OK.

                                 CAMERON
                        I just can’t...
           He hands her back the sweater-- kisses her sweetly. They
           start to kiss more passionately.

           INT. KATIE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Lucy talks a mile-a-minute.

                                 LUCY
                        And so the teacher wanted me
                        to sit next to Annabelle at
                        lunch. But I didn’t want to
                        sit next to her because
                        Annabelle farts when she eats.

                                 KATIE
                                (laughs)
                        She does not!

                                 LUCY
                        She does. And it’s gross!
                        So I asked if I could sit next
                        to Rachel, but Rachel said she
                        would only sit next to me if
                        Daisy would sit next to her.
                        And I said fine, but then Maya
                        started to cry because she
                        thought Rachel didn’t want
                        to sit next to her but...

                                 KATIE
                        Lucy...

                                 LUCY
                        But Rachel didn’t want to
                        sit next to Maya because
                        she sat next to her for
                        three straight days and
                        then Mrs. Watson came
                        over and said...

                                 KATIE
                                (laughs)
                        Lucy!

           Lucy finally stops.

                                 KATIE
                        We’ve gone 10 minutes over.
                        We’ll have to pick up with
                        the musical chairs next time.
                                 LUCY
                        Can I just tell you this one
                        last part? It’s really short.

                                 KATIE
                        Next time.

                                 LUCY
                        OK.

           Lucy grabs her things. Starts to leave.

                                 KATIE
                        Hey Lucy...

           She turns around.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m really proud of you.

           Lucy lights up.

           INT. KATIE’S ROOM - DAY (1985)

           Jake has served Katie breakfast in bed. A single rose is in a
           vase on a silver tray.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re not writing at all
                        today?

                                 JAKE
                        Not on Katie Emily Davis’
                        6th birthday. Are you
                        kidding me?

                                 KATIE
                        And we can do anything I want?

                                 JAKE
                        We can do everything you want.

           EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

           Jake and Katie ice skate holding hands. All smiles.

           INT. PORT AUTHORITY BOWLING ALLEY - DAY

           Katie rolls her ball with both hands. The ball trickles down
           the lane, barely moving.
           It knocks up against a pin so gently that it rolls back
           without dropping it.

           INT. FIFTIES DINER - TIMES SQUARE - DAY

           Jake and Katie sit at a table waiting for their food at a
           touristy Fifties diner.

           Smokey Robinson’s, “I Second That Emotion” comes on.

           THE WAITERS start to dance and sing along with the song.
           We now realize it’s a “singing” diner.

           Katie loves it. Jake stands up. Starts singing to Katie.
           She laughs hysterically. The waiters and diners egg him on.

           Jake jumps on top of the counter. Sings and dances
           shamelessly-- his eyes never leaving Katie.

           The crowd loves it. Katie beams-- the happiest girl in the
           world!

           INT. FIFTIES DINER - TIMES SQUARE - LATER

           Jake and Katie eat their hot dogs. He has mustard on his.
           She has ketchup on hers.

                                 JAKE
                        I can’t believe I have a
                        daughter who puts ketchup
                        on hot dogs.

                                 KATIE
                        You don’t like ketchup?

                                 JAKE
                        I love ketchup. On hamburgers.
                        French fries. But on hot dogs?
                        Ridiculous.

                                 KATIE
                        Well, I’m my own person.

                                 JAKE
                        You certainly are.

                                 KATIE
                        You said we could do
                        anything I want today,
                        right?
           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Jake and Katie stand in front of Trish’s grave.

           Katie silently stares at it. Jake holds her hand tightly.

                                 JAKE
                        Do you remember your Mom?

                                 KATIE
                        Not really.

                                 JAKE
                        It’s OK.

                                 KATIE
                                (lying)
                        I mean, a little.

                                 JAKE
                        You were the great joy
                        of her life, you know that?

           He pulls her into him.

                                 JAKE
                        Just like you’re the
                        great joy of mine.

           She hugs him tightly for a moment.

                                 KATIE
                        Are you going to die?
                                (Jake ignores this)
                        Are you?!

                                 JAKE
                        When I’m very, very old.
                        A long, long time from now.

                                 KATIE
                        How old?

                                 JAKE
                        A thousand. A million.

           Katie hits him. This is serious.

                                 JAKE
                        I’ll be so old, you’ll
                        have your own family-- a
                        husband, a bunch of kids.
                        A dog and a cat. All putting
                        ketchup on everything.
                                 KATIE
                        Promise?

                                 JAKE
                        Promise.

                                 KATIE
                        Pinky swear?

                                 JAKE
                        Pinky swear.

           They rub their pinkies together.

           INT. JAKE’S LOBBY - NIGHT

           Jake carries a sleeping Katie over his shoulder. A MAN
           approaches him.

                                 MAN
                        Jake Davis?

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah.

           The man hands Jake an official-looking envelope.

                                 MAN
                        You’ve been served.

           INT. CROWDED BAR - NIGHT (2012)

           A crowded, noisy bar. Cameron is telling a story and Katie
           and Amanda are laughing hysterically.

                                 CAMERON
                        But of course my high school
                        French wasn’t half as good as
                        I thought it was, so instead of
                        saying I’ve never met this man
                        before I said he’s my brother.

           Katie and Amanda scream with laughter.

                                 CAMERON
                        And that’s how I spent the
                        night in a Parisian jail.

           Katie and Amanda continue laughing.

                                 CAMERON
                        Another round of Appletinis?
                                 KATIE
                        Yes!

                                 AMANDA
                        Absolutely.

                                 CAMERON
                        I shall return.

           Cameron scoops up the glasses and heads to the bar.

                                 AMANDA
                        I love him!! He’s great.

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah?

                                 AMANDA
                        Yeah!! He’s funny and smart.
                        And SO cute.

           Amanda grabs Katie. Hugs her affectionately.

                                 AMANDA
                        I’m so happy for you!

           JOHN, 30, a drunk Wall Streeter comes over.

                                 JOHN
                        Katie, hey. John Harper.

           Katie looks at him. Clearly has no idea who he is.

                                 KATIE
                        Oh, hi, how are you?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m good, you look great.

                                 KATIE
                        You too.

                                 JOHN
                        You have no idea who I am,
                        do you?

                                 KATIE
                                (lying)
                        Of course I do.

                                 JOHN
                        We met at Walker’s Pub maybe
                        a year ago. Had a couple beers.
                                 KATIE
                        Absolutely.

                                 JOHN
                        You still have that apartment
                        with the incredible view of
                        the park?

                                 KATIE
                        Yeah, same place.

           Katie looks nervously over at the bar. Sees Cameron getting
           the drinks.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry I never called.

                                 KATIE
                        That’s OK.

                                 JOHN
                        But we should get together
                        again.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t... It’s not really
                        a good...

                                 JOHN
                                (nasty)
                        Oh, I get it. You’re one
                        of those girls who’s strictly
                        into the one night thing.
                        That’s cool.

           The conversation has ended, but John’s in no hurry to leave.

                                 AMANDA
                        Would you please go?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll pay you for it, I
                        don’t give a shit. Call
                        the first one a freebie.

           Katie looks at the ground. Mortified.

                                 AMANDA
                        Please?

                                 JOHN
                        Fuck you, chubbs!

           Cameron now shows up at the table.
                                 JOHN
                                (to Cameron)
                        She’s a one night girl and
                        I guess it’s your night...
                        Enjoy her. I did.

           John walks off. Turns around.

                                 JOHN
                        I fucked you on your
                        kitchen floor!! You could
                        at least remember my
                        God-damn name!

           He’s finally gone.

                                 CAMERON
                        What’d I miss?

           INT. CAMERON’S APARTMENT - LATER

           They come into Cameron’s apartment. Both quiet.

                                 KATIE
                        Cameron, look, I...

                                 CAMERON
                        I don’t care.

                                 KATIE
                        I want to explain...

                                 CAMERON
                        The past is past. I don’t
                        care what you did before
                        you met me.

           Katie looks both sad and relieved.

                                 KATIE
                        Here you thought you were
                        getting Potato Chip and
                        wound up with some cheap
                        piece of ass.

                                 CAMERON
                        The woman I’m crazy about
                        isn’t Potato Chip. It’s you,
                        Katie. Just you.

           Katie hugs him tightly.
                                 CAMERON
                                (a tone we haven’t
                                heard before)
                        But all that stuff’s
                        in the past, right?

                                 KATIE
                        Absolutely.

           INT. LAW OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (1985)

           Jake sits at a table with his personal attorney, BOB MCNALLY
           and a highly-polished legal expert, JON KUMBLE.

                                 KUMBLE
                        I have to admit I was shocked
                        when Bob shared your case with me.

           Jake starts to fiddle with his hands.

                                 KUMBLE
                        It’s unprecedented for an aunt
                        and uncle to sue for the custody
                        of their niece when the biological
                        father is not only alive and well,
                        but a famous author to boot.

           Jake rubs his hands more conspicuously. He starts to gently
           rock back and forth.

                                 MCNALLY
                        Jake, Jon Kumble is the best
                        custody lawyer in the country.
                        I can’t tell you how happy I
                        am he’s interested in your case.

                                 KUMBLE
                        Sometimes these lawsuits are
                        more about hurt feelings than
                        a genuine desire to obtain
                        custody. The first step is for
                        you to sit down with William
                        and see if you can talk him
                        out of pursuing this.

                                 JAKE
                        And if he refuses to drop it?

                                 KUMBLE
                        We’ll file a motion to dismiss.
                        Argue the case is completely
                        without merit.
                                 JAKE
                        And if that fails?

                                 KUMBLE
                        Then we’ll kick their
                        ass in court.

           INT. BAR - DAY

           Jake sits at an out-of-the-way table. Knocks down a shot.
           William arrives looking very lawyerly.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Hello, Jake.
                                (to the waiter)
                        Scotch. Neat.

           The waiter goes off. William sits.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’ll start. I want you to
                        know this lawsuit is not a
                        vendetta against you. We don’t
                        blame you for what happened
                        to Patricia. And we’re not
                        retaliating because you kept
                        Katie away from us after we
                        took care of her for 18 months
                        in your absence. Our only
                        concern is for Katie’s welfare.

                                 JAKE
                        And Katie would tell you in
                        a heartbeat she wants to
                        stay with me.

                                 WILLIAM
                        She’s 6. It’s inadmissible
                        in court.

                                 JAKE
                        It still matters!

           Jake takes a softer tone.

                                 JAKE
                        William, you’re a reasonable man.
                        And you’re a father. You know
                        in your heart that it’s wrong to
                        separate a motherless daughter
                        from the father she loves.

           William’s drink comes. He takes a swig instead of answering.
                                 JAKE
                        Look, I admit I was pretty
                        mad when I came to get Katie
                        and you talked about adopting
                        her out from under me. Perhaps
                        I overreacted. I would...
                        welcome you and Elizabeth being
                        more involved in Katie’s life.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Jake, we didn’t file the
                        lawsuit as a bargaining chip.

           William finishes his scotch. Orders a second.

                                 JAKE
                        You know, my lawyer,
                        Jon Kumble...

                                 WILLIAM
                        Great attorney. But certainly
                        not cheap.

                                 JAKE
                        Jon tells me you don’t have
                        a shot. That they’ll never
                        separate a daughter from her
                        sole biological parent.
                        Especially when he’s a
                        famous author.

                                 WILLIAM
                        Van Gogh was a great artist,
                        but I certainly wouldn’t want
                        him raising my kid.

                                 JAKE
                        You know you’re going to lose.
                        Why do this?

           William is now the bullying lawyer.

                                 WILLIAM
                        You spent 18 months in a mental
                        hospital being treated for
                        depression. Three dozen people
                        witnessed you punch a guest at
                        a Christmas party in my home
                        because he said he didn’t think
                        your latest novel was your best.

                                 JAKE
                        You lying son of a bitch!
                                 WILLIAM
                        You gave testimony to the
                        Massachusetts State Police
                        that you were having a heated
                        argument and were speeding at
                        the time of Patricia’s death.
                        While they didn’t charge you
                        with reckless endangerment,
                        it’ll certainly look like
                        that to the custody judge.
                        Your last book tanked
                        critically and commercially
                        putting into doubt whether you
                        can even provide for Katie.

           William’s drink comes.

                                 WILLIAM
                        And I have a feeling you’re
                        running out of money faster
                        than a race horse on speed.

           He puts the drink to the side with a dramatic slam.

                                 WILLIAM
                        We’ll find out soon enough
                        when we subpoena your financial
                        records. If we lose, we’ll appeal.
                        And if we lose the appeal we’ll
                        appeal that. We have more money
                        than God. How are you positioned
                        to handle a prolonged legal battle?

                                 JAKE
                                (not a compliment)
                        You really are a very good lawyer.

                                 WILLIAM
                        I’m trying to be a very good uncle.
                        I may appear ruthless to you, but
                        all I care about is family, family,
                        family. That’s my whole life!

                                 JAKE
                        You’re trying to separate a
                        motherless daughter from the
                        father she loves. There’s got to
                        be a special place in hell for that.

           INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jake enters, exhausted. Stacey pops off the couch.
           A half-empty bottle of wine sits on the coffee table.
                                 JAKE
                        Thanks for staying late.

                                 STACEY
                        How’d it go?

                                 JAKE
                        About what I expected.

                                 STACEY
                        Are they going to drop the
                        lawsuit?

                                 JAKE
                                (ignores the question)
                        Katie’s asleep?

                                 STACEY
                        Yeah. For a while now.

                                 JAKE
                        Good.

                                 STACEY
                        I was so worried I helped
                        myself to some wine! I
                        hope that’s OK?

                                 JAKE
                        It’s fine.

           Stacey suddenly hugs Jake.

                                 STACEY
                        I would do anything for
                        you and Katie.

           She holds him tightly. Lets her body slowly lean into his.
           She kisses him. He pulls her off.

                                 STACEY
                        Let me comfort you.

                                 JAKE
                        Stacey...

           She kisses him again, longer.

                                 STACEY
                        I’m a big girl.

                                 JAKE
                        You’re also Katie’s nanny.
                                 STACEY
                        I love Katie. I would never
                        do anything to hurt her.

           She kisses him passionately.

                                 STACEY
                        Just this once. Please...

           She takes his hand, puts it on her breast. She starts to
           moan. Jake is tempted, but takes his hand off her breast.

                                 JAKE
                        Stacey, look...

                                 STACEY
                        Since we both know what
                        you’re gonna say, how
                        about you just don’t
                        say it?

           Stacey quickly grabs her coat.

                                 JAKE
                        See you Monday, right?

           She races out.

                                 JAKE
                        Right?

           EXT. SHEEP’S MEADOW - CENTRAL PARK - DAY (2012)

           A beautiful Spring day. Cameron and Katie sit on a blanket
           reading the Sunday Times. Cameron looks up from the paper.

                                 CAMERON
                        So my mother’s birthday is
                        next week. My father’s
                        throwing a dinner for her
                        on Saturday night up in
                        Greenwich. You want to go?

                                 KATIE
                        Do you want me to go?

                                 CAMERON
                        Yeah, of course.

           Katie seems uncomfortable. Cameron picks up on this.

                                 CAMERON
                        I mean, if you want to.
                                 KATIE
                        Sure.

                                 CAMERON
                                (surprised)
                        Really?!

                                 KATIE
                        Uh-huh.

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NIGHT

           Katie stands under the Golden Clocks all dressed up.
           Looks beautiful.

           We now see Cameron in line getting tickets. He holds a
           bouquet of flowers.

           Katie starts to look increasingly nervous. She gently rubs
           her hands together not unlike Jake. Cameron now appears.

                                 CAMERON
                        Track 37. It’s this way.

           They walk silently through the station. Katie looks more and
           more uncomfortable.

                                 KATIE
                        Cameron, I can’t do this.

                                 CAMERON
                        What?!

                                 KATIE
                        I...

           She starts to rub her hands faster.

                                 KATIE
                        Can we get some air?

           Cameron looks at his watch.

                                 CAMERON
                        For like 1 minute.

           EXT. 42ND STREET - NIGHT

                                 KATIE
                        I’m sorry.
                                 CAMERON
                        Katie...

                                 KATIE
                        I know how unfair this is.

                                 CAMERON
                        Katie, it’s just my parents.
                        And a few of their friends.
                        Most of whom aren’t horrible.
                        Just rich and boring.

           Katie smiles weakly.

                                 CAMERON
                        And my parents will love
                        you! They will eat you up.
                        I promise.

           Katie looks even more upset.

                                 CAMERON
                        And even if somehow they
                        didn’t, which is not possible,
                        it wouldn’t matter at all
                        to me. Not a bit.

           Cameron looks at his watch. Takes her hand.

                                 CAMERON
                        C’mon... we can still make
                        the train.

           INT. CAMERON’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Cameron and Katie walk into Cameron’s apartment. He throws
           the bouquet of flowers on a chair.

                                 KATIE
                        What will you tell your parents?

                                 CAMERON
                        I’ll tell them I had car
                        trouble.

                                 KATIE
                        But you don’t own a car.

                                 CAMERON
                        So you can imagine.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m really sorry.
                                 CAMERON
                                (curt)
                        OK.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know what happened.

                                 CAMERON
                        And you’re getting a Ph.d
                        in psychology?

                                 KATIE
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 CAMERON
                        It means it’s pretty obvious
                        what happened. You chickened
                        out! Maybe because you were
                        afraid my parents wouldn’t
                        like you. And maybe because
                        you were afraid they’d like
                        you too much and then you’d be
                        in even deeper than you are now.

                                 KATIE
                        How deep am I in?

                                 CAMERON
                        I don’t know, Katie. I don’t
                        know what the fuck we’re doing.
                        But I’ll tell you something--
                        I’m tired of being the girl.

                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m tired of being the girl!!
                        If this is just fucking, and
                        that’s all it is, then that’s
                        fine. Because, you know what,
                        it’s really great fucking. And
                        it makes me happy. And if that’s
                        what’s on the table, I’ll take it.
                        No complaints.

           Katie stares at him for a long minute.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s not just fucking.

                                 CAMERON
                        Good. Cause I was lying about
                        what I just said.
                                 KATIE
                        I don’t know how to do this.

                                 CAMERON
                        Do what?

                                 KATIE
                        Be the girlfriend.

           Cameron strokes her hair back gently.

                                 KATIE
                        I don’t remember my mother at
                        all. Not a thing. And I only
                        had a year-- one little year--
                        with my father before he died.

           Katie fights tears.

                                 KATIE
                        Maybe somebody else would have
                        handled it better, you know.
                        Maybe they would have gotten
                        past it by now. But I just
                        haven’t been able to.

                                 CAMERON
                        It’s OK.

                                 KATIE
                                (now crying)
                        You’re opening up feelings
                        in me that have been locked
                        away for years.

           Cameron hugs her.

                                 CAMERON
                        It’s OK...

           Katie continues to cry. He continues to hold her.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - NIGHT (1985)

           An exhausted Jake, in his brown writing sweater, bangs away
           at the typewriter. The phone rings, Jake grabs it.

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah?

                                 KUMBLE
                        Jake, Jon Kumble. How
                        are you?
                                 JAKE
                        You tell me.

                                 KUMBLE
                        The motion to dismiss was
                        denied. I’m sorry.

           Jake goes numb.

                                 KUMBLE
                        Now this doesn’t mean the
                        judge is taking their side.
                        Or even that he believes they
                        have a particularly strong
                        case. It just means he feels
                        there’s enough there to bring
                        it to trial. It’s a setback,
                        but they still have a very high
                        burden of proof to establish.

           Jake is silent.

                                 KUMBLE
                        Listen, this is a highly
                        unusual case. Sorting through
                        the relevant case law is going
                        to be a major undertaking.
                        I’m going to have to ask you
                        for a $25,000 retainer to start.

           INT. BANK - DAY

           Jake sits at a desk with a humorless BANKER.

                                 BANKER
                        You understand the interest
                        rate on your second mortgage
                        will be 3 3/4 percent higher
                        than on your original note.

           Jake nods. The banker continues to prepare the papers.

                                 JAKE
                        A character in “The Sun Also Rises”
                        when asked how he went broke says
                        two ways: gradually then suddenly.
                                (beat)
                        Damn good writing.

                                 BANKER
                        Should we be concerned
                        about your ability to pay
                        two mortgages?
                                 JAKE
                                (laughs)
                        Why? You’ll just take my home.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - NIGHT

                                 JAKE
                        I’m really sorry, but
                        we just can’t afford to
                        keep you right now.

                                 STACEY
                                (devastated)
                        I love being here. You
                        don’t have to pay me.

                                 JAKE
                        No! Absolutely not.

           Stacey starts to cry.

                                 JAKE
                        But I hope you’ll come visit.

           Stacey nods.

                                 JAKE
                        And when you finish your novel,
                        bring it by. I know everybody.

           INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jake scrambles to get Katie’s coat and knapsack on.
           He’s in the same clothes he wore the day before. He’s stayed
           up all night working.

           EXT. BROADWAY - DAY

           Katie chatters away as an exhausted Jake walks her to school.

           EXT. BANK STREET - DAY

           PARENTS and NANNIES wait for their children to come out from
           school. A disheveled Jake stands by himself-- scribbling
           notes on a pad.

           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Jake sits Katie in front of the TV.
           INT. JAKE’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Katie watches cartoons. We hear the sound of furious typing
           in the background.

           INT. JAKE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jake pulls food out of a McDonald’s bag. Puts it on paper
           plates for him and Katie.

                                 JAKE
                        Wait, I was the Big Mac.
                        You were the cheeseburger.

           He switches the sandwiches around.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - LATE

           Jake types slowly. He can barely keep his eyes open.
           He rests his head on the typewriter keys.

           INT. CAMERON’S BEDROOM - DAY (2012)

           Cameron and Katie have finished making love. He gently rubs
           her belly.

                                 CAMERON
                        God, I love making love to you.
                                (then)
                        Actually, I think I just love you.

           Katie’s silent.

                                 CAMERON
                        I love you too, Cam, is pretty
                        much the perfect response.
                        Then we’d kiss passionately.
                        You’d climb on top of me and I’d
                        fuck you until I brought you to
                        this incredible, heaving orgasm
                        that you’d talk about for weeks.
                        We’d fall asleep together-- arms and
                        legs joyously entangled. Not a bad
                        way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

           Katie remains silent.

                                 CAMERON
                        Long, uninterrupted silence.
                        Definitely not your first
                        choice response.
           The two of them lie there quietly.

                                 CAMERON
                        Not everybody who loves
                        you is going to leave you.

                                 KATIE
                                (points to her head)
                        I know that here.
                                (points to her heart)
                        But not here.

           Cameron kisses her gently.

                                 CAMERON
                        If you need more time, you
                        need more time. No biggie.

           He puts his arms around her tenderly.

                                 KATIE
                        You should find some sweet,
                        uncomplicated girl to love.
                        Stop wasting it on me.

                                 CAMERON
                        I like wasting it on you.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

                                 AMANDA
                        You actually said “Stop
                        wasting it on me?”

                                 KATIE
                        OK, but the thing is...

                                 AMANDA
                        Oh, no, no, no! You’re not
                        going to lecture me. I’m
                        going to lecture you.

           Amanda puts her fork down. Wipes her mouth.

                                 AMANDA
                        Katie... you’re beautiful
                        and brilliant and even
                        immortalized in Western
                        Literature for Chrissake.
                        But you’re also a fucking idiot.

                                 KATIE
                        Amanda!
                                 AMANDA
                        Look, we both know the really
                        pretty girls will always,
                        always, always have a litter
                        of guys chasing them around.
                        This is clearly the way God
                        wants it.

                                 KATIE
                        This is not about...

                                 AMANDA
                        But Cameron is sweet and funny
                        and smart-- and a hottie to boot.
                        Most importantly, he adores you.
                        He loves you. How many times do
                        you think you’re gonna find that?

           Katie tries to talk, but the words don’t come.

                                 AMANDA
                        I know you’re busy trying
                        to save the world, but...

                                 KATIE
                        I’m not trying to save the
                        world. I’m trying to save
                        myself.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - NIGHT (1985)

           Katie comes into the study. Jake proofs a page from a thick
           stack of pages.

                                 KATIE
                        Do you know what Sara said
                        to me today?

                                 JAKE
                                (not looking up)
                        Uh-uh.

                                 KATIE
                        She said, when we’re older,
                        we’re going to...

                                 JAKE
                        Sweetie, I need to concentrate.
                        Go get ready for bed.

                                 KATIE
                        Is there a book tonight?
                                 JAKE
                        Not tonight.

                                 KATIE
                        Why?

                                 JAKE
                        Cause Daddy’s working.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re always working.

                                 JAKE
                        You’re just gonna have to get
                        used to that for a while.

                                 KATIE
                        Sara’s Dad reads two books
                        every night.

                                 JAKE
                        Well you got screwed in
                        the parents’sweepstakes,
                        what can I tell you?

           Katie’s mad. She knocks over the stack of manuscript papers.
           They go flying.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie, God damn it!

           She stares at her father defiantly. Holds her ground.

                                 JAKE
                                (raging)
                        You want to know why I’m
                        always working, do you,
                        do you?! Because we live
                        in the United States of
                        Money!! We need money
                        for food! Money for clothes!
                        Money for the fancy private
                        school I send you to.

           Jake kicks the typewriter off his desk.

                                 JAKE
                        I don’t give a shit about
                        art or friendship or love--
                        I want money!!!

           Katie now looks terrified. 
                                 JAKE
                        Do you have any money?!
                        Cause that’s what we need.
                        You have 60 grand stashed
                        away in your piggy bank?
                        Cause that would be great.
                        Do you?! Do you?!

           Katie runs out crying.

           INT. KATIE’S ROOM - LATER

           Jake comes in Katie’s room. Katie’s in bed. She turns toward
           the wall and pulls the blanket over her head.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie...

           He sits on the edge of the bed. She moves closer to the wall.

                                 JAKE
                        There’s absolutely no excuse
                        for how I behaved. I’m sorry.
                        Really sorry. I love you so
                        much. And I promise I’ll
                        never act like that again.
                        Ever!

           Katie doesn’t respond.

                                 JAKE
                        Hey, what did Sara say
                        today? Tell me.

           He tries to roll her over to face him. She won’t budge.

                                 JAKE
                        When you’re older, you
                        guys are gonna what?
                        C’mon, I want to know.

           He tries again to roll her to face him, but she’s a rock.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie, I swear to God, I’m
                        doing the best I can.

           INT. CAROLYN’S OFFICE - NIGHT (2012)

                                 KATIE
                        Cameron told me he loved
                        me the other day.
                                 CAROLYN
                                (smiles)
                        Really?! How’d that make
                        you feel?

                                 KATIE
                        Good.
                                (then)
                        Scared.

                                 CAROLYN
                        Scared?

                                 KATIE
                        He thinks he loves me
                        because I’m pretty and we
                        have great sex and I have
                        this famous father...
                        But if he saw all the
                        rot underneath the shiny
                        surface he’d...

                                 CAROLYN
                        He’d what?

                                 KATIE
                        Run for the hills and
                        never look back.

           Katie’s lost in her thoughts. Then:

                                 KATIE
                        Sometimes I think it’d
                        be easier to lose him,
                        rather than worry about
                        losing him all the time.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Katie sits at the bar-- reads a book.

           A MAN shooting pool is mesmerized by her. Can’t take his eyes
           off her. She notices him, sips her beer, goes back to her
           book.

           He continues to stare. Katie feels his eyes on her. She
           stares back at him for a long minute.

           She picks up a cherry from the bartender’s tray and starts to
           lick it erotically.
           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The man from the bar fucks her doggie-style on her bed. Katie
           moans loudly.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT

           Cameron and Katie cuddle in bed as they watch a movie-- the
           portrait of domesticity. The credits roll. Cameron gets up.

                                 CAMERON
                        I’m gonna brush.

           INT. KATIE’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cameron brushes. Uses a little paper cup to rinse.

           He finishes. Crumples up the cup and throws it in the trash.
           He notices a bright red wrapper sitting on top of the trash.

           He picks it up, it’s a condom wrapper. Obviously not the kind
           he uses. His heart skips a beat.

           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cameron storms into the bedroom, Holds up the condom wrapper.

                                 CAMERON
                        What the fuck?!

           Katie stares at him-- silent.

                                 CAMERON
                        What the fuck, Katie?!

                                 KATIE
                        I’m so sorry...

                                 CAMERON
                        Sorry?! You left it on
                        top of the fucking trash!!
                        Why didn’t you just Fedex
                        it to me!

           Cameron starts to get dressed.

                                 KATIE
                        Cameron... don’t! Please don’t!

                                 CAMERON
                        You want out! You’re out!!
                                 KATIE
                        I don’t want out! I’m sorry!!
                        So sorry!!

           Cameron grabs his coat. Heads out.

                                 KATIE
                                (shrieks)
                        Cameron!!!

           He turns to face her.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m so scared!!

                                 CAMERON
                        Of what?

                                 KATIE
                        Of you. Of this. Of us.

                                 CAMERON
                        Fuck off Katie!

           INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT

           An incredible dive. Katie is dressed positively slutty. She
           has 5 or 6 beer bottles in front of her.

           She’s very drunk. She talks to GUS, a slimy biker.

                                 GUS
                        So, c’mon, why don’t you
                        come back with me and
                        Jeanie? It’ll be fun.

           Katie stares at him. He’s practically salivating.

                                 GUS
                        She makes great pancakes.

                                 KATIE
                        I do love pancakes...

                                 GUS
                        I’ll get the Mrs.

           He hurries off to find Jeanie.

           The Rolling Stones Wild Horses now plays on the juke box.
           Katie smiles, listens to the song.
                                 KATIE
                        Hi Daddy... Still watching
                        over your little girl, huh?

           The song continues to play.

                                 KATIE
                        I miss you so much!

           She listens for another minute. Turns to the BARTENDER.

                                 KATIE
                        Will you put me in a cab?

           INT. JAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY (1985)

           Jake’s study door opens. An exhausted and unshaven Jake
           stumbles out.

           He wanders into the kitchen. Takes a handful of Cheerios,
           stuffs it in his mouth and heads back to the study.

           We now see Katie sitting on the living room floor, paging
           through a book. She’s surrounded by half-a-dozen other books.

                                 KATIE
                        Daddy, could you read me
                        one book?

           Jake stares at her. He’s beyond exhausted. He sits down on
           the floor. Puts her on his lap.

                                 JAKE
                        How about if we read all
                        of them?

           INT. RESTAURANT - DAY (2012)

           A much older Ted Shipley, elegantly dressed, sits at a table.
           He lights up as Katie comes in.

                                 KATIE
                        Uncle Teddy!

                        Hey sweetheart.

           They hug warmly.

                                 KATIE
                        And the girls?

                                 TED
                        Maggie’s got her hands full
                        raising the twins in Boston.
                        And Zoe and her partner are
                        busy raising apples in
                        Washington State.

                        I wish your Dad could see
                        you. He’d be so proud.

                                 KATIE
                        Only about the outside.

                        You know, I’ve often thought
                        if...

                        Don’t!!... Please don’t.

           Ted pulls out a handkerchief. Wipes his eyes.

                                 TED
                        I become more like an old

                        Katie, I wanted to see you
                        because...

           Ted hesitates, doesn’t want to say it.

                                 TED
                        They’re making a movie about
                        your father. About the final
                        year of his life. And you,
                        of course.

           Katie looks very upset.

           Katie is silent.

                        Not in this lifetime.

                        Katie, this guy’s gonna have
                        an awful lot to do with how
                        future generations view your
                        father and his work. You
                        should spend an hour having
                        coffee with him.

           INT. DOWNTOWN CAFE - DAY

           Katie’s with IAN, a young film director.

                                 IAN
                        Ever since Philip Seymour
                        Hoffman scored an Oscar for
                        Capote, every actor in town
                        wants to play an fdw.

                                 KATIE
                        Fdw?

                                 IAN
                        Famous dead writer.

           Katie shoots him a nasty look. Ian’s checking out the ass of
           a HOT WAITRESS, doesn’t see it.

                                 IAN
                        And your father’s...

                                 KATIE
                        As dead as any of them.

                                 IAN
                                (missing the sarcasm)
                        Exactly.

           Ian suddenly looks glum.

                                 IAN
                        We’re shooting in Toronto, but
                        I promise even you won’t be able
                        to tell it’s not Greenwich Village.
                                 KATIE
                        We lived on the Upper West Side.

                                 IAN
                        Village plays artier.

                                 KATIE
                                (looks at her watch)
                        I don’t mean to be rude, but
                        I see patients uptown.

                                 IAN
                        Oh, and the suicide scene is
                        gonna blow you away!

           Katie’s face turns white.

                                 KATIE
                        My father didn’t commit suicide!!

                                 IAN
                        It’s the price you pay for
                        working with stars. The Big
                        Dog thinks suicide guarantees
                        him an Oscar nom. Which...
                        it probably does.
                                (laughs)
                        Hollywood’s so fucked-up.

                                 KATIE
                        But it’s not true!

                                 IAN
                        But it’s better than the truth!

           Ian sees he’s upset her.

                                 IAN
                        Hey, did I mention we’re in
                        talks with Abigail Breslin
                        to play you? You think we
                        can get away with making
                        your character 15?

           INT. DR. CORMAN’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 KATIE
                        What do you mean they’re
                        giving her up?!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Lucy’s foster parents asked
                        to have her transferred.
                                 KATIE
                        Why?!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        When Lucy came to them she
                        was a special needs case
                        because she wasn’t speaking.
                        Now that she is, she’s lost
                        that classification.

                                 KATIE
                        So?

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        So her monthly stipend’s
                        been reduced.

                                 KATIE
                        This is about money?!

           Dr. Corman nods.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ll make up the difference!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        It doesn’t work like that.
                        Lucy’s already been reassigned.
                        She moves to a foster care
                        facility in Bed Stuy next week.

                                 KATIE
                        Brooklyn?! She’s never been
                        more than 10 blocks from
                        125th street in her life!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Katie, if you’re going to work
                        with this population you’re
                        going to have to develop a high
                        tolerance for this sort of thing.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s gonna take her an hour on
                        the subway to come see me.

           Dr. Corman suddenly looks very uncomfortable.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        You can’t see her anymore.

                                 KATIE
                                (stunned)
                        What?!
                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Our funding only permits us
                        to see residents of New York
                        County.

                                 KATIE
                        So?

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Brooklyn is King’s County.

                                 KATIE
                        It’s all New York City!

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        Yes, but different counties.
                        I have no discretion over this.

           Katie’s shocked.

                                 DR. CORMAN
                        You’ve done an incredible
                        job with Lucy, I want you
                        to know that.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - NIGHT (1985)

           Jake types away. He’s more tired than we’ve ever seen him.

           He stops typing. Reads what he wrote. Rips the paper out of
           the typewriter.

                                 JAKE
                        They’re right! It’s all
                        over for me-- I’m done.

           Jake bites the paper. Starts to rip it with his teeth like a
           rabid dog.

           He grunts and growls until the paper is in tiny pieces all
           over the floor.

           His tantrum over, he sits back down.

           Takes a blank piece of paper, rolls it into the typewriter.

           Starts pounding away at the keys.

                        No, no... Not Lucy Connors!
                        Lucy Carter! Well, I’m glad you
                        have a file for Lucy Connors, but
                        I don’t know who that is. We’re
                        transferring a Lucy CARTER from
                        Harlem to Bed Stuy... I’ve e-mailed
                        you her file three times... Well,
                        is there anyone there who does
                        know how to use the computer?

           Katie gives the phone the finger just like her father did
           with William.

                                 KATIE
                        You say you’re gonna call back,
                        but you don’t! This is my fourth...
                        Can you just give me the name of
                        her new therapist?... OK, can
                        you give me your name... Can you
                        name any one of the 50 states?

           We hear a click. The woman has hung up.

                        We have an awful lot to talk about.
                        I wish you would speak to me.

           Lucy stares. Says nothing.

                                 KATIE
                        A new family. New neighborhood.

           Lucy is stone-faced.

                                 KATIE
                        New therapist.

           Lucy looks at Katie. BURSTS into tears.

           Katie kneels on the floor. Puts her arms out wide.

                                 KATIE
                        C’mere.

           Lucy runs over to Katie. She punches Katie hard in the face.
           Katie falls over. Her nose is bleeding! Lucy hits her again.
           And again. Katie grabs her arms.
                                 KATIE
                        Stop it!!

           Lucy struggles fiercely.

                                 KATIE
                        Stop it!!

           Katie tries to hold onto her arms.

                                 KATIE
                        Stop it!!

           Katie finally pins her onto the ground.

                                 KATIE
                        If you want to keep seeing
                        me, stop it.

           Lucy looks surprised. Stops struggling.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - BOAT POND - DAY

           Katie and Lucy watch the miniature sail boats glide along the
           water.

                                 KATIE
                        I’m an orphan, too. But the
                        opposite of you. My mother
                        died first. Then my father.
                        I don’t really remember my
                        mother. But I loved, loved,
                        loved my father.

           Lucy looks at Katie, surprised by the confession.

                                 KATIE
                        He was a writer and he was
                        actually quite famous. But
                        we were still poor. Not poor
                        poor-- but we were spending
                        a lot more money than we
                        were making-- upper middle
                        class poor he used to call
                        it. And then some things
                        happened and I think, I
                        honestly believe, my
                        father somehow knew he
                        was going to die.

           Katie now has tears in her eyes.
                                 KATIE
                        Anyway, we had all these bills
                        and my father wasn’t so well...
                        mentally. But he stayed up all
                        night, every night, to finish
                        this book. Because he wanted to
                        protect me before he was gone.
                        He was a writer and that’s how
                        he could take care of me--
                        by writing. 

           Katie is now crying freely.

                                 KATIE
                        And my father wrote one
                        last book. It was about me.
                        It was about his life with me.
                        And when it was published people
                        loved it and critics who had
                        written him off were now
                        calling him the best American
                        writer of the 20th century.

           Katie wipes her face.

                                 KATIE
                        When he died we were deep in
                        debt. Owed everybody money.
                        But this book just kept selling
                        and selling. Year after year.
                        All over the world. And I was
                        the sole heir to his literary
                        estate. So when I was 21, I
                        inherited all this money and
                        could tell my aunt to fuck off
                        which I think my father pretty
                        much knew I would want to do.

           Lucy is clearly shocked at the conversation.

                                 KATIE
                        Anyway, I’m telling you all this
                        because... I want... I want...

           Katie can’t spit it out.

                                 KATIE
                        You want to come live with me?
                        Because I want to adopt you. I
                        think I could really love you
                        and take care of you and make
                        a nice home for you.

           Lucy stares at Katie. Shocked!!
                                 KATIE
                        You want to do that?

                                  LUCY
                        Yeah!!!

           Lucy’s crying now, too. She hugs Katie.

                                 KATIE
                        Really?!

                                 LUCY
                        Uh-huh!

           They remain hugging and crying.

           INT. TED’S OFFICE - DAY (1985)

           Ted pages through a manuscript.

                                 TED
                        How do you write a book
                        in 3 months?

           Jake shrugs.

                                 TED
                        It usually takes you 2 years.

           Jake is too exhausted to argue. Ted closes the manuscript.
           Reads the title.

                                (skeptical)
                        Is it any good?

                                 JAKE
                        I have no fucking idea.

           INT. FAMILY COURT - DAY (2012)

           A middle-aged FEMALE JUDGE addresses Katie.

                                 JUDGE
                        Katie, do you currently
                        have any children?

                                 KATIE
                        No, but I’m getting my Ph.d in
                        psychology with a specialization
                        in child development from Columbia.
                                 JUDGE
                        It’s not the same thing.

                                 KATIE
                        No.

                                 JUDGE
                        It’s highly unusual for a therapist
                        to ask to adopt a client.

                                 KATIE
                        Your honor, I’ve worked at the
                        Harlem Children’s Clinic for over
                        4 years. I’ve treated almost 200
                        children. I’ve never had the slightest
                        desire to adopt any of them. I just
                        have a very special bond with Lucy.

                                 JUDGE
                        Why Lucy?

                                 KATIE
                        I think, in part, because we’re
                        both orphans. My mother died in
                        a car accident when I was 3.
                        My father was Jake Davis-- the writer.

                                 JUDGE
                        Yes, I know. I’m a big fan of
                        your father’s work.

                                 KATIE
                        Thank you.

                                 JUDGE
                        He was a great writer.

                                 KATIE
                        I think he was an even better father.

                                 JUDGE
                        How so?

                                 KATIE
                        Well, he had his demons for sure.
                        He struggled with depression and
                        money and... a lot of things.
                        But... but, I always knew how much
                        he loved me. How nothing in his life--
                        not his books, not his fame, not even
                        his health mattered half as much to
                        him as I did. I never doubted for
                        a second how totally and completely
                        loved I was. It was wonderful-- and rare.
           Katie starts to cry softly.

                                 KATIE
                        And... I know I have my own demons.
                        Things I struggle with. But if
                        I’m given the chance, I think--
                        no, I know I could make Lucy
                        feel just as loved as I did.

           The judge is obviously moved by her response.

                                 JUDGE
                        Katie, you’re currently a
                        full-time graduate student?

                                 KATIE
                        Yes.

                                 JUDGE
                        How will you materially
                        support Lucy?

                                 KATIE
                        I’m the sole heir to my
                        father’s literary estate.

                                 JUDGE
                        And what’s your approximate
                        net worth?

                                 KATIE
                        $21 million dollars, your honor.

                                 JUDGE
                        I’ll render my judgement
                        within 30 days.

           INT. LAW FIRM CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY (1985)

           Jake’s a mess. We can see he’s barely slept in weeks.
           McNally and Kumble come in. Sit down solemnly.

           McNally hands Jake a cigar.

                                 MCNALLY
                        Congratulations, Jake.

                                 JAKE
                                (confused)
                        For what?

                                 KUMBLE
                        You’re gonna be an uncle again.
                                 MCNALLY
                        It seems your brother-in-law
                        William has been having a
                        long-term affair with his
                        secretary. And she’s pregnant.
                        And she’s keeping it.

                                 KUMBLE
                        Elizabeth’s filing for divorce.
                        They’ve dropped the law suit.

           Jake is too stunned to speak.

                                 MCNALLY
                        Whoops!!!

           McNally and Kumble HOWL with laughter.

           INT. JAKE’S STUDY - EVENING

           Jake puts bills into three long rows. He moves a bill back
           and forth from pile to pile.

                                 JAKE
                        Fuck ‘em.

           He sweeps all the bills into the trash can.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie, let’s go out for dinner.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT (2012)

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I can understand wanting
                        to have a child. Lord knows
                        it’s easier to love a kid
                        than a man-- and more
                        rewarding. But why adopt
                        this little colored girl?

                                 KATIE
                        Her name is Lucy.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Why not have one of your
                        own? You certainly don’t
                        want for male attention.
                                (then)
                        And maybe they’ll be a
                        genius like your father.
           Katie looks shocked. The first nice thing Elizabeth’s said
           about Jake in decades.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I hated your father, but I
                        wasn’t blind to his gifts.

                                 KATIE
                        He’s been dead 25 years.
                        How can you still be so
                        angry with him?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I don’t know. What are you
                        still so angry about?!

                                 KATIE
                                (blurts out)
                        The love he couldn’t give
                        me for all those years he
                        was gone!

           Katie sits there stunned as the simple truth of her life
           washes over her.

           An epiphany in the last place you’d expect to find it.

           EXT. MADISON AVENUE - NIGHT

           Katie wanders down Madison Avenue. Still in a daze from her
           confession.

           EXT. 57TH STREET - LATER

           She wanders past the Niketown store. There’s a huge window
           display of ping pong tables with a sign that says:

           “New York Welcomes the World Table Tennis Championship”

           Katie can’t help but smile.

           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Katie stares at a photo booth strip of pictures of her and
           Cameron taken from a cheesy mall photo booth.

           They’re screwing around and laughing in all the pictures.
           INT. KATIE’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Very late. Katie paces as she talks on her cell.

                                 KATIE
                        Hey Cameron, it’s Katie. I’m
                        calling at this bizarre hour
                        because I wanted to make sure
                        I got your voicemail. I realized
                        something tonight. Something
                        awful-- and maybe wonderful, too,
                        I don’t know. I realized I’ve
                        been too angry to love you. Too
                        angry and... too afraid.

           Katie fights back tears.

                                 KATIE
                        I’ve lost so many years to anger
                        and fear-- it’s time to move on.
                        And I want to move on with you.
                        I know I hurt you and I’m sorry.
                        So, so sorry. But where there’s
                        love there should be forgiveness.
                        Please forgive me. So if you’re not
                        with some sweet, uncomplicated girl
                        by now-- and if you don’t just out
                        and out hate me, then... call me back.
                        Because I really want to talk to you.

           Katie closes her phone. Takes a deep breath.

                                 KATIE
                        OK, now for real.

           She dials Cameron’s number. Shakes nervously as the phone
           rings. We hear Cameron’s voice mail:

                                 CAMERON
                        Hey, it’s Cameron. Leave
                        a message.

           We hear the beep. Katie tries to speak, but nothing comes
           out. She slams her cell shut. Throws the phone in disgust.

           She opens her closet. Pulls out Jake’s brown writing sweater.

           She puts it in a large padded envelope and addresses it to
           Cameron.

           INT. CAFE DES ARTISTE - NIGHT (1985)

           Jake and Katie enter the plush restaurant dressed elegantly.
                                 MAITRE D’
                        Mr. Davis, what a nice surprise.

                                 JAKE
                        And this is my date, Miss Katie.

                                 MAITRE D’
                        A pleasure, mademoiselle.

           Katie giggles.

           INT. CAFE DES ARTISTE - LATER

           Jake and Katie are seated at a table.

                                 KATIE
                        Why are we eating at such a
                        nice place?

                                 JAKE
                        We’re celebrating.

                                 KATIE
                        What?

                                 JAKE
                        Your birthday.

                                 KATIE
                        My birthday’s not for another
                        8 months.

                                 JAKE
                        Well we don’t want to wait
                        until the last minute, do we?

           Katie laughs. Jake stares adoringly at his beautiful little
           girl.

           INT. KATIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jake reads a very tired Katie a bedtime story.

                                 JAKE
                        And so they lived...

           He waits for Katie to say, “happily ever after” but she’s
           already fallen asleep.

           Jake tucks her under the covers. Turns out the light. Strokes
           her hair gently.
                                 JAKE
                        I don’t care if people know my
                        name or don’t know my name. If
                        they read my books or don’t read
                        my books. I don’t care if I ever
                        write another word. Just so long
                        as I get to take care of you--
                        watch you grow up. That’ll be
                        more than enough. A life well spent.
                                (beat)
                        You’re my Potato Chip.

           He kisses her gently on the forehead.

                                 JAKE
                        You and no one else.

           Jake gets up. Heads out.

           We now see Katie open her eyes. She’s heard every word.

           INT. JAKE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jake washes his face. Sees how old and tired he looks.

           He suddenly bursts into tears. All the fear and frustration
           and exhaustion comes pouring out. He bawls for a long minute.
           He suddenly vomits.

           Starts to shake back and forth-- rubs his hands feverishly.
           It’s worse than we’ve ever seen it. He tries to calm himself.

                                 JAKE
                        It’s over. All over.

           He rocks back and forth even more frantically.

                                 JAKE
                        It’s over. You won.

           He now has no control over his body. He bangs his head hard
           against the mirror. There’s a gash on his forehead.

                                 JAKE
                        You won. It’s over.

           He tries to steady himself. Can’t.

           He rocks even more feverishly. Crashes into the glass shower
           stall. Smashes it. Shards slice him.
           INT. KATIE’S ROOM - SAME

           Katie hears a noise. Opens her eyes. She’s exhausted.
           Falls back asleep.

           INT. JAKE’S BATHROOM - SAME

           Jake lies on the ground-- bleeds profusely. He struggles to
           get up. Gets to his knees.

                                 JAKE
                                (barely audible)
                        Katie... Katie...

           He falls back down. Struggles to get up again-- he’s nothing
           if not a fighter.

                                 JAKE
                        Katie... Katie...

           He crawls towards the bathroom door. We now see a thick glass
           shard jutting through his back. He collapses on the floor.

           TO BLACK

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           A HUGE GATHERING OF PEOPLE.

           Katie is in an expensive black dress. Elizabeth holds her
           hand. Katie stares at the coffin.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Do you want to say something
                        to your father?

           Katie approaches the coffin. Whispers something to her Dad.
           Comes back.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What did you say?

           But Katie is now silent!

           INT. DINING ROOM - ELIZABETH’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Katie, do you want more chicken?

           Katie doesn’t say anything. Keeps eating.
                                 ELIZABETH
                        Katie, I’m asking you if
                        you’d like more chicken
                        and I’d like you to answer
                        me please.

           Katie continues to eat in silence.

                                (overly animated)
                        Hi Katie, so nice to meet you!

           INT. BREARLEY SCHOOL - DAY

           Katie, in crisp uniform and bow, silently does her work.

           INT. KATIE & AMANDA - DINER (2012)

                                 AMANDA
                        You still haven’t heard
                        from the judge?

                                 KATIE
                        No, and it’s been over 30
                        days. My lawyer says that’s
                        a bad sign.

           The heaviness hangs in the air.

                                 AMANDA
                        And you never heard from
                        Cameron either?

                                 KATIE
                        Uh-uh.

                                 AMANDA
                                (without conviction)
                        Maybe it’s for the best.

           Katie’s silent. Clearly doesn’t think it’s for the best.

                                 AMANDA
                        Then call him! Or text him.
                        Or show up naked in his bed.
                        If he’s your guy, then do
                        whatever you have to do to
                        get him back.
                                 KATIE
                        I sent him the most precious
                        thing in the world to me and I
                        never even heard back from him.
                        For all I know, he sold it on
                        ebay. I’m done chasing him.
                        That ship has sailed.
                                (then)
                        I’m good at being alone--
                        it’s my thing.

           INT. WALDORF ASTORIA - BALLROOM - NIGHT (1985)

           Ted, in black tie, is on the dais of a packed ballroom.

                                 TED
                        It’s a great honor to accept
                        this Pulitzer on behalf of my
                        client, the late Jake Davis.
                        That Fathers and Daughters has
                        won every major literary award
                        and has been perched atop the
                        bestseller’s list for a year
                        is every agent’s dream. That
                        I never got to buy Jake a
                        drink and slap him on the back
                        is my own personal nightmare.

           We now see Elizabeth and Katie sitting in the front. Katie is
           silent and expressionless.

           INT. ELIZABETH’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Speak!! Speak God damnit!!
                        Speak!!

           Katie is silent.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Speak!! Speak you little bitch!!

           Elizabeth slaps Katie hard across the face. Katie doesn’t
           flinch. Stares defiantly at Elizabeth.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?

           Katie is silent.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?
           Katie says nothing.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        What?!!

           Katie continues to stare as we...

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK PLAYGROUND - DAY (2012)

           A brisk, fall day. We hear a CHILD’S VOICE but can’t see the
           speaker.

                                 VOICE
                        What?
                                (beat)
                        What?...

           We now see Lucy staring at Katie.

                                 LUCY
                        Mama what?

                                 KATIE
                        It’s getting to be dinner
                        time. I think we should go.

           Lucy jumps off the climbing bars.

           Katie drapes a colorful scarf around Lucy. Lovingly ties it
           around her neck. They head out of the park, arm in arm.

                                 LUCY
                        What’s for dinner?

                                 KATIE
                        I thought I’d make pasta.

           Lucy makes a face.

                                 LUCY
                        Can we order in?

                                 KATIE
                        Thai.

                                 LUCY
                        Sushi.

                                 KATIE
                        OK, but you’re paying.
                        I got it last time.
           Lucy smiles.

                                 KATIE
                        You’re my Potato Chip,
                        you know that?

           Lucy nods.

                                 KATIE
                        You and no one else.

           Katie kisses her gently on the nose.

           The Rolling Stone’s “Wild Horses” begins to play.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST - CONTINUOUS

           Katie takes Lucy’s hand as they cross the street. We hear the
           two of them chatting and laughing over the MUSIC.

           As they approach Katie’s building, the camera pulls back--
           the movie feels like it’s ending.

           SUDDENLY KATIE STOPS DEAD-- stares straight ahead.

           We see Cameron standing outside her building in Jake’s old
           brown sweater.

           Cameron and Katie stare at each other for a long minute.

           Lucy looks at Cameron. Then at Katie. She totally gets what’s
           going on. Her face breaks into a HUGE SMILE.

           The music swells up as we...

           FADE OUT
