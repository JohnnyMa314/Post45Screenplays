                                 DR. BRIGITTA SORENSON (V.O.)
                             (Norwegian accent)
                        Anna Bagenholm was skiing the first 
                        time she died. 

           REAL NEWS FOOTAGE: RESCUERS reach ANNA. She’s buried under ice. 
           Only her feet and skis poking out. 

                                 SORENSON (V.O.)
                        She fell headfirst into a frozen 
                        stream. She had been dead for an hour 
                        by the time they found her. Her 
                        temperature had dropped 45 degrees. 

           FOOTAGE: doctors resuscitate Anna. Her pupils eerily dilated.

                                 SORENSON (V.O.)
                        As a last resort, they attached her to 
                        a machine that warmed her blood. And 
                        then -- her heart started to beat... 
                        People say death is the great 
                        equalizer. But Bagenholm taught us not 
                        all death is equal.

           ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. We move forward into:

           A MASSIVE LAB 

           Starred with display lights. Technicians deferentially step out 
           of our way, giving us a view of shelves laden with glowing 
           PETRI-DISHES. MONITORS magnify the BACTERIAL CULTURES inside. 

                                 SORENSON (V.O.)
                        Hibernation has been possible since 
                        the earliest forms of life. Bacteria 
                        dormant since the dinosaurs can be 
                        revived 250 million years later. And 
                        start up exactly where it left off...

           And then we see VAULTS: each containing a HUMAN HIBERNATING in 
           the fetal position. Thermal Scans read “CORE BODY TEMPERATURE: 
           40°F” and show their hearts contracting a mere 9 BEATS/MINUTE.

                                 SORENSON (V.O.)
                        Imagine the benefits of hibernation. 
                        If diagnosed with a fatal illness, you 
                        could enter stasis, only to be woken 
                        up when a cure was found. During a 
                        biological attack or deadly outbreak, 
                        people could hibernate until it was 
                        safe to return to normal life. 
                                 SORENSON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        It could make human exploration of 
                        deep space possible...

           We see ourselves reflected in the glass of the vaults as a 
           WOMAN (38). Keen eyes filled with idealism. We realize this 
           move through the lab has been from Sorenson’s POV:

                                 SORENSON (V.O.)
                        But who would sign up for an 
                        experiment with an unknown survival 
                        rate? 

           PUSH IN ON: SEAN QUINN (34) in a chamber. Tattooed, scarred. 
           Imposing, like he’s too big for his vault. Ready to burst out. 

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           SEAN QUINN APPROACHING AN APARTMENT COMPLEX - AFTERNOON

           Easy gait. Warm smile, which helps because he has a mouth that 
           draws trouble. He wears a UPS UNIFORM and carries a delivery.

           SUPER TITLE: 2013

           Quinn RAPS at a door in 10 HILLS, a rundown section of Boston. 
           A YOUNG BOY (5) answers. Clearly anxious at the sight of Quinn-- 
           huge, tattooed, a SCAR on one cheek. 

           Quinn looks way down at him...and grins. 

                                 QUINN
                        You know what? I think I have those 
                        same pajamas. 

           The young boy glances at the COLORFUL DINOSAURS on his PJs. 

                                 BOY
                        What happened to your face?

                                 QUINN
                        T-Rex bite.

           The boy smiles.

           QUINN’S UPS TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn hops into his truck. Startles as he sees A MAN IN A 
           BASEBALL CAP squatting on the floor. He’s opened and is sifting 
           through one of the boxes.

                                 QUINN
                        Hey! Don’t touch those!
           He throws the man against the shelves -- the man’s hat falling 
           off -- Quinn recognizes AUSTIN MORAN (18), white-blond hair.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Didn’t think they’d hire someone with 
                        a grand theft conviction.

                                 QUINN
                        Thinking doesn’t suit you. The fuck 
                        are you doing here?

                                 AUSTIN
                        My brother wants to see you. 

           Quinn tenses. Tries to hide it. 

                                 QUINN
                        I’ve got a route to finish. 

           Austin -- the cocky smile of someone whose brother is boss. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        It can wait. He can’t.

           He nods to something behind Quinn -- LATICIA (19, striking, 
           Hispanic) steps inside. All business. She frisks Quinn. 

           Finding nothing, she leads him to a JEEP parked outside. Austin 
           kicks the UPS truck’s door closed and follows.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A DILAPIDATED DOG TRACK

           Gamblers watch race broadcasts from across the globe. Austin 
           leads Quinn to a different wing, down a dark corridor to

           A CRAMMED OFFICE

           Guarded by THREE YOUNG DOBERMANS. They put their paws on 
           Quinn’s chest, greeting an old friend. 

           “RAJ” MEHTA (51, dapper in an Oxford shirt and alligator shoes) 
           works souped-up computers running so hot the windows have 
           steamed. The monitors show he has hacked the police network. 

           Quinn gives him a friendly nod, but Raj stares back with an 
           unsettling intensity. Austin disappears through a door. Once 
           he’s gone, Raj whispers:

                                 RAJ
                        Do what he tells you. If you don’t, I 
                        can’t protect you -- 
           Before he can say more, Austin reappears, motioning Quinn into

           THE OWNER’S OFFICE

           Overlooking the decaying track. Nobody’s inside the room: just 
           a crappy desk and some cheap plastic chairs. Quinn takes a 
           seat, waiting for Moran. Then, through the far door:

           A MUFFLED GUNSHOT. Then ANOTHER. Then A THIRD.

           Quinn gets up to leave, but Austin stares him back into his 
           seat. 

           The door opens. In comes ANDREW MORAN (35): well-groomed, 
           charming. In another life a banker or lawyer, but he never got 
           out of the hard world he grew up in. Moran holds a TENNIS BALL 
           and wears a medical smock splattered in BLOOD. 

                                 MORAN
                             (smiles)
                        Sean. Good to see you. 

           Quinn stares at the blood. Off his look, Moran laughs.

                                 MORAN
                        Just dogs. You heard they’re shutting 
                        down the track, right? Because it’s 
                        “inhumane?” So now we have to do the 
                        nice, humane thing and kill all these 
                        dogs before investigators show up and 
                        see how they’ve all got parasites or 
                        whatever.

           He removes the smock, revealing an EXPENSIVE SUIT. 

                                 MORAN
                        It's hard, you know? But things 
                        change. Sometimes you have to say 
                        goodbye to your old friends. Anyway, I 
                        throw them the ball before I do it.

           He tosses Quinn the ball.

                                 MORAN
                        So at least they're not looking me in 
                        the eye as they're shot. Speaking of 
                        shots, want one?

                                 QUINN
                             (shaking his head)
                        Seeing Chloe later.
                                 MORAN
                        Never stopped you before. Can we get 
                        all the children outside before we 
                        start?

           Moran looks at Austin, but Austin doesn’t get it. 

                                 MORAN
                        Austin. You. Go. I think I hear the 
                        ice cream truck.

           Austin blushes. Exits.

                                 MORAN
                        I’ve got a job for --

                                 QUINN
                        -- No. I’m sorry, no. I can’t risk 
                        doing more time.

           A gunshot from outside. Moran’s face darkens.

                                 MORAN
                        This isn’t a social club, Quinn. 
                        Nobody walks away.

                                 QUINN
                        Maybe I don’t want to miss any more of 
                        my daughter’s life -- 

                                 MORAN
                             (cutting him off)
                        Close your eyes. 

           Quinn -- scared now -- as another shot rings out. He glances at 
           the blood all over Moran’s smock.

                                 QUINN
                        Why?

                                 MORAN
                        Close them. 

           Quinn -- seeing no alternative -- closes his eyes.

                                 MORAN
                        Picture you stay with us. Picture what 
                        you’ll be able to provide for Chloe -- 
                        private school, all the shit you never 
                        had as a kid...Now picture what it’s 
                        like without me. You see anything? 
                             (beat)
                        Exactly. Without me there is no 
                        future. 
           Quinn opens his eyes.

                                 QUINN
                        That’s where you’re wrong. I don’t 
                        need your paycheck. I’m happy to punch 
                        the clock with everyone else. I don’t 
                        care if I get stuck doing it forever, 
                        long as --

                                 MORAN
                             (cutting him off)
                        Don't bet on forever, Sean. That gives 
                        the rest of the world forever to fuck 
                        it up for you.

           This is clearly a threat. And taken as one.

                                 QUINN
                        I have real work to do. 
                             (he turns to leave, stops)
                        Are you going to shoot me in the back 
                        as I walk away?

                                 MORAN
                        Nah. You’re already dead to me.

           A chill. Quinn strides out. As he passes through the door: a 
           wave of relief that he’s still alive. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. QUINN’S MATCHBOX OF A HOUSE

           Iron bars over every window. But the open picture books and 
           scattered board games breathe with life.

           Quinn holds his daughter, CHLOE, up so she can hammer a DEAD 
           BOLT to the front door. Chloe’s a six-year-old REDHEAD, with 
           the scraped knuckles and knees of a tomboy.

                                 CHLOE
                        Mommy says this is a bad neighborhood. 
                        Is the new lock cause you’re scared?

           He is scared. But he would never let his daughter know it.

                                 QUINN
                        Not at all! It’s the outside that’s 
                        scared of me. Plus I have to keep out 
                        all my fans.

           She finishes hammering and shuts the bolt. Crows in victory.
                                 CHLOE
                        We did it!

           Quinn puts her down and she flexes in the mirror, admiring her 
           tough-ass self in her dad’s tool belt and giant work boots. 

           A sudden KNOCK. Chloe starts to unlock the door, but Quinn 
           stops her --

                                 QUINN
                        You can’t trust people, Chloe. You 
                        gotta be careful who you let in. 

                                 AMY (O.S.)
                        I can hear you! Open the damn door!

                                 QUINN
                        Speaking of my fans...

           He unlocks it. AMY (28, now we know where Chloe got her red 
           hair) brushes inside. She hands Chloe her backpack as Quinn 
           looks through the doorway:

           A BMW pulled up outside. BRAND-NEW. No plates yet. 

                                 QUINN
                        Ooh, that’s some new car Mommy’s got. 
                        Santa Claus, huh? How often does he 
                        spend the night? 

           But Chloe pulls something from her backpack. Tugs Quinn’s arm.

                                 CHLOE
                        Look! Look what I made!

           His anger boils off as he sees: a woven BRACELET IN HER HAND.

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s a friendship bracelet. Mom says 
                        you don’t have any friends --

                                 QUINN
                        Oh, she does? Well, you can tell Mommy 
                        she has too many friends.

           She wraps the bracelet around Quinn’s wrist.

                                 CHLOE
                        You can wear it all the time and think 
                        of me!

           But it’s TOO SHORT. Chloe’s face falls. Her moment ruined.
                                 QUINN
                        Wait wait wait --

           He ties it around her wrist. Perfect fit. 

                                 QUINN
                        Now you can wear it and think of me 
                        thinking of you.

           Chloe beams. Amy gives him a look: good save. But that’s when 
           Quinn notices the STACK OF PAPERS in her hands. 

           INT. QUINN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           O.S. Chloe practices a SIMPLE MINUET on the piano as Quinn 
           skims custody documents. Looks up at Amy, aghast.

                                 QUINN
                        “Sundays from noon to five”? Her T-
                        ball coach gets more time with her 
                        than that.

           Quinn opens a drawer: inside, a bottle of Jameson next to his 
           .40 BERETTA. He pours some into the nearest glass. Drinks it.

                                 AMY
                        Just sign. We both know you don’t have 
                        money for lawyers --  

                                 QUINN
                             (too loud)
                        And how do you, Amy? Is Moran giving 
                        it to you? That would explain the car--

           The piano playing stops abruptly. Chloe’s clearly listening. 
           Quinn downs another drink. 

                                 QUINN
                        You take her away and -- I don’t know 
                        what I’ll do --

           She looks at him. Moved by his vulnerability. 

                                 QUINN 
                        We could be happy here. Without that 
                        other life. Without Moran’s money. 
                             (begging)
                        I know it.

                                 AMY
                        It’s sweet that you think so. 
                             (beat)
                        And sad.   
           She turns away. Doesn’t see that Quinn has a cloudy look in his 
           eyes. Unclear whether it’s humiliation or anger or tears or --

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Quinn awakens in an armchair. Disoriented. A pounding headache.

           The bottle of Jameson has spilled all over the coffee table. He 
           reaches forward to clean it up, then slowly turns his arm over--

           LONG RED SCRATCHES. Like he picked a fight with a bear. 

           His eye falls on something on the floor. His .40 BERETTA.

                                 QUINN
                             (horrified)
                        Chloe?

           No answer. He tries to move, but he’s dizzy. He dry heaves. 

           INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn stumbles down the hall. SIRENS in the background.

                                 QUINN
                        CHLOE!

           He opens the door to a darkened room. Just enough light to see 

           A LITTLE GIRL’S BED. BLOOD ON THE SHEETS and WALL. His heart 
           almost stops. BANGING from the front door. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Police! Open the door!

           Quinn sees the BATHROOM LIGHT on in the otherwise dark house.

           HE STEPS INTO THE BATHROOM. 

           BLOOD COMING FROM BEHIND THE DOOR. He slowly turns. Sees:

           Amy hanging from the bathrobe hook. BULLETS IN HER CHEST drain 
           blood. 

           TWO COPS BURST IN, guns out.

                                 COP 1
                        Hands up, hands up --
           EXT. QUINN’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn, dazed and handcuffed, struggles to get free as cops 
           force him toward a squad car. His vision still blurry as he 
           takes in the growing crowd of neighbors, cops, ambulances.  

                                 QUINN
                             (panicked)
                        My daughter’s still in the house -- we 
                        need to find her -- 

           Tears form in Quinn’s eyes, his desperation growing -- 

                                 QUINN 
                        SOMEBODY FIND MY DAUGHTER.

           INT. CELL BLOCK - CONCORD PRISON

           SUPER TITLE: 2014. 

           Dark, imposing cells. Quinn, in a PRISON UNIFORM, sits on his 
           hard cot, filling out “HAVE YOU SEEN ME” ads with photos of 
           Chloe. 

           His CELLMATE, skinny as a reed, peers down at him from the top 
           bunk. 

                                 CELLMATE
                        Everyone says you killed her. 

           Quinn’s jaw unconsciously tightens.

                                 QUINN
                        I was never accused of that. 

                                 CELLMATE
                             (coy smile)
                        That’s ‘cause they never found a body. 
                        Where’d ya hide it?

           Quinn forces himself to ignore him. Continues writing 
           descriptions of his daughter on the forms.

                                 SORENSON (O.S.)
                        The Department of Corrections can’t 
                        afford this palace you’re in...

           INT. CONCORD PRISON AUDITORIUM

           INMATES watch as DR. SORENSON (33 now), flanked by guards, 
           gives a Powerpoint presentation. Quinn barely listens, reading 
           a book on how to appeal prison sentences. 
                                 SORENSON
                        So they’re allowing clinical trials to 
                        pay for the upkeep. My company, 
                        Hematech, is a network of hematology 
                        labs. But we’re expanding beyond 
                        analyzing bloodwork...

           A video plays of a DNA strand against a silhouette of a rat.  
           One GENE is lit up -- staying in place even as the rat morphs 
           to a dog then a bear then a human -- 

                                 SORENSON (O.S.)
                        Evolution is imperfect. 95% of the DNA 
                        we carry around is never activated. 

           Quinn watches curiously as Hematech employees remove FURRY 
           OBJECTS from CAGES and pass them down the rows of prisoners.

                                 SORENSON
                        We believe we’ve discovered the latent 
                        genes and medication to induce in 
                        humans the kind of deep hibernation 
                        you see in your hands.

           The OBJECT reaches Quinn. It’s a SQUIRREL, tightly curled in a 
           ball. Quinn’s touch doesn’t rouse it from HIBERNATION.

                                 SORENSON
                        Ours will be the first long-term study 
                        of hibernation in human beings. 

           But the Prisoners are getting restless. One yells --

                                 PRISONER 1
                        What’s in it for us?

                                 SORENSON
                        For undergoing forty years of 
                        hibernation, you will have one day of 
                        monitored parole every five years to 
                        visit your loved ones --

           This gets Quinn’s attention. He raises his hand.

                                 SORENSON
                        If we could save our questions --

                                 QUINN
                             (ignoring her)
                        How are they going to let us out? Half 
                        the people here have been convicted of 
                        murder.
                                 SORENSON
                        Violent criminals are released back 
                        into society every day. The average 
                        murderer serves only twenty years. 
                        Terrifying, right? You, on the other 
                        hand, will be released under strict 
                        supervision --

                                 QUINN
                        You mean with a guard?

                                 SORENSON
                             (smiles)
                        Nothing so outdated. 

           She flips to a SLIDE of AN ELECTRONIC ANKLET: with no joints or 
           hinges, it appears completely fused around the model’s ankle. 

                                 SORENSON
                        The GPS Tether system has been used in 
                        over 45 clinical trials in eight 
                        countries without any serious problem. 

                                 PRISONER 2
                             (fake polite)
                        On our day out, is recreational gun 
                        use permitted? It’s a hobby of mine.

           The other inmates laugh.

                                 SORENSON
                        Obviously there will be strict 
                        limitations on your freedom. You’ll 
                        only have six hours of parole, and you 
                        will have to pass exams to prove you 
                        are not psycho- or sociopathic --

                                 PRISONER 2
                             (getting up to leave)
                        Good luck with this crowd.

           More prisoners get up. Follow him out. Sorenson, rattled, flips 
           to the NEXT SLIDE charting the experiment’s dangers.

                                 SORENSON
                        We’re not sure which proteins in the 
                        bloodstream activate the hibernation 
                        gene. That's why we need a range of 
                        applicants. Not everyone will be 
                        accepted, and, to be frank, not 
                        everyone accepted will survive the 
                        treatment.
                                 PRISONER 3
                             (reading the chart)
                        “Survival rate may be as low as 
                        fifteen percent”?

                                 PRISONER 4
                             (shouting)
                        People who take bullets to the head 
                        have a better survival rate! 

           Grumbles grow to a ROAR of disapproval. Sorenson, overwhelmed, 
           shouts over them --

                                 SORENSON
                        Hibernation freezes your metabolism. 
                        After the study, you will basically be 
                        the age you are now. But you'll have 
                        served forty years of your sentence 
                        and be that much closer to freedom!

           But the room has descended into chaos: INMATES shouting, 
           outraged by her offer; GUARDS rushing in to restore order.

           Only Quinn remains seated -- staring at Sorenson --

           INT. PRISON MEETING ROOM

           Quinn paces as his lawyer, BARRY SHEAR (63) sits at a rickety 
           table. Shear looks like a chair that needs reupholstering: 
           wrinkled suit, lumpy body. 

                                 QUINN
                        Tell me you’ve found something on 
                        Moran --

                                 SHEAR
                        Dead end. 

                                 QUINN
                             (furious)
                        You haven’t looked hard enough! He set 
                        me up. And he knows what happened to 
                        Chloe. He could be keeping her 
                        somewhere. You should’ve found 
                        something to get me off by now --

                                 SHEAR
                             (heating up)
                        The only way I could get you off is if 
                        I pleaded guilty. Bullets from your 
                        gun were in Amy’s chest. Four locks on 
                        your door, yet no sign of a break-in. 
                                 SHEAR (CONT'D)
                        And your blood shows you were so drunk 
                        that night, you could have fucked the 
                        President and wouldn’t remember it. 

                                 QUINN
                        That would be a great alibi. We try 
                        that angle?
                             (as Shear rolls his eyes)
                        I wasn’t drunk, I was drugged. I only 
                        had two drinks that night --

                                 SHEAR
                        Sounds like you remember it perfectly.

           Shear stands up. But Quinn won’t let him leave. Snaps --

                                 QUINN
                        I trusted you to find her. To help me. 
                        In two years, you’ve done nothing. I’m 
                        going to find her myself.
                             (off Shear’s look, “Oh 
                              really?”)
                        You heard about the hibernation 
                        research they’re doing? They’re giving 
                        prisoners furlough --

           Shear’s halfway out the door when he stops. Alarmed.

                                 SHEAR
                        How will you help your daughter by 
                        going into a coma for five years? It’s 
                        too dangerous. They’re going to stop 
                        your metabolism -- basically kill you-- 
                        then hope you come back to life.

           Quinn -- what was a scar suddenly feels like an open wound --

                                 QUINN
                        How else am I going to find her?

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           QUINN’S FACE as he hibernates inside a vault in

           HEMATECH’S MASSIVE HIBERNATION LAB

           SUPER TITLE: 2019

           Sorenson (38 now) taps a touchscreen and the vault SLIDES OPEN.

           The lab JOLTS INTO ACTIVITY. Doctors remove Quinn’s hydrogen 
           sulfide IV and place him on a gurney with a BREATHING MASK.
           DR. ERIC KIMURA (32) attaches an INFUSION PUMP to a tube 
           sticking out of Quinn’s abdomen. A straw-colored fluid flows 
           into Quinn’s stomach for immediate absorption.

                                 KIMURA
                        Atropine on board.

           Sorenson watches the monitor closely as QUINN’S HEART RATE 
           INCREASES. A recurring wave that quickly morphs into chaos.  

                                 SORENSON
                        Paddles! And clear!

           She slams defibrillator paddles against Quinn’s chest. His body 
           jolts upwards. She checks his heart rhythm. Still chaos. 

                                 KIMURA 
                        Shit, we’re losing him!  

           Sorenson shocks Quinn again. Kimura gasps as --

           QUINN’S EYES SNAP OPEN. 

           His vision is blurred. As the world takes shape, Sorenson 
           hurries to reassure him -- 

                                 SORENSON
                        You’re going to be OK. You have been 
                        in hibernation for five years. Do you 
                        know what year it is now? 

           He considers. Remembers. Panics. 

                                 QUINN 
                        Chloe --

           INT. HEMATECH LABS 

           QUICKS CUTS as Quinn undergoes a BATTERY OF TESTS: going into 
           an MRI scanner, having his reaction time tested, running on a 
           treadmill with sensors all over his body --

           INT. OFFICE - HEMATECH LABS - LATER

           Quinn’s ushered to where Sorenson and Shear (considerably 
           grayer at 68) wait with --

           Hematech SECURITY CHIEF PATRICK FELTON (43, black, head like a 
           bullet, never jay-walks). Felton eyes Quinn with suspicion.
                                 FELTON
                        Sean Quinn, you are now starting six 
                        hours of limited parole. You may 
                        reclaim your personal effects.

           He slides over a safe box with Quinn’s OLD CLOTHES and KEYS, 
           then attaches a GPS “TETHER” to Quinn’s ankle so the world can 
           see he’s a criminal. 

                                 FELTON
                        This tracker will relay your location 
                        to us at all times. 

           Felton takes a HANDGUN from his holster. Hands it to Quinn.

                                 FELTON
                        Aim this at me and pull the trigger.

           Quinn shoots an uncertain look at Shear, who nods, “Go ahead.” 
           Quinn pulls the trigger, but it LOCKS. 

                                 FELTON
                        Guns are now biomatched -- fingerprint 
                        to trigger. We also have the right to 
                        disable you with the Tether if you 
                        stray more than 10 miles from Boston 
                        or break any parole terms. Like this:

           He pushes a button on his laptop and A SURGE of electricity 
           shoots from the TETHER up Quinn’s leg. He doubles over, drops 
           the gun. Sorenson grimaces. 

                                 FELTON
                        And if we find a weapon on you --

                                 SHEAR
                        That includes knives, boxcutters, 
                        explosives, fertilizers -- 

                                 FELTON
                        -- you’ll be resentenced to life 
                        imprisonment. 

           He hands Quinn a release. As he signs it, Sorenson notices a 
           strange tremor in his fingers. She takes his hand in hers.

                                 SORENSON
                        You’re due for your medicines. 

           Kimura wheels over INSTRUMENTS. Sorenson lifts Quinn’s shirt to 
           refill the DRIP PUMP attached to the tube in his abdomen. 
                                 SORENSON
                        We’ve found hibernation lowers plasma 
                        glucocorticoids. This counteracts that 
                        with a steady drip of hormones. The 
                        D.O.C.’s ordered we only give you six 
                        hours worth. 

                                 QUINN
                        Why?

                                 SORENSON
                        As insurance you come back. You’re 
                        basically on life support and this--
                             (tapping the drip pump)
                        Is your “oxygen tank.” 

           She hands him a cell phone.

                                 SORENSON
                        If you feel sick, you are legally 
                        obligated to call us immediately.

                                 FELTON
                             (tougher)
                        If you come back with anything that 
                        implies you put your body in peril -- 
                        jeopardizing the experiment -- we can 
                        refuse you future release. Got it?

                                 QUINN
                        Preach all you want. I’m spending the 
                        next six hours doing heroin in a 
                        tanning bed.

           Felton’s face: fuck you. But Sorenson sees Quinn’s sly smile. 
           She swallows a laugh, delighted someone stood up to Felton.

           Sorenson pushes a button and Quinn’s time on the DRIP PUMP 
           starts racing down. 06:00:00, 05:59:59...

                                 FELTON
                        Parole starts now.

           EXT. HEMATECH LABS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn pulls on a Hematech parka and gloves as he and Shear exit 
           the hilltop LAB (a squat, unimpressive building). A view of 
           Boston we will see on each release. It’s snow-covered but looks 
           much the same as Quinn remembers.

                                 SHEAR
                        I have to sign that you’ve read these 
                        thoroughly.
           He hands Quinn a booklet: “Regulations for Clinical Prisoners.” 

                                 QUINN
                        I have six hours to find my daughter. 
                        You think I’m going to waste a second 
                        reading this?

           Quinn takes off toward the BUS STOP where a BUS is pulling up. 

                                 SHEAR
                             (furious)
                        Quinn! 

           INT. CITY BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn’s Tether beeps as he boards. The Driver’s computer 
           displays a photo and “SEAN QUINN. IF SEEN AFTER 12/2/19, CALL 9-
           1-1.” The Driver grips the wheel tighter.

           Out the window on the sidewalk: a RED-HAIRED GIRL. Quinn bolts 
           upright. As the bus passes, he sees she’s 17. Too old. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Quinn rushes up the road toward 

           MORAN’S DOG TRACK

           But as he gets close he realizes the windows are smashed. The 
           track’s overgrown with weeds. Reclaimed by nature. Abandoned.

           Quinn’s face -- fuck. He turns around, racing back the way he 
           came. 

           EXT. SUBURBAN SOMERVILLE

           Quinn sprints down the street. On the Drip Pump: 4 hours 56 
           minutes remaining.

           Worried his Tether is drawing attention, he checks for anyone 
           watching him. Passing a garbage can, he reaches inside. 

           Finds a glass bottle. Slams it against the inside of the can. 

           CRACK! The bottle’s neck is intact to use as a handle but 
           there’s a LETHAL JAGGED EDGE where the bottom blew off. He 
           hides the bottle in his jacket pocket and approaches

           A MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSE DUSTED WITH SNOW

           He rings the bell. His body tense. Ready to attack.
                                 WOMAN’S VOICE THROUGH THE DOOR (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 QUINN
                        I need to talk to Raj.

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        You mean Mr. Mehta? We bought the 
                        house from him eight months ago.

           Quinn -- not sure he believes this. 

                                 QUINN
                        You know where I can find him now?

           A beat, then A BUSINESS CARD slides under the door. 

           Quinn looks at it, stunned: Raj’s name and number printed next 
           to a cartoon TAXI CAB. Quinn dials the number.

           INT. ELECTRIC TAXI

           RAJ MEHTA (58 now) drives. His GPS is hacked to play BOLLYWOOD 
           MOVIES. Raj sings along, loudly. His arm dangles out the window 
           with a cigarette, despite all the non-smoking signs in his cab. 

           He pulls up at a corner. The door opens and a hooded figure 
           gets in back --

                                 RAJ
                        You the guy who called?

           Quinn presses the broken bottle against Raj’s neck. Raj rolls 
           his eyes.

                                 RAJ
                        I have four bucks on me, man. I should 
                        be robbing you.

                                 QUINN
                        I don’t want your money.

           Raj checks his rearview mirror. Is stunned to see Quinn.

                                 QUINN
                        Where’s Moran?

                                 RAJ
                             (terrified, babbling)
                        I don’t know -- he fired me. Some 
                        Bulgarian hacker kid took my place.
                                 QUINN
                        But you know what he did with my 
                        daughter.

                                 RAJ
                        No, no! Please don’t kill me --

                                 QUINN
                        I should. You spent years helping him 
                        rob people. Destroying lives --

                                 RAJ
                        Oh right, and you only helped him with 
                        his charity ventures.

                                 QUINN
                        But I hated it. I got out.

                                 RAJ
                        And you never committed an act of 
                        violence again.

           Pause. Quinn glances at the bottle he has against Raj’s throat.

                                 QUINN
                        You’re still working for him, aren’t 
                        you? 

                                 RAJ
                        Then why would I be driving a cab? And 
                        don’t say something racist, not that 
                        I’m in a position to make demands. 

                                 QUINN
                        I’ll give you one chance.

           INT. RAJ’S TAXI CAB - LATER

           Quinn drives. No sign of Raj. The time on Quinn’s Drip Pump 
           races down -- 3 hours 6 minutes left -- as he steers up a 
           PARKING STRUCTURE. He parks on the completely vacant top floor 
           and looks out -- 

           A part of Boston the city gave up on. Quinn focuses on a once-
           stately, now-decrepit building: columns out front, a stone 
           eagle by the stairs. It’s an ABANDONED POST OFFICE.

                                 QUINN
                        Fuckin’ email.

           Quinn steps out of the car and opens the trunk: 

           RAJ is INSIDE. Taped up and gagged. Quinn pulls the gag down.
                                 QUINN
                        Is this a trap?

                                 RAJ
                        Sure, you could put it that way. 
                        Moran’s in there, and he’s definitely 
                        going to kill you. So if you don’t let 
                        me out now, I’m just going to 
                        suffocate in here.
                             (pleading)
                        Please -- we were friends.

                                 QUINN
                        I don’t have friends. 

                                 RAJ
                        How about non-killing associates?

           Quinn slams the trunk shut.

                                                                CUT TO:

           It’s 4pm, but the sun has set. Welcome to winter in Boston. 

           STREET LAMPS have MOTION DETECTORS so each light Quinn passes 
           CLICKS ON. Illuminating his path as he hurries toward --

           EXT. ABANDONED POST OFFICE

           A large sign over the marble edifice “MASS MOVERS & STORAGE.” 

           Quinn scans the entrance. Totally sealed off. He hustles to

           THE BACK OF THE BUILDING. GARAGE DOORS tightly shut. CAMERAS 
           point at oncoming traffic -- if he moves any closer he’ll be 
           seen. 

           A TRUCK ROARS toward the garages. Quinn LEAPS onto the back of 
           it as it passes. He tenses. Did the driver see him?

           Quinn hears the driver talking to someone. The TRUCK lurches 

           INTO THE OLD POSTAL WAREHOUSE

           The Truck’s engine obscures Quinn’s footsteps as he RUNS AWAY, 
           past HUNDREDS of crates. A strange whirring sound coming from a 
           row of 3D PRINTERS printing GUNS. Some appear fully formed. 
           Probably operational.

           Quinn reaches out for one that appears finished...

           But dives back as TWO ENGINEERS APPROACH. Quinn takes off in 
           the other direction. Toward a door that reads “DO NOT ENTER.” 
           He opens it. Sees:
           MORAN’S THREE DOBERMAN PINSCHERS on the landing of a STAIRCASE, 
           a closed door at the top... 

                                 QUINN
                             (mutters)
                        Found you. 

           The DOGS leap to their feet, snarling. Quinn goes rigid as they 
           approach. Sniff his fingers. Then lick them. They remember him. 

           Suddenly the DOOR at the top of the stairs opens. Men’s VOICES.

           Quinn presses into the CORRIDOR off the landing. Whips out the 
           broken bottle, READY TO ATTACK, as the men descend:

           Four GUARDS surround ANDREW MORAN (42 now). Then a flash of 
           white-blond hair: AUSTIN MORAN (24 now), a few steps behind.

           Like a wolf grabbing the nearest sheep, Quinn springs behind 
           Austin. The bottle-edge to his neck.

                                 QUINN
                        DON’T MOVE!

           Moran’s men already have their guns drawn as Quinn covers 
           himself with Austin. Pulls him into the corner by the WINDOW.

                                 QUINN
                        Drop your weapons! Or I slit his 
                        throat. I already have a life 
                        sentence. 

           Moran stares at Quinn, shocked he’s out of prison. Quinn looks 
           back at him -- eyes burning. Moran nods to his guards and they 
           drop their guns. 

                                 MORAN
                        Fuck do you want?

                                 QUINN
                        Did you kill my daughter?

                                 MORAN
                        Why would I?

                                 QUINN
                        Because I wouldn’t work for you. You 
                        said I’d regret it.

                                 MORAN
                        And do you?

           Silence. Moran senses weakness. 
                                 MORAN
                        You even sure Chloe’s your kid? I 
                        can’t be the only guy Amy was fucking--

                                 QUINN
                             (enraged)
                        Where is my daughter?

           Moran sees the insane look in his eyes. Austin’s terror.

                                 MORAN
                        If I tell you, will you let him go?

           MORAN’S OFFICE DOOR opens above them. Quinn glances up.

           And Austin seizes his chance. Slips out of Quinn’s grasp. Quinn 
           tries to stop him -- Austin’s neck SLIT by the bottle-edge -- 
           he screams as hot red BLOOD sprays out.

           Quinn -- realizing he only has a second as MORAN’S MEN reach 
           their guns -- HURLS HIMSELF THROUGH THE WINDOW. His gloved 
           hands protect his face as he BREAKS THROUGH THE GLASS. 

           FALLING 25’ to the ALLEY BELOW. A SNOW PILE cushions his fall.

                                 MORAN
                        Shoot him!

           Moran’s men OPEN FIRE through the window.

           Quinn -- bullets whizzing all around -- blasts into

           THE BLIGHTED NEIGHBORHOOD. He twists down different streets, 
           but the STREET LAMPS go off as he runs. Leaving a trail. 

           A ROAR. He turns back -- 

           A BLACK JEEP CAREENS TOWARD HIM. Moran’s THUGS inside. 

           Quinn knows he’s too exposed. Scrambles up the wall running 
           along the road. On the other side:

           THE MYSTIC RIVER 15 feet below. COVERED IN A SHEET OF ICE. 
           Swirled black and white like solid marble.

           But he’s in the headlights now. No other option. He hurls 
           himself toward THE FROZEN WATER.

           CRACK! From the sound it’s unclear whether the ice broke or he 
           did. UNDERWATER -- the cold sears through him like electricity.

           Moran’s Thugs leap onto the wall. They FIRE as Quinn swims 
           toward the far side of the river. Bullets ricochet off the 
           ceiling of ice above him.
           But Quinn’s going to suffocate. He punches at the ice over his 
           head. Can’t get through. Punches again and again until --

           A TINY BREAK IN THE ICE. He puts his mouth against it and 
           desperately sucks down air. 

           The Thugs see Quinn’s ghostly shadow beneath the surface.

                                 THUG #1
                        There!

           They fire. Bullets streaking through the hole into the water 
           like comets, tails of bubbles behind them. 

           Quinn tries to swim away, but there are so many bullets that 
           the ICE ABOVE HIM CRUMBLES. Suddenly his head bobs above water.

           He gasps a breath and RE-SUBMERGES. Swims on. Too far from the 
           glow of the streetlamps, he’s out of the Thugs’ visibility.

           EXT. RAJ’S TAXI IN THE PARKING STRUCTURE - LATER

           Quinn, his wet clothes frozen to his body, opens the trunk. 
           Raj, curled in a ball for warmth, looks at Quinn, terrified --

                                 QUINN
                        Tell me your taxi has a clothes dryer.

           INT. RAJ’S TENEMENT BUILDING

           Black mold scales the walls. A “BROKEN” sign on the elevator. 
           Quinn, shivering, follows Raj up the stairs to the 20th floor.

                                 QUINN
                        Moran was behind it. I’m not going 
                        back to the lab til I find proof. I 
                        can’t make Chloe wait five more years.

                                 RAJ
                        The only way to get rid of your Tether 
                        is to cut off the leg.

           It hangs between them. Raj, unlocking his door, realizes Quinn 
           is still holding the BROKEN BOTTLE to his back. 

                                 RAJ
                        Put it away. My kids will be there.
                             (Quinn shakes his head)
                        I told you where Moran was --

           But Quinn doesn’t trust him. He pushes Raj into --
           INT. RAJ’S THREADBARE STUDIO

                                 RAJ’S KIDS
                        Daddy!

           RAJ’S SON (5) and DAUGHTER (3) rush up. Seeing them, Quinn’s 
           face softens. He hides the bottle. As the kids hug Raj, Quinn 
           takes in the DINGY APARTMENT. Raj, seeing Quinn’s look:

                                 RAJ
                        Believe it or not, taxi drivers don’t 
                        live the movie star lives they used 
                        to. 

           His wife, DESHANI (37), comes out from the kitchen area. Balks 
           at the sight of Quinn and the Tether, but Raj mouths “It’s OK.” 

                                 RAJ
                             (brightly)
                        Time for their bath.

           The kids shout “NO!” as Deshani, still anxious, shouts “Yes!” 
           and pulls them into the bathroom. Raj closes the door. 

           Quinn looks at HIS DRIP PUMP. Remaining time: 00:47:35, 
           00:47:34... Starts to panic. 

                                 QUINN
                        The lab said hibernation makes me 
                        deficient in stuff. This pump feeds me 
                        meds, so I have to go back. But if I 
                        found out what drugs I need...
                             (with difficulty)
                        We could cut off the Tether. I could 
                        escape. 

           Raj’s amazed Quinn will take it so far. 

                                 RAJ
                        Doctors won’t treat clinical 
                        prisoners...it’s a felony.

           Raj takes out a pair of BAGGY PANTS and tosses them at Quinn.

                                 RAJ (CONT’D)
                        I know someone. We get her to test 
                        what meds you need. Then you and I 
                        can...deal with your leg.
           EXT. VACANT LOT OVERGROWN WITH WEEDS

           Quinn wears the baggy pants over his own to hide his Tether. 
           Raj guides him toward a YOUNG WOMAN in high-heeled boots, 
           locking up a TRAILER that reads “CLINIC ON WHEELS.” 

                                 RAJ
                        You get all dressed up for me?

           LARA ROSS (20) turns. A blue streak in her cropped black hair. 
           A T-shirt for a Mexican punk band under her coat. Mischievous 
           eyes.

                                 LARA
                        Sorry Raj, I’m late for a date.

                                 RAJ
                        But doc, you need to treat my friend 
                        here. Some bastard tried to rob me, 
                        but he showed up and saved my life!

           Lara looks at Quinn with interest, inspecting the scratches.

                                 LARA
                        Come back if they get infected. We 
                        closed an hour ago.

           Raj shoots Quinn a desperate look as Lara brushes past them --

                                 LARA
                        My boyfriend’s waiting for me.

                                 QUINN
                        Don’t you think you’re worth waiting 
                        for? 

           Lara looks at him, surprised. Quinn smiles. 

           INT. CLINIC ON WHEELS - MOMENTS LATER

           As Lara applies ointment and bandages to Quinn’s scratches:

                                 QUINN
                        Hey, a doctor told me a while ago I 
                        might be deficient in some stuff. 
                        Hormones, I think. Can you figure out 
                        what I need prescribed?

                                 LARA
                        I’m not supposed to do lab tests. I’m 
                        just a volunteer. 
                                 RAJ
                        Whatever Quinn needs, I’ll pay for. 

                                 LARA
                        How’s that when you can’t afford your 
                        insulin?

                                 RAJ
                        Richard Branson left his wallet in my 
                        taxi. 

           Quinn watches as Lara clumsily opens a syringe. 

                                 QUINN
                        You know what you’re doing, right?

                                 LARA
                        Yes, so this is a suppository. 
                             (off his look)
                        Kidding. I’ve seen them do it a 
                        million times. They ask some dumb 
                        distracting question and plunge it 
                        in... So: if you could live anywhere 
                        in the world, where would it be?

                                 QUINN
                        Here. At my house on Park.

           She stabs the needle into his arm, gives Raj a look, “What kind 
           of shit answer was that?”

                                 QUINN
                        Oh, so you’re slumming it down here?

                                 LARA
                        Not for long.

           She pulls the needle out. As they talk, she drops the syringe 
           into a chute that feeds his sample through a BLOOD ANALYZER.

                                 LARA
                        I’m going to Ghana. Over there, you 
                        work in the hospital a couple years 
                        and they hand you a nursing degree.

                                 QUINN
                        Sounds like your boyfriend better get 
                        used to waiting.

                                 LARA
                        Who says I want him to?
                                 RAJ
                        Who says her boyfriend isn’t the 
                        prince of Ghana?

           Lara skims over her paperwork.  

                                 LARA
                        Sorry, what’s your full name? And you 
                        can take off the bandages.

                                 QUINN
                        Sean Abbot.

                                 LARA
                        He said your name was Quinn.

                                 QUINN
                        You noticed.

           She’s embarrassed. Tries to hide it.

                                 QUINN
                        Quinn was my maiden name. It’s Abbot.

           He peels the bandages off. His skin is MOSTLY HEALED. Amazed, 
           he looks at the box: INSTA-BANDAIDS. Now in Less than 3 Mins.

           Lara applies more bandages to the scratches still visible.

                                 LARA
                        Take these off in a few minutes.

           The BLOOD ANALYZER spews out results. Lara reads them. Behind 
           her, Raj and Quinn share an excited look. 

           She looks at Quinn -- stunned.

                                 QUINN
                        I’ve had some health problems. What do 
                        I need to make myself normal?

           Lara skims the results again. Wide-eyed. 

                                 LARA
                        You have to talk to a real doctor.

           Quinn -- the color draining from his face as he realizes -- 

           INT. RAJ’S TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn panicking as Raj’s cab tears away from the Clinic.
                                 QUINN
                        We can still cut off the Tether --

                                 RAJ
                        You think you can outrun the police 
                        sick and on one leg?

           Quinn, beyond furious, looks at his DRIP PUMP. 1 minute left. 

                                 QUINN
                        If new evidence emerges, they’d have 
                        to wake me up. If you find something 
                        that leads to my daughter or proves 
                        Moran was involved -- 

                                 RAJ
                        Investigate Moran? Are you fucking 
                        crazy? Like I’m going to jeopardize my 
                        kids to find yours. 

                                 QUINN
                        You know I was set up. By someone who 
                        knew I drank. Someone who knew I had a 
                        prior. Someone who knew about me and 
                        Amy fighting over Chloe. Moran knew 
                        all of it. 

                                 RAJ
                        But why would he take Chloe? And if he 
                        killed her, why hide the body? I know 
                        you’re hoping she’ll prove you 
                        innocent -- 

                                 QUINN
                        I’m not trying to find her just to 
                        help my case!

           His anguish is palpable. Raj looks away.

                                 QUINN
                        I need to know she’s OK. If you find 
                        something, I’ll give you my house.

                                 RAJ
                        You still own it?

                                 QUINN
                             (nods)
                        It was boarded up after I was 
                        arrested. Please, I saw how you were 
                        living --

           BEEP BEEP. BEEP BEEP. The LOUD ALARM on the DRIP PUMP goes off. 
           He sees he has ZERO MEDS LEFT.
                                 RAJ
                        Swear I’ll get the house?

                                 QUINN
                        Only if you find something and take it 
                        to the police.

                                 RAJ
                        I told you, you can trust me. I’ll 
                        have you out of there within a month.

           Quinn -- has to believe him. Gets out of the car. 

                                 RAJ
                        Take those bandages off so they don’t 
                        suspect you got medical help.

           He guns the car round the corner as Quinn removes the bandages. 
           There’s something written on one: Lara’s phone number.

           Quinn looks at it a moment. Another life. It’s flattering, but--

           HEADLIGHTS in his eyes. A HEMATECH VAN barrels down the street.

           Quinn tosses Lara’s number aside. Instinctively, like a 
           cornered animal, he TAKES OFF RUNNING.

           INSIDE THE SECURITY VAN

           SECURITY CHIEF FELTON sees Quinn sprinting away. PUSHES A 
           BUTTON on his laptop sending --

           A JOLT of electricity from the Tether into Quinn. Quinn falls 
           to the ground.

           INT. HEMATECH HIBERNATION LABS

           Quinn lies on a gurney as Sorenson, Kimura, and the other 
           doctors prepare him for hibernation.

                                 SORENSON
                        What happened here?

           Lara didn’t treat a bruise on his knee. Quinn tenses.

                                 QUINN
                        Bumped into a chair. Lap dancing 
                        class.

           Sorenson looks at him a moment, measuring him. Then she nods to 
           Dr. Kimura, who hits a touchscreen and --
           The gurney lifts Quinn UP INTO THE HIBERNATION CHAMBER. IVs 
           feed him hydrogen sulfide. 

           His eyes shut. Hold on his slack expression and --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A blurred diaphanous image -- like the world was painted with 
           too broad a brush --

                                 SORENSON
                        One moment, Sean. Dr. Kimura has your 
                        contacts.

           This is QUINN’S POV: fingers open his eyes wider. Pop in 
           contact lenses -- the world snapping into focus and Quinn sees 

           SORENSON, KIMURA, and technicians above him, applying sensors, 
           taking readings. Quinn’s groggy.

                                 QUINN
                        How long? How long has it been?

           Kimura and Sorenson exchange a look. Quinn notices Kimura’s put 
           on 30 pounds. The responsibility of running a massive lab has 
           started to line Sorenson’s brow. 

           Horror on Quinn’s face as he realizes: It hasn’t been weeks... 

           SUPER TITLE: 2024 - DAY 2.

           INT. HEMATECH LAB - LATER

           Quinn runs in an iCube -- a fully-immersive virtual reality box 
           with an omnidirectional treadmill for flooring. He reacts to 
           the virtual outdoors projected around him -- sprinting through 
           forests, leaping over streams.

           Kimura and Lab Techs monitor his reactions:

                                 LAB TECH
                        15% slower than in ‘19. He’s 
                        deteriorating. 

           Kimura, worried, punches a button. Suddenly in Quinn’s virtual 
           outdoor world, a window opens in the sky and he can see Kimura.

                                 KIMURA
                        Do you feel tired, Sean? 

                                 QUINN
                             (intense)
                        I need to make a phone call. About my 
                        daughter --
                                 KIMURA
                        Unfortunately the D.O.C. dictates when 
                        you may contact friends and relatives, 
                        and it’s only during furlough.

           Quinn, furious at his own captivity, paces around the iCube.

                                 QUINN
                        Then get this over with.

           Kimura starts the iCube again. 

           INT. HIBERNATION LAB - LATER 

           Shear (73 now, sickly, his voice little more than a wheeze) 
           oversees Sorenson and Felton (48) prepping Quinn for release.

                                 SHEAR
                        Good news. You no longer have to wear 
                        a Tether. 

           Quinn -- stunned -- smiles.

                                 SORENSON
                        After a prisoner in the Ebola study 
                        attempted to escape by cutting off his 
                        foot, the D.O.C. required we embed the 
                        tracking chip directly into your body. 

                                 QUINN
                             (horrified)
                        What?

           Shear holds out a tablet with the latest D.O.C. directive. 
           Quinn’s too preoccupied to read it -- searching his arms, legs--

                                 QUINN
                        Where’s the chip?

                                 CHIEF FELTON
                        Obviously the whole purpose is to 
                        prevent you from knowing and removing 
                        it.

           Quinn looks at Felton, realizing no matter how much time goes 
           by, he’s always going to want to punch this asshole in the 
           face.

           As Sorenson steps forward to attach the DRIP PUMP, Quinn sees: 
           A THIRD OF THE HIBERNATION CHAMBERS are empty.

                                 QUINN
                        What happened to the others?
           Sorenson avoids his gaze. 

                                 SORENSON
                        You’re doing extremely well. You have 
                        nothing to worry about.

           For the first time, a hint of fear in Quinn’s eyes. 

           EXT. HEMATECH LABS

           Quinn hurries out, struggling to use a 2024 CELL PHONE: a 
           DEVICE around his neck projects a number pad onto his hand. He 
           pushes the buttons, the device recognizing his movements. 

           As the phone rings, he has the SAME VIEW of Boston, this time 
           in summer. A new skyscraper capped with CHINESE LETTERS soars 
           400 feet above the others. Behind him, Hematech has expanded 
           with two wings. 

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        The number you have called is no 
                        longer in service.

           Quinn’s face -- frustration turning to worry.

           INT. BUS - LATER

           Quinn, on the phone with 4-1-1, struggling to hear because the 
           ADVERTISEMENT on his SEAT’S MONITOR is so loud:

                                 QUINN
                             (to 4-1-1)
                        Boston area...

                                 ADVERTISEMENT ON MONITOR
                        Press the screen if you would like to 
                        purchase a napping pill. Ten Minutes. 
                        No side effects.

           Quinn moves toward the bus’s doors to get away from the noise.

                                 QUINN
                             (into the phone)
                        This is a message for Raj...I don’t 
                        know if this is even the right one, 
                        but it’s Quinn. I don’t know where the 
                        fuck you are or why you couldn’t get 
                        me out, but I’m coming to your 
                        apartment. Meet me there.

           Quinn angrily hangs up. He’s momentarily distracted a nearby 
           BOY, who seems to be LAUGHING at nothing. 
           Mystified, Quinn leans forward: the BOY wears wireless earbuds 
           and CONTACTS THAT PLAY VIDEO. A cartoon embedded in the lenses. 

           The bus slows for a FLOOD OF FOOT TRAFFIC. Quinn looks out at

           EXT. FENWAY PARK 

           20-STORY-TALL HOLOGRAMS of BALL PLAYERS soar above Fenway with 
           bombastic sound effects. The PLAYERS are mostly CHINESE. 

           Quinn gapes, with the same expression of awe as the THREE-YEAR-
           OLD has standing next to him. No one else is interested. 
           They’ve seen it all before. 

           The bus stops, the DOORS next to Quinn open and suddenly --

           ANOTHER MAN inside the bus bears down on Quinn, knocking him 
           out into the crowd of fans, scalpers, and souvenir hawkers.

           Quinn shoves the man off him. Realizes: IT’S RAJ.

                                 RAJ
                        Moran found out -- found out I was 
                        looking into him, all his guys --

           He’s ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE. Dirty, his face creased with deep 
           wrinkles like it was poorly ironed. He pulls Quinn along. 

                                 RAJ
                        I’ve lost everything. Haven’t been 
                        able to go home, to work. You have to 
                        sell your house. Send them the money--

                                 QUINN
                             (can barely follow)
                        Them?

                                 RAJ
                        My wife, kids -- I sent them back to 
                        Mumbai. You brought me into this, and 
                        now what happened to you is going to 
                        happen to me!

                                 QUINN
                        But did you find anything?

                                 RAJ
                        I think they had your daughter.

           Quinn’s shocked. Heart pounding. He waited years for any news:

                                 QUINN
                        Had her? Or have her?
           A VENDOR, rushing through the crowd, SLAMS into Raj, spilling a 
           TRAY of SUPERSIZED DRINKS all over him. Raj’s SOAKED. 

           Quinn sees the Vendor’s eyes are DIFFERENT COLORS -- one green, 
           one brown -- as THE VENDOR mutters something and pushes through 
           the crowd. 

           Raj seems more frightened than angry. Quinn grabs him --

                                 QUINN
                        What did he do with her? Is she alive? 

                                 RAJ
                             (eyes widening)
                        You smell that?

           BANG! CRACK! 

           Raj CRIES OUT. Terrified. Everyone turns. Quinn takes a few 
           steps forward to get a view of where --

           Someone’s thrown FIRECRACKERS IN A NEARBY TRASH CAN. Sparks 
           dance above the bin. 

           Quinn turns back to see --

           A man brushes by Raj and flicks on a lighter --

           The liquid spilled all over Raj IGNITES. PFOOSH! 

           Raj -- a sun of WHITE FLAMES AND INCREDIBLE HEAT. A futuristic 
           chemical fuels the flame. Eats his body in seconds.

           PEOPLE SCREAM.

           Quinn, horrified, rips off his jacket, rushes to Raj, and tries 
           to BEAT OUT THE FLAMES. But Quinn’s jacket ignites as well --

           MAKING EVERYONE PANIC. NOW PEOPLE ARE RUNNING. SECURITY GUARDS 
           push Quinn back, knocking him to the GROUND.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Get back! Back everyone!

           Quinn struggles to pick himself up, but A STAMPEDE bears down 
           on him. TENS becoming HUNDREDS becoming THOUSANDS IN SECONDS. 

           Below the mob’s field of vision, Quinn sees a SCREAMING CHILD -- 
           separated from her parents, barely avoiding getting trampled.

           He forces himself up. Waves of people throw him around like a 
           rough tide as he shoves his way through. PICKS UP the GIRL.

           RUNS WITH THE REST OF THE CROWD. The KID KEEPS SCREAMING.
           A hand on his arm. He turns -- fearful it’s the police.

           But it’s the girl’s mother who snatches the child and runs. 

           Quinn looks back -- an AMBULANCE AND MEDICS swarm around the 
           ashy remains of Raj’s body. 

           Quinn stumbles forward: numb, beaten, more isolated than ever.

           EXT. RAJ’S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

           Quinn sprints toward Raj’s building. Sidewalks are now BRIGHT 
           SCREENS, playing ads continuously with his step. Passing cars 
           are AUTOMATED. Drivers watch TV. 

           Quinn rummages through a recycling bin outside Raj’s building. 
           Fishes out plastic bags to cover his hands and shoes.

           INT. RAJ’S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn gets off the elevator and hurries up to Apartment 21A. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Resident or visitor?

           Confused, Quinn realizes the question comes from a SECURITY 
           SYSTEM by the door.

                                 QUINN
                        Resident.

           A few beeps are heard inside. Silence. 

                                 QUINN
                        OK, you got me. Intruder.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        I didn’t understand. Please --

           Quinn RUSHES FORWARD AND KICKS DOWN THE DOOR. 
           INT. RAJ’S DARK APARTMENT

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        ATTENTION. The police have been 
                        notified. ATTENTION. The police...

           Quinn opens the blinds. DUST FLIES. Clearly Raj left months ago 
           and in a hurry: drawers half emptied, pots in the sink.

                                 QUINN
                        C’mon Raj, what did you find?

           The ALARM continues as Quinn searches Raj’s desk. His eyes 
           light on a photo: Raj beams with his wife and kids. Quinn 
           forces himself to look away. 

           His nerves beginning to surface, he rips open drawers. In the 
           bedside table, he finds a file marked “Quinn.” 

           Quinn’s face -- Thank God. He rips it open. It’s EMPTY.

           A DOUBLE CHIRP FROM OUTSIDE. Quinn peers out the window:

           20 STORIES BELOW two sleek POLICE VEHICLES pull up. Four COPS, 
           in armor and helmets, hurry into the building.

           Quinn looks around, frantic for a way out. Sees there’s a COP 
           keeping guard by the bottom of the FIRE ESCAPE. 

                                                              INTERCUT:

           INT. STAIRWELL -- RAJ’S BUILDING

           The COPS draw 90-DEGREE GUNS, letting them see and fire around 
           corners. They check the ELEVATOR. Pull its emergency stop. 

                                 COP 1
                        Clear.

           They advance up the staircase, sweeping each floor.

           BACK IN RAJ’S APARTMENT --

           Quinn desperately tries to find a way out. His eyes linger on a 
           DISPLAY CASE. Inside:

           An AGED PHOTO of Raj’s grandfather in WWII uniform and next to 
           it -- his WWII ENFIELD .38 REVOLVER: long-nosed, wood-handled. 

           Quinn hurls the case to the floor. GLASS SHATTERS. He grabs the 
           REVOLVER. Sees six deteriorating bullets in the chamber.

           He races out the front door onto --
           THE LANDING

           He hears the DETECTIVES CLIMBING THE STAIRS. Scans the landing. 
           NOWHERE TO HIDE. Just a door to another apartment and --

           Three metal HATCHES built in the wall. The smallest says 
           “Trash,” the second “Compost,” the largest “RECYCLING.” 

           He opens the Recycling hatch. TWENTY STORIES BELOW him down a 
           NARROW TUNNEL: DAYLIGHT and a DUMPSTER full of GLASS BOTTLES.

           He jumps in, feet first. ENTERS A FREEFALL DOWN THE CHUTE.

           He thrusts out his hands and feet, like a kid on a slide trying 
           to slow himself down --

           The SHARP GLASS BELOW coming at him -- closer and closer. 

           Finally -- throwing his limbs out with all his strength -- he 
           BREAKS HIS FALL. Suspended in the tube. The GLASS just twenty 
           feet below.

           BACK AT RAJ’S APARTMENT

           Finding the door kicked down, the Cops move in. See the place 
           is empty.

           BACK IN THE RECYCLING CHUTE:

           Quinn’s arms and legs are thrust against the tunnel walls. By 
           relaxing his limbs for a split second, he can control his fall, 
           sliding down a foot at a time. It’s EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFUL. 

           BACK AT RAJ’S APARTMENT

                                 DETECTIVE 1
                        Heat detail?

           Detective 2’s infrared visor displays an ULTRA-SENSITIVE 
           TEMPERATURE READING, showing where even trace amounts of heat 
           were absorbed by the floor. 

           Faint BLUE SHOE PRINTS appear where Quinn stepped.

                                 DETECTIVE 2
                        Detail shows intruder was here less 
                        than 90 seconds ago.

           He follows the faint prints back TO THE LANDING. Sees where 
           Quinn stood for a moment by THE CHUTE.
           The Detective opens the hatch -- AIMS HIS GUN down the tunnel -- 

           But the CHUTE’S EMPTY. Just the RECYCLING BIN at the bottom.

           IN AN ALLEY NEARBY

           Quinn, moving fast, turns the corner and finds himself in the 
           midst of a HUGE RALLY, LCD PROTEST SIGNS reading: “Vote Yes on 
           Mystic Reservoir” and “Create Jobs: Yes on Mystic Dam!” 

           Quinn quickly disappears into the crowd. 

           INT. CLINIC ON WHEELS - MINUTES LATER

           Quinn bursts in. See a RECEPTIONIST (mid-40s).

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Can I help you?

           POLICE SIRENS. GROWING LOUDER. Quinn tenses. 

                                 QUINN
                        I’m looking for Lara. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You mean Dr. Ross? She left ages ago.

           But he’s listening to the SIRENS. They PASS, then grow quiet. 

                                 QUINN
                        You have any idea how I can reach her 
                        there?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        There?

                                 QUINN
                        Africa.

           The Receptionist looks at him from under raised brows. 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        I don’t know about Africa. But if you 
                        wait, her next shift starts in an 
                        hour.

           Quinn -- a wave of relief. She’s here.

                                 QUINN
                        There any way to reach her sooner?
           The Receptionist shakes her head as her phone rings. She sticks 
           an adhesive wireless mic to her cheek and answers.

           Quinn looks at his watch -- 03:26:12...03:26:11...

           He anxiously takes a seat in the waiting area. TABLETS are 
           piled on the coffee table, as thin and flexible as magazines. 

           He sifts through them, each one lighting up and talking as it 
           senses the heat of his hands. There’s a Teen Vogue, a National 
           Geographic; his hands linger on the CNN one as --

                                 REPORTER (ON TABLET)
                        And in local news, an Indian man set 
                        himself on fire today in a suspected 
                        act of terrorism...

           The video shows the Police Commissioner addressing the press:

                                 POLICE COMMISSIONER (ON TABLET)
                        Jihadi literature has been found in 
                        the boarding house Raj Mehta had been 
                        living in for the past two months --

           Quinn takes out his Hematech cell phone. Dials.

                                 SHEAR (ON PHONE)
                        Office of Barry Shear. 

                                 QUINN
                        I need you to sell my house. And find 
                        a Deshani Mehta in Mumbai who used to 
                        live in Boston...

           INT. CLINIC ON WHEELS - MUCH LATER

           Quinn now looks more ill than anxious, the color drained from 
           his face. His watch: 02:29:36...02:29:35...

           Lara walks in. It takes him a moment to recognize her -- her 
           hair now honey-blond and shoulder-length. She’s five years 
           older, just as beautiful. 

           Thinking he’ll have to flirt like last time to get anywhere, 
           his demeanor immediately changes -- charming, a smile.

                                 QUINN
                        We need to talk.
                             (as she clearly doesn’t 
                              recognize him)
                        My name is Sean Quinn and I was here 
                        five years --
           A glimmer in Lara’s eyes.

                                 LARA
                        I thought it was Sean Abbot.

           She gives him a meaningful look and waves for him to follow as 
           she leads him down a HALLWAY.

                                 QUINN
                        And I thought you’d be in Africa. 

                                 LARA
                             (blankly)
                        Africa?

           He looks at her. For him, it was just yesterday --

                                 QUINN
                        When I met you, you said you were 
                        going to Ghana. 

                                 LARA
                             (laughs)
                        Sounds like one of my phases. I’ve 
                        been through a few. 

                                 QUINN
                        I guess when you’re 20 you think 
                        you’ll have time to do everything. 

                                 LARA
                        And by my age you realize you only get 
                        to do a few things. I chose a family.

           She’s taken off her coat now and he sees she’s SIX MONTHS 
           PREGNANT. He notices the RING on her finger.

                                 QUINN
                        Boy or girl? Do you get to choose now? 
                        Back in my day, it was blind luck. 

                                 LARA
                        Boy. We flipped a coin.

                                 QUINN
                        Excited?

                                 LARA
                        Anxious. 

                                 QUINN
                        Don’t be. My daughter’s the only good 
                        decision I ever made. 
                                 QUINN (CONT'D)
                        You get to watch Sesame Street, eat 
                        the good cereal again --

           She leads him into a 

           PRIVATE EXAM ROOM 

           She closes the door behind him. Quinn’s voice is quiet, urgent--

                                 QUINN
                        Have you seen Raj? Did he say anything 
                        about me?

                                 LARA
                        He said he was helping you. That he 
                        thought you were innocent. 

           For the first time since Raj’s death, hope lights Quinn’s eyes.

                                 QUINN
                        He found proof? Did he find my 
                        daughter?

                                 LARA
                        I don’t know -- 

                                 QUINN
                        Did he give you anything?
                             (as Lara shakes her head)
                        Raj would never have left anything in 
                        the apartment -- it would have been 
                        too easy to find -- but you -- you’re 
                        the only other person we both talked 
                        to that day. You’re the link --

           A KNOCK on the door. Lara shuts her mouth as an UPBEAT NURSE 
           (mid-fifties) enters with a file --

                                 NURSE
                        Mr. Abbot’s chart.

                                 LARA
                        That’s okay, I’m not treating...

           But then she sees: QUINN’S FILE obviously has something in it. 
           Quinn sees it too, tenses -- 

                                 LARA 
                             (flustered)
                        Or...just leave it.

           She waits for the nurse to leave, then opens the chart: A 
           CONTACT LENS CASE and HEARING AID. She reads the prescription: 
                                 LARA 
                        Ordered by...Dr. Lara Ross, May 8 

           It sends a chill through her. Her face darkening.

                                 QUINN
                        That must be from Raj.

                                 LARA
                        Writing orders in my name is against 
                        the law. Leave me out of whatever you 
                        and Raj --

                                 QUINN
                             (cutting her off)
                        Raj is dead. 

           Lara’s stopped in her tracks. She gapes at him.

                                 QUINN 
                        He was murdered this morning. The 
                        police are saying it was a suicide.

           She covers her mouth -- her anger melted away. Seeing her 
           fighting back tears pulls his emotions to the surface. 

           He puts a comforting hand on her shoulder. She puts a hand on 
           top of his. Then he sees: the file is just sitting on the desk. 

           He GRABS it.

                                 LARA
                             (too loud)
                        Sean! No -- 

           She looks anxiously at the door, worried someone heard.

                                 QUINN
                        Raj told you I’m looking for my 
                        daughter. With every five years that 
                        goes by -- my chances of finding her 
                        become less and less. If you let me 
                        have this, maybe I can find her today. 

           Lara gets hold of part of the file. Quinn’s not letting go --

                                 LARA
                        Take it, I’ll call the police.
                                 QUINN
                        You’ll have to tell them how we met. 
                        You committed a felony treating a 
                        prisoner. Think they’ll let you keep 
                        your medical license? 

           She finally lets go. He tucks the chart in his jacket and 
           strides out, leaving her standing there -- utterly conflicted. 

           EXT. CLINIC ON WHEELS - MOMENT LATER

           Quinn steps shakily into the vacant lot next door, now A PARK 
           UNDER CONSTRUCTION. The workers have left for the day. 

           He sweats profusely. GRAVELY ILL. With trembling hands, he puts 
           in the hearing aid. They BUZZ until he pokes in the contacts:

           POV QUINN: a flood of VIDEO superimposes over the vacant lot 
           like a HOLOGRAM, showing Raj filming himself in a mirror.

                                 RAJ (ON THE CINETACTS)
                        If you’re watching this, I can only 
                        assume it got too dangerous for me to 
                        stay in the U.S. 

           It tears at Quinn to see Raj alive when he last saw him as a 
           pile of smoldering ashes.

                                 QUINN
                        Raj --

           The footage cuts. Clearly filmed on a HIDDEN CAMERA: a HISPANIC 
           WOMAN, early 30s, slumped at a table. Her good looks walked out 
           on her. She seems drunk or drugged or both.

                                 RAJ (NARRATING)
                        Remember Laticia? She dated Austin 
                        same time you were arrested. I could 
                        only record her without her knowing. 
                        I’m sorry I couldn’t get anything you 
                        could take to the police. I’m sorry -- 

           There’s something foreboding about the desperation of Raj’s 
           apology. The audio changes and Quinn can hear Raj, from 
           somewhere behind his hidden camera, talking to Laticia:

                                 LATICIA
                        -- but one night I caught Austin. He 
                        said he was meeting with his brother, 
                        but...I followed him. He went to 
                        Amy’s. The place she was living after 
                        she and Quinn split up.
                                 RAJ
                        But why’d he lie to you? 

           Laticia shrugs. Still angry.

                                 LATICIA
                        He said he was just giving her money. 
                        To help her get custody of the little 
                        girl. After Amy died, I started to 
                        worry that he had something to do with 
                        it --

                                 RAJ
                        Why? What happened?

           Laticia hesitates. Tears in her eyes.

                                 LATICIA
                        You have to swear you won’t tell 
                        anyone...

           Raj must have nodded from somewhere behind his hidden camera.

                                 LATICIA 
                        If Moran had a little girl, he’d try 
                        to make money off it.

                                 RAJ
                        How?

                                 LATICIA
                        Austin was selling girls for him...If 
                        that girl died that night with her 
                        mother, it’s probably better than what 
                        would have happened to her if Austin 
                        got her alive --

           The footage on the CINETACTS cuts out.

           Leaving Quinn staring at the vacant lot. Quinn -- like he’s 
           swallowed a gallon of acid -- the pain burning through him.

                                 QUINN
                        Austin -- I’ll fucking kill you --

           He takes a few steps forward, charging at the world --

           But his body mutinies. He dry heaves. His head drenched with 
           sweat. His vision blurs. He’s going to have to get help.

           His fingers move to the ENFIELD REVOLVER -- what to do with it? 
           He stumbles through the construction site, passing equipment, 
           mounds of earth. Sees: a row of shallow HOLES. A few tiny 
           saplings already planted, the rest waiting nearby.

           Quinn grabs an unplanted sapling and drops it in the first 
           empty hole, the fourth in the row. Fills dirt around the roots. 

           He drops the bag with the REVOLVER into the hole, near the 
           surface. He forces himself to compact dirt on top of everything 
           then staggers back toward 

           EXT. CLINIC ON WHEELS

           Through the open door, the RECEPTIONIST sees Quinn trying to 
           pull himself up the steps.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Doctor Ross! 

           Quinn loses his grip. Falls to the ground. Passersby stare. 

           Lara rushes out. He tries to talk but is unintelligible. She 
           sees written on the breast of his jacket “IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, 
           CALL” with a phone number. Pulls out her phone. 

           Quinn’s eyes freeze in place. OPEN. A corpse.

                                 LARA
                        Sean? Sean!

           Quinn on the ground, looking straight up at the sky. Lara 
           screaming into the phone --

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                 LARA (O.S.)
                        Do you remember your name?

           Quinn opens his eyes. As Lara puts in his contact lenses, her 
           concerned face comes into focus above him.

                                 QUINN
                        Lara?

                                 LARA
                        What are the odds? That’s my name too.

           Dr. Kimura (even paunchier at 42) steps away the gurney.

                                 DR. KIMURA
                        I’ll get Sorenson.

           Quinn tries to process his surroundings. He’s
           BACK IN THE HEMATECH LABS

                                 QUINN
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LARA
                             (smiles)
                        I met Dr. Sorenson when I brought you 
                        in. She told me about the work they’re 
                        doing. Then when the clinic shut down--

           Quinn’s examining Lara’s face: her hair’s short again, the 
           faintest smile lines framing her mouth. He realizes --

           SUPER TITLE: 2029 - Day 3

                                 QUINN
                             (cutting her off, furious)
                        It’s been five years? What about the 
                        two hours I had left last --

                                 SORENSON
                        You spent them in the ICU. 

           Sorenson approaches, Kimura and two assistants trailing behind. 

                                 SORENSON (CONT’D)
                        Other patients have suffered from the 
                        same heart-rhythm disorders during 
                        their furloughs --

           She motions to the hibernation vaults: only six patients still 
           hibernating. The other vaults are EMPTY. Quinn realizes he’s 
           one of the few subjects still alive. He blinks back his fear. 

                                 SORENSON
                        -- So we’ve gained permission from the 
                        D.O.C. to have a doctor and guard 
                        accompany all patients on furlough.
                             (Quinn’s already shaking 
                              his head)
                        You’re now more valuable to us. If 
                        your heart stops again, Dr. Kimura 
                        will be there to help you --

                                 QUINN
                        Where’s my lawyer?

           BARRY SHEAR steps forward. He looks THIRTY YEARS YOUNGER. 

                                 SHEAR, JR. 
                        Barry, Jr. I took on Dad’s pro bono 
                        clients after his death. 
           Quinn, stunned, shakes Jr.’s hand. 

                                 QUINN
                        The original agreement said nothing 
                        about a doctor and guard riding 
                        shotgun.

                                 SHEAR, JR.
                        The D.O.C. agreed with Hematech on 
                        this. We can sue, but then you won’t 
                        be released today and I’ll have to 
                        fight them while you’re under.

           Quinn sees he’s trapped. Looks past Shear, Jr. to Sorenson.

                                 QUINN
                        If I need a baby-sitter, I want her.

           He points to Lara, who’s preparing Kimura’s medical case. 

           INT. HEMATECH LABS HALLWAY - LATER

           Quinn and Shear, Jr. by an observation window overlooking 
           another EXPERIMENT. Quinn’s time racing down: 05:42:56... 

                                 SHEAR, JR. 
                        Your house sat on the market for three 
                        years. Then...a miracle! Department of 
                        Power slapped down a hundred ten grand 
                        for it. 

           He shows Quinn on his tablet: a lake in the center of 10 Hills. 

                                 SHEAR, JR. (CONT’D)
                        Mystic Dam. Built for the water, 
                        hydropower, and -- if you’re a cynic -- 
                        the waterfront homes. Your house was 
                        in the flood zone. 

                                 QUINN
                             (gapes)
                        Did you get my things out of it? 

           Shear, Jr shifts like he’s suddenly in quicksand. 

                                 SHEAR, JR.
                        My father was dying. He didn’t have 
                        time to get anything out. But he 
                        researched widows named Deshani Mehta 
                        living in Mumbai. Said you asked.
           Shear, Jr’s amassed ID photos on his tablet. Quinn scrolls 
           through them -- recognizes RAJ’s WIFE. He taps on her and a 
           FAMILY TREE appears, showing Raj’s kids. A pang of guilt.

                                 QUINN
                        Send them the money. 

                                 SHEAR, JR.
                             (surprised)
                        Maybe you want to think about it. I 
                        mean, are they relatives?

                                 QUINN
                        Send it. All of it.

           Lara waits for Shear to exit before coming up. She sees Quinn 
           watching an EXPERIMENT below through the observation window:

           Technicians with ORANGE CANISTERS spray A GREEN GAS over SICKLY 
           COWS. The gas has all the directional control of a liquid. 

                                 LARA
                        They have pig pox. Misnamed actually, 
                        all mammals can carry it. It kills 
                        humans in 48 hours, so the FDA banned 
                        all livestock. 

           The gas covers the cows, their legs folding under them. 

                                 LARA
                        This sedates them before they’re 
                        exterminated...

           Quinn turns, leading Lara toward the exit. Her manner is more 
           reserved than before. Pleasant, but formal. Classic doctor. 

                                 QUINN
                        Has everything changed for the worst?

                                 LARA
                        Not everything. Look what’s in beta -- 
                        elastic floors --

           She hurls her tablet at the floor, and the floor, sensing the 
           object about to impact, compensates, cushioning its fall, like 
           a trampoline. But Quinn’s mind is elsewhere, thinking about the 
           ENFIELD REVOLVER.

                                 QUINN
                        So why’d your clinic shut down?
                                 LARA
                        The city built a park on the lot. One 
                        of those awful climate-controlled 
                        ones.

                                 QUINN
                        I’ve never been to one. Let’s go.

                                 LARA
                             (surprised)
                        I thought you’d want to look for your 
                        daughter.

           A sadness in his eyes. His voice toughens.

                                 QUINN
                        There’s only a two percent chance of 
                        ever finding a missing child after the 
                        first 48 hours. It’s been...17 years. 
                        Time to move on.

                                 LARA
                             (regards him, then)
                        I admire that. Some patients have 
                        trouble accepting that things have 
                        changed while they’re in hibernation.

                                 QUINN
                             (softening)
                        Looks like you’ve moved on too.
                             (off her confusion)
                        Second finger from the right.

                                 LARA
                        We in the science community call that 
                        one the “ring finger.”

           But her WEDDING RING is gone. She slips her hand into her 
           pocket.

                                 LARA
                        I guess that whole “to love and to 
                        cherish forever” thing just didn't 
                        work out for us.

                                 QUINN
                        An old friend told me never bet on 
                        forever. It just gives the rest of the 
                        world forever to fuck it up for you...

                                 LARA
                             (a pained smile)
                        Smart friend.
                                 QUINN
                        So what happened?

                                 LARA
                             (starting to blow him off)
                        Oh, it’s --

           But he looks at her with such genuine concern, she stops. 
           Finally --

                                 LARA
                        My son...he’s sick. And my ex lost 
                        hope about a year ago. So now he’s 
                        just a big paycheck at the end of the 
                        month. I like him better that way 
                        anyway.

           For a second Quinn sees the old Lara. The mischievous smile. 

           EXT. HEMATECH TOWER - CONTINUOUS

           As they walk out, Quinn sees he’s been hibernating in a MASSIVE 
           NEW TOWER. The view ahead: mass urbanization has caused much of 
           Boston to resemble the haphazard slums of the Third World.

                                 QUINN
                        What does your son have?

                                 LARA
                        Ewing’s sarcoma. There’s no treatment. 
                        But if he gets too sick, we might put 
                        him in hibernation til there’s a 
                        cure...
                             (she smiles, trying to 
                              bury her emotions)
                        I found out about the experiment 
                        because of you. And I joined it 
                        because of him.

           They both fall silent as they ENTER 

           A HEMATECH VEHICLE AT THE CURB.

           SECURITY OFFICER DANIELS (32, a diesel truck of a man) is 
           already inside, armed with weapons Quinn barely recognizes. 

           Daniels stares at Quinn suspiciously as Lara speaks to the 
           CAR’s NAVIGATION SYSTEM:

                                 LARA
                        Menino Park.
           The car takes off, all automated. No driver. With Daniels 
           watching them, Lara and Quinn sit in silence. He stares out the 
           window at a world he no longer recognizes. 

           EXT. MENINO PARK (FORMERLY THE CLINIC’S VACANT LOT)

           Half a normal park on a summer’s day; half a “winter park” 
           encased in transparent steel with snow falling on pine trees. 

           Quinn, Lara, and Daniels descend from the Hematech car. It 
           FOLDS in PARKING MODE, its center contracting so it saves space 
           on the road. Daniels talks into a device round his neck:

                                 DANIELS
                        Patient Quinn with us at Menino Park.

           INT. HEMATECH SECURITY CENTER

           CHIEF FELTON (53 now) checks a monitor. Sees where a DOT marked 
           “SEAN QUINN” is on the map.

                                 FELTON
                        Confirmed.

           EXT. MENINO PARK (FORMERLY VACANT LOT)

           Quinn scans the park, glancing nervously at the ROW OF TREES 
           where he hid the gun. What were 18” saplings are now 8’ trees.

           He steps unsteadily. Lara, concerned, takes his arm --

                                 LARA
                        You feel sick?

                                 QUINN
                        My stomach... I need a bathroom...

           Lara spots a PUBLIC RESTROOM in a corner of the park. 

           INT. PUBLIC RESTROOM

           A sink and one stall. Quinn coughs, his face turning red.

                                 LARA
                             (alarmed)
                        Deep breaths -- OK?

           Quinn goes into the stall. Starts to shut the door when DANIELS 
           blocks it.
                                 DANIELS
                        I have to keep you in sight.

                                 QUINN
                             (gasping for breath)
                        You’re going to watch me? GET OUT.

                                 DANIELS
                             (not moving)
                        Do what you need to.

           Quinn stands over the toilet, dry-heaving. Quinn positions 
           himself so Daniels can’t see as he PULLS HIS OWN TRIGGER.

           He VOMITS. Daniels, disgusted at the smell, turns away --

           And at that moment -- Quinn leaps onto the seat of the toilet, 
           grabs the top of the stall wall as a fulcrum and SWINGS OUT 
           FEET FIRST -- 

           Daniels grabs his gun -- Lara SCREAMS as --

           Quinn KICKS DANIELS in the face, knocking him down, his GUN 
           flying from his hands. Quinn grabs him and SLAMS his head 
           against the stall’s metal wall.

                                 LARA
                        STOP OR I’LL SHOOT. 

           LARA AIMS DANIELS’ GUN AT QUINN.

           Quinn lets go of Daniels, who slumps to the floor.

                                 LARA
                        Oh my God. You killed him.

                                 QUINN
                        He’ll live. Check his pulse if you 
                        don’t believe me. 

           They stare at each other. Neither can quite believe it’s come 
           to this.

                                 QUINN
                        You can’t kill me, Lara. I’m one of 
                        three survivors. You need me for your 
                        son. You said it yourself --

                                 LARA
                        Don’t come closer -- 
                             (nods to the gun)
                        This is a company weapon -- I’m 
                        Biomatched.
           His voice is gentle. Quiet.

                                 QUINN
                        You think I’d hurt you? You gave me 
                        your number once -- it’s the only good 
                        thing that’s happened to me in ten 
                        years.

           He takes a tiny step forward. Her eyes narrow.

                                 LARA
                        I’m not some gullible kid anymore. 
                        Don’t move --

                                 QUINN
                        I’m not a killer, Lara. Neither are 
                        you.

           He leaps toward her --

           Lara FIRES.

           Too late -- the bullet hits the stall -- Quinn rips the gun 
           away as he presses his body against hers, PINNING HER TO THE 
           WALL --

                                 QUINN
                        You’re going to help me escape. Give 
                        me the medicine for the drip pump so I 
                        don’t have to go back.

           He nods to her MEDICAL CASE, which she’s dropped at her feet.

                                 LARA
                        It’s a whole cocktail. More drugs than 
                        would fit in a suitcase.

                                 QUINN
                        You’re lying -- you have to have more!

           Lara shakes her head. Quinn -- furious -- now he’s fucked. 

                                 QUINN
                        Then the Tether -- the tracking chip 
                        Hematech implanted -- you’re going to 
                        take it out.

           Lara, eyes fearful, nods. Seemingly compliant. She slides down 
           the wall to reach the case, Quinn moving with her. Ready to 
           block her from grabbing the gun or escaping. 

           She opens the case. In an instant, she snatches a SCALPEL. GOES 
           FOR QUINN’S FACE --
                                         Revision

           He GRABS HER ARM. TWISTS it so she drops the blade. They 
           STRUGGLE for it, their arms entangled --

                                 QUINN
                        Take out the tracker!

           He grabs the blade and holds it to her throat. Wraps his legs 
           around her so she CAN’T BREAK AWAY. She quiets. Then:

                                 LARA
                        It’s in your neck.

           She points to a tiny bump a few inches below his ear. 

                                 LARA
                        I need the scalpel.

           Like he’s falling for that. He nods to a metal sickle probe, 
           like a dentist’s, in the case.

                                 LARA
                        That’s too blunt.

                                 QUINN
                        Use it.

           Her hands shaking, she picks up the probe. Forces it violently 
           into his skin. Blood pours out. Quinn, in agony, anxious she 
           might rip too deep into his jugular --

                                 QUIN
                        If you try to kill me, I’ll have to 
                        kill you first.

           She rips through membrane. Tissue. Finally something GLINTS 
           through the blood. She scrapes out A TINY CHIP.

                                 QUINN
                             (relieved)
                        Now give me a syringe with whatever 
                        would knock someone out a few hours. 

           She picks up a vial from the case. Loads the syringe. He takes 
           it. Pulls up her sleeve to inject the inside of her elbow --

                                 LARA
                        You’ll never find the vein. Put it in 
                        the shoulder muscle.

           She undoes the top buttons of her blouse and pulls the neckline 
           down to expose her shoulder.

           He plunges the needle in. Watches her intensely. Already the 
           medicine’s working. Her body relaxes under his grip.
                                 LARA
                        I really thought you’d moved on.

                                 QUINN
                        You have a son. You should have known 
                        better.

           Their faces are incredibly close. Tears in her eyes.

                                 QUINN
                        There's a lot you don't know about 
                        me...If I told you everything, it 
                        would scare you. But what happened to 
                        Chloe was my fault. Not because I 
                        killed my wife -- but because I let 
                        the wrong people into Chloe’s life. 

           Just admitting it hurts. 

                                 LARA
                             (desperate to stop him)
                        But Quinn...it’s been 16 years. She 
                        won’t even be your daughter anymore.

                                 QUINN
                        It doesn’t feel like 16 years to me. I 
                        need to see her. Let her know how 
                        sorry I am. 

                                 LARA
                        But...do you really think she’s still 
                        alive? 

           She’s picked him open. He’s bleeding now.

                                 QUINN
                        When you lose your child, there’s no 
                        moving on. As long as I’m alive, I’ll 
                        look for her. If she's buried by the 
                        side of some road -- 
                             (starting to lose it)
                        I want to know where it is. And who 
                        put her there. It doesn't matter how 
                        much time has gone by. 

                                 LARA
                             (fading)
                        The police will hunt you down and if 
                        we lose you...I could lose my son, 
                        too.

           He searches her face. Her eyes going glassy...she’s 
           unconscious. He checks his DRIP PUMP. 3 hours 28 minutes. He 
           has to hurry.
           MOMENTS LATER:

           Daniels, still out cold, is stripped to his underwear. Quinn, 
           wearing his UNIFORM, locks the bathroom door. Clambers out the 
           HIGH WINDOW 

           INTO THE PARK

           He tosses their phones and devices -- anything with a GPS -- 
           into the garbage next to the restroom. 

           Sprints to the ROW OF TREES. He starts digging under the fourth 
           tree from the left. He looks around anxiously -- but nearly 
           everyone’s in the park’s winter half.

           He tears at the earth like a wild animal. But there’s nothing 
           but tree roots. Someone must have taken the gun. 

                                 QUINN
                        No -- no --

           Finally he touches plastic. Unearths the bag with the ENFIELD 
           REVOLVER. He finds all SIX BULLETS still in the chamber, but 
           more deteriorated than before. He’s not sure it will even fire. 

                                 QUINN
                        Fuck.

           He tucks it under his jacket and TAKES OFF RUNNING.

           EXT. 10 HILLS

           The once-desolate neighborhood is now lush. New “invisible 
           buildings” project sky on their outer walls, making the windows 
           appear suspended in air. 

           Billboards read “PROTECT YOUR FAMILIES: REPORT ILLEGAL MEAT.”

           Beneath it all -- QUINN runs, crossing the city on foot. He’s 
           exhausted, pushing the limits of his body. Finally reaches:

           What was Moran’s POST OFFICE HEADQUARTERS. The columned edifice 
           is now just the ground floor of a luxurious highrise. The 
           building was previously atop a steep hill above the Mystic; 
           it’s now directly on the shores of the MYSTIC RESERVOIR.

           Quinn panics. The building’s completely transformed -- Moran 
           probably doesn’t still own it. Quinn rushes inside
           THE HIGH-RISE’S GRAND LOBBY

           A robotic fridge next to the door slides open, “Complimentary 
           refreshments.” Quinn doesn’t even hear it, rushing toward the 
           CONCIERGE (23, too large for his suit) behind the front desk.

                                 QUINN
                        I’m looking for Austin Moran. Or 
                        Andrew.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Who?

           Quinn -- his heart sinking -- 

           Then: his focus shifts to the SIGN behind the Concierge: “VALET 
           YOUR DOG“ with an arrow pointing down the hall. And Quinn’s on 
           the move. Charges round a corner into --

           DOG VALET KENNEL

           Laser pens keeping the dogs in place. In a large pen:

           THREE DOBERMANS. Ancient now. Scruffy.

                                 CONCIERGE
                             (a step behind Quinn)
                        I’m sorry but you can’t --

           Quinn turns on him with the ENFIELD in hand. 

                                 QUINN
                        -- Yeah, but I'm going to try anyway.

           INT. HEMATECH SECURITY HEADQUARTERS

           Felton studies a satellite view of Menino Park. The “SEAN 
           QUINN” DOT blinks in place. Not moving. 

                                 FELTON
                        Daniels, your position?

           Five seconds. No response. 

                                 FELTON
                             (worried, to computer)
                        Track the location of Dr. Ross’ phone.

           A dot appears in Menino park. He zooms in -- on the dumpster 
           where Quinn deposited the phones.

                                 FELTON
                        Somebody get Sorenson. 
           INT. DINGY ELECTRICAL ROOM - MORAN’S HIGHRISE

           Quinn keeps the gun on the Concierge as he opens what looks 
           like a GIANT WATER HEATER. Its sides split to reveal: 

           A NARROW TUNNEL. A ladder leading down to TOTAL DARKNESS.

                                 QUINN
                        What’s down there? My grave? 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        Sullivan T Station. Austin’s at 
                        Lechmere.

                                 QUINN
                        How could he be operating out of the 
                        fucking T?

           The Concierge looks at Quinn like he’s crazy.

                                 CONCIERGE
                        T’s been closed since they dammed the 
                        Mystic, since the water table rose --
                             (as Quinn shoves the gun 
                              against his head)
                        I swear -- it’s the safest place to 
                        transport goods. 

           Quinn searches the Concierge’s face. Deciding whether to 
           believe him. He looks at his DRIP PUMP. 42 minutes left...

           He grabs a FLASHLIGHT and EXTENSION CORDS from the shelves of 
           service equipment. Starts tying up the Concierge --

           EXT. MENINO PARK (FORMERLY THE CLINIC’S VACANT LOT)

           Homeless people sleeping on the summer lawns awaken, then run 
           for cover as a HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER noisily descends.

           Sorenson, Felton and Kimura rush out with a SECURITY TEAM. 

           Felton and the Guards BREAK DOWN down the bathroom door... 

           Find Lara and Officer Daniels unconscious inside. Sorenson 
           fills a syringe from her medical case and injects it into Lara.

           Lara’s eyes SNAP OPEN.

                                                               BACK TO:

           INT. ELECTRICAL ROOM - MORAN’S HIGHRISE - SIMULTANEOUS

           The Concierge is gagged and bound with extension cords. 
           Through the hole in the wall, 60 feet down the ladder, Quinn 
           descends, with the flashlight in his mouth, into

           INT. ABANDONED T STATION 

           Turnstiles frame spider webs. The stairs to the Victorian 
           station have been cemented off. The tracks flooded. Abandoned 
           SUBWAY CARS sit half-filled with water. 

           Quinn rushes to the subway map rusting on the wall. Orients 
           himself: Austin and Lechmere Station are six stops away.

                                 QUINN
                        Fuck!

           He drops into the flooded tracks. The water up to his waist. 
           Beneath the surface, the slight ripple of activity. Something -- 
           or things -- is alive down there.   

           Quinn, hellbent, ignores it. Charges down the tunnel.

           INT. HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER 

           Sorenson, Lara, and Felton are surrounded by security techs and 
           search equipment. Their voices overlap, tension running high -- 

                                 SORENSON
                        Without the Tether in him, how do we 
                        stop him from hurting someone?

                                 FELTON
                        We can’t. We’re legally obligated to 
                        tell the police we lost control of 
                        him.

                                 LARA
                        You bring police in, they’ll kill him--

                                 FELTON
                             (turning on Lara)
                        He almost killed you and you’re 
                        defending him?!

                                 LARA
                        He wasn’t trying to kill us -- he was 
                        trying to escape us. He says he’s 
                        going to prove his innocence. Maybe he 
                        is.
                                 FELTON
                             (darkening)
                        We all know you have a personal stake 
                        in this. 

           Lara blushes. 

                                 FELTON
                        But we can’t let your son’s needs 
                        dictate our decision. I’m sorry.

           Lara sees there’s no hope with Felton. Turns to Sorenson. 

                                 LARA
                        Please -- he’s too valuable to the 
                        research --

                                 FELTON
                             (cutting in)
                        You have two other hibernation 
                        survivors. Study them.

                                 LARA
                        And if one of them dies? Or both? 

                                 SORENSON
                             (to Felton)
                        We don’t want the D.O.C. shutting down 
                        this experiment because we lost 
                        control of one patient. 

                                 FELTON
                        And if they find out later you covered 
                        it up? They could shut down your 
                        entire company.

           As Sorenson wavers...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FLOODED SUBWAY TUNNEL

           QUINN sprints through three feet of water. It’s like running 
           into a 40 mph headwind. On the DRIP PUMP: 48 seconds left. 

           Turning a corner, he sees two boats moored at:

           LECHMERE STATION

           Dimly lit. Generators hum. The platform’s lined with HUGE 
           FREEZERS. Quinn, just his eyes and nose above the water, creeps 
           forward. Seeing no one, he hoists himself onto the platform. 
           Rushes for the stairs leading to the rest of the station.
           BEEP BEEP. BEEP BEEP. The DRIP PUMP is EMPTY. Its ALARM ECHOES 
           LOUDLY through the empty tunnels.

           Quinn, panicking -- doesn’t know what he’s about to deal with, 
           doesn’t even know if his gun works -- looks for a place to 
           hide. Opens one of the giant freezers lining the wall. It’s 
           full of huge legs of ILLEGAL BEEF.

           INT. ABANDONED LECHMERE STATION - ELSEWHERE

           A GUARD, the size of a refrigerator, watches glasses-free 3D 
           TV, blurring the line between the room and movie. 

           He hears a faint BEEPING. Turns off the movie. Draws his gun --

           INT. LECHMERE PLATFORM

           The Guard descends the stairs. The BEEPING continues. Seeing no 
           sign of an intruder, he cautiously walks forward. 

           Stops next to QUINN’S FREEZER. The BEEPING clearly coming from 
           inside. The Guard flexes his finger on the trigger...

           OPENS THE DOOR. FIRES A SHOT INSIDE. 

           But Quinn’s NOT THERE. The Guard leans in. Sees the DRIP PUMP 
           on the fridge floor. And in that moment of confusion --

           QUINN leaps out from behind and SLAMS the Guard with one of the 
           COW LEGS, wielding it like a baseball bat.

           CRACK! The GUARD’S NOSE DISLOCATING. TEETH DISLODGED. Quinn can 
           take no chances. PUMMELS the Guard unconscious. 

           Quinn bends down, unstraps the man’s BULLETPROOF VEST. There’s 
           a TEMPERATURE GAUGE on it. He has no idea what it’s for, but 
           straps the vest on anyway. 

           But Quinn’s hands are turning blue. He’s covered in sweat. He 
           clearly needs the medicine he was due for.

           He picks up the Guard’s PHONE. Dials HEMATECH. No reception.

           INT. GIANT ESCALATOR TUNNEL - LECHMERE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Quinn, on the lookout for Moran’s men, hustles up the stalled 
           escalator. He bends over. Nauseous. Now that he’s higher, he 
           dials HEMATECH again. RINGING.

                                                              INTERCUT:
           HEMATECH MOBILE SECURITY HEADQUARTERS

                                 TECH
                        Quinn’s on the line.

                                 SORENSON
                             (picking up, furious)
                        Have you lost your mind? 

                                 QUINN (ON PHONE)
                             (whispering)
                        Bring my medicines to the Lechmere T. 
                        And stay on the line --

                                 SORENSON
                        What are you doing? You -- 

                                 QUINN
                        -- Make sure you record this. I’m 
                        going to get a confession.

           Quinn doesn’t hang up, but puts the phone in his pocket so --

           IN THE HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER

           Sorenson, Lara and Hematech Security can hear everything. An 
           AUDIO WAVEFORM pulses on the security screens as it records.

                                 SORENSON (INTO PHONE)
                        Quinn? 

                                 FELTON
                             (to the Techs)
                        Plug into the phone’s GPS location. We 
                        can’t lose him again --

           INT. TOP OF THE ESCALATOR TUNNEL 

           The Guard’s immersion theater plays in front of a closed STEEL 
           DOOR. Quinn, ENFIELD in hand, slowly opens it. Peers into

           THE T STATION’S CENTRAL HUB. 

           Now a massive REFRIGERATED ROOM filled with DEAD COWS, PIGS, 
           DEER hanging from meat hooks. A BLACK MARKET SLAUGHTERHOUSE.

           Quinn’s breath steams in the cold as he creeps forward between 
           the animals. From deeper inside: a Golden Oldies station blasts 
           Jay-Z’s “99 Problems.” Quinn turns toward the sound:

           Through the doorway to the TICKETING OFFICE, Quinn sees a MAN 
           facing the other way. AUSTIN MORAN’S white-blond hair. 
           INT. FORMER TICKETING OFFICE

           Austin turns on a state-of-the-art CAPPUCCINO MACHINE just as

           Quinn, in the doorway, COCKS THE REVOLVER’S HAMMER. The gun 
           trained on Austin.

                                 QUINN
                        Don’t move. 

           Austin freezes. Quinn struggles to keep his emotions at bay -- 
           but it’s been 17 years -- this is it -- 

                                 QUINN
                        What’d you do with Chloe? Is she OK?

           Austin’s VOICE SOUNDS STRANGLED, like it’s half-air. 

                                 AUSTIN
                        I don’t know any Chloe. But if she’s a 
                        cow, I sold her and someone ate her.

                                 QUINN
                        Turn around.

           He does. Quinn’s shocked: at 34, Austin’s cheeks are gaunt. A 
           life of brutality has turned him manic, scarred his face. 

           But Austin’s the more startled by Quinn -- a living memory, 
           unchanged in 15 years.

                                 QUINN
                        What happened to your voice? 

           Austin’s eyes burn into him, but the voice is just as weak.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Some asshole slit my vocal cords ten 
                        years ago. 

           Quinn realizes Austin’s talking about him. Austin looks at 
           Quinn -- pale, sweaty, sick -- then at the ENFIELD. He smiles.

                                 AUSTIN
                        Bet my life that doesn’t fire. 

           AND AUSTIN’S MOVING. Quinn -- no other option -- 

           PULLS THE TRIGGER. CLICK. The ENFIELD DOESN’T FIRE.

           Austin hits the lights. THE ROOM GOES COMPLETELY BLACK.

           Scrambling sounds, God knows what’s happening -- then LIGHT 
           slices in as Austin runs out. The door slams behind him.
           BANG! BANG!

           Two bullet holes appear white in the darkness of the office. 
           Quinn’s shot two holes in the door. He rushes forward, opens 
           the door, sees --

           Austin darting between the rows of animals, tightly packed and 
           straight like a cornfield. Quinn takes off after him, but has 
           NO CLEAR SHOT. CAN’T WASTE BULLETS. 

           Austin disappears out of the refrigerated room and is BACK 
           AGAIN. MASSIVE GUN IN HAND.

           Now instead of chasing Austin, Quinn’s trying to get away --

           BOOM! Austin fires. Quinn, on the move, but the BULLET CURVES 
           TOWARD HIM. 

           HEAT-SEEKING. 

           It HITS Quinn in the chest. He looks down -- the smoking bullet 
           embedded in his BULLETPROOF VEST.

           And like that, Quinn realizes what the TEMPERATURE SETTING on 
           the vest is for. He jacks it up all the way. 115 degrees.

           He steps out from behind the carcass. 

           A BARRAGE OF HEAT-SEEKING BULLETS slam into the vest, the 
           impact jostling him, making it hard for him to AIM.

           He FIRES ONCE. MISSES. Keeps running -- but Austin’s now only 
           ten feet away --

           Austin FIRES AGAIN -- the bullet HITS THE ENFIELD. Knocks it 
           from Quinn’s hand.  

           AUSTIN: SPRINTING full speed -- raises his gun to fire again -- 
           he’s so close, there’s no way he’ll miss a headshot --

           Quinn SWINGS A BULL’S BODY IN FRONT OF HIMSELF --

           The BULLET HITS THE BULL’S HEAD and --

           AUSTIN -- at full speed -- too much momentum -- can’t stop --

           GOES STRAIGHT INTO THE BULL’S HORNS. 

           Piercing DEEP into his stomach. In that moment of shock -- he’s 
           been fucking impaled -- Quinn tosses Austin’s gun aside. He 
           grabs the Enfield. Presses it against Austin’s head.

                                 QUINN
                        What’d you do with my daughter?
           He pushes Austin back into 

           HIS OFFICE

                                 QUINN
                        Tell me, you fuck!

           Quinn hits the lights. The COFFEE MACHINE, still on, sputters 
           BOILING HOT COFFEE all over the counter as Austin screams -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                        Call Andrew -- Call Andrew --

           There’s a loud RINGING from every speaker in the room. 

           Suddenly PROJECTED ON THE WALLS:

           ANDREW MORAN is 15 FEET HIGH IN FRONT OF THEM. He’s 51 now, 
           hustling his YOUNG SON away as he answers the video phone. 

           For a moment he does nothing. Stares at them. Quinn stares at 
           him. They’re face-to-face when neither expected it. 

                                 QUINN
                             (to Austin)
                        Turn this off!

           Andrew -- assessing the scene -- the bloom of red blood soaking 
           Austin’s shirt -- yells into his headset --

                                 ANDREW
                        Send a team to Lechmere --

                                 QUINN
                             (to Austin)
                        What’d you do to my daughter? 

           Austin gapes at him -- open mouthed -- no idea what to say --

                                 ANDREW
                        -- Put the gun down. I’ll have men 
                        there in minutes --

                                 QUINN
                        Maybe some coffee will help. 

           He grabs Austin by the hair and shoves his FACE UNDER THE 
           SPEWING COFFEE MACHINE. Austin screams as COFFEE SCALDS HIM. 

                                 QUINN
                        Where is she?!

           Andrew yells from the screen, but Quinn doesn’t even hear it. 
           He yanks Austin out. Austin sputters, terrified--
                                 AUSTIN
                        You killed your wife -- your daughter-- 
                        everyone knows --

           Quinn turns on the STEAMER. Sticks a finger up each of Austin’s 
           nostrils and forces Austin’s face under it -- the steam 200 
           DEGREES -- Austin’s skin at 200 DEGREES -- 

                                 AUSTIN
                             (in agony)
                        I took Chloe! 

           He pulls Austin out. Austin gasps in pain, his skin raw.

                                 AUSTIN
                        You’d already passed out when I got to 
                        your house. I took her with me --

                                 QUINN
                             (enraged)
                        What’d you do with her? 

                                 ANDREW
                             (horrified)
                        Shut the fuck up, Austin -- we’re 
                        coming!

           He HANGS UP, disappearing from the wall. Quinn keeps the 
           Enfield on Austin as he snatches the Guard’s phone.

                                 QUINN (INTO PHONE)
                        You record his confession? We have to 
                        take it to the police!

           INTERCUT: HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER 

           Sorenson -- beside herself; Lara -- pale. 

                                 SORENSON
                        Quinn -- you’re torturing someone? 

                                 AUSTIN
                             (screaming into the phone)
                        HELP! He’s going to kill me! 

           Quinn SLAMS Austin across the face with the Enfield. He rifles 
           through Austin’s desk. Finds DUCT TAPE. Gags him with the it.

           Sorenson and Lara look at each other. Not sure what to believe. 

                                 SORENSON
                        The police will never accept that 
                        confession. They’ll arrest you for 
                        what you’ve done to him.
                                 QUINN
                        Then let the cops interrogate him -- 
                        he’ll admit the same to them.

           He binds Austin’s hands behind him with the tape.

                                 SORENSON
                        If you don’t get more medicine soon, 
                        you’re going to get --

                                 QUINN
                             (cutting her off)
                        Just help me get him to the cops.

                                 SORENSON
                        Our team will be there in three 
                        minutes.

           A eerie BUZZING. Suddenly the POWER CUTS OUT in the subway 
           station. Quinn and Austin just visible in the phone’s glow --

                                 QUINN
                        I’ll be dead in three minutes. 

                                 FELTON
                        Don’t hang up or we’ll lose your 
                        location --

           Guided by the phone’s glow, Quinn hauls Austin from the office.

                                 QUINN
                        How do we get out of here?

           EXT. ALLEY - MINUTES LATER

           A piece of cement opens like a trap door as Quinn pulls Austin 
           up a spiral staircase to the outside world.

           A MERCEDES SUV parked next to it. Quinn shoves Austin up to the 
           car’s security device. It SCANS Austin’s eyes. The door POPS 
           OPEN. Quinn pulls him

           INSIDE AUSTIN’S MERCEDES

                                 AUTOMATED CAR
                        We are automatically routing you home. 

           And the car takes off.

                                 QUINN
                        No, no -- reroute -- nearest police 
                        station!
                                 AUTOMATED CAR
                        Rerouting. Bunker Hill Station. 
                        Estimated arrival - 7 minutes.

           OUT THE REAR WINDOW: Quinn sees a JEEP turn down the alley. 
           GUNNING toward them. Quinn jumps into the driver’s seat and

           SLAMS DOWN THE ACCELERATOR. But the car continues leisurely 
           forward -- its computer still controlling everything. Quinn 
           doesn’t understand how the future works --

                                 QUINN
                             (screaming at the car)
                        Let me drive!

           He frantically punches buttons on the dashboard -- transforming 
           the windshield into a TV that plays a 3-D AD for ANTI-AGING 
           MEDICATION: an old woman losing wrinkles, thanks to her pills. 

           Quinn hits more buttons to get it off -- instead ALL THE 
           WINDOWS start playing the ad too. Now Quinn can’t see where the 
           JEEP is. Austin smiles at Quinn’s confusion -- he’s done for.  

                                 QUINN
                        Manual! Manual!

                                 AUTOMATED CAR VOICE
                        I think you’re trying to initiate 
                        Human Steering. Is that correct?

                                 QUINN
                        YES!

           The windshield and windows again go transparent -- Quinn can 
           see the JEEP IS JUST BEHIND THEM --

           And suddenly the car recognizes that his FOOT IS ALL THE WAY 
           DOWN ON THE PEDAL. The car ROCKETS FORWARD. TURNS THE CORNER

           -- as MORAN’S MEN FIRE AT HIS WHEELS, trying to stop him.

           Quinn’s accidentally navigated to A CROWDED STREET. Swerves 
           around OTHER CARS -- 

           The OTHER CARS -- all automated -- sensing Austin’s car and the 
           Jeep barreling down the road, beyond control -- all stop -- 
           making it harder for Quinn to weave around them, like dribbling 
           through cones a foot apart. 

           He looks back -- the JEEP IS GAINING ON HIM and --

           WORSE -- Austin has wormed his way to the right-side of the car 
           and is OPENING THE CAR DOOR WITH HIS FEET.
           Quinn -- can’t let go of the wheel. Can’t let Austin escape. 

           The BACK RIGHT DOOR IS NOW OPEN. Austin’s about to get out --

           Quinn SWERVES THE CAR HARD RIGHT -- 

           A TOTAL U-TURN, the car nearly flipping over. It SLAMS Austin’s 
           door shut again and sends Austin FLYING across the car --

           But now Quinn’s nearly in a HEAD-ON COLLISION with MORAN’S MEN.

           Who OPEN FIRE THROUGH THE WINDOW as he passes. Quinn ducks just 
           in time. Shattered glass raining down on him.

           Austin’s car slams to a halt.

                                 AUTOMATED CAR VOICE
                        The vehicle is damaged. Contact towing 
                        company?

                                 QUINN
                        No! Override! Go! GO!

           The car lurches forward again. It jabbers away with a self-
           diagnosis, telling Quinn all the things that are now broken as

           Quinn swerves down A NARROW STREET. He glances in the mirror -- 
           behind him is a BLUE VAN full of teenage girls.

           He seems to have lost the Jeep. 

           But he’s soaked in sweat. Jaundiced. Clearly needs medicine. 

           Looks in the mirror again. Sees -- THE JEEP TURNING ONTO THE 
           STREET. Quinn grabs the ENFIELD.

                                 QUINN
                        You drive -- automatic drive!

                                 AUTOMATED CAR VOICE
                        Switching to -- auto drive.

           The car decreases speed suddenly, but at least now Quinn can 
           TURN AROUND. He tries to control his shaking hands as he --

           SHOOTS OUT THE TIRES of the BLUE VAN behind him. BANG! The 
           teenage girls SCREAM IN TERROR. Their van automatically STOPS -- 
           creating a ROADBLOCK for the Jeep --

           And as a SILVER CAR going the other way comes alongside the 
           van, Quinn aims at its tires -- BANG! CLICK! CLICK! The 
           Enfield’s out of bullets --
           But the first bullet hit -- the SILVER CAR skids to a stop next 
           to the van --

           THE TWO VEHICLES BLOCKING THE ROAD. The Jeep has too much 
           momentum -- plows into a parked car, stopping mere inches from 
           the van -- the teenage girls wailing hysterically --

           Giving Quinn the chance to get away!

                                 QUINN
                        Human steering!

           The car lets him take over and he SPEEDS AWAY round a turn.

           But he convulses. Barely manages to grab the PHONE. He calls 
           Hematech, gagging as his body stiffens:

                                 QUINN (INTO PHONE)
                        Where are you? I need help!

           INT. HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER - INTERCUT

                                 SORENSON
                        We’re almost there. Are you hurt?

           INT. AUSTIN’S CAR

           Before Quinn can reply, he goes into seizure -- arms and legs 
           contracting violently. He can’t see that AUSTIN has opened the 
           door again with his feet. Austin hurls himself OUT OF THE CAR. 
           Hitting the ground outside. 

           Quinn’s eyes roll back. He slumps onto the wheel, pushing the 
           PEDAL ALL THE WAY DOWN -- the car speeding up to 110 mph --

           BACK TO AUSTIN, covered in blood. With the last of his 
           strength, he starts running. His hands still bound behind him.

           BACK TO QUINN -- unconscious as the car rockets off the road. 
           Plows through a divider and SLAMS INTO A WALL.

           Quinn -- no seatbelt -- FLIES HEADFIRST THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

           EXT. AUSTIN’S CRASHED CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           The HEMATECH SECURITY HELICOPTER lands nearby. Sorenson, Lara, 
           medics, guards all run out --

           -- as Austin’s Mercedes UNCRUMPLES. Popping itself back into 
           shape. German cars. Still the best.

           Lara gasps at the sight of Quinn -- mangled on the ground. 
                                 LARA
                        No --

           Blood all over his face. Sorenson can barely look, overwhelmed, 
           trying not to cry --

                                 SORENSON
                        You’ve killed yourself. My God -- 
                        you’ve killed yourself.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. HEMATECH - NIGHT

           A hibernation chamber slowly opens...

           And Lara methodically contracts Quinn’s muscles with a guided 
           electrical current, so he doesn’t atrophy during hibernation.

           The rest of the lab is silent and still. It’s just Lara and 
           Quinn. She glances at his face, as if expecting his eyes to 
           open. A scar from the car accident plows across his cheek.

           INT. HEMATECH LABS - DAY

           QUINN’S BLURRED POV as he regains consciousness. 

           SUPER: 2034 - DAY 4

                                 LARA
                        Do you remember your name?

           Quinn sees Lara (35 now) above him. He stares at her, unsure 
           who she is.

           But then pieces come back --

                                 QUINN
                        Austin.

                                 LARA
                        Austin?

                                 QUINN
                        The man in the car -- did you get a 
                        confession? 

                                 LARA
                        He wasn’t there when we arrived. Our 
                        focus was saving you. 

                                 QUINN
                        But he confessed he took my daughter --
                                 LARA
                             (uncomfortable)
                        That’s for you to discuss with your 
                        lawyer.

           Quinn remembers more. His heart freezing over. Alarmed.

                                 QUINN
                        They’re not going to let me out again, 
                        are they? 

           She doesn’t answer. 

                                 QUINN
                        Lara, help me convince them. 

                                 LARA
                        You held a knife to my throat.

                                 QUINN
                        I told you I wouldn’t hurt you -- and 
                        I didn’t. I just needed to find my 
                        daughter. I shouldn’t be here --

           He’s begging now. Finally --

                                 LARA
                        I couldn’t forgive you...

           Quinn deflates. 

                                 LARA
                        But then -- you’re the reason my son’s 
                        still alive. 

           She looks past Quinn. He turns to follow her gaze. Sees:

           All the HIBERNATION CHAMBERS are filled again. Lara pushes his 
           gurney toward

           A YOUNG BOY INSIDE A CHAMBER. Nine years old. Lara’s son.

                                 QUINN
                        So hibernation’s safe now?

                                 LARA
                        We’re still perfecting the drugs based 
                        off your survival. You and the other 
                        two who made it through the prisoner 
                        study. But this is our first civilian 
                        trial.

           She puts a hand up to her son’s heart monitor. Completely flat 
           at the moment... 
                                 LARA
                        We’ve already lost a few patients. 
                        Sometimes their heart rate just slows 
                        to nothing. I watch it -- 

           An anxious moment. Them both watching. 

                                 LARA
                        Worried it just won’t beat again...

           Her son looks tiny and helpless in the giant vault built for an 
           adult. Finally --

           ANOTHER HEARTBEAT. His monitor reads: 9 BEATS/MINUTE. 

                                 LARA
                             (optimistic)
                        We’ve discovered you and the other 
                        survivors have a protein that we’re 
                        trying to synthesize to give to the 
                        other patients. That’s why I need you 
                        to keep going. 

                                 QUINN
                        So you’ll help me?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SORENSON’S GIANT OFFICE - LATER

           Quinn across the desk from a graying Sorenson (53 now). She 
           clearly sleeps here a lot: behind her, an assistant pushes a 
           button and Sorenson’s sleeping pod slides into the wall. 

           Kimura (47, thin again; the future’s solved the obesity 
           crisis), Lara, and Quinn’s lawyer, Shear, Jr., sit nearby. 

                                 QUINN
                        You heard Austin’s confession! He said 
                        he took my daughter -- 

                                 SORENSON
                        Put a loaded gun in the face of anyone 
                        in this lab. Tell them you’ll kill 
                        them unless they confess to kidnapping 
                        your daughter. What do you think 
                        they’d say?  

           Quinn -- realizing she’s right --

                                 SHEAR, JR.
                        Hematech already did you a favor by 
                        not reporting it to the police -- 
                                 QUINN
                        Of course they didn’t report me. Why 
                        would they want that kind of 
                        publicity?
                             (as Sorenson’s face 
                              tightens)
                        You have to let me go out. You have to 
                        let me find her -- 

                                 LARA
                        Maybe she could corroborate his story. 
                        Find her -- and maybe we prove his 
                        innocence.

                                 SORENSON
                        How could we possibly let him out?
                             (to Quinn)
                        We have over thirty different clinical 
                        programs now. The D.O.C. might shut 
                        down all of them if we let you go on 
                        another violent rampage.
                             (shaking her head)
                        In my position, you’d do the same. I’m 
                        sorry --

           Quinn responds calmly -- his conviction growing. 

                                 QUINN
                        Not as sorry as you will be. I only 
                        joined this program -- risking my life 
                        -- so I could have one day out to find 
                        my daughter. One day out. Every five 
                        years. But if you take that away from 
                        me, my lawyer --
                             (he nods to Shear, Jr.)
                        -- will call the police. He’ll tell 
                        them I beat up your guard, he’ll admit 
                        I shot Austin. The police will have to 
                        investigate. I’ll be removed from 
                        clinical and put back in prison. You 
                        want to lose one of the only subjects 
                        who’s managed to survive?

           The air in the room goes cold. Even Lara is stunned. 

                                 SORENSON
                        Are you blackmailing us?

                                 QUINN
                        You don’t want me jeopardizing the 
                        program. Fine. I’m not asking to go 
                        out alone. I’m asking you to help me 
                        find her.
           Sorenson considers. Her gaze wanders to the windows. The 
           Hematech campus now stretches for acres around the Tower. 

                                 SORENSON
                        The easiest way to find someone is 
                        with DNA.
                             (turning back to them)
                        This company started with hematology 
                        labs before we ever got into 
                        hibernation and clinical experiments. 
                        Tens of millions across the country 
                        still get blood tests at our 
                        subsidiaries. If you had a DNA sample 
                        from your daughter, maybe we could 
                        match it to a name or address on file--

           Quinn -- realizing this means hope --

                                 KIMURA
                        We’re not authorized to use people’s 
                        information that way.

                                 SORENSON
                             (with difficulty)
                        I’d be more comfortable with that than 
                        having an innocent man in my program.

                                 LARA
                        But how can we get DNA from a child 
                        who disappeared 21 years ago? 

           Beat.

                                 QUINN
                        Am I allowed to go swimming? 

           EXT. MYSTIC DAM - LATER 

           MASSIVE, generating power for the entire city. Behind it:

           THE NEW MYSTIC LAKE. Mansions line the shore. Yachts loll on 
           the water. 

           ON A SMALL BOAT PULLED BY A TOWING KITE:

           LARA and QUINN with CHIEF FELTON (58 now) and three SECURITY 
           GUARDS, all donning scuba gear. Felton watches Quinn intensely. 
           Leans in, his voice quiet:

                                 FELTON 
                        Do me a favor -- try to escape again. 
                        I’ve been waiting five years to shoot 
                        you for what you did. 
           He nods to OFFICER DANIELS, also in scuba gear. 

                                 LARA
                        Problem?

                                 FELTON
                        Anything he had was probably looted or 
                        floated away. The odds are nothing’s 
                        down there.

           Lara ignores him. Turns to Quinn as he pulls down his mask.

                                 LARA
                        Tell me immediately if you feel sick.

           He nods and JUMPS OVER THE BOAT into the water. Lara and the 
           Security Team follow him

           UNDER THE LAKE’S SURFACE

           It’s like the view from a helicopter, as they swim 60 feet 
           above A SILENT UNDERWATER CITY. Beautiful and ghostly. 

           They click on FLASHLIGHTS. Quinn presses ahead, excitement 
           kicking in, until he sees:

           TWO FORMS coming toward them out of the darkness. 

           The Guards swim in front of Quinn. Reach for their weapons... 

           ...until they sees it’s just DIVERS with metal detectors. The 
           Divers wave, like neighbors passing on the street. Lara waves 
           back. They continue to where a STREET SIGN still stands at --

           PARK ST. Full of rotting houses. And QUINN’S HOME. Looking even 
           smaller from above, like a doll’s house dropped in the lake.

           Quinn swims over the fence and makes the familiar journey down 
           his front path, now in the most surreal of settings. Sweeping 
           aside a curtain of algae in the doorway, they enter 

           INT. QUINN’S UNDERWATER HOUSE

           Only the skeletons of furniture remain. The fireplace is a 
           colony of oysters. Water grass slithers between floorboards. 

           Rotting board games, the old piano -- artifacts of Chloe float  
           like ghosts before Quinn’s eyes. It’s a lot to take in. This 
           was his life. 

           INT. QUINN’S SUBMERGED BEDROOM

           They swim to the dresser, billowing at an angle in the current. 
                                 QUINN
                        This is where I saved her first tooth. 
                        Her first haircut.

           He wrestles open a swollen drawer. He stares. Inside is A BLUE 
           PLASTIC BRACELET. Chloe’s friendship bracelet. From the last 
           time he saw her.

                                 LARA
                        Any chance of DNA -- ?

           He shakes his head. Lara looks at the bracelet. It obviously 
           belonged to a little girl.

                                 LARA
                             (softly)
                        Save it for her.

           Felton rolls his eyes but Quinn looks at her -- appreciative. 
           Someone believes in him. 

           He tucks the bracelet in his wetsuit pocket. Searches the other 
           dresser drawers. ALL EMPTY.

           Panicking -- he turns back to Lara. What now?

           INT. QUINN’S HOUSE - UNDERWATER - LATER

           Lara inspects the shredded clothing in the closets for a stray 
           hair. Her eyes linger on FRAMED FAMILY PHOTOS. Bleached by the 
           water. She can just make out Quinn and Chloe on a tire swing. 
           Quinn beaming. Happier than she’s ever seen him. 

           The GUARDS search a desk. A Young Guard, barely out of his 
           teens, looks at a few CDs.

                                 YOUNG GUARD
                        What are these?

           Felton maintains a close proximity as Quinn swims into --

           THE BATHROOM

           He hasn’t been here since the night of the murder. He tries to 
           open the CABINET, but the wood has swelled in the water. 

           Lara sees Quinn struggling. Together, they yank the door open a 
           crack. He wiggles his hand inside. PULLS OUT -- 

           A PINK HAIRBRUSH. Beneath Lara’s flashlight, A FEW STRANDS OF 
           HAIR, still tangled in the bristles, glow copper.
           INT. HEMATECH LABS - LATER

           Lara washes the strands of hair in a chemical base. Spools the 
           hair around a tube, then drops it into a DNA ANALYSIS MACHINE.

           Sorenson goes to the computer. Puts her eye up to the reader. 
           The screen flashes: 

           “CLEARANCE LEVEL 4”

                                 SORENSON
                             (to the computer)
                        Compare sample with the databases of 
                        Hematech and all subsidiaries. Include 
                        lab tests of any kind. 2013 to 
                        present.

           The computer scans. And scans. Lara, Quinn, and Sorenson 
           anxiously watch the screen.

                                 LARA
                        The sample may be too old. Damaged.

           Then: “MATCH FOUND.” A LAB TEST appears. Quinn reads: “Rachel 
           Jenkins, 475 Canyon Rd, Utica, Ohio” with her birthdate. 

                                 QUINN
                        She’d be 27...
                             (breathless)
                        It’s her.

                                 SORENSON
                             (reading)

           “NO PHOTOS FOUND.” Sorenson and Lara look uncomfortable.

                                 LARA
                        Ohio has harsher laws against 
                        surveillance. A lot of cults, anti-
                        government groups. If you want to hide 
                        someone, that’s the place to do it. 

                                 QUINN
                             (to Sorenson)
                        I need to see her.

                                 SORENSON
                        If you think someone’s really taken 
                        her from you, how do we know they 
                        won’t try to stop you from seeing her? 
                                 QUINN
                        You’ve tried to stop me. How’s that 
                        going so far?

           Sorenson regards him. 

                                 SORENSON
                        You’ll have a lot of company.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MULTI-FUNCTION VEHICLE FLYING OVER COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

           Packed with FELTON and HEMATECH GUARDS. Somewhere among them -- 
           Lara works on her tablet as Quinn peers through DIGITAL 
           WINDOWS, which automatically brighten the outside world.

                                 QUINN
                        This is Cleveland?

                                 LARA
                             (nods)
                        Some of the most naturally fertile 
                        land in the country.

           It looks like rabid agriculture took over the city. Abandoned 
           offices decay among corn fields. Robotic farm equipment toils 
           in the darkness.

                                 LARA
                        I see you’re nervous...

           He turns back to her, surprised. She nods to her tablet.

                                 LARA
                        I can watch your vital signs on my 
                        tablet. Yours are what you’d expect on 
                        a quarterback before the Super Bowl.

                                 QUINN
                        ...It’s bad enough she won’t recognize 
                        me. It’s even worse I won’t recognize 
                        her.

                                 LARA
                        You will. Want to see her now?

           She pushes a few buttons on her tablet --
                                 LARA
                        DNA projection technology. Expecting 
                        parents never ask their doctor “boy or 
                        girl” anymore -- they want a full 
                        projection of what their kid will look 
                        like at different ages. Of course, we 
                        can’t predict the face tattoos and 
                        piercings ...yet.

           A PROJECTION POPS UP. 50 IMAGES OF CHLOE at all different ages. 
           Quinn turns back to the window.

                                 LARA
                        What age is she now?

                                 QUINN
                             (quietly)

                                 LARA
                             (to tablet)
                        27. Show all variables in gene 
                        expression for mineral deficiencies, 
                        sun exposure, weight variance --

           A range of images appears showing Chloe at 27 under different 
           conditions -- all are recognizable as the same woman. But Lara 
           realizes Quinn’s not looking at pictures.

                                 LARA
                        What’s the matter?

                                 QUINN
                        I keep thinking I’m going to pick her 
                        up -- hug her -- my little girl still 
                        in a ponytail and glasses...

           He points vaguely at the projections, still not looking at 
           them.

                                 QUINN
                        You always think your child is going 
                        to need you. You always think you need 
                        to stay alive to protect them...But 
                        what does a woman her age want with a 
                        father she hasn’t seen in 20 years?

           She can feel his anguish. That he’s completely out of touch 
           with a future -- a present -- he can’t wrap his head around.

                                 LARA
                        Maybe she doesn’t still need a father. 
                        But who doesn’t need a friend?
           She turns off the DNA projections.

                                 LARA 
                        You don’t need these. You’ll find out 
                        in ten minutes which one is right.

           As the enormity of the statement sinks in -- Quinn’s 
           overwhelmed. Struggles for words --

                                 QUINN
                        If we find her today -- it’s because I 
                        finally met someone who believed me.

           She smiles. Her face close to his...

           As the Multifunction Vehicle hits the ground, its wings tuck in 
           like a bird’s, allowing it to drive down the road. 

                                 GUARD 1
                             (worried)
                        Haven’t seen a house for miles.

           Lara clearly finds it strange as well -- this is too isolated. 
           The car stops outside the STONE WALL surrounding 

           EXT. 475 CANYON RD - NIGHT

           The Guards quietly load weapons. Even they seem unnerved by the 
           remote location, the eerie silence. Felton whispers to Quinn:

                                 FELTON
                             (suspicious)
                        You really have no idea why your 
                        daughter would be out here?
                             (as Quinn shakes his head)
                        If you sense danger, say you’re lost. 
                        We’ll move in.

           He hands Quinn a tiny mic. Quinn looks at the OLD FARM HOUSE in 
           the distance. Hesitates. Suddenly fears what he’ll find there. 

           He turns uncertainly to Lara -- who gives him a look as warm as 
           an embrace.

           He starts up the path to the HOUSE. THE GUARDS fan out behind 
           the wall, creating a perimeter in case this all goes to shit. 

           As he moves closer to the house, he can see through the window: 
           a MAN (mid-thirties), sitting at a table opposite:

           CHLOE 
           Her red hair cut short now. 27 with the same wide-set green 
           eyes. Quinn stares. Doesn’t know what to make of the scene. 
           Can’t believe it’s real.

           A CRASH from behind the wall as a GUARD stumbles in the dark.

                                 CHLOE
                        What was that?

           The Man gets up -- moves out of Quinn’s sight through the 
           window. Chloe sees Quinn’s shadowy figure standing outside --

                                 CHLOE
                             (frightened)
                        Matt! There’s someone out there -- 

           Matt opens the door, a ‘34-model rifle in hand. 

                                 MATT
                        Who the hell are you?

           And then she’s there -- behind Matt. She looks at Quinn. And 
           keeps looking. It’s been over 20 years but his face looks 
           exactly the same. 

           This is it.

           Quinn dumbly holds out the SPARKLY BRACELET. 

                                 CHLOE
                             (trembling)
                        No -- 

                                 QUINN
                        Chloe --

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh my God. 

                                 QUINN
                             (opening up)
                        It’s me -- it’s me, Chloe --

                                 MATT
                        Who is this?

           She stares at Quinn -- her eyes already gleaming with tears --

                                 CHLOE
                        I tried to forget you -- I tried to 
                        forget everything about you --

                                 QUINN
                        I never forgot you.
           He takes a step toward her -- she grabs her husband --

                                 CHLOE
                        No -- don’t get closer! 

           EXT. STONE WALL OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

                                 LARA
                        Shit --

           Chloe and Matt see the Guards and Lara running toward them. 

                                 CHLOE
                             (nearing hysterics)
                        Are you from the prison? Take him away 
                        -- take him away from me!

           Lara sounds tougher than we’ve ever heard --

                                 LARA
                        You have to talk to him. He’s gone 
                        through everything to find you. 

                                 CHLOE
                        He killed my mother!

           Lara -- stunned. She let herself believe in a murderer. 

           Quinn feels like he slammed into a wall at 100 mph. There it 
           is. He did it. But --

                                 QUINN
                        Austin told me he took you away.

                                 CHLOE 
                        You can’t remember what happened?

           He shakes his head.

                                 CHLOE
                        I heard you yelling -- crazy -- you 
                        said you were going to kill her...

                                 QUINN
                        No, that’s impossible.

                                 CHLOE
                        I saw you do it.

           Quinn blanches. His world slowing down, falling off its axis. 
           Lara looks at him with anger. Confusion.
                                 CHLOE
                        You saw me in the doorway -- started 
                        to come after me -- 

                                 QUINN
                        No --

                                 CHLOE
                        But you passed out. Austin found me -- 
                        took me away.

                                 QUINN
                        Why...why was Austin there?

                                 CHLOE
                        Mom called him. Because she was scared 
                        of you. Moran was helping her get 
                        custody --

           Quinn, anguished, pushes forward. Trying to reach her --

                                 QUINN
                        Chloe -- whatever I did -- I’m sorry -- 
                        I’m so sorry -- but you’re still my 
                        daughter -- I still love you --

           Matt blocks Quinn, raising his gun.

                                 MATT
                        Get back! 

           Setting off the guards. They lift their weapons --

                                 GUARD 1
                        Put down your gun!

                                 QUINN
                        Chloe, give me a chance --

           Lara -- can’t believe Quinn was a murderer all along -- watches 
           as two of the Guards grab Quinn, yank him back. Quinn tries to 
           fight them off. 

                                 FELTON
                        Bring him down!

           A Guard SHOCKS QUINN with a device. He shakes violently. Falls 
           to the ground, UNCONSCIOUS.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Sorenson walks out the main doors of

           THE HEMATECH TOWER - NIGHT
           The security team unloads Quinn, still unconscious, from the 
           Multi-function Vehicle onto a gurney. Lara watches, heart-
           broken, as Quinn is wheeled into the building. 

                                 LARA
                        You always think people are what you 
                        want them to be.

           Sorenson’s surprised by Lara’s face -- shell-shocked. Dead. 

                                 SORENSON
                        Go home. It’s bad enough this place is 
                        home for me. Don’t let it become yours 
                        too. You’re still young.

           But Lara doesn’t feel young. Sorenson follows the gurney inside 
           -- leaving Lara alone on the dark, empty steps. 

           INT. HIBERNATION LAB - LATER

           CLOSE ON: Sorenson’s eyes as her CINETACTS light up, receiving 
           a video-intercom:

                                 LAB TECH (VIA CINETACT)
                        Dr. Sorenson, report to lab six. 

                                 SORENSON
                        Be there in a minute.

           The Tech disappears from her Cinetacts as she preps QUINN for 
           hibernation. Quinn’s conscious. But broken. His eyes lifeless.

                                 QUINN
                        That stuff you use to knock me out. 
                        Give me enough I don’t wake up again. 

           Sorenson looks at him, startled to see he’s completely serious.

                                 QUINN
                        Just tell the Department of 
                        Corrections I died in hibernation.
                        Please --

           Sorenson shakes her head. Gently puts a hand on his shoulder, 
           steadying him for a shot. The syringe has a monitor that scans 
           under the skin for veins, so it’s easier to inject.

                                 SORENSON
                        Maybe look at it a different way. Your 
                        daughter has a life now. She’s happy. 
                        Isn’t that what every parent wants for 
                        their children? 
           He tries to accept it. Can’t.

                                 QUINN
                             (fighting back tears)
                        I found her --

           He’s losing it. Pained, she turns away.

                                 QUINN
                        I found Chloe --

                                 SORENSON
                        I know how much you risked to find 
                        her. I know what it means to have 
                        something for which you’ll sacrifice 
                        everything...

           She looks at the dark hibernation vaults, shaking her head.

                                 SORENSON
                        I never thought I’d spend so much of 
                        my life on this experiment. I thought 
                        we’d have perfected the technology 
                        decades ago. But it’s become my life’s 
                        work. And Kimura’s. And Lara’s...

           Guilt fills his eyes at the mention of Lara’s name.

                                 SORENSON
                        Have you ever heard of the Seven 
                        Sleepers? 

           Quinn is too upset to answer.

                                 SORENSON
                        In Ancient Rome, early Christians were 
                        considered criminals. Seven hid in a 
                        cave and slept for two hundred years. 
                        And when they awoke: Rome had become 
                        Christian and they were no longer 
                        persecuted... The world may be a very 
                        different place when you finish 
                        serving your sentence. But you’ll 
                        still be the age you are now. 

           He looks at her. The youthful blond he remembers from 2014 now 
           could be a grandmother. Her hands wrinkled. His still smooth.

                                 SORENSON
                        You can start over. Maybe with better 
                        luck this time.

           She thinks she sees understanding in his eyes. Her CINETACTS 
           light up again.
                                 TECH (VIA CINETACT)
                        Doctor, we need you in lab --

                                 SORENSON
                             (annoyed by the 
                              interruption)
                        -- Alright, alright.

           She CLOSES THE CASE OF MEDS and walks out. Seeing he’s alone, 
           Quinn tries the case, but it has a futuristic seal he has no 
           idea how to open.

           He sneaks out the other door into 

           INT. HEMATECH HALLWAY 

           Automated trolleys of equipment drive themselves between labs. 
           No people. Quinn searches the trolleys: finds SYRINGES, VIALS. 

           Finds bottles of anesthetics, barbiturates, sedatives. He loads 
           them into syringes the way Lara taught him on Day 3. 

           BACK IN THE HIBERNATION LAB

           Sorenson returns to see Quinn gone. Her heart quickening, she 
           opens the door to the hall.

                                 SORENSON
                        Quinn!

           He turns around. And she sees -- he’s injecting a syringe. 

           On the floor are a DOZEN ALREADY USED. 

           Sorenson gapes at him. Emotion flooding her face.

                                 QUINN
                        Tell Lara I’m sorry.

           Sorenson takes a step toward him and --

           QUINN TAKES OFF RUNNING. Sorenson bolts after him into 

           A DIFFERENT HALL -- passing Techs --

                                 SORENSON
                        Stop him! 

           A TECH calls an EMERGENCY CODE into his headset. Another TECH 
           tries to block Quinn’s path -- 

           But Quinn has too much momentum. Knocks the man to the ground -- 
           crashing through carts, gurneys -- rushing deeper into the lab. 
           He bursts through random doors into
           A SPLENDID LOBBY

           Filled with Hematech employees leaving for the night. GUARDS, 
           seeing a patient being chased, raise their guns.

                                 SORENSON
                        Don’t shoot! Grab him!

           The Guards chase him too now as Quinn, dazed from the overdose, 
           blows through an upside-down garden growing from the ceiling. 

           But he realizes the Guards are about to catch him. 

           So he turns and LEAPS OVER THE BALCONY RAILING. Sorenson 
           screams as Quinn whips through the air. 

           Total freefall.

           People on the ground 25 feet below run out of Quinn’s way --

           As he BELLY-FLOPS onto the floor -- which CRADLES THE FALL -- 
           the surface sensing impact and compensating for it, the 
           “elastic floors” from 2029.

           Momentary chaos. Sorenson and Kimura shove through onlookers as 
           Quinn’s overdose takes effect. His face blue. His back arching.

                                 SORENSON
                        We need to flush his blood! Get him 
                        upstairs!

           GUARDS lift him up, pushing people back. Quinn gazes up at them 
           as he begins to lose it. He sees:

           One of the Guards is mid-40s with black hair. The palest skin. 

           And DIFFERENTLY-COLORED EYES. One dark, one light.

           And as Quinn’s mind is awash with drugs, his vision doubles to 

           FENWAY: the black-haired man with the palest skin and 
           DIFFERENTLY-COLORED EYES slams into Raj, douses him in 
           flammable liquid.

           Quinn tries to say something, fixated on the GUARD’S EYES and 
           HEMATECH UNIFORM, but his words come out garbled as

           DARKNESS WASHES OVER HIM. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           CHERRY TREES IN FULL BLOOM
           Lara walks beneath them. Holograms of home movies play in the 
           air at her ankles as she walks through:

           EXT. MT. AUBURN CEMETERY

           Each grave plays video of the deceased’s happiest moments: 
           graduating college, getting married...

           Lara lays a bouquet of flowers on a grave. As she watches the 
           hologram play over it, it becomes clear this is --

           Her son’s grave. In the HOME MOVIE: he blows out candles from 
           his third birthday cake, as a younger Lara, 13 years ago now, 
           kisses him, tries to get him to talk to the camera. He waves 
           and smiles at it --

           A happier time. Another life.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Blurry shapes take form as ROBOTIC EQUIPMENT revives Quinn in

           THE HIBERNATION LAB

           SUPER TITLE: 2039. Day 5.

           The lab, once bright and hopeful, feels dark and ominous as he 
           stares up at LARA (40) and Kimura (52). 

           INT. HEMATECH EXAM ROOM - LATER

           Quinn, naked but for shorts, in a windowless room. A snake-like 
           device scans over his body, beaming data to Lara’s Cinetacts. 

           REVEAL: He’s enclosed in a LASER PEN. Dozens of sharp lines 
           crisscross around him -- accompanied by the eerie hum of 
           electricity. 

           Lara impassively gives him directions from outside the pen. 
           Avoiding eye contact.

                                 QUINN
                        Why am in here?

                                 LARA
                        Because we can’t trust you. Raise your 
                        arm.

           But Quinn’s in turmoil -- trying to make sense of what he saw.

                                 QUINN
                        That girl you had led me to. How do I 
                        know that was Chloe?
           It takes her a moment to remember what he’s talking about -- it 
           was five years ago --

                                 LARA
                        She matched the DNA sample.

                                 QUINN
                        That information came from your 
                        database. I want to talk to Austin.

                                 LARA
                        Who?

                                 QUINN
                             (losing patience)
                        The man in the car -- I need to talk 
                        to him. Or to Andrew Moran --

                                 LARA
                        That won’t be possible. Your parole 
                        privileges have been revoked.

           Finishing the test, she pushes a button, changing the opacity 
           of the walls so they’re WINDOWS. Letting in blinding DAYLIGHT 

           -- and a view of the Hematech campus: now an elegant fortress. 
           Walls with Guard Towers protect their bio-military projects. A 
           MONORAIL winds between the buildings, transporting workers.

                                 QUINN
                        As long as I’m here, I get parole. 
                        Otherwise you have to send me back to 
                        the Department of Corrections --

           Lara turns on another scanner, which opens up from the wall 
           behind Quinn.

                                 LARA
                             (coldly)
                        You don’t know how things work 
                        anymore. Hematech changed the rules 
                        for all its clinical trials. 

           Quinn reels. Stunned that she’s turned on him so much --

                                 QUINN
                        I signed a contract. You can’t change 
                        it after the fact. That’s illegal --

                                 LARA
                        Not anymore. This state’s prison 
                        system gets a quarter of its funding 
                        from Hematech’s studies.
           Quinn -- furious -- TRIES TO STEP TOWARD HER. The LASERS slice 
           through his arms and legs like surgical knives. He jerks back 
           into the pen. Lara gasps.

                                 LARA
                        What are you doing?

                                 QUINN
                             (through the pain)
                        What’s special about me, Lara? You 
                        said I had something that made 
                        hibernation work --

           Lara -- stricken -- stares at the blood and smoke pouring from 
           his burned tissues.

                                 QUINN
                        -- a protein -- what is it?

                                 LARA
                        CX-17. A variant within the 
                        hibernation gene--

                                 QUINN
                        How many people have it? 

                                 LARA
                        Fewer than one in a million.

                                 QUINN
                        That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? That’s 
                        why you people put me in here --

           He rushes forward. Dozens of lasers cut into him.  Freezing him 
           in pain. Deeper and deeper they cut. Lara screams. Bolts for 
           the door. 

           He forces himself forward as the lasers char his skin. Out of 
           the pen now, he’s COVERED IN BLOOD, his skin fried. He knocks 
           her away from the door. Blocking it with his body.

                                 QUINN
                        Only someone with a life sentence 
                        would agree to this experiment. You 
                        know how many people in Massachusetts 
                        have sentences that long? 

           She backs away from him -- terrified.

                                 QUINN
                        Maybe two thousand. If CX-17 is so 
                        rare, what are the odds there would be 
                        ANYONE with it in prison at all? 
           Surreptitiously, she activates a device around her wrist. 
           There’s a glimmer in her eyes, as suddenly her CINETACTS are 
           broadcasting to:

           THE HEMATECH SECURITY CENTER - SIMULTANEOUS

           A TECH watching a bay of monitors suddenly sees EXACTLY WHAT 
           LARA SEES -- Quinn blocking the door, speaking with a barely 
           controlled rage --

                                 QUINN (ON SCREEN)
                        I wasn’t chosen after I got in prison. 
                        I was chosen before.

           The TECH springs into motion, paging --

                                 TECH
                        Guards to room 147. Guards to 147 --

                                                              CUT BACK:

           IN THE EXAM ROOM

                                 QUINN
                        I trusted you, Lara --

           Her betrayal tearing through him -- he’s coming toward her now. 
           She darts away.

                                 QUINN
                        And you brought me to some woman -- 
                        said it was Chloe -- 

                                 LARA
                        No --

                                 QUINN
                        -- Cause you wanted to keep me in 
                        Clinical. And keep me from going to 
                        the police.

                                 LARA
                        You’re paranoid! It’s in your 
                        psychological report. Always 
                        distrusting -- always blaming others -- 

           Quinn, not listening, GRABS HER. She cries out.

                                 QUINN
                        And you guys needed someone to set me 
                        up. And Austin knew everything about 
                        me -- my whole life. He framed me -- 
           CHIEF FELTON (63 now) and GUARDS burst in. Pry Quinn from Lara, 
           but Quinn won’t let go.

                                 QUINN
                             (screaming)
                        What happened to my daughter? Did 
                        Austin kill her?

           Quinn wildly throws punches and kicks. Between the blood and 
           the violence he looks completely mad.

           They throw a webbed device over his head, which tightens 
           against his face like a MUZZLE, his screams now INAUDIBLE as 
           they drag him into

           THE HALLWAY

           Lara stumbles behind them. Suddenly SORENSON appears beside 
           them in a holographic projection.

                                 SORENSON (VIA PROJECTION)
                        What happened?

                                 LARA
                             (stunned)
                        He’s gone crazy -- we need to put him 
                        back under -- 

           There’s a strange blurring of projection and reality as 

           SORENSON opens the door and enters the hall in person. Lara 
           breaks down -- the terror sinking in, he nearly killed her --

                                 SORENSON
                        Oh, my dear...

           She takes Lara in her arms. Supports her as they follow THE 
           GUARDS DRAGGING QUINN into

           THE HIBERNATION LAB

           Quinn tries to scream through the MUZZLE as Kimura helps the 
           Guards deposit Quinn onto the gurney. 

                                 SORENSON
                        Secure patient.

           Arms snap out of the gurney, caging Quinn in. He tries to break 
           free, straining his muscles as hard as he can, but it’s futile.

           As Sorenson talks, ROBOTIC ARMS spray medication into Quinn’s 
           wounds and, like a sewing machine, stitch them up. 
                                 SORENSON
                             (to Kimura; upset)
                        We’ll test how long he can remain in 
                        hibernation, but never return him to 
                        full consciousness. You understand? We 
                        cannot risk the lives of our staff 
                        this way.

           Kimura nods solemnly. Taps a console. The gurney pins Quinn 
           down as a robotic syringe injects him with hydrogen sulfide.

           He desperately tries to make eye contact with Lara. Knows these 
           are his last moments. She stares back. Her eyes barbed wires. 

           The doctors watch gravely as Quinn loses consciousness. The 
           gurney lifts his body up, up into the HIBERNATION CHAMBER. 

           Sorenson and Kimura pull Lara away, pausing at the door as 
           Quinn’s chamber SEALS shut. The lights in the lab dimming.

                                 SORENSON
                        We need to remember Sean Quinn for the 
                        good his sacrifice will do for the 
                        world. Not for the crimes he 
                        committed.

           They exit. Quinn in the distance, trapped in his chamber, his 
           coffin, forever asleep... 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           Lara carries a bouquet. Trees behind her. It looks like she’s 
           again at her son’s grave, but she actually approaches

           CHLOE’S FARMHOUSE - OHIO COUNTRYSIDE

           As she gets closer, it’s clear the place is long abandoned.

           EXT. OHIO COUNTRYSIDE

           A FARMER (80) talks to Lara across a PROJECTION WALL: no wall 
           can be seen, but every few seconds electricity surges through 
           the air of the fence like lightning. 

                                 LARA
                        I saw her. She was living there six 
                        years ago. 

                                 OLD FARMER
                        No one’s lived in that house since 
                        ‘bout ‘25. Company came in a while ago 
                        -- I think they were shooting a 
                        commercial or something. 
                                 OLD FARMER (CONT'D)
                        They dressed the whole house up. Came 
                        and went in in a day. But that was it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Lara’s automated car moving through

           DOWNTOWN BOSTON

           Mostly deserted. Everyone works from home. Office buildings are 
           obsolete, abandoned, except for 

           A SINGLE SKYSCRAPER

           Lit with activity. Armored vehicles protect a five block 
           radius. Walls have been erected to prevent entry from land.

           It’s a PRISON.

           INT. MASSIVE PRISON VISITING HALL

           Crowded with inmates and visitors. Lara looks up as a GUARD 
           leads in:

           ANDREW MORAN (64). Grayed, sickly. Almost unrecognizable from 
           that first day at the track when his presence filled the room. 

           MORAN’S POV: his Cinetacts’ facial recognition software scans 
           Lara and plugs in social networking information: “LARA ROSS. 
           Age 41. Marital Status Single. Employed by Hematech Labs.”

           The Guard hits a button, creating WALL PROJECTIONS around Lara 
           and Moran, shutting out the rest of the room VISUALLY and 
           AURALLY. Lara and Moran are now in silence and private.

                                 MORAN
                        What do you want? A woman like you is 
                        only here to preach, teach, or fuck.

                                 LARA
                        I was looking for your brother. Saw 
                        the old news reports.

           She taps her tablet and NEWS FOOTAGE projects around them 
           creating a 

           FULLY IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT: Moran and Lara now on a FORESTED 
           STRETCH of the I-495.

           AUSTIN MORAN’S bloody but recognizable. A REPORTER in front:

                                 REPORTER
                        -- the police reports show Austin 
                        Moran was intoxicated and high --

                                 MORAN
                             (angrily)
                        I don’t want to watch this. It wasn’t 
                        an accident. He’d been clean eight 
                        years. The police set him up --

                                 LARA
                        No. Not the police.

           She pauses the News Experience as it shows the POLICE REPORT on 
           Austin’s death. She zooms in on --

           Austin’s blood tests. Farther in on the --

           NAME OF THE LAB: “Cambridge Labs. A subsidiary of Hematech.” 

           Moran doesn’t know what it means. She hands him her tablet:

                                 LARA
                        You may remember Quinn was also drunk 
                        the night he was arrested for murder --

           He sees on the tablet: scans of the physical pages of QUINN’S 
           BLOOD TESTS from the night of his arrest. 

                                 LARA
                        -- He always claimed he only had two 
                        drinks that night, that he must have 
                        been drugged to pass out --

           She zooms in on LAB’S NAME on the blood tests. HEMATECH LABS. 

           Moran looks at her -- 

                                 LARA 
                        Quinn had value to Hematech. They 
                        needed him framed -- hired your 
                        brother to do it -- 

                                 MORAN
                        No --

                                 LARA
                        Why else would they kill Austin? He 
                        knew too much. They set him up. Same 
                        way he helped them set Quinn up -- 
                                 MORAN
                        But you’re from Hematech --

                                 LARA
                        That’s why I need your help.

                                 MORAN
                        They co-own the prisons. They probably 
                        know you’re here. 

                                 LARA
                             (shaking her head)
                        I need connections you might still 
                        have on the outside. In exchange you 
                        get revenge for what they did to 
                        Austin.

                                 MORAN
                        How do I know this isn’t a set-up?

                                 LARA
                             (desperate)
                        I’ve wasted 15 years there --

           But Moran is leaving -- doesn’t believe her --

                                 MORAN
                        That says enough about you. For years 
                        everyone’s known they’re corrupt. 
                        Questioned the experiments.

                                 LARA
                             (emotional now)
                        I thought they’d save my son -- 

           Her voice stops him.

                                 LARA
                        They made us all believe hibernation 
                        could work.
                             (raw)
                        And I thought I’d make a lasting 
                        contribution, something the world 
                        would remember forever. 
                             (smiles at her own 
                              niavete)
                        But you can’t bet on forever. It only 
                        gives the rest of the world forever to 
                        fuck it up.

           Quinn’s words. Moran’s words. HOLD ON MORAN’S SURPRISE.

           And finally -- he smiles.
                                 MORAN
                        There’s this Bulgarian hacker...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK FILLS THE SCREEN.

           An ALARM grows louder, louder -- until it’s SHRIEKING. 

           Quinn’s eyes open: blurred forms rush above him. SMOKE IN THE 
           AIR. Something is very wrong. Voices emerging from chaos -- 

                                 JITTERY TECH (O.S.)
                        Can you hear me? There’s a fire! 
                        You’re being evacuated --

           The terrified Tech gives Quinn a series of quick injections. 
           Fills the DRIP-PUMP. The medicine pours into Quinn’s stomach --

           Now he’s conscious enough to realize -- he’s on a gurney in 

           THE HIBERNATION LAB

           And he’s alive again -- this is his chance. 

           He can’t even see clearly but he’s already stumbling toward the 
           door -- the Tech tries to stop him -- Quinn shoves him away, 
           toppling the guy over. 

                                 LARA
                             (sprinting toward him)
                        Restrain this one!

           THREE TECHS lock Quinn back into the GURNEY. Caging him in.

           A DEAFENING BOOM! 

           Everyone but Lara turns -- out the window: an ENORMOUS FIREBALL 
           consumes a REMOTE BUILDING on the HEMATECH CAMPUS.

           ALL THE POWER GOES OFF in the building. Yelling and screaming -- 
           “Those were the generators!” “Is it an attack?” 

           At that moment, Lara bends over Quinn, her lips to his ear.

                                 LARA
                        Don’t scream.

           She pushes A DEVICE against his hand. LASERS shoot out, so hot 
           they alter the morphography of the skin. He barely suppresses a 
           scream as his FINGERPRINTS are REWRITTEN.
           Lara pockets the DEVICE as doctors and techs rush to the few 
           remaining hibernation patients. The doctors’ CINETACTS make 
           their eyes glow like demons in the darkness.

                                 KIMURA
                        These emergency generators won’t last 
                        long. Hurry! Get the patients out! 

           Lara, harried, brushes away the Tech who comes to assist her.

                                 LARA
                        I’ll take him. Get one of the others 
                        out!

           And she pushes Quinn’s gurney into 

           INT. HEMATECH TOWER HALLWAY

           Panicked people moving every which way. Evacuation video plays 
           loudly on all the walls, adding to the sense of chaos. Halfway 
           to the stairwell, Lara opens a door. Steers Quinn into --

           AN EMPTY CONFERENCE ROOM

                                 QUINN
                        What is --

           Lara unlocks Quinn from the gurney. Her voice quiet, urgent --

                                 LARA
                        We’re getting out separately. These 
                        show your exit route.

           She hands him CINETACTS. 

                                 LARA
                        You can get through exits with your 
                        copy of my fingerprints. 

           The CINETACTS LIGHT UP as he puts them in. A bright green route 
           superimposes over his actual VIEW OF THE CAMPUS through the 
           window:

           It’s DARK out. Helicopters shower chemicals on the two BURNING 
           BUILDINGS, giving the WINTRY CAMPUS a hellish glow. People pour 
           toward exits where each has to be IDed.

                                 LARA 
                        I’ll be in the Security Center to 
                        reroute you according to the guards’ 
                        movements -- we can’t let them scan 
                        your face. They’ll know you’re a 
                        patient on the run. Wait for me 
                        outside the last gate. Then we leave --
                                 QUINN
                        Leave -- leave to where?

                                 LARA
                        Ghana. They don’t extradite. 
                             (off his surprise)
                        Took me thirty years to get there. But 
                        we’re going.

           They’re side by side now. He looks at her -- her hair now short 
           and black like the first night they met twenty years ago. He’s 
           drawn to her -- she’s sacrificed so much for him -- 

                                 QUINN
                        I can’t go yet. I need to know what 
                        happened to my daughter --

                                 LARA
                             (desperate)
                        You don’t want to believe it but 
                        Austin probably killed her -- and 
                        Austin's dead -- there's no way to 
                        know -- 

                                 QUINN
                        Where’s Sorenson? She’d know --

                                 LARA
                        The campus is on fire -- you can’t go 
                        looking for her. 
                             (imploring)
                        I’ve spent months planning this. Moran 
                        too. Do as I say and you'll get out 
                        safely. Please --

           She takes his hand.

                                 LARA
                        We can't get back what we've lost. 
                        Your daughter. My son --

           A mother’s pain. Quinn feels it.

                                 QUINN
                        I’m sorry, but I can’t. You have to go 
                        now.

                                 LARA
                        No! Come with me!

           She looks at him, her eyes begging him to change his mind. 

           But his face is resolute. 
           Lara steps away. 

                                 LARA
                        I’ll try to help you find Sorenson. 
                        You’ll be able to hear and see 
                        everything I do through the Cinetacts. 
                        I’ll be able to hear you. But then I’m 
                        cutting off communication so they 
                        won’t kill me too. In the meantime, 
                        get a weapon.
                             (to her wrist-controller)
                        Reroute Quinn to the Experimental 
                        Weapon Labs.

           QUINN’S CINETACTS: a BLUE ROUTE lights up to the WEAPONS LABS, 
           casting the halls through the door in a BLUE GLOW.

           He takes a step toward her -- to hold her -- maybe more -- but 
           she won’t let him --

                                 LARA
                             (firmly)
                        This isn’t goodbye. 

           A long beat. They look at each other. Knowing it is. 

                                 LARA 
                             (smiles, eyes moist)
                        Ghana.

                                 QUINN
                        Ghana.

           She leaves. 

           Quinn takes the other door, pushing through the crowd. 
           Following the GLOWING BLUE path Lara’s programmed. 

           EXT. HEMATECH TOWER 

           Lara exits the bottom of the stairwell and fights her way 
           through the panicked throngs crowding the PARKING LOT.

           INT. HEMATECH TOWER -- STAIRWELL

           Quinn races up the stairs, the air nearly opaque with smoke. He 
           holds his shirt over his mouth. He can see the door to the 

           WEAPONS LAB. But FLAMES BLOCK HIS PATH. NO HOPE OF GETTING 
           THROUGH.
                                 QUINN
                        Lara -- where else can I get a weapon?

                                                              INTERCUT:

           But Lara can’t answer as she’s just stepping inside:

           A MAKESHIFT SECURITY CENTER IN THE PARKING LOT

           Inside a huge truck, powered by its RUNNING ENGINE. A gaggle of 
           TECHNICIANS coordinate evacuation efforts.

                                 LARA
                        How scared should we be?

           INTERCUT: Through Lara’s Shared Vision, Quinn can hear and see 
           CHIEF FELTON (68 now) standing before a BAY OF MONITORS.

                                 FELTON
                        Could be terrorists. Could be thieves. 
                        But security cameras are out. We’re 
                        operating on the Shared Vision system.

           ON THE MONITORS: since stationary security cameras are dead, 
           Lara sees what every SECURITY GUARD on campus is seeing -- with 
           each Guard’s vision projected on a different monitor. 

                                 FELTON 
                        Power should be back in 10 minutes. 
                        Meantime we have guards IDing everyone 
                        they pass.
                             (to Guards on the screens)
                        Use infrared on every room -- someone 
                        could be hiding in the closets -- go!  
                        -- go! 

                                 LARA
                        Has Dr. Sorenson been evacuated?

                                 FELTON
                             (concerned)
                        She won’t leave. See if you can 
                        convince her -- 

           He points to a monitor showing: SORENSON entering a BUILDING.

           Quinn RECOGNIZES it. Rushes to the window: looks out at 
           BUILDING 1, the original Hematech building he was housed in 
           until 2029. It only has one door, barricaded by Guards. 

                                 QUINN
                             (desperate)
                        How can I get in there?
           Lara -- wracking her brain for how to answer Quinn and seem 
           innocuous to Felton.

                                 LARA
                             (to Felton)
                        We have to get Sorenson out. Patch me 
                        in to her --

           Felton does so -- suddenly Lara and Quinn can see Sorenson 
           through the Shared Vision of the Guards accompanying her as she 
           descends to BUILDING 1’s BASEMENT.

           Huge metal doors read: “CLEARANCE LEVEL 4”

                                 LARA 
                        Doctor, we need you to follow security 
                        protocol and evacuate -- 

                                 SORENSON
                        I need to check on Clearance Level 4. 
                        God forbid terrorists have gotten in --

           MEANTIME IN THE TOWER: Quinn sees GUARDS approaching, waving an 
           ID scanner over each person they pass. He’s about to be caught.

           Quinn tries to duck through the nearest DOOR, but it’s LOCKED. 
           He holds his finger over the SCANNER. The screen flashes:

           “DR. LARA ROSS, HIBERNATION DIV” and the locked door pops open.

           Quinn enters A DARK LAB. Hears MOVEMENT. Are Guards in here? 

                                 LARA
                             (to Sorenson)
                        Terrorists can’t get in, Doctor. You 
                        and Kimura are the only ones with 
                        access -- But if they blew up the 
                        generators, they could blow up 
                        Building 1. You need to get out--

                                 SORENSON
                             (cutting her off)
                        I will. As soon as I know it’s secure.

           As emergency lights flash, Quinn sees he’s surrounded by:

           CHIMPANZEES, SHEEP, PIGS running wild after escaping from their 
           electric pens, hooting and screeching. He’s in 

           THE ANIMAL LABS

           Along the wall: ORANGE CANISTERS OF GAS. The directional gas he 
           saw sedate the cows Day 3. He grabs a canister and gas mask. 
           Suddenly LIGHT from the GUARDS’ SCANNER pours in. Quinn bursts 
           into the NEXT ROOM, shoving the canister and mask under his 
           shirt. But the GUARDS are after him now. Quinn runs --

           -- trying to focus at the same time on the vision of SORENSON 
           on his CINETACTS, putting her hand into a security reader 
           outside the door to CLEARANCE 4. The DOOR slides open --

                                 SORENSON 
                        -- I’m shutting off Shared Vision for 
                        the security of Clearance 4. Kimura’s 
                        in charge until I initiate contact.

           Lara is about to protest further when A BABY-FACED TECH turns 
           to Felton. 

                                 BABY-FACED TECH
                        Un-IDed man in the Animal Labs.

           Lara stiffens as a MONITOR shows a video feed of the Guards 
           chasing Quinn. Felton’s intensity now has a target --

                                 FELTON
                        Rewind all Shared Vision within 1000 
                        feet of the lab. Get me an ID. Block 
                        off all stairwells -- the driveway -- 
                        trap him!

           Felton pushes a button and suddenly the video feed of Quinn 
           running away is BROADCAST on every emergency screen on campus -- 

                                                             INTERCUT: 

           -- Playing on the entire OUTSIDE WALL of the Tower. TEAMS OF 
           GUARDS armed with SHORT-FIRE MISSILES push through the crowds 
           toward Quinn.

           BACK IN THE TOWER:

                                 QUINN
                             (running, desperate)
                        Lara -- how do I get to Sorenson? 

           Lara, terrified, tries to come up with a new plan. Turns to 
           Felton.

                                 LARA
                        What about the monorail? You’re not 
                        worried about someone using it to 
                        follow Sorenson to Building 1?

                                 FELTON
                        All trains are stalled. No power.
                                 QUINN
                             (murmurs)
                        The monorail --

           He bursts into --

           AN INDOOR PARKING LOT

           Vehicles Quinn doesn’t even recognize as cars are bottle-necked 
           in a CORKSCREW DRIVEWAY descending eight floors to the ground. 

           As he starts to run down it, Quinn sees GUARDS at the bottom. 
           It’s too blocked for them to drive up. So they rig themselves 
           to short-range missiles and --

                                 LEAD GUARD
                        Go!

           The missiles FIRE -- like vertical chariots, pulling the Guards 
           up, up the hollow center of the DRIVE -- 

           They shoot out HOOKS. Clamber over the railing toward Quinn --

           Quinn turns round, just as the ORIGINAL GUARDS chasing him 
           BLOCK HIS EXIT. He scans for options. Just ahead --

           A MAN has a vehicle so sleek and strange -- its shell covering 
           its wheels -- it takes Quinn a moment to recognize it’s a 

           MOTORBIKE. The man is about to step on it when QUINN shoves him 
           off. Leaps on himself. Weaves between cars, screeching turns --

           BACK IN THE SECURITY CENTER:

                                 BABY-FACED TECH
                        Sir! Got an ID!

           He points to a MONITOR: Quinn’s visible entering the Animal 
           Labs. Facial recognition software identifies: “SEAN QUINN. 
           HIBERNATION PATIENT 03.” 

           ALL OVER HEMATECH: Quinn’s ID photo is on every Guard’s 
           Cinetacts, every emergency screen. 

           IN THE SECURITY CENTER: Felton stares. Stunned.

                                 FELTON
                        How’d he get through the door?

                                 SECOND TECH
                        Door security recognized him as...
                             (stunned)
                        Dr. Lara Ross.
           Felton turns to Lara, his eyes blazing. She shakes her head -- 

                                 LARA
                        Impossible. Unless he stole my prints 
                        somehow --

                                                               BACK TO:

           QUINN can’t pay attention to what’s happening with Lara as the 
           Guards OPEN FIRE across the parking lot. People scream as Quinn 
           swerves to avoid the bullets. The GUNFIRE BLOWS OUT THE 
           WINDOWS. Glass falling like raindrops over Quinn.

           Through the blown out windows: Quinn sees the MONORAIL STATION 
           20 FEET BELOW. Only one way to get down. He turns sharply -- 

           And DRIVES STRAIGHT OUT THE WINDOWS --

           QUINN on the BIKE falling through the air -- 80 feet above the 
           earth -- DIZZYING, TERRIFYING --

           A HUGE BOOM as he LANDS ON THE MONORAIL STATION -- barely 
           keeping the bike upright --

           BACK IN THE SECURITY CENTER:

                                 BABY-FACED TECH
                        Quinn’s Cinetacts are receiving a 
                        signal from within ten feet of this 
                        location --

           Lara blanches as HER OWN VISION FILLS THE MONITORS as the Tech 
           patches into the signal she’s sending Quinn, showing the 
           Security Center itself from her POV.

           Lara -- panicking -- exposed -- runs for the door --

           Felton TACKLES her. She fights him off, but a half dozen men 
           pin her down. 

                                 LARA
                        Listen to me -- Sorenson killed his 
                        daughter -- set him up -- 

           They MUZZLE her the way they did Quinn the prior day. She 
           screams, but no sound emerges. 

                                 TECH
                             (to Felton)
                        Sir, we’ve patched into Quinn’s 
                        vision.
           QUINN’S VISION -- as he races the bike along the platform of 
           the Tower’s Monorail Station -- fills a security screen.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           THE TOWER MONORAIL PLATFORM

           Quinn sees BUILDING 1 a quarter mile away -- connected by an 18-
           inch wide MONORAIL TRACK.

           No other choice -- he TAKES THE BIKE ONTO THE TRACK itself -- 
           basically tight-rope walking at 70 miles per hour. 100 feet a 
           second. 60 FEET above the ground.

           He plows through CLOUDS OF SMOKE obscuring the track for 
           seconds at a time -- Quinn’s about to drive off the edge -- 

           BACK IN THE SECURITY CENTER

           Felton watches Quinn’s vision.

                                 FELTON
                        Take him out! Now!

           And at that moment -- the POWER GOES BACK ON. The lights turn 
           the smoky air OPAQUE as Guards on the ground OPEN FIRE.

           Bullets whiz by Quinn. He hears A STRANGE HUM. Looks up. 

           A MONORAIL TRAIN RUSHES TOWARD HIM. 300 feet ahead. The 
           BUILDING 1 MONORAIL station about 50 feet before it -- and with 
           it -- the chance of finding Sorenson --

                                 FELTON 
                             (watching Quinn’s vision 
                              on the monitors)
                        You’ve killed yourself now --

           Quinn speeds up. He’s almost reached the building -- only 40 
           feet away --

           Bullets hitting the bike now -- POPPING HIS FRONT WHEEL --

           He’s losing control and -- 

           The TRAIN is about to hit him! He SWERVES OFF THE TRACK.

           Falling through the air. HIS MOMENTUM CARRYING HIM FORWARD as 
           he BLASTS THROUGH THE HUGE WINDOWS of
           INT. BUILDING 1 - 6TH FLOOR 

           QUINN covers his face as he rockets in, wiping out tables, 
           chairs. Hits the ground with brutal force. 

           Quinn’s slumped on the floor, bleeding, ribs broken. Slowly, 
           agonizingly, forces himself up. Pulls out the cannister and gas 
           mask he stole from the Animal Labs. It’s dented but intact.

           Quinn -- in this first moment of quiet -- finally realizes he’s 
           lost Lara’s signal --

                                 QUINN
                        Lara? 
                             (worried)
                        Lara -- where are you?

           INT. SECURITY CENTER

           Lara, muzzled and restrained, can hear Quinn but do nothing as 
           Felton monitors QUINN’S VISION. He patches into KIMURA:

                                 FELTON
                        Kimura -- he’s descending the North 
                        Stairwell, Building 1 --

           INT. BUILDING 1 HALLWAY

           Quinn hobbles down to the GROUND FLOOR just as --

           Kimura and the ARMED GUARDS enter at the FAR END. 

           Quinn flies back round the corner as the Guards OPEN FIRE. He 
           shoves the gas mask over his face. Rips open the GAS CANISTER 
           and HOLDS IT OUT AROUND THE CORNER. 

           A POP. Then ROAR --

           As the gas Quinn saw used on the cows POURS FROM THE CANISTER, 
           unbelievably dense, crushing forward like a TIDAL WAVE. 

           The guards reel -- the closest already collapsing, unconscious.

           INT. SECURITY CENTER

           Felton and THE SECURITY PERSONNEL see Quinn take off after 
           Kimura through Quinn’s Shared Vision. 

                                 FELTON
                             (screaming to his Guards)
                        Team C to Building 1 -- 
           INT. BUILDING 1

           Quinn reaches Kimura, who’s doubled over, coughing. Quinn HOLDS 
           HIS BREATH, RIPS OFF HIS MASK and shoves it over Kimura’s face. 

           He alternates holding the mask over himself and a barely-
           conscious Kimura as he drags Kimura down the stairs to

           THE BASEMENT LEVEL. The air clearer here. Huge DOORS read: 
           CLEARANCE 4. 

           Kimura’s regained consciousness enough to struggle as Quinn 
           forces his hand onto the palm outline on the door’s SECURITY 
           DEVICE. Kimura seems unhinged, hysterical --

                                 KIMURA
                        You can’t go in there!

           A NEEDLE shoots out of the SECURITY DEVICE into Kimura’s hand 
           muscle. An instant DNA test. The device IDs Kimura and the

           DOORS SLIDE OPEN. Revealing 

           CLEARANCE LEVEL 4. A DARK STORAGE FACILITY.

           And in that moment of Quinn staring into the darkness --

           Kimura snatches a box out of his pocket. It UNFOLDS into a 
           COLLAPSIBLE GUN. Quinn reacts just as Kimura FIRES, a BULLET 
           BURYING ITSELF in QUINN’S ARM. 

           Quinn fights Kimura for the weapon -- Quinn’s fingerprints on 
           the trigger -- the gun IDs “LARA ROSS,” and 

           FIRES into Kimura’s abdomen. He falls to the floor. Dead. Quinn 
           staggers into

           CLEARANCE LEVEL 4

           The doors close behind him, jam against Kimura’s body. 

           Quinn presses further into the darkness -- past giant machines. 
           The faintest light. An unsettling silence.  

                                 SORENSON (O.S.)
                        Put the gun down.

           He sees SORENSON standing over what looks like an open casket.

                                 QUINN
                        What happened to my daughter?
                                 SORENSON
                        You shut off the power. Blew up the 
                        generators. It may have killed her...

           Quinn hears a SLOW BEAT through a heart monitor. 

           Then he sees it. He loses himself, nearly drops the gun -- 

           A HIBERNATION CHAMBER. Its LID OPEN. Inside:

           CHLOE. 

           STILL A LITTLE GIRL.

           Her metabolism has barely aged her since thirty years ago and 
           that day at the piano. 

           Like Sleeping Beauty -- she looks serene, unaware of the chaos 
           around her.

           BACK IN THE SECURITY CENTER:

           Felton sees the LITTLE GIRL through Quinn’s vision. 

           Stunned, he turns to Lara, who meets his gaze from behind the 
           muzzle...

           BACK IN CLEARANCE 4:

           Quinn stares at Chloe, realizing --

                                 QUINN
                        She has what I have. The protein...you 
                        wanted her, too.

                                 SORENSON
                        You know how it works. Her heart will 
                        beat like this for a few minutes. But 
                        if we don’t attach the drip pump, she 
                        will die...

           Quinn -- still trying to comprehend -- trains his gun on her. 

                                 QUINN
                        How’d you find us?

                                 SORENSON
                        Some routine test your doctor ordered. 
                        Came into our hematology labs. I saw 
                        you had a variant of the hibernation 
                        gene -- the rarest. I didn’t know then 
                        it was the only one that would work. 
                                 SORENSON (CONT'D)
                        I just knew I had to have every 
                        variation. I couldn’t do an experiment 
                        this long twice.

           Quinn is mad with rage, still weak from the gas --

                                 QUINN
                        Two for one. Is that what you figured?

                                 SORENSON
                        And your criminal record guaranteed a 
                        conviction...

           Chloe’s heartbeat, beeping through the monitor like an alarm, 
           grows still SLOWER, less REGULAR.

                                 SORENSON
                        She’s dying, Quinn.

                                 QUINN
                             (threatening)
                        Give her the medicines --

                                 SORENSON
                        Give me the gun. If you kill me, 
                        she’ll die. Or do you know which 
                        medication she needs?

           Sorenson nods to easily three dozen vials. Quinn has no idea. 
           Doesn’t know what to do. His voice fills with emotion, his 
           desperation surfacing --

                                 QUINN
                        But how can I trust you?

                                 SORENSON
                        She’s only been awake a few hours in 
                        thirty years. Never knew where she 
                        was. She can be adopted. Have a life. 

           A SUSTAINED BEEP from the heart monitor. Chloe’s FLATLINING.

           Quinn, in agony, looks at his daughter. Her skin going blue. He 
           reaches out. Takes her hand. Cold. Like a corpse already. 

                                 QUINN
                        Give her what she needs.

           He holds out the gun. Sorenson takes it.

           AND SHOOTS HIM. 

           Quinn’s blown back against the wall. Blood floods his shirt.
           He gasps -- the world going hazy -- but he can still see -- 

           Sorenson put the gun down. Fills the drip-pump. The medicine 
           flowing into Chloe.

           Quinn watches -- embracing his fate, his final seconds of life -
           - as he collapses to the ground.

           FELTON and LARA BURST IN. A team of Guards behind them. 
           Sorenson grabs the gun --

                                 SORENSON
                        You shouldn’t have come in here --

                                 LARA
                        We were recording his vision.

           Sorenson looks at them. Their faces say it all: they saw 
           everything.

           Lara slowly -- carefully -- approaches Sorenson.

                                 LARA 
                        Put the gun down, Doctor.

           Sorenson shakes her head.

                                 SORENSON
                        The work has to go on. It’s too 
                        important.

           Lara grabs Sorenson -- but Sorenson moves too quickly --

           A GUNSHOT RINGS THROUGH THE ROOM. Lara and Sorenson collapse 
           together -- 

                                 FELTON
                             (rushing forward)
                        Dr. Ross!

           He grabs Lara -- she’s covered in blood. 

           But UNHARMED. It’s Sorenson who’s bleeding, still clutching the 
           gun, which she's pulled on herself. 

           As the Guards swarm around Quinn and Sorenson, the sound of 
           Sorenson's DYING BREATHS grows louder and --

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           BLACK. The raspy breathing continues. Grows more normal. 

           P.O.V. of blurred shapes finally clarifying into --
           A CIVILIAN HOSPITAL ROOM. Futuristic yet familiar -- the same 
           dull furniture and art that hospitals have always had. 

           REVEAL: that wasn’t Quinn’s P.O.V., but 

           CHLOE’S. 

           She lies on a hospital bed. Blinking awake. Her eyes fall on --

           THE PLASTIC FRIENDSHIP BRACELET on the bedside table. 

           QUINN is in the next hospital bed over. Chloe’s turned away 
           from him. Hasn’t seen him yet. Not that there’s much to see -- 
           his body is bandaged and his face bruised and pulpy like an 
           overripe piece of fruit.

           Quinn -- watches breathlessly as Chloe reaches out for the 
           bracelet. 

           She puts it on. Still fits perfectly. 

           Quinn -- it’s still her. Chloe’s still Chloe. He’s choking back 
           emotion. Can’t even talk --

           So LARA -- sitting in the chair next to his bed -- speaks for 
           him.

                                 LARA
                        Chloe?

           Chloe whirls round. Sees -- 

           LARA and QUINN. It takes her a second to recognize this man -- 
           with the swollen, discolored face -- is --

                                 CHLOE
                        Daddy?

           Everything Quinn wanted to hear. He’s still someone’s Dad. And 
           even though it hurts like hell --

           He smiles.
