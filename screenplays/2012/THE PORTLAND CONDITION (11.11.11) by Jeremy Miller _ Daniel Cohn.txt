                                    FIRST DRAFT
           EXT. PORTLAND, OREGON - 5:59 AM

           LIGHTNING zig-zags the ominous predawn sky.  Then, a THUNDERCLAP.

           INT. BEDROOM - 6:00 AM

           An ALARM CLOCK BEEPS.  CAMERA PUSHES IN ON:  JASPER AYLES, 30,  
           as he peels open his eyes.  Weary and disheveled, we don’t know 
           if he’s been sleeping for ten minutes or ten hours.  

           In a haze, Jasper puts a LIGHT THERAPY BOX on his chest.  
           Blinding U.V. RAYS SHINE in his face.  He just lies there. 

           “GLASS, CONCRETE & STONE” by David Byrne PLAYS OVER:

           INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

           Jasper picks his meds out of a 7-Day Pill Organizer.  All the 
           colors of the rainbow, downed in a handful of water.  

           He looks at himself.  With any effort, he’d be handsome.  But 
           Jasper hasn’t put much effort into anything lately.

           INT. CLOSET - MORNING

           Jasper stands in front of his closet.  He stares at six hanging 
           GRAY HOODIES.  We can’t tell them apart, he can’t choose.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Jasper pours milk on his listless Grape Nuts, waits for them to 
           come to life.  He’ll have to wait forever.  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           PAN the loft.  It’s barely furnished, except for WALLS of BOOKS.  

           A BIRD CAGE is next to an open window.  There is NO BIRD in the 
           cage.  Jasper sprinkles seed into the already filled bird feeder.  
           He leaves the CAGE DOOR and the WINDOW OPEN.  

           EXT. PORTLAND, OREGON - STEEL BRIDGE - MORNING

           A drizzle morphs to rain.  Jasper flips up his hood and ambles 
           across the bridge that spans the churning Willamette River.  
           MOUNT ST. HELENS juts out of the foggy horizon.
           INT. STUMPTOWN COFFEE - MORNING 

           Jasper waits in line for his jolt of caffeine.  Technically,  
           he’s still asleep.  KENNY, 20’s, a barista for whom coffee is    
           a religion, calls out to Jasper.

                                 KENNY
                        Jack-attack!  How you doin’, my man?

                                 JASPER
                             (turns upbeat)
                        Now that I got my Kenny-fix, a whole 
                        lot better.

           Kenny hands Jasper a to-go cup with “Jack” written on it.

                                 JASPER
                        See the new Esquire?  We got #1  
                        “Most Depressed City in America.”   
                        #6 in suicide, but I think with a 
                        little elbow grease, we could pop 
                        that up to a 4 or a 5.

                                 KENNY
                             (laughs)
                        Who’d they poll for that shit, ‘cuz 
                        that ain’t the Portland I know.

           Jasper looks out the window at the dark, dreary day.

                                 KENNY
                        Supposed to be sunny on Thursday.

                                 JASPER
                        It’s worse when it’s sunny.  You  
                        know it’s not gonna last.

           INT. THE “WILLAMETTE WEEK” - DAY

           The offices of an alternative newsweekly.  Jasper plays “Words 
           With Friends” in his cubicle.  Over his desk is a framed column:

              “What’s the Haps, Portland?” by Jasper Ayles, dated 2007.

           PHIL, 40’s, Jasper’s boss, wearing a sweater vest tucked into 
           jeans, comes by the cubicle.  

                                 PHIL
                        Lemme’ ask you a question, Jasper.

                                 JASPER
                        Shoot, Phil.
                                 PHIL
                        You reviewed Bon Iver at the   
                        Aladdin Theater last Friday?

                                 JASPER
                        Great show.  Gave’em 3 1/2 eyeballs.  

                                 PHIL
                        They never played the Aladdin.

                                 JASPER
                             (thinks on his feet)
                        Did I put the Aladdin?  My bad, this 
                        was a secret show at Red Room.  Just 
                        a short set, then a couple of guys 
                        from The Antlers did an encore with 
                        them.  “Cinnamon Girl,” I think.  

           Phil is suspicious, but Jasper was so convincing, he lets it go.

                                 PHIL
                        Your job is to tell us “what the 
                        haps” are.  

                                 JASPER
                             (cringes)
                        Can we at least drop that phrase?

                                 PHIL
                        What’d you do last night, Jasper?

                                 JASPER
                        Dinner at this new tapas place and a 
                        Rothko retrospective at the --

                                 PHIL
                        Where are your receipts?

           Jasper feigns looking through his drawer.

                                 PHIL
                        We reimburse you for everything you 
                        do, yet you haven’t turned in a 
                        receipt for months.

                                 JASPER
                        I know the paper’s struggling.

                                 PHIL
                        Not as much as you are.

           Phil walks away.  TREVOR, 35, with a mountain of dandruff and an 
           enormous chip on his shoulder, peers over the cubicle.
                                 TREVOR
                        You’re a dick.  You got the best job 
                        here and all you do is make shit up.

                                 JASPER
                        It would be a decent job, if we  
                        lived in a decent city.

                                 TREVOR
                        Then move already.

                                 JASPER
                        Funny you say that, I am moving.

                                 TREVOR
                        Where this time?

                                 JASPER
                        Tampa.  No...Phoenix.

           Trevor descends back into his cubicle.  

                                 JASPER
                        Maybe Nashville.  Just waiting to see 
                        how their mayoral election pans out.  

           Jasper sits in his cubicle.  We ONLY SEE the TOP OF THEIR HEADS.

                                 JASPER (O.S.)
                        Or Columbus, it’s all still up in  
                        the air.

                                 TREVOR (O.S.)
                        Please keep me posted.

           INT. ROLAND’S OFFICE - EVENING

           A TIGHT TWO SHOT - Jasper sits across from DR. ROLAND HARVEY, 
           late 40’s, a psychiatrist who doesn’t pull any punches.  

                                 JASPER
                        The light therapy isn’t working.  
                        Nothing is.   

                                 ROLAND
                        Well, I’m proud of you.  You’ve   
                        been single for about a month.  

                                 JASPER
                        33 days.  I keep thinking about 
                        Emily.  Maybe we could’ve made it 
                        work.  I should have tried harder.
                                 ROLAND
                        You held on for two years.  

                                 JASPER
                        What if she was the one?

                                 ROLAND
                        But Sara was the one.  And Natalie?  
                        She was the one before the one.
                             (then)
                        No matter how many women you try    
                        to rescue, your mother will still   
                        be dead.

                                 JASPER
                        Whoa, Dr. Dick!

                                 ROLAND
                        Jasper, I’m just trying to get you  
                        to see the pattern.  

                                 JASPER
                             (this rankles him)
                        Mind your own business.

                                 ROLAND
                        Einstein said, “Insanity is doing  
                        the same thing over and over and 
                        expecting a different result.”

                                 JASPER
                        Please stop Einstein-ing me.

                                 ROLAND
                        Who else would like to share?

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  

           Jasper is actually in GROUP THERAPY, held in a BARBER SHOP    
           (”GUS CUTS”) after closing.  Everyone sits in barber chairs.  

           On a CHALK BOARD, written in bold:

                      “THE PORTLAND CONDITION”

                 “Seasonal Affective Disorder -- S.A.D.” 

           We meet BRAD, 40’s, pocky and meek.

                                 BRAD
                        That was some rain last night.

           ANDREA, heavy-set, looks like she always has a cold, chimes in.
                                 ANDREA
                        It made me binge.

           KEVIN, an angry teen with a penchant for drugs, pounces.

                                 KEVIN
                        What doesn’t make you binge?

                                 ANDREA
                        The Summer.  I always lose a few 
                        l.b.’s in the Summer.

                                 KEVIN
                        Do you really though, Andrea?

                                 ANDREA
                        At least I don’t smell like cocaine, 
                        Kevin!

                                 ROLAND
                             (interrupts)
                        It’s April.  You know what they say, 
                        “April showers --  

                                 JASPER
                        And then it’s November.

           Roland holds up the Esquire: “Portland - Most Depressed City?” 

                                 ROLAND
                        I’m sure you’ve all seen the   
                        “Esquire” article by now.

                                 KEVIN
                        Finally the truth comes out!  

                                 ANDREA
                        Yeah.  Do you know how long it took 
                        me to get out of the house this 
                        morning?  I have to prepare for  
                        light rain, heavy rain, sideways 
                        rain, freezing rain, driving rain --

                                 JASPER
                        Hail.

                                 KEVIN
                        Sleet.

                                 BRAD
                        The occasional flurry.

           Their chatter continues to rise in decibels.
                                 ROLAND
                        -- OK, I get it, ok!  Let’s move on 
                        to this week’s assignment.
                             (gets everyone’s attention)
                        We are all going to write a letter.  
                        To ourselves.  Not to ourselves now.  
                        To ourselves TEN years ago.  
                             (then)
                        Jasper -- you’re 30.  I want you to 
                        write a letter to Jasper at 20.  

                                 JASPER
                        What am I supposed to write?

                                 ROLAND
                        Anything you want.  List your 
                        regrets, give yourself advice.  How 
                        would you live these past ten years 
                        differently?

                                 BRAD
                        I wouldn’t have become a tax 
                        attorney.

                                 ROLAND
                        Perfect.  Put that in the letter.    
                        Maybe we can shine a light on   
                        what’s making you stuck.  

                                 JASPER
                        What do I do with it when I’m done?

                                 ROLAND
                        You could put it in a bottle and   
                        float it out to sea, but you don’t 
                        have to send it, that doesn’t matter.
                             (for instance)
                        I’ve always had a fantasy of base-
                        jumping off “Big Pink”.  I’ll put 
                        that in my letter. 

                                 BRAD
                        Can I send it to my old address?

                                 ROLAND
                        If you want, but that’s really not --  

                                 BRAD
                        -- My old building got torn down.

                                 ANDREA
                        Wait, I lie about my age.  Should I 
                        write to me 10 years ago based on my 
                        real age or my fake age?
                                 KEVIN
                        Do I have to type it or can I --

                                 ROLAND
                        Just write it!
                             (takes a breath)
                        Everyone work on your letters.  Next 
                        week, we’ll share our experiences.   

           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Group has ended.  Kevin guzzles the coffee, Andrea hoards donuts. 

           Jasper glances up at a BULLETIN BOARD -- Flyers for LOCAL BANDS.  
           ROOMMATE WANTED.  LOST CAT.  His eyes drift to the bottom corner.  
           “SENSUAL MASSAGE.  CALL ALEXIS!”

           EXT. SUNBURST MOTEL - PORTLAND - NIGHT

           The rain falls in solid sheets.  In the corridor of a seedy 
           motel, Jasper pulls out a crumpled paper with “214” written on 
           it.  He finds Room 214, composes himself, then knocks.

                                 JASPER
                        It’s, uh...Jack.  We spoke on the 
                        phone.

           The door opens to reveal ALEXIS, 20’s, in jean shorts and 
           stilettos.  Smoking a joint, she ushers him in.

           INT. SUNBURST MOTEL - ROOM 214 - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper enters the nondescript room.  He’s soaking wet.  

                                 JASPER
                        I never do this.

           He attempts a clumsy hug, then shakes her hand instead.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Why don’t you put the “donation”    
                        on the table and get comfortable.

           Jasper counts out his damp bills.  He’s nervous as hell.    

                                 JASPER
                        This isn’t our normal Portland 
                        drizzle, you know, where it feels  
                        like they’re spitting on you.    

           She unbuttons down to her bra, puts his hand on her breast.    
                                 ALEXIS
                        Has anyone ever said you look     
                        like Johnny Depp?

           They haven’t, because he doesn’t.  

                                 JASPER
                        Emily, my ex, used to say I looked 
                        like Ben Kingsley. 

                                 ALEXIS
                             (no clue who that is)
                        I can see that.  He’s hot.

                                 JASPER
                        The thought of starting over, dating, 
                        calling, not calling, do I, should I, 
                        I mean, Tweets?  Ugh.
                             (then)
                        This is so much easier...we have no 
                        connection, this can’t end badly.  
                        You know I’m not gonna call.  Unless 
                        you want me to call and check in, 
                        because I can.  I would.

           Silence.

                                 JASPER
                        It’s just better this way, don’t you 
                        think? 

           Jasper quickly surveys the room.

           ECU:  A plastic bottle of POPOV VODKA and remnants of COKE LINES.

           ECU:  The edge of a torn TROJAN WRAPPER under the bed. 

           ECU:  LUBE on a night table.

                                 JASPER
                        Can I...use your bathroom?

                                 ALEXIS
                        You asked for a 30 minute “blow-dry,” 
                        I don’t wanna cut into your time.

           INT. BATHROOM - ROOM 212 - MOMENTS LATER

           In the mirror, Jasper looks at himself with disappointment.

                                 JASPER
                        You’re really maximizing your 
                        potential.  I’m so proud of you.
           Jasper kicks up the toilet seat with his shoe.  As he pisses, he 
           spots the dirty shower curtain.  He stares at it for a long beat.  

           Finally, he yanks open the curtain TO REVEAL:

           A MAN in THE SHOWER.  CAMERA GETS FRENETIC.

           Jasper SCREAMS.  The Man SCREAMS.  Jasper lets go of his penis, 
           PISSES OUT OF CONTROL - All over the towels and the walls.

                                 SWEATY MAN
                        It’s ok, I’m her husband!  

                                 JASPER
                        I swear, I hardly ever do this!

                                 SWEATY HUSBAND
                        I’m just here if something goes 
                        wrong!

           Frantic, Jasper flies out of the bathroom.  

                                 ALEXIS
                        I keep telling him not to stay in 
                        there.

           The Husband rushes into the room to quell the situation.

                                 JASPER
                        I really have to go.

                                 ALEXIS
                        But this is your party, Jack. 

                                 SWEATY HUSBAND
                        It’s your time together, bro.  She 
                        can roll a condom on with her mouth.

                                 JASPER
                             (forces a smile)
                        That’s...awesome.

                                 SWEATY HUSBAND
                        I’m gonna go out for a couple cigs.  
                        Pretend I was never here.  Honey, 
                        throw in a “DFK”.

           Jasper looks to Alexis, confused.

                                 ALEXIS
                        Deep French Kiss.
                                 JASPER
                        You know what?  Keep the money, we’ll 
                        reschedule...I had a great time.

           Jasper shakes their hands, can’t get out fast enough, and we...

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - 6:00 AM

           The ALARM CLOCK BEEPS.  Hazy, Jasper puts the LIGHT THERAPY BOX 
           on his chest.  Blinding U.V. RAYS SHINE in his face.

           INT. JASPER’S CLOSET - MORNING

           Jasper stares at six identical GRAY HOODIES.  He can’t choose.  

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           CU the GRAPE NUTS, sulking in a bowl.  Jasper takes out the milk, 
           it’s empty.  He pours tap water on top of the cereal.

           EXT. STREET - THURSDAY 

           A rare, perfect sunny day.  Jasper grimaces.  He steps into the 
           crosswalk, just as -- A bevy of CYCLISTS FLY BY JASPER.  They are 
           overjoyed to be alive on a beautiful morning.  A sea of spandex 
           shorts on bikes.

                                 JASPER
                        What are you guys so smiley about? 
                        It’s just gonna rain again tomorrow!

           The BIKES KEEP BUZZING BY JASPER.  He is CAUGHT in THEIR SWARM.

           EXT. THE STEEL BRIDGE - DAY

           Jasper walks across the Bridge into Downtown Portland.  

                                 JASPER’S VOICE
                        “Dear 20 year-old Jasper...” 

           INT. POWELL’S CITY OF BOOKS - DOWNTOWN - DAY

           More than a million books fill a full city block.  Jasper sits at 
           a table, staring at his OPENING LINE.  He adds one more line: 

                                 JASPER’S VOICE
                        “There is no cure for the Portland 
                        Condition...”
           Satisfied, Jasper stuffs it into an envelope, addresses it to: 

                             JASPER AYLES
                             REED COLLEGE - EAST DORMS
                             PORTLAND, OR  97202

           On his way out, he hands a JOHN UPDIKE novel to GWEN MINER, 
           23, behind the counter.  A hipster who’d kill you if you 
           called her a hipster, Gwen wears a tight “Sailor Moon” t-
           shirt, a patched-up cardigan and tortoise shell glasses.

                                 GWEN
                        What’d you think?

                                 JASPER
                        Updike’s all over the place.  I mean, 
                        pick a POV.  And Middle-aged WASP’s 
                        boning?  Not for me.

           She hands him an anthology of CHEKHOV SHORT STORIES.

                                 GWEN
                        Sorry they weren’t stuck in a dreary 
                        Chekhov malaise.  “Ooh, we’re poor, 
                        we’re Russian, we won’t shut the fuck 
                        up about our Cherry Orchard.”

                                 JASPER
                        Dreary?  More like hilarious and 
                        realistic.

                                 GWEN
                        Depressing, man.

                                 JASPER
                        This book club isn’t working for me.

                                 GWEN
                        Is it really a book club with just 
                        the two of us?

                                 JASPER
                        If a guy dies in an avalanche and   
                        no one’s on the mountain to hear him 
                        scream, did he make a sound?

           She can’t help but laugh.  A beat.

                                 GWEN
                        I don’t like your hair like that.  
                        It’s too bushy.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t like...your hair.
                                 GWEN
                        Good one.  
                             (holds up flyer)
                        Portland’s 160th b-day.  Clark Gable 
                        marathon at “Flicks on the Bricks.”  
                        Me, Reg and Kiki are going.  You in?

                                 JASPER
                        Thanks, but I’ll wait for the 200th 
                        birthday.

           Jasper pulls a beaten-up CLASSIC out of his satchel, hands it to 
           her.  She gives him a NOVEL in return.

                                 GWEN
                        I sent my short story out.

                                 JASPER
                        The one about the zebras?  I loved 
                        that.

                                 GWEN
                        Fingers crossed.  Hear another  
                        Barnes & Noble closed?

                                 JASPER
                        Serves’em right.  Book bullies.  I 
                        gotta run, Rabbit.

                                 GWEN
                        Run. 

           EXT. POWELL’S BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Jasper exits Powell’s, where a group of young Portlanders smoke.  
           A GIRL stands under a UMBRELLA shaped like a LADYBUG.

                                 JASPER
                        Bum a light?

           Jasper borrows a lighter.  He holds up the ENVELOPE, lights it on 
           fire, then tosses it into the gutter and watches it burn.  Just 
           as, the RAIN PICKS UP and dampens his bonfire. 

                                 JASPER
                        Can I borrow your ladybug?

           Jasper takes her ladybug umbrella, holds it over the smoldering 
           envelope, makes sure the PAPER BURNS.  The kids watch curiously.
           EXT. PARK - DOWNTOWN PORTLAND - DAY

           Jasper drinks from a Stumptown cup with “Jack” on it.  He sits on 
           a bench, lost in thought, watching KIDS play on a jungle gym.

           CU ON ONE BOY.  With tousled, curly hair.

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           THE SCREEN BECOMES GRAINY...

           CLOSE ON:  5 YEAR-OLD JASPER, wearing little boy shorts.

           REVERSE ANGLE:  At the end of a long hallway is a bedroom.  
           Bright light from the room casts a glow in the corridor.  Jasper 
           walks slowly toward the bedroom.  He is bathed in the light.

           We see what Jasper sees... MARY AYLES, 30, pale and sickly, 
           writhes on the bed in pain.

           AUNT ROSE, 28, tends to Mary.  She comes over to Jasper.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                             (kisses his head)
                        You can go in, honey.

           Jasper goes to his mother’s side.  Drenched in a feverish sweat, 
           she reaches out for his hand, just as the Rain picks up outside.    
           Jasper looks out at the Storm.

                                 JASPER
                        Maybe it’ll be sunny tomorrow, Mommy.

                                 MARY
                        It’s worse when it’s sunny, baby.  
                        You know it won’t last.

           The rain smacks against the window and we...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           THE PRESENT:  AS BEFORE

           Jasper snaps out of his memory, continues to watch the Kids play.  
           He finishes his coffee, gets up and leaves the park.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. THE BITTER END PUB - NIGHT

           Packed for happy hour.  Jasper enters, finds Trevor at the bar.  
           Jasper takes off his soaked hoodie.
                                 TREVOR
                        Will you please get an umbrella?

                                 JASPER
                        Why give’em the satisfaction?

           Jasper looks around the place.  PAN THE FACES in the BAR.  

                                 JASPER
                        Same old crowd.  Vancouver Bob... 
                        Mustache Sally...and then there’s...

           His eyes land on NICOLE PRICE, 26, the bartender, a radiant 
           breath of fresh air.  She is absolutely stunning.  

                                 JASPER
                        ...her.

           Jasper skips a breath as Nicole approaches him.  He scrambles to 
           think of something witty to say.  And then...

                                 NICOLE
                        What’s the haps?

           Jasper deflates.  Trevor busts up laughing, and Nicole instantly 
           feels bad for saying it.

                                 JASPER
                        He told you to say that, right?

                                 NICOLE
                        You think I’d say something dumb  
                        like that on my own? 

           Jasper can’t help but laugh.

                                 JASPER
                        You’re new.

                                 NICOLE
                        You’re new to me, too.  Let me  
                        guess, Beer flight?

                                 JASPER
                        You think I’d order something dumb 
                        like that?

           An instant attraction.

                                 JASPER
                        Bourbon.  Neat.

                                 NICOLE
                        Kentucky or Tennessee?
                                 JASPER
                        Is there really a difference?

                                 NICOLE
                        People pretend there is.

                                 JASPER
                        Those are the same people who are 
                        full of empty promises.

                                 NICOLE
                             (intrigued)
                        I knew I liked you.

           CU JASPER:  He is riveted as Nicole fetches the Maker’s Mark, 
           pours two highballs and brings them both to him.

                                 NICOLE
                        Happy Hour’s 2-for-1. 

                                 JASPER
                        I’m only trying to have 1 1/2 drinks 
                        these days.

                                 NICOLE
                        Why?

                                 JASPER
                        They say three or more drinks makes 
                        you an alcoholic.  So, I decided, if 
                        I cut that in half --

                                 NICOLE
                        You’re fine with being half an 
                        alcoholic?

                                 JASPER
                        I propose a toast to my self control.

           He holds up his Bourbon.  She takes the second highball.  They 
           toast each other, then both take a drink.  

                                 JASPER
                        It’ll probably take me about 3 weeks, 
                        but I’m pretty sure I’m gonna get the 
                        balls to ask you out.  But knowing 
                        me, it might take longer, so... 

                                 NICOLE
                        Then let’s say tonight.  We’ll grab a 
                        drink & a half, see where it goes.
                                 JASPER
                             (somewhat surprised)
                        Wait, tonight?

                                 NICOLE
                        I get off at 10.  And don’t change, 
                        ‘cuz I can’t.

                                 JASPER
                        I would never.  I hate change.

           Nicole never takes her eyes off Jasper as she moves down the bar.

                                 TREVOR
                             (filled with envy)
                        These drinks are on you.

           OFF JASPER, watching Nicole in awe, we go to...

           INT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - NIGHT

           Jasper hurries in just as a SALESGIRL is about to lock the door.

                                 JASPER
                        Wait wait wait -- I need a shirt.    
                        A date shirt.

           5 MINUTES LATER:

           Now wearing a hideous shirt, Jasper checks himself in the mirror.  

           EXT. THE BITTER END PUB - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jasper is back in his HOODIE uniform, waiting on the street for 
           Nicole.  He checks the VOICEMAIL on his cell.

                                 AUNT ROSE (V.O.)
                        It’s Rose.  Mariners are up 2-1 in 
                        the third, ducks on the pond.  I’ll 
                        meet you at the ferry on Saturday.    

           Nicole exits the bar, surprises Jasper with a kiss on the cheek.

                                 NICOLE
                        Very cool you didn’t change.

                                 JASPER
                        Didn’t even occur to me.
           INT. DOUG FIR LOUNGE - NIGHT

           OPEN TIGHT on JASPER & NICOLE at a candle-lit table in a 1920’s 
           dance hall.  They drink cocktails and eat bar snacks.

                                 JASPER
                        One of my readers tipped me off to 
                        this place a while back.  It’s like 
                        “Miss America.”  Evening gown, 
                        swimsuit, talent.  We vote.    
                        Whoever wins goes to the Nationals, 
                        so please don’t take this lightly.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I take this civic-duty shit 
                        seriously.  I’m Canadian, though.  
                        Does my vote still count?

                                 JASPER
                             (horrified)
                        You’re Canadian?  We’re done here!

           Jasper storms out of the night club.  Nicole thinks it’s funny, 
           but after a long beat, realizes he might not return.

           Finally, Jasper returns, beaming.  Nicole dies laughing. 

                                 NICOLE
                        You really sold that!

                                 JASPER
                        Where in Canada are you from?

                                 NICOLE
                        Toronto.  Actually, just outside.  
                        Kitchener.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  A BANNER reads “MISS OREGON DRAG QUEEN”.  

           On STAGE, an EMCEE welcomes 20 DRAG QUEENS in evening gowns.  
           They wear sashes with Oregon city names on them.  Heavily made 
           up, some of these guys aren’t half bad.

           The CROWD APPLAUDS wildly, the loudest of whom is Nicole.  

           INT. DOUG FIR LOUNGE - LATER IN THE NIGHT

           “MISS CORVALLIS” twirls a baton in a leotard.   

           ON NICOLE & JASPER:  Shot glasses and beers litter the table.  
           They have a great time.  Nicole lights up a cigarette.  
                                 NICOLE
                        I only smoke when I drink.  
                        And...when I don’t drink.

           Jasper watches Nicole.  She catches him staring.  Her smile  
           makes his heart pound.  It’s a charged moment.  

                                 NICOLE
                        My father goes to hookers.

           Jasper almost spits his drink out.

                                 NICOLE
                        That’s why my parents got divorced.
                             (smiles)
                        That, and all the affairs he had.

                                 JASPER
                        Your mom’s a bit of a stickler, huh? 

                                 NICOLE
                             (laughs)
                        I know, right?

                                 JASPER
                        Chekhov went to brothels.  He had 
                        major intimacy issues.

                                 NICOLE
                        Why would you know that?

                                 JASPER
                        I started a PHD dissertation on his 
                        works.  Never finished.  

                                 NICOLE
                        Why not?

                                 JASPER
                        I got...stuck.

                                 EMCEE (V.O.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I give you,  
                        the swimsuit competition.

                                 NICOLE
                        What do they do, tuck it, or just  
                        hang loose?

           Her eyes widen as she finds out...
           EXT. THE PEARL DISTRICT - PORTLAND - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Both buzzed, Jasper and Nicole walk through the hip, artsy area 
           filled with galleries and boutiques.  The So-Ho of Portland.    

                                 NICOLE
                        Ok, family time, go!  Brothers and 
                        sisters?

                                 JASPER
                        No, none.  You? 

                                 NICOLE
                        Just me, I’m an “only,” too.  How 
                        about your parents?

                                 JASPER
                        My dad died during childbirth.

                                 NICOLE
                        Seriously?

                                 JASPER
                        No, he took off way before that.

                                 NICOLE
                        And your mom?

                                 JASPER
                        Actually dead.  When I was 5, she  
                        got cancer. 

           Nicole stops, she feels bad for bringing it up.

                                 NICOLE
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 JASPER
                        I thought I could save her.  I was a 
                        stupid little kid.  

                                 NICOLE
                        You were only 5.

                                 JASPER
                        My Aunt Rose, her sister, raised me.  
                        I guess I was lucky.

                                 NICOLE
                        That’s a great way to look at it.

                                 JASPER
                        She was 30, my mother.  Now, I’m 30.
                                 NICOLE
                        Is that weird for you?

                                 JASPER
                        My therapist keeps telling me it   
                        is.  He calls it the “Death Age.”    
                        Little dramatic, no?

           Nicole takes Jasper’s hand and they keep walking.  She stops in 
           front of a tiny GALLERY filled with eclectic PHOTOGRAPHY.  

                                 NICOLE
                        What do you think of these pictures?

           Jasper studies the strange photographs.  Post-modern with DOUBLE 
           and TRIPLE-EXPOSED NEGATIVES that are HAND COLORED.  

                                 JASPER
                        There’s so much happening...I can’t 
                        decide where to start hating them.

                                 NICOLE
                        I took them all.

                                 JASPER
                        Did I say hate?  I meant love.  I 
                        love them!

                                 NICOLE
                             (laughs)
                        Tell me what you really think.  

           Jasper gives the photography a second look.

                                 JASPER
                        If I stare at it long enough the 
                        chaos turns into calm.

                                 NICOLE
                        Now you’re just trying to get me    
                        in bed.

                                 JASPER
                        I wish I was that smooth.

                                 NICOLE
                        You’re doing better than you think.

           His pulse quickens.

                                 NICOLE 
                        My work’s finally in a gallery, and 
                        no one comes to see it.  Story of    
                        my life.  
                                 JASPER
                        You’re still kind of famous.  

           They continue walking - WE PULL UP HIGH ABOVE THEM:  Jasper    
           and Nicole are so engrossed in each other, they don’t notice 
           NIGHT FLOOD INTO MORNING.

           EXT. THE STEEL BRIDGE - DAWN

           Jasper and Nicole stand on the bridge, drinking from a bottle   
           of wine.  Jasper moves in closer.  Nicole ducks away at the   
           last second, and she CLIMBS UP on the railing of the bridge.

                                 JASPER
                        Um...what are you doing?!

           Nicole spins around to face Jasper.  She wraps her feet around 
           the bars for support, then lets herself HANG OFF THE RAILING.

                                 JASPER
                        This is a really bad idea.

           NICOLE’S POV -- Of the Willamette River riling below.

                                 NICOLE
                        You have to see the world this way.  
                        It’s all just water under the bridge.

           After a long beat, Jasper gingerly climbs up on the railing.  He 
           takes a deep breath, and inhales some confidence.  He wraps his 
           feet around the bars, and lets himself HANG OFF THE RAILING.  

           CU JASPER:  UPSIDE DOWN.  For a moment, everything makes sense.  

                                 JASPER
                        Don’t let me fall in love with you.

                                 NICOLE
                        I can’t promise anything.

           Then, Nicole and Jasper come together for a fantastic kiss.   
           HOLD ON THEM:  SUSPENDED IN MID-AIR 

           The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY.  WE PULL BACK FURTHER & FURTHER:       
           The two dangling figures become blurry in the distance.  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Jasper and Nicole make love.  They aren’t awkward or shy, it’s 
           like they’ve known each other forever.  Their bodies move in 
           perfect rhythm.  It’s emotional, it’s hot, it’s loud, finally 
           they both climax at the same time.  
           They hold each other tightly.

                                 NICOLE
                             (catches her breath)
                        That’s never happened.

                                 JASPER
                        Me neither.  I’ve never...at the  
                        same time with someone.  

                                 NICOLE
                        No, I mean, I’ve never had an   
                        orgasm during sex before.  

           Jasper feels pretty amazing right now.  He blissfully rolls   
           over on his back.  Nicole puts her head on his chest.

           ANGLE BIRDCAGE - BY THE WINDOW.

                                 NICOLE
                        What’s with the cage?

                                 JASPER
                        I had a bird.  Tony.  He went out to 
                        do something.  I leave the window 
                        open in case he comes back.

                                 NICOLE
                        Can we maybe, close it a little?

           Jasper gets up.  Self conscious, he wraps the blanket around 
           himself and closes the window.

           ON NICOLE.  A naked vision, she takes his breath away.  Ours too.  
           Jasper slides in next to her, they’re back in each other’s arms. 

                                 NICOLE
                        I feel safe with you.

           Nicole closes her eyes and pulls in closer to an elated Jasper.

           EXT. JASPER’S LOFT - NIGHT

           THROUGH THE WINDOW:  WE SEE Jasper and Nicole having uninhibited 
           sex.  They can’t get enough of each other.

           EXT. PARK - DOWNTOWN PORTLAND - MORNING

           Jasper and Nicole sit on his bench, watching the KIDS play.  
                                 JASPER
                        I love watching them.  They should 
                        have spotters.  Like in the Olympics.  
                        People who stand there to keep the 
                        kids from cracking their heads open.

           She watches him watch the Kids play, taken by his tenderness.

                                 JASPER
                        I know, kind of a poor man’s 
                        Salinger, right?

                                 NICOLE
                             (smiles at this)
                        I was adopted by a family a month 
                        after they lost a baby.  Also a girl.  
                        I was a replacement child.

                                 JASPER
                        That’s a lot of pressure.

                                 NICOLE
                        To be a good person, to live for two 
                        people, yeah, it is.  
                             (beat)
                        When I can afford her, my therapist 
                        tells me I suffered trauma at 3 hours 
                        old, because my real mother never 
                        held me.  Abandoned, she says.  I 
                        don’t know...maybe.

           They go back to watching the children.  

                                 JASPER
                        I’d make the spotters wear uniforms 
                        and color coordinate.  Each color 
                        would be responsible for one kid.

                                                           WE FLASH TO:

           THE KIDS IN THE PARK.  Every CHILD wears a different COLORED 
           UNIFORM...RED, YELLOW, WHITE, BLUE...

           Several ADULTS spot for them.  Each wears a DIFFERENT COLOR.

           CLOSE ON ONE KID:  With tousled, curly hair, he’s dressed all in 
           GREEN.  He climbs the jungle gym.  He goes higher and higher.  He 
           reaches the top and celebrates, safe and out of harms way.

           The Kid’s SPOTTER, also in GREEN, watches, at the ready...

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:
           JASPER & NICOLE:  AS BEFORE

           She is moved by his description.  They share a look.

                                 JASPER
                        It’s too late.

                                 NICOLE
                        For what?

                                 JASPER
                        I’m already in love with you.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. JASPER’S STREET - EVENING

           Jasper walks down the street.  It’s actually more of a swagger.  
           He smiles from ear to ear.  Life is good.  Finally.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

           A UPS BOX is in the doorway.  Jasper struggles with the box.  At 
           a row of mailboxes, Jasper gathers his mail.  It drops out of  
           his hand, scatters across the floor.  Jasper picks it all up.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Jasper is full of energy as he hammers a nail into the wall.   
           The UPS BOX is at his feet.  He has nails in his mouth as he 
           talks on the phone.  MUSIC PLAYS in B.G.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m sorry I wasn’t at the ferry, 
                        Rose.  I know, I got caught up...
                             (he pauses)
                        ...a girl.  Maybe five-foot-six, 
                        that’s a weird question.  

           Jasper holds a leveler and a tape measure.  He makes sure the 
           nails are lined up correctly.

                                 JASPER
                        Yeah, it is great, but don’t jinx it.  
                        Next weekend might work, I’ll let you 
                        know.  Ok, love you.  Bye.

           He turns up the MUSIC - CUE OTIS REDDING’s “HAPPY SONG”.  

           Jasper is euphoric.  He sifts through the pile of mail, comes to:

           AN ENVELOPE.  It’s addressed to him, at his CURRENT RESIDENCE.   
           He opens the envelope -- It’s a letter written on specialty 
           stationery.  “JASPER AYLES” is embossed on the LETTERHEAD. 

           CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON JASPER, and we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - EVENING

           Kevin spins around and around in his barber chair.

                                 KEVIN
                        What was I supposed to tell myself  
                        at 7?  “Don’t let that counselor  
                        touch your dick at Camp Wildwood?”

           Roland tries not to react to this.

                                 ANDREA
                        I thought it was really therapeutic.  
                        I wrote a lot of helpful, intimate 
                        things.  I told the truth.

                                 ROLAND
                        Jasper, what about you?  Do you want 
                        to share your experience?

           WE COME TO JASPER - He is frozen.

                                 ROLAND
                        Jasper?

           A long beat, then Jasper holds up THE LETTER.

                                 JASPER
                        Did...anyone else get a letter back?

                                 ROLAND
                        You sent it and it got returned?

                                 JASPER
                        No, I got a letter from myself at 40.  

                                 ROLAND
                             (humors him)
                        Why don’t you share what you wrote  
                        to the group?

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t write it.  But it came on 
                        stationery with my letterhead. 
                             (struggles)
                        It’s a suicide letter.
                                 KEVIN
                        Nice.  Read it to us!

                                 JASPER
                        If someone here is fucking with me...

                                 ROLAND
                        It’s ok, Jasper.  You can read it.

           Jasper steadies himself, then starts to read out loud.

                                 JASPER
                        “Dear 30 year-old Jasper.  I’ve   
                        just turned 40 and I’m going to    
                        kill myself.”

           Jasper looks around the room.  EVERYONE IS RAPT.

                                 ROLAND
                        Maybe you misunderstood the exercise.  
                        I asked you to write a letter to 
                        yourself ten years ago.

                                 JASPER
                        I did.  Then I burned it in a gutter. 
                        This came in the mail.

                                 KEVIN
                        Get back to it, you were about to 
                        kill yourself, dude.

                                 JASPER
                             (back to letter)
                        “There’s so many things that you, 
                        that we, have done wrong.  Enough 
                        regrets to fill a book.  Or, a 
                        pretentious dissertation, which 
                        you’ll never finish.  And if you did, 
                        it would be amateurish and horribly 
                        received.”  

           INSERT - THE LETTER.  Written in rambling cursive.

                                 JASPER
                        “I’d tell you to leave Portland.   
                        But that’ll never happen.  I’d tell 
                        you to quit your job, but don’t 
                        worry, they fold within a year.”
                             (continues reading)
                        “There is no cure for the Portland 
                        Condition.  And your Group disbands 
                        when Roland dies suddenly.”

           Jasper looks up at Roland, who is a bit taken aback.
                                 JASPER
                        “Oh, and Mount St. Helens, she’s not 
                        done erupting.  Grab your popcorn, 
                        it’s a show worth seeing.”

           Jasper struggles to read a sentence that is smeared.

                                 JASPER
                        “Just for shits and giggles...here 
                        are the lottery numbers from 
                        yesterday’s paper, November 5, 2021.”
                             (to the Group)
                        Then there are six numbers.

           Jasper takes a deep breath, keeps reading.  

                                 JASPER
                        “DON’T MARRY HANNAH.  She’s a lying, 
                        pathetic drunk.  You can’t save her, 
                        just like you couldn’t save Mary.  
                        Stop being a fucking life raft.  

                                 BRAD
                        Wait, who’s Hannah?

                                 JASPER
                        No idea.

           Jasper goes back to the letter.

                                 JASPER
                        “And speaking of Mary, what kind of 
                        mother does that?  To lie to a child 
                        for that long...that kind of 
                        betrayal?  She should burn in Hell.”
                             (to Group)
                        What lie?  That’s just...so harsh.

           Jasper stops cold on the last sentence.

                                 JASPER
                        “I have a gun in my mouth right now.  
                        Chekhov was right.  ‘When you show   
                        a gun, you have to fire it.’”

           The rest of the letter is illegible.

                                 JASPER
                        This looks like a scotch stain.  Or 
                        blood.  I can’t read this part here.  
                        The rest is just jibberish.

           Jasper looks to Roland.  Dead silence all around.  
                                 ROLAND
                        First of all, very well written.

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t write this!  But it’s in my 
                        handwriting.  Look, I signed it.
                        This is my “J”!

                                 ROLAND
                        You’re taking this a little too far.

                                 JASPER
                        Has anyone ever seen a $2 dollar 
                        stamp?

           INSERT - A FIRST CLASS $2 DOLLAR US STAMP.  With a hologram and 
           multiple seals, it is futuristic and dead real. 

           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Now it’s just Jasper and Roland in the barber shop.

                                 JASPER
                        Did you write this to me?  Maybe as  
                        a motivational tool?

                                 ROLAND
                        How does my death motivate you?

           The wheels are spinning in Jasper’s head.

                                 ROLAND
                        You had a few drinks, took the Ambien 
                        and sent the letter to yourself.

                                 JASPER
                        I wrote the letter I was supposed to 
                        write as a fucking joke, and 
                        addressed it to myself at 20!  To my 
                        old college address.  And instead of 
                        sending it, I burned it.

                                 ROLAND
                        Jasper, you don’t seriously think you 
                        got a letter from the future, do you?
                        You wrote the letter in your sleep.

                                 JASPER
                        In my sleep?  Honestly Roland, go 
                        fuck yourself.
                                 ROLAND
                        I have patients on Ambien who write 
                        crazy emails, drive to “7-11” and 
                        order slurpees.  I have a man who 
                        painted his front door black and   
                        had no memory of it.

                                 JASPER
                        Fascinating, really, it is.  Except  
                        I haven’t taken Ambien for months.  

           Roland is perplexed, and a little unsettled.

                                 ROLAND
                        Just out of curiosity...did it say 
                        how I died?

                                 JASPER
                        No, it didn’t.  
                             (exhales loudly)
                        Should I tell Nicole about this?

                                 ROLAND
                        Who’s Nicole?

                                 JASPER
                             (braces himself)
                        I’m in love.

                                 ROLAND
                             (exhales)
                        Seriously, Jasper?  

                                 JASPER
                        I am!

                                 ROLAND
                        How damaged is she?  I mean, on a 
                        scale of “well adjusted” to “so 
                        fucked up, Jasper’s head-over-heels.”

                                 JASPER
                        She’s not fucked up at all.

                                 ROLAND
                        If that was the case, you wouldn’t  
                        be interested.  
                             (baiting him)
                        And what about the sex?  

                                 JASPER
                        I can’t even explain how incredible.
                                 ROLAND
                        Let me guess, the best you’ve ever 
                        had, right?

                                 JASPER
                        Are you mocking me?

                                 ROLAND
                        I’m just glad you found the Perfect 
                        Storm.

                                 JASPER
                        Yep, that’s mocking me!

           Jasper grabs his stuff and storms out of the Barber Shop.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAYS LATER

           Jasper hasn’t slept for days, and it shows.  He’s uncomfortable 
           in his own skin.

           INT. THE BITTER END PUB - EVENING

           Jasper enters the bar in a fog.  Nicole sets up.  She is happy  
           to see him, but doesn’t want to give too much away.

                                 NICOLE 
                        Did you not call because I was too 
                        easy, too quick?  I know there 
                        weren’t that many costume changes, 
                        but you didn’t let me go home.

           Even in his addled state, Jasper sees humor in this.

                                 JASPER
                        I would have called, I should have.  
                        I got blind-sided...with work.

                                 NICOLE
                        Get this -- someone bought all my 
                        pictures.  I just got a check for 
                        $6,500 bucks.  We need to celebrate!

           Jasper tries to put up a good face.

                                 JASPER
                        A celebration?  Um, yeah...

                                 NICOLE
                        I heard about a Clark Gable marathon 
                        tomorrow night.  Did you know he was 
                        a Portland native?
                                 JASPER
                        I did.

                                 NICOLE
                        “Flicks on the Bricks.”  Let’s do a 
                        picnic, I’ll set it up.  You could 
                        meet me there.

           Jasper numbly nods.  She leans over the bar and gives him a kiss.

                                 NICOLE
                        Promise you’ll call me later.

                                 JASPER
                        I promise.

           Nicole comes out from behind the bar.  Another quick kiss turns 
           into more.  He forgets everything, kisses her with all he’s got.

                                 NICOLE
                        Never stop kissing me.

           The feeling is mutual.  

                                 NICOLE
                        We don’t open for another 8 minutes.

           She grabs Jasper by the belt and pulls him into the bathroom.  

           CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM...

           INT. BATHROOM - THE BITTER END PUB - CONTINUOUS

           It’s hot & heavy.  He puts her up on the sink, they go at each 
           other.  The bathroom door CLOSES ON THE CAMERA.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. REED COLLEGE - LABORATORY - DAY

           Jasper is in a lab with BERT, 30, a ghostly hobbit who looks like 
           he’s never seen the Sun.  

           The LETTER is beamed up on an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR.

                                 BERT
                        So what do you hear from old        
                        AJ Brass?

                                 JASPER
                        Not much.  I think he lives in 
                        Houston.
                                 BERT
                        What about Jimmy Park?

                                 JASPER
                        Probably still in finance, I don’t 
                        know.

                                 BERT
                             (high-fives Jasper)
                        Right on!  How ‘bout Zambetti?

                                 JASPER
                        Bert, I’d love to catch up, but can 
                        we get to the letter?

                                 BERT
                        Who’s this Hannah?  

                                 JASPER
                        Bert --

                                 BERT
                        Ok, handwriting analysis is almost as 
                        exact a science as fingerprinting.

                                 JASPER
                        That’s my “J”.

                                 BERT
                        Yeah, it’s your “J”.  You wrote this.
                        I put the letter through an elemental 
                        dispersive spectro-copy.

           Jasper is dizzy as Bert holds up the LETTER.

                                 BERT
                        This paper is ten years old.

                                 JASPER
                        It was made in 2001?

                                 BERT
                        I didn’t say that.  All I’m saying 
                        is, the paper has aged ten years.

                                 JASPER
                        Then it really is from the future?

                                 BERT
                        I didn’t say that either.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ve never had my own stationery.  
                        Not now, not ten years ago.  
           Bert holds up the ENVELOPE.  CU STAMP.

                                 BERT
                        Whoever did this work...it’s 
                        flawless.  From the seals, the silk 
                        threads, to the watermarks.  Look at 
                        this hologram, that’s crazy.  My only 
                        question, why make a $2 dollar stamp 
                        when you can’t use it?

                                 JASPER
                             (exasperated)
                        Someone can use it.  It was used!

           EXT. JASPER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 

           Jasper intercepts his MAIL CARRIER, a gaunt woman with a    
           Breath-Right on her nose.  He shows her the ENVELOPE.

                                 JASPER
                        Do you remember delivering this?

                                 MAIL CARRIER
                        Of course.

                                 JASPER
                        You do?

                                 MAIL CARRIER
                        I remember every envelope I’ve ever 
                        delivered.  For the past 15 years.  
                        We’re talkin’ thirty, forty thousand 
                        envelopes a year.  That’s around half 
                        a million envelopes, so, yeah...how 
                        could I forget delivering that 
                        incredibly ordinary one?

           Jasper now feels stupid for asking.

                                 JASPER
                        I was just hoping...you remembered 
                        something about it.

                                 MAIL CARRIER
                        Kid, I don’t remember the shoes    
                        I’m wearing right now.

           Jasper puts the envelope in her face.

                                 JASPER
                        Ever see something like this?

           The Mail Carrier takes a closer look, and we MATCH CUT TO...
           INT. POST OFFICE - DAY 

           THE STAMP - MAGNIFIED IN SIZE

           Through the MONOCLE of a POSTAL SUPERVISOR.  

           Jasper wants answers.  So does the Postal Supervisor.  The Mail 
           Carrier stands there, arms folded, angry at Jasper.

                                 POSTAL SUPERVISOR
                        Sir, where did you get this stamp?

                                 JASPER
                        I told you, in the mail.  

                                 POSTAL SUPERVIOR
                        From whom?

                                 JASPER
                        Technically from me, but --

                                 POSTAL SUPERVISOR
                        Sir, as an employee of the Federal 
                        Government, the US Postal Service, 
                        and a civil servant of Oregon, I’m 
                        going to ask you one more time.  
                        Where did you get this stamp?

                                 JASPER
                             (indignant)
                        I made it in my stamp printing 
                        machine that I keep in my bath tub.  
                        I love to counterfeit stamps for fun 
                        and mail shit to myself.

                                 POSTAL SUPERVISOR
                        I’ll need that envelope.

           Jasper surreptitiously takes the letter out, hands the ENVELOPE 
           to the Postal Supervisor and exits the Post Office.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND - DAY

           Out of sorts, Jasper hurries down the street.  At a crosswalk, he 
           pushes the button for the “Walk” sign.  He is oblivious to the 
           fact that he’s in front of Powell’s City of Books.   

           INT. POWELL’S CITY OF BOOKS - SAME TIME

           Gwen watches Jasper through the window.  The street light turns 
           to “Walk,” Jasper is so lost he doesn’t even notice.  
           INT. POWELL’S CITY OF BOOKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Gwen comes out onto the street.  

                                 GWEN
                        Yo, space cowboy?

           Jasper looks up, startled.

                                 GWEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 JASPER
                        I’m...just a little frazzled.

                                 GWEN
                        I got a lot goin’ on too, guy.  
                        Doesn’t mean I can’t stop in and   
                        say hey to a buddy.

           Jasper considers spilling his guts, then decides against it.

                                 JASPER
                        I...like your hair today.

           Gwen just stares at him.  His hair is all over the place, she 
           doesn’t return the compliment.  

           A beat, and they go their separate ways.

           SINT. JASPER’S APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY 

           Jasper huffs and puffs up the stairs.  He sees his front door is 
           ajar.  He cautiously opens it to find:

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           The apartment has been ransacked.  Jasper’s belongings are 
           everywhere.  An FBI AGENT sits on the couch, watching TV.  

                                 JASPER
                        What the fuck...?

                                 FBI AGENT 
                        Looks like your bird got out.

           He flashes an FBI BADGE.  Alarms go off in Jasper’s brain.

           Then, the Agent holds up the ENVELOPE with the $2 DOLLAR STAMP.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Who are you with?
                                 JASPER
                        I’m not with anybody.  

                                 FBI AGENT
                        I don’t get it.  If you were gonna 
                        counterfeit stamps, why wouldn’t you 
                        make a 44 cent?  You make a stamp 
                        that doesn’t exist?

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t make the stamp!  

           The Agent looks at all of Nicole’s BLACK & WHITES on the walls.  
           (Jasper was the one who bought all her art).

                                 FBI AGENT
                        You some kind of artist?

                                 JASPER
                        No.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        I get it.  Some faggot art school 
                        grad.  That don’t pay the bills.

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t go to art school.  I’m not    
                        a counterfeiter.  This is a 
                        misunderstanding.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        We know it’s your handwriting.    
                        That was confirmed by your friend 
                        Bertie, right?

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t write it!

                                 FBI AGENT
                        From faggot art school to prison.  
                        Easy transition, ‘cuz somebody’s 
                        gonna get plain butt-fucked.

                                 JASPER
                             (full of panic)
                        Nobody’s getting butt-fucked!  Some 
                        people like it, I have nothing 
                        against the “butt-fuckers,” but I’m --

                                 FBI AGENT
                        We’ll lean on your mother if we   
                        have to.
                                 JASPER
                             (confused)
                        Rose?

           The FBI Agent checks his notes.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Mary.

                                 JASPER
                             (long beat)
                        Mary’s been dead 25 years.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Not if your mother is Mary Whitehead.  
                        Alive and well in Boise, Idaho.
                        8916 Braxton Avenue.

           Jasper tries to comprehend what is being said.

                                 JASPER
                        Mary Whitehead?

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Maiden name’s Ayles.  Social Security 
                        number 209-83-4636.

           Jasper is struck dumb.  Then, he overloads.

                                 JASPER
                             (loses it)
                        All this, what everyone’s doing to 
                        me...It’s not ok!

           The Agent takes a .45 COLT REVOLVER out of Jasper’s desk.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        What’s this all about?

                                 JASPER
                        My Aunt got it for me.  For 
                        protection, but I’d never use it.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Don’t fuck with the mail again.

           The FBI Agent hands the Gun to Jasper and walks out the door. 
           Terrified of the gun, Jasper gingerly puts it back in his desk. 
           He surveys the mess in his apartment.  

           ECU:  A little STUFFED LION is on the floor.  

           It’s the only thing Jasper picks up and puts back on the shelf. 
           Jasper checks his watch, realizes how late he is.
           INT. JASPER’S NISSAN - EVENING

           About to have a breakdown, Jasper weaves in and out of traffic.  
           His knuckles are white from gripping the wheel.

           He makes a phone call on his cell.  He gets VOICEMAIL. 

                                 AUNT ROSE (V.O.)
                        It’s Rose.  Leave me a message.

           Jasper HANGS UP on ROSE’s VOICEMAIL, almost side-swipes a parked 
           car.  He guns the Nissan through downtown Portland.

           Scattered, Jasper makes another CALL.  

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        City and state, please?

                                 JASPER
                        Boise, Idaho, do you have the   
                        number for a Mary Whitehead?

           A long, pregnant pause.

                                 OPERATOR
                        I’ll connect you.

                                 JASPER
                        NO NO NO!!!  I just wanted to see --

           The CALL IS ALREADY CONNECTED.  The PHONE IS RINGING...

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello?

           HOLD ON JASPER.  Filled with fear.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
                        Hello?...
                             (beat)
                        Hello?

           Finally, the WOMAN HANGS UP.

           Jasper is too rattled to make the left turn against a wall of 
           oncoming traffic.  CARS HONK.  The light changes - He is 
           paralyzed.  More HORNS.  The light changes again, and...

           Jasper GUNS IT and is BROAD-SIDED by an SUV.  He fish-tails,  
           then careens into the curb.  The AIRBAG EXPLODES in his face.
           EXT. STREET - PIONEER COURTHOUSE SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bruised and bleeding, covered in debris, Jasper gets out of his 
           mangled Nissan.  Woozy, he looks off into the Courthouse Square 
           to see CLARK GABLE’s FACE glowing 60-feet high on a MOVIE SCREEN.

           EXT. PIONEER COURTHOUSE SQUARE - NIGHT

           Thousands pack the Town Square, which has been transformed into 
           an outdoor movie theater.  “FLICKS ON THE BRICKS.”  

           Jasper finds Nicole on a picnic blanket on the outskirts of the 
           Square, watching “IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT.”  

           Nicole has already polished off a bottle of wine.  She’s loaded.

                                 NICOLE
                             (like a 30’s movie star)
                        Where you been hidin’ my whole   
                        life, Buster?

                                 JASPER
                        I...was in a car accident.

           Nicole sees the gash on his forehead and her demeanor changes.

                                 NICOLE
                        Oh my God, are you ok?

           Jasper sits down.  Nicole kisses him.

                                 NICOLE
                        You have dust in your hair.

           She dusts Jasper off, takes him into her arms.  He holds on for 
           dear life.

                                 NICOLE
                        All your buttons are screwy, baby.

           Nicole fixes the buttons on his gray sweater.  He shivers.  She 
           wraps her scarf around him, opens another bottle of wine.

                                 JASPER
                        If I told you lightning was gonna 
                        strike right there in two seconds.  
                        Would you move?

                                 NICOLE
                        Of course I would.  

           Jasper’s mind is racing.
                                 JASPER
                        Do you believe you can change your 
                        fate?

                                 NICOLE
                        Are you concussed?

           Jasper pours himself a glass of wine and downs it.  

                                 NICOLE
                        How about this for fate?  The day 
                        after I sell all my pictures, I get a 
                        call from the gallery.  They’re going 
                        out of business.  They were the ones 
                        sponsoring me, my Visa runs out in 27 
                        days.  I have to go back to Canada.

                                 JASPER
                             (tries to process this)
                        You’re leaving?

                                 NICOLE
                             (laughs ironically)
                        Unless you wanna marry me?

           Jasper’s eyes widen.  Nicole clinks his glass, downs her wine.

                                 JASPER
                        Do you have a middle name?

                                 NICOLE
                        Michelle.  

                                 JASPER
                        Nicole Michelle Price?

                                 NICOLE
                        Yeah, why? 

                                 JASPER
                        I’m sorry, I got this letter, 
                        and...it was bizarre, I can’t  
                        explain it.

                                 NICOLE
                        Who was it from?

                                 JASPER
                             (falters)
                        I don’t...know.

                                 NICOLE
                        What did it say?
           Jasper doesn’t even know where to begin.  

           After a beat, Nicole touches the gash on his head. 

                                 NICOLE
                        You’re acting strange...but you   
                        look so sweet.  

           She starts to kiss Jasper’s neck. 

                                 NICOLE
                             (whispers in his ear)
                        I need you.

           She keeps kissing him. 

           CU JASPER:  He looks around, self conscious.  Nobody notices.  

           They start to kiss passionately.  Jasper pushes Nicole back on 
           the blanket, gets on top of her.

                                 NICOLE
                        Hold me down.

           He takes pause.  

                                 NICOLE
                        Like this.

           Nicole clasps his hands around her wrists.  He pushes her to the 
           ground.  She likes it.  Now, he’s charged up.  Filled with 
           reckless abandon, they have sex in public.  

           No one pays them any attention, everyone watches CLARK GABLE and 
           CLAUDETTE COLBERT banter on the screen.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jasper helps a staggering drunk Nicole into the apartment.  She 
           can barely walk.  He turns on the lights.  Nicole sees all her 
           PHOTOGRAPHS hanging on his wall.

           She tries to focus.  Jasper has a smug sense of satisfaction.

                                 JASPER
                        They grew on me.

                                 NICOLE
                             (overcome with emotion)
                        That’s the nicest...no one’s ever 
                        done anything like that for me.
                                 JASPER
                        Don’t they look great on the wall?

           Then, Nicole changes on a dime.

                                 NICOLE
                        Am I some kind of charity case to 
                        you?

                                 JASPER
                        No, I --

                                 NICOLE
                        I am not a fucking charity case!

                                 JASPER
                        I never thought you were.

                                 NICOLE
                        I’m gonna be sick.

           Nicole pushes Jasper out of her way as she runs to the bathroom.  
           Jasper backs into the wall - knocking one of the PHOTOGRAPHS to 
           the floor.  The GLASS SHATTERS.

           Jasper bends down to pick up the pieces.

           INSERT PHOTO - Signed by “HANNAH PRICE”.

           ON JASPER’S FACE:  His eyes light up with abject fear.

           FLASH TO ECU of EVERY PICTURE.  They’re all signed by “HANNAH”.  
           It’s like the photos are screaming at him.

           INT. JASPER’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Nicole hugs the toilet.  Jasper enters with trepidation.  He sits 
           on the edge of the bathtub.  She is a crying, self-pitying mess.

                                 NICOLE
                        Please take care of me.

           These words dig into Jasper’s soul.  His ultimate weakness. 

                                 NICOLE
                        I love you.

           He wants to say it back, but the words don’t come.

                                 NICOLE
                        I do.  I’m in love with you.
           Jasper is powerless to stop feeling the way he feels.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I don’t deserve you.

           All he can do is hold her as she drunkenly sobs.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jasper wakes up, alone in bed.

           INT. JASPER’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Jasper enters the kitchen to find Nicole making breakfast.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I’m a shitty cook, but I feel 
                        terrible about last night.  
                             (then)
                        I can’t believe you bought my 
                        pictures.  

           Nicole kisses Jasper’s cheek.  He is filled with dread.

                                 JASPER
                        Why do all your photos say “Hannah”?

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s kind of my nom de plume, I use 
                        it for my art.  It’s fun to be 
                        someone else.  

           Jasper can’t believe what he’s hearing.

                                 NICOLE
                        I love palindromes.  Perfect 
                        symmetry, an “H” to get things 
                        started, an “H” to finish the story.   

                                 JASPER
                             (dazed)
                        Sometimes I go by Jack.

                                 NICOLE
                        Who doesn’t like a Jack?

           Just as, the SMOKE ALARM GOES OFF.

                                 NICOLE
                        That would be the toast.
           The toaster is billowing with smoke.  Nicole pulls the plug.   
           The ALARM keeps SOUNDING.  She jumps, swatting at the ALARM.

           Jasper grabs a broom and knocks it out of the ceiling, pulling 
           plaster down with it.  It SQUAWKS one more time, then stops.

           EXT. SEATTLE FERRY - DAY

           As the Ferry knifes through the fog, we FIND JASPER on the bow.  
           The SEATTLE SKYLINE is behind him.

           Jasper tries to escape by playing “Words with Friends”.  The  
           Game abruptly clicks off for an INCOMING PHONE CALL.

           INSERT RINGING PHONE - “WORK”.  Jasper presses IGNORE.

           INT. WILLAMETTE WEEK - SAME TIME

           Trevor sits at Jasper’s desk, leaves him a message.

                                 TREVOR
                        What the shit, man?  We’re running 
                        this issue without your column.     
                        If you’re not dead or moved to 
                        Tuscon, you better call me pronto.

           EXT. FERRY - SAME TIME

           BACK TO JASPER - On the bow of the ferry.

           INSERT iPHONE - “WORDS WITH FRIENDS”  

           Jasper compulsively scrolls to a game vs “AndersonPA.”  He   
           texts his opponent ... Jasper: “It’s your move.”

           After a beat, he texts angrily ... Jasper: “Make a word.”

           Jasper grows more and more impatient, like the world depends on 
           this guy making a word.  Finally... 

           AndersonPA:  “Having dinner with my family.  Can’t play now.”

           Jasper: “Get your priorities in order.”

           After another beat ... Jasper:  “Your fucking move!”

           EXT. BAINBRIDGE ISLAND, WASHINGTON - DAY

           A quaint island town, surrounded by Puget Sound.
           EXT. AUNT ROSE’S HOUSE - BAINBRIDGE ISLAND - DAY

           Jasper walks up the steps of an old colonial house.  The wind 
           hisses off the water, chilling him to the bone.  Jasper rings  
           the doorbell.  He waits, no answer.  

           He lifts a planter, finds the house key, and opens the door.

                                 JASPER
                             (calls out)
                        Rose?

           INT. AUNT ROSE’S HOUSE - BAINBRIDGE ISLAND - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper takes off his shoes, walks through the home.  

           We see PICTURES of Jasper as a BOY.  Jasper with his Aunt Rose at 
           the Seattle Space Needle.  Jasper’s high school graduation photo.  

           QUICK CUTS:

           -- Jasper opens a filing cabinet, pulls out stacks of papers.

           -- He pores over Rose’s long distance phone bills.  From his 
           satchel, he pulls out the Boise area code (208), looks for a 
           match on the phone bill.  No match.

           -- Jasper leafs through the drawers of Rose’s desk.  

           -- He goes through a pile of personal items on top of the desk.

           Jasper’s eyes land on something.  

           INSERT:  A burgundy BOX OF STATIONERY, with “JASPER AYLES” 
           stenciled on the letterhead.  

           THE PACKAGE IS SEALED.  

           It is the same stationery the letter was written on.  Jasper 
           turns over the box.  

           INSERT:  The STATIONERY BOX is copyrighted, ”2011”.

           INT. THE RUSTY SKUPPER BAR - BAINBRIDGE ISLAND - DAY

           Jasper finds ROSE AYLES, 50’s, a kind face that’s seen some 
           miles, with a klatch of LOCALS watching a Mariner game on tv.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        A-Rod’s an A-Hole if he doesn’t go 
                        into the Hall as a Mariner.
           All her comrades agree.  Rose looks up and sees Jasper.

                                 AUNT ROSE 
                        Jazzy, I didn’t know you were coming.

                                 JASPER
                        Can I talk to you outside?
                             (to Group)
                        Hey guys.

           The entire table greets Jasper with a chorus of “JAZZY”.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        It’s the eighth inning.  Here’s some 
                        quarters, go play the pop-a-shot.

                                 LOCAL
                        Your high score’s still up there.

           ANGLE POP-A-SHOT:  “JAZZY” 38,190 points

           Jasper walks out of the bar.

           EXT. RUSTY SKUPPER - DAY

           LATER:  Rose comes outside to find Jasper pacing on the gravel.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        We gave up two in the bottom of the 
                        ninth.  Shitty road trip.

           Rose sparks up a cigarette.

                                 JASPER
                        Did you write me that letter?

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        What letter?

           From his satchel, Jasper takes out the SEALED BOX of STATIONERY.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I guess I don’t need to wrap it now.
                        That was your birthday present.  

                                 JASPER
                        Is my mother alive?

           Rose takes a long pause.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Did she contact you?
           His mouth agape, Jasper just got his answer.  

           He is flooded with emotion.  Rose tries to console him.  Jasper 
           pulls away from her, stalks off down the hill.

           EXT. PUGET SOUND - MOMENTS LATER

           Rose catches up to Jasper at the shoreline.  The WAVES CRASH 
           against a retaining wall.

                                 JASPER
                        Why did you tell me she was dead?

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        She was.  To you.  To you and me.

                                 JASPER
                        But she’s not dead!!!

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        You were 5.  She put you in my arms, 
                        went to get cigarettes, and never 
                        came back.  

           Jasper is rendered mute.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Mary couldn’t be your mother  
                        anymore.  She didn’t want to be.   
                        She was so fucked up.

                                 JASPER
                        She had cancer.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        It’s easier to tell a kid his mother 
                        has cancer, than she’s a junkie.

                                 JASPER
                        But she was sick, I remember.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        That was her trying to detox.  

                                 JASPER
                        Why?  Why would you lie to me?

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Better she be dead, then just up   
                        and leave her son. 

           Jasper is devastated. 
                                 JASPER
                        She lives in Idaho. 

           Rose smokes the cigarette all the way down in one drag.

                                 JASPER
                        When’s the last time you talked to 
                        her?

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        You were 9.

                                 JASPER
                        What did she say?

           Rose doesn’t want to answer.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s the difference now?  

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        She wanted money.  She said she was 
                        clean, but I didn’t believe it, so I
                        hung up on her.  I told her she was 
                        dead, and made her agree to it.

           Jasper is a passenger in his own life right now.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I’m sorry, Jazzy.  I tried to do  
                        what was best for you.

           Rose tries to go to Jasper, but he shrugs her off. 

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Are you spending the night?  The  
                        last ferry --

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll be on it.

           Rose is consumed with guilt and grief.  

                                 ROSE
                             (grasping at straws)
                        Did your bird come back yet?

                                 JASPER
                        Nope, Rose.  Just my mom.

           All we hear is the CRUNCHING of GRAVEL as Jasper trudges uphill.
           EXT. DOCK - PORT OF ASTORIA - NIGHT

           A bundled up Nicole waits for Jasper as he gets off the ferry.   
           A Carnival is disassembled in the port.  Nicole excitedly holds 
           up a bag of guppies and funnel cake. 

           Jasper is happier to see Nicole than he wants to be.  She jumps 
           into his arms, kisses him like he just returned from the war. 

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jasper changes his t-shirt, puts on a different gray hoodie. 
           Nicole descends the spiral staircase into the bedroom.

                                 NICOLE
                        You don’t have a big enough bowl,   
                        so I put the fish in the sink.

                                 JASPER
                        Have you ever wanted to find your 
                        birth parents?

                                 NICOLE
                             (caught off guard)
                        When I was a kid, yeah.  I wrote a 
                        letter to my mother.

                                 JASPER
                        What kind of letter?

                                 NICOLE
                        In crayon.  “Atomic tangerine,”   
                        that was the color.

                                 JASPER
                        Then what?  Did you send it?

                                 NICOLE
                        I put it under my pillow.  When I 
                        woke up, it was gone.  Like the  
                        tooth fairy, but no dollar bill.  I 
                        pretended I sent it, never got a 
                        response, obviously.  But I wasn’t 
                        mad. 
                             (then)
                        I had this fantasy she was some   
                        kind of a saint who carried me for 
                        nine months, she sacrificed 
                        everything.  I wanted to keep her 
                        that way.  My sisters used to tease 
                        me all the time about it.

           A beat, she laughs.
                                 NICOLE
                        What made you ask that?

                                 JASPER
                        She’s still alive.  Mary.  My mother.

                                 NICOLE
                        What?

                                 JASPER
                        She lives in Idaho.  25 years.  
                        That’s how long she’s been dead.   
                        And now, she’s just...not dead.      
                        I called, heard her voice.

           WE HEAR, then SEE, WATER POURING down the spiral staircase.

           ECU GOLDFISH:  As they come bouncing down the steps in the FLOOD.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           WATER BILLOWS over the sink, through the kitchen, across the hard 
           wood floor, down the staircase.  Nicole turns off the sink.

                                 JASPER
                        You said you were an only child.   
                        Now you have sisters?

                                 NICOLE
                        Half sisters.  From my Dad’s first 
                        marriage.  Amanda and Beth.

                                 JASPER
                        Which one’s older?

                                 NICOLE
                        Amanda, by two years.  
                             (switches gears)
                        You just found out your mother is 
                        alive.  Why are we talking about 
                        this? 

                                 JASPER
                        I need to know everything about you.

                                 NICOLE
                        Ask me anything.  I’m an open book.

           Jasper studies the lines of her face, and we go to...         
           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - NIGHT

           Nicole sleeps alone in Jasper’s bed.  

           PAN THE DIMLY LIT ROOM TO:  Jasper’s face, illuminated by the 
           screen of his LAPTOP.  

           ANGLE COMPUTER:  GOOGLE EARTH

           He taps away at the keyboard.

              “8916 BROXTON AVENUE, BOISE, IDAHO, 83711”

           We watch the SCREEN as it zooms in on the MAP.  A satellite  
           takes us closer and closer until we come to a HOUSE on a  
           suburban cul-de-sac.  ZOOM CLOSER, we see a living room window.

           A CURSOR takes us left, then right, all over the HOUSE.  The 
           mailbox.  The street.  The surrounding homes.

           HOLD ON JASPER, looking at his MOTHER’S HOUSE, we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           HOURS LATER:  Jasper is still transfixed by Google Earth.  

           The water glass on his desk begins to RATTLE.  The bedroom starts 
           to SHAKE.  The entire apartment is moving.  Nicole vaults out of 
           bed.  PEOPLE SCREAM OUTSIDE.  CAR ALARMS GO OFF.  

           Then, a DEAFENING SOUND unlike anything we’ve ever heard.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. JASPER’S BALCONY - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Jasper and Nicole step out on the balcony to see MOUNT ST. HELENS 
           ERUPTING.  It is truly a spectacle.   

           ECU JASPER:  He watches the Volcano with awed fear.

           ANGLE NEIGHBORHOOD - PEOPLE stand in their windows and roof tops.  
           A front row seat to a once in a lifetime event.  

           The Volcano ILLUMINATES THE MIDNIGHT SKY.  A barrage of bursts.  
           Vibrant colors and a BLAST of SOUNDS as plumes of smoke and lava.

           IN SLOW MOTION:  Jasper looks over at Nicole.  She glows in the 
           spotlight.  The lights dance in her eyes.  It is magical.
           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - DAY

           All eyes are on Jasper.  He wipes his sweaty hands on his pants.  

                                 KEVIN
                        Fuckin’ Nostradamus over here.

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t predict anything.

                                 BRAD
                        But they came true.  You foretold 
                        these events.  Your mother is alive. 
                        A volcano erupted.  This girl is 
                        Hannah.

                                 KEVIN
                        Roland, should we say our good-byes 
                        now?

           Jasper looks over at Roland, who is anxious and shaken.

                                 ANDREA
                        Do I age well, Jasper?

                                 JASPER
                        I’m not from the future.

                                 KEVIN
                        You age fat, Andrea.  Duh.   

                                 JASPER
                        Roland, do you wanna chime in here?

                                 ROLAND
                        I’d like to hear the part about me 
                        again if I could.  

                                 JASPER
                        It just said “Roland dies suddenly.” 
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 ROLAND
                             (boils over)
                        You’re sorry?  This wasn’t part of 
                        the exercise!

                                 JASPER
                        I fucking wind up suicidal, Roland!  

                                 ROLAND
                        And I wind up fucking dead!

           Stunned silence all around.  Then...
                                 BRAD
                        You better break up with this girl, 
                        Jasper.

                                 JASPER
                        What if I can’t?

                                 ANDREA
                        What do you mean, you can’t?  

                                 JASPER
                        I just...can’t let go.

                                 ROLAND
                        Even if it kills you?

           The air clears.  Everyone stares at Jasper.

           EXT. NICOLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Conflicted, Jasper pauses outside her door.  Filled with anxiety, 
           he tries to pull himself together a little bit, then knocks.  

           Nicole opens the door.  Jasper looks at her and gets lost.

                                 JASPER
                        Why are you so beautiful?

           Her eyes sparkle, she kisses him.  Then, she excitedly whips out 
           two THEATER TICKETS.

                                 NICOLE
                        “The Cherry Orchard!”  

                                 JASPER
                        I’ve read it so many times, it’s   
                        his only play I haven’t seen.

           She grabs a bottle of vodka, makes drinks in two plastic cups.

                                 NICOLE
                        We should take “roadies.”  Aren’t  
                        all Chekhov’s characters drunks?

                                 JASPER
                        Bring the bottle.

           INT. PORTLAND PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT

           Chekhov’s “THE CHERRY ORCHARD” is in full swing. 
           ON STAGE:  The ACTORS swill their vodka in the midst of a SCENE.

           PAN THE AUDIENCE:  Everyone is stoic, serious.

           We Continue to hear the ACTORS in B.G.

           FIND JASPER & NICOLE:  Nicole chuckles at a line.  She laughs out 
           loud at another.

           She turns to see Jasper, just staring at her.

                                 NICOLE
                        Oh my God, no one else is laughing.  
                        It’s not supposed to be funny, is it?

                                 JASPER
                        It’s a comedy.  No one ever seems to 
                        get that.  But you did.

           Jasper takes Nicole’s hand.  Then he swigs Vodka from the bottle.

           EXT. THEATER DISTRICT - PORTLAND 

           Jasper and Nicole walk out of the theater.  It starts to rain.  

           Without missing a beat, Nicole starts to dance around him like 
           Gene Kelly in “Singing in the Rain.”  

           And Jasper falls in love all over again.

                                 JASPER
                        Chekhov shows us the value of  
                        opening oneself up to the beauty of 
                        the world and the love of others,  
                        and the blatant foolishness of    
                        this in the face of the inevitable 
                        destruction of beauty and love.

           Nicole just looks at him, impressed.

                                 NICOLE
                        Your dissertation?

                                 JASPER
                        Pretentious, I know.

                                 NICOLE
                        I think it’s brilliant.  Why didn’t 
                        you finish?
                                 JASPER
                        I guess...because I didn’t know   
                        what I would do when I finished.   
                        So, I just didn’t...

                                 NICOLE
                        You will some day.
                             (then)
                        I think I finish things quickly   
                        just to be finished with them.

           They walk through the rain, two lovers in hoodies.

           INT. NICOLE’S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Jasper and Nicole have passionate sex.  She arches her back, digs 
           her fingers into the sheets.   

                                 NICOLE
                        Call me Hannah, it turns me on.

           Jasper tries to keep going, but his mind gets the best of him.

                                 JASPER
                        I can’t.  

           Jasper rolls off Nicole.  He looks freaked out.

                                 NICOLE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t want to call you Hannah.

                                 NICOLE
                        Then don’t.  But that’s not it, 
                        what’s wrong?  

           He tries to talk but his voice trails off.

                                 NICOLE
                        Is it me?

                                 JASPER
                        No.

                                 NICOLE
                        I don’t believe you.
                             (beat)
                        When you said you were in love    
                        with me, did you mean it?

           Jasper doesn’t say a word.
                                 NICOLE
                        That’s not the answer I wanted to 
                        hear.

                                 JASPER
                        Yes, I meant it.  But maybe we’re 
                        moving too quick.

                                 NICOLE
                        There’s no such thing.  You move   
                        how you move.  

           A terminally long beat.

                                 NICOLE
                        What’s the difference?  I’m leaving 
                        the country anyway.  And nobody 
                        cares.

                                 JASPER
                        I CARE!  

                                 NICOLE
                        You don’t love me.  You never did.

                                 JASPER
                        That’s not true!

                                 NICOLE
                             (an ironic laugh)
                        “Beauty and love will inevitably be 
                        destroyed.”  You’re the one who said 
                        it, Jasper.  Clearly, you were right.

           Jasper has no comeback for his own words.

                                 NICOLE
                        I need you to leave.

                                 JASPER
                        Nicole --

                                 NICOLE
                        Just go.  Please.

           Jasper starts putting on his clothes.

                                 JASPER
                        I wish I could explain.

           As he puts on his shoes, she pushes him to the front door.
                                 NICOLE
                        Why didn’t I trust myself?  You’re 
                        just like the rest of them.

                                 JASPER
                             (enraged)
                        Don’t tell me I’m like someone else!  

           Nicole forces Jasper out, SLAMS THE DOOR in his face. 

           EXT. NICOLE’S FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper is about to BANG on the door, then stops himself.  

           He fumes down the corridor and plows through the EMERGENCY EXIT.

           EXT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - EARLY AM

           Jasper arrives to find Roland pacing in front of the apartment.  
           Roland’s just had his third coffee.  He’s wound up, ready to pop. 

           ASH from MOUNT ST. HELENS wafts down on them like filthy snow.  

                                 ROLAND
                        Why the hell is your cell phone off?

                                 JASPER
                        I didn’t charge it.

                                 ROLAND
                        Who doesn’t charge their fucking 
                        phone?!

                                 JASPER
                        Jesus, settle down.

           Roland sees Jasper’s cup with “Jack” written on it.

                                 ROLAND
                        “Jack.”  So obvious with your  
                        textbook escapism, self loathing 
                        bullshit.  

                                 JASPER
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ROLAND
                        I feel like there’s someone inside  
                        my head, jack-hammering my brain.  
                                 JASPER
                        I wish I could help you, but I’m 
                        leaving for Idaho.  I have to get   
                        to the train.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY

           The “CASCADE CORRIDOR” EXPLODES INTO FRAME, speeding across the 
           Northwest Trail. 

           INT. THE CASCADE CORRIDOR TRAIN - DAY

           Jasper looks out the window, stoically watches the spectacular 
           landscape flying by.  HOLD ON JASPER FOR A LONG BEAT.

                                 JASPER
                        I find it really odd that you’re 
                        here.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL:  ROLAND is sitting next to Jasper.

                                 ROLAND
                        Who else can I talk about this with?

                                 JASPER
                        Your own therapist?

                                 ROLAND
                        They would take away my license.  

           Roland tries to find his breath.  

                                 ROLAND
                        I have a fever.  Feel my head.

           Jasper reluctantly touches Roland’s head.

                                 JASPER
                        No fever.  You just feel gross.

                                 ROLAND
                        I gotta get my blood pumping.

           Roland stands and starts to stretch vigorously in the aisle.

                                 JASPER
                        We’ve pinned all of my issues on   
                        the fact that my mother died.   
                        Except now, she never died.  
                                 ROLAND
                        She did what she did.  There’s 
                        nothing you can do about it.  All  
                        you can control is what you do now.  
                        You need to end your relationship 
                        with Hannah.

                                 JASPER
                        Nicole.

                                 ROLAND
                        You were never able to let go of her.  
                        That’s why you wrote the letter.

                                 JASPER
                        That fucking letter!  Seriously 
                        Roland, how could this happen?

                                 ROLAND
                        Einstein said, “All time is now.”

                                 JASPER
                        What does that even mean!?  If you’re 
                        gonna answer me like that, then don’t 
                        answer at all!
                             (beat)
                        What if I can change fate?  

                                 ROLAND
                        You have a gun in your mouth and I’m 
                        dead, so I hope you can.    

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. THE CASCADE CORRIDOR TRAIN - DAY

           Jasper paces the train.  He sits down next to an out-cold Roland.  
           He rests his head against the window.  He takes out a fifth of 
           Vodka and guzzles it down.   

           OVER THIS, WE HEAR JASPER’S VOICEMAIL BEEP.

                                 NICOLE (V.O.)
                        I’ve never missed anyone like this.  
                        I’m trying not to, but I can’t help 
                        it.  I hope you’re ok, baby.  

           ANGLE WINDOW:  We see the snow-capped Rocky Mountains.  Sideways 
           rain smacks against the train.  

           Jasper closes his eyes, and we...

                                                          FLASH CUT TO:
           The SCREEN BECOMES GRAINY...

           CLOSE ON:  5 YEAR-OLD JASPER, walking through a CEMETERY, 
           trailing behind AUNT ROSE, 35.  Young Jasper holds flowers.  

                                 5 YEAR-OLD JASPER
                        Where is she buried?

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Right here.

           They come to an UNMARKED PLAQUE in the ground.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Give Mommy the flowers.  I’ll wait 
                        over at the gate.

           Young Jasper lays the flowers down on the unmarked grave. 

                                 5 YEAR-OLD JASPER
                        When I have money some day, I’ll   
                        put your name on there. 

           Young Jasper runs his hand over the smooth plaque.  

                                 5 YEAR-OLD JASPER
                        Wait for me, Aunt Rosie...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT:  BOISE, IDAHO    

           An ordinary suburban neighborhood in Boise.

           INT. TAXI - DAY 

           OPEN on a shaky Jasper, now wearing his corduroy blazer over the 
           gray hoodie outfit.  In the backseat of a cab, he stares at the 
           pelican mailbox of a home surrounded by a white picket fence.  

               8916 Broxton Avenue  “The Whiteheads”

           The driveway and both sides of the street are packed with cars. 

                                 ROLAND
                        I would have waited to talk to her.

                                 JASPER
                        I got her once and hung up.  Every 
                        time since, I keep getting the 
                        machine.  So I just said, “fuck it.”
                                 ROLAND
                        Make sure you know what you want to 
                        say.

                                 JASPER
                        First up, I’d like to let her know 
                        she destroyed my life.

                                 ROLAND
                        She might slam the door in your face.

                                 JASPER
                        Then I’ll just have to break the door 
                        down, won’t I?

           A beat.

                                 ROLAND
                        I’m still confused by the champagne.

           Roland gestures to the bottle of Veuve Cliquot in Jasper’s hand.

                                 JASPER
                        I figured it’d be a good ice-breaker.  
                        You can’t go wrong with champagne.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Gives me migraines.  

                                 JASPER
                        Leave the meter running.

           EXT. MARY’S HOME - BOISE, IDAHO - DAY

           MOMENTS LATER:  Jasper walks slowly up the driveway.  

           He can’t feel his legs as he climbs the porch steps.  A MAN in a 
           black suit comes outside to smoke a cigarette.

                                 JASPER
                        Excuse me, is this Mary’s house?

                                 MAN
                        Yeah.  Go on in.
                             (beat)
                        Champagne?

           He holds the door open for Jasper.  It’s a crowded house.
           INT. MARY’S HOME - BOISE, IDAHO - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper moves through his mother’s house in a daze.  Everyone is 
           in suits and dresses, eating finger sandwiches, talking quietly.

           HOLD ON JASPER, adrift at the party, holding his Veuve Cliquot.  

           He sees PICTURES of MARY from various stages in her life.  

           Finally, Jasper finds ROBERT, 50’s, kind faced, and stops him.

                                 JASPER
                        Do you know where Mary is?

                                 ROBERT
                        We...just came from the cemetery.  

                                 JASPER
                             (it dawns on him)
                        This is a funeral?

                                 ROBERT
                        Mary’s funeral.  I’m her cousin, 
                        Robert.  

           Robert shakes Jasper’s hand.  Jasper is dazed.  

           An attractive WOMAN, early 20’s, looking particularly overwhelmed 
           (LINDSEY) comes over to Robert.

                                 ROBERT
                        I’m so sorry, Linds.

                                 LINDSEY
                             (hugs Robert)
                        Thank you so much for coming.

           Jasper just stares at Lindsey, frozen.  She notices him.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Hi, I’m Lindsey Whitehead.  Did 
                        you...know my mother?

                                 JASPER
                             (long beat)
                        How did she die?

                                 LINDSEY
                             (thinks this is odd)
                        Cancer.

                                 JASPER
                        That’s rather ironic.
                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m sorry, can I ask who you are?

                                 JASPER
                        Did you see her body?

                                 ROBERT
                        What kind of question is that?  

                                 JASPER
                        I’m surprised she wasn’t cremated.  
                        Destroy all the evidence.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Who are you!?

                                 JASPER
                             (beat)
                        Mary was my mother, too.

           Dumbfounded, Lindsey just stares at Jasper.

                                 LINDSEY
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 JASPER
                        I’m Jasper.  She left when I was 5.

           Lindsey starts to cry. 

                                 LINDSEY
                        I want you to leave.

           A little boy, ETHAN, 3, runs into her arms.  Robert grabs Jasper 
           by the arm, starts to pull him away.  

                                 JASPER
                        She was already dead once!  Why do 
                        you believe her now?  

           Jasper’s VOICE KEEPS RISING, he CAUSES a SCENE.  

           Robert and a few Guests force the hysterical Jasper to the door.

                                 JASPER
                        Where is she buried?!

           HOLD ON LINDSEY, watching Jasper in horror...

           EXT. MARY’S HOME - BOISE, IDAHO - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper passes Roland, who does jumping jacks on the driveway. 
                                 JASPER
                             (incredulous)
                        I brought champagne to a funeral.  

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BOISE CEMETERY - DAY

           Jasper pours out the bottle of champagne over MARY’s GRAVE.

           “MARY WHITEHEAD  1954-2011.  Beloved Mother, Grandmother, Wife”  

                                 JASPER
                        Was I really that bad a kid?

           Jasper steals the flowers off her grave and trudges back to 
           Roland, watching from a distance.

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Jasper and Roland ride the Cascade Corridor in silence.

                                 ROLAND
                        I’m gonna have some gum.  You?

                                 JASPER
                        Sure.

           The gum exchange takes place.  Silence for the next 400 miles.

           OVER THIS, WE HEAR JASPER’S VOICEMAIL BEEP.

                                 NICOLE’S VOICE
                        Ok, now I’m worried.  I’ve called 
                        three times.  

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           TIGHT ON NICOLE:  LEAVING JASPER A MESSAGE.

                                 NICOLE
                        I just want to see you.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL...  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - SAME TIME

           NICOLE IS IN JASPER’S APARTMENT.  She is sitting on his couch, 
           surrounding by the “Hannah” PHOTOGRAPHS. 
                                 NICOLE
                        I love you, Jasper.

                                                               BACK TO:

           JASPER ON THE TRAIN:  AS BEFORE

           As the Passenger’s CONVERSATIONS get LOUDER and LOUDER, we PUSH 
           IN ON JASPER’S FACE...

           EXT. PORTLAND CEMETERY - DAY

           Jasper still holds the stolen flowers.  He stands before the 
           UNMARKED GRAVE where he always though his mother was buried.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll find out your real name, I will.
                             (lays down the flowers)
                        When I have the money, I promise I’ll 
                        put your name on there this time.

           INT. ROLAND’S CAR - EVENING

           Roland pulls up in front of Jasper’s building.  They sit in the 
           car for a long beat, both afraid to go back into the world.  

                                 JASPER
                        Is it unethical to have your 
                        therapist be your best friend?

           The VOLCANIC ASH rains down around them.  It looks like the 
           Apocalypse is near.

                                 ROLAND
                        Considering the circumstances, I 
                        think it’s apropos.  

           A beat.

                                 JASPER
                        What are you gonna do now?

                                 ROLAND
                        Probably stop by the market, make 
                        some calls, then...get ready to die.

           Jasper says good-bye to Roland and gets out of the car.
           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT 

           Jasper opens his mailbox, pulls out a stack of mail, shuffles 
           through it, then stuffs it all back in the box.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The ALARM CLOCK BLARES.  In a haze, Jasper puts the LIGHT THERAPY 
           BOX on his chest.  Blinding U.V. RAYS SHINE in his face.  Jasper 
           just lies there. 

           INT. JASPER’S CLOSET - MORNING

           Jasper puts on one of his GRAY HOODIES.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Jasper sprinkles seed into the bird feeder.  He leaves the CAGE 
           DOOR and the WINDOW OPEN.

           EXT. THE STEEL BRIDGE - EVENING

           Jasper stands alone on the bridge.  His PHONE RINGS.

           INSERT PHONE - “NICOLE”

           He hesitates for a beat, then answers the phone.

                                 JASPER
                        Hi.

           INTERCUT WITH NICOLE 

           EXT. RESTAURANT - SAME TIME

           She stands outside a restaurant, talks to Jasper on her cell.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I feel sick without you.  I don’t 
                        know what to do.  

           CONTINUE TO INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM

                                 JASPER
                        Neither do I.
                                 NICOLE
                        I want to make this work.  Tell me 
                        what to do, I’ll do it.

           Jasper is so conflicted, but he doesn’t say a word.

                                 NICOLE
                             (long silence)
                        I’ll let you go.  Good-bye, Jasper.

           She puts her phone away and enters the restaurant.

           HOLD ON JASPER, still holding his phone.

                                 JASPER
                        Don’t go.

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           A handsome MAN (BRIAN), late 30’s, spots Nicole and waves his 
           hand.  She goes over to him.  They kiss.  

                                 NICOLE
                        Sorry, I was on the phone with my 
                        landlord.  

           Nicole sits across from Brian.  She drinks from his wine glass.

                                 NICOLE
                        He won’t let me renew my lease.  I 
                        don’t know what I’m gonna do.  I 
                        can’t afford to pay “first & last” 
                        somewhere else.

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s too soon for us to be living 
                        together.  Four months seems like 
                        we’re rushing.

                                 NICOLE
                        According to you.  I knew this was 
                        gonna happen.  Typical, just typical.

                                 BRIAN
                        Don’t be so theatrical, Hannah.

           Just as, a WAITER comes to the table.

                                 NICOLE
                        Can I get a Bourbon, neat?
           INT. THE “WILLAMETTE WEEK” OFFICES - DAY

           Jasper enters the office to zero fanfare.  He is looking more and 
           more unkempt.  Everyone is puzzled to see him, especially Phil.

                                 PHIL
                        Jasper?  What are you doing here?

                                 JASPER
                        Just coming to work.

                                 PHIL
                        You don’t work here anymore.

                                 JASPER
                             (tries to keep it together)
                        Phil.  I’m sorry, I’ve had a really 
                        bad...

                                 PHIL
                        You haven’t shown up in weeks.  You 
                        haven’t returned, I don’t know, a 
                        dozen phone calls?

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t think that’s true.

                                 PHIL
                        What’s true is, you’re fired.  Your 
                        stuff is in a box at security.

           Phil walks away, leaves Jasper standing there.  

           ANGLE TREVOR:  Peering over his cubicle.  Trevor now has Jasper’s 
           old “Entertainment Director” plaque.

                                 TREVOR
                        No hard feelings, right buddy?

                                 JASPER
                        Look Trevor, this place is gonna fold 
                        within a year, so you should start --

                                 TREVOR
                        There’s some sour grapes.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t care about the job.  You’ve 
                        always wanted it, I’m happy for you.

                                 TREVOR
                        This guy!  Gunning for his old 
                        position back.
                                 JASPER
                        Just...never mind.  Good luck, Trev.

           Jasper turns and heads out of the office. 

                                 TREVOR
                             (calls out)
                        Happy Hour later?  On me.  

           And Jasper leaves Willamette Week forever.

           EXT. PORTLAND STREET - EVENING

           Jasper steps into the crosswalk -- Just as, the bevy of CYCLISTS 
           BUZZ BY.  Now, they sound like evil hornets.  Their NOISE IS 
           DEAFENING as they PASS HIM in all directions.

                                 JASPER
                             (yells out)
                        Shorts are for little boys! 

           Jasper continues walking.  A drizzle morphs to a shower.  It is a 
           black rain as the drops mix with the ASH.

           INT. POWELL’S BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Jasper carries a large, heavy box of books up to Gwen.  

                                 GWEN
                        When we entered into this, we made a 
                        pact, a book a week.  You can’t just 
                        disappear.  We’re 3 books behind.

           Jasper starts to unload his books onto the counter.  It’s his 
           entire collection of RUSSIAN LITERATURE.

                                 GWEN
                        Hell no.  I’m not reading any more  
                        of this.  Nyet!

                                 JASPER
                        I’m here to sell everything.  
                        Actually, you guys can have it for 
                        free.

                                 GWEN
                        I just want to thank you again for 
                        making me realize how much I hate 
                        Russian literature.
                                 JASPER
                        That’s what I do.  Spread joy 
                        everywhere I go.

                                 GWEN
                        Check this out.  My short story is 
                        getting published in The Atlantic.

                                 JASPER
                             (lets this register)
                        Wow.  That’s...huge.  

                                 GWEN
                        I couldn’t have done it without you.  
                        Thanks for the notes.

           Jasper looks lost for a moment.

                                 JASPER
                        What’s it like to get what you want?

                                 GWEN
                        Jasper, are you ok?

                                 JASPER
                        No, not particularly.

                                 GWEN
                        Should I be worried about you?

           Without another word, Jasper is out the door.  

           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - EVENING

           Jasper shows up halfway through Group.  He is greeted like the 
           prodigal son.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jasper!

                                 ANDREA
                        I’m so happy you’re back.  Do you 
                        know how hard it is to sit here with 
                        a broken circle?

                                 BRAD
                        I was gonna have my housekeeper come, 
                        make her sit in your spot.

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah bro, you can’t just leave 
                        without notice.
                                 ANDREA
                        Then we wonder --

                                 BRAD
                        Did he kill himself?

                                 KEVIN
                        I had $20 bucks on “yes”.

           Kevin hands Andrea a $20 bill.

           Jasper looks around the Barber Shop.  No Roland.

                                 JASPER
                        Where’s Roland?

           INT. ROLAND’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Jasper rings the doorbell, knocks several times.  He hears LOUD 
           MUSIC coming from inside.  He tries the door, it’s ajar. 

           INT. ROLAND’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           “CHAINS OF LOVE” by ERASURE reverberates through the place.  

           Jasper finds Roland, dancing in his bedroom as he gets dressed.  
           He is manic, like he just inhaled a mountain of coke.

                                 JASPER
                        Your door’s open.

                                 ROLAND
                             (hopped up)
                        I don’t lock it anymore, I don’t 
                        worry about that stuff.

           Roland passes Jasper with a burst of energy.  He bounces from 
           room to room, putting on his shoes, jacket, and a backpack.

                                 JASPER
                        Jesus, how much coffee have you had?

                                 ROLAND
                        Not a drip.

                                 JASPER
                        You missed Group today.

           Roland never stops moving.
                                 ROLAND
                        Is it Wednesday?  I don’t really  
                        keep “days” anymore. 

                                 JASPER
                        What the hell does that mean?

           Roland finally stops moving.  He turns to Jasper.

                                 ROLAND
                        I hermitted myself.  I’ve been  
                        hiding out, terrified to leave the 
                        house.  I stopped seeing my patients, 
                        avoided all human contact.  I would 
                        order food and leave the money 
                        outside so I didn’t have to see the 
                        guy.  Then it got to the point where 
                        I couldn’t eat the food, I didn’t 
                        trust that either.  I thought I’d 
                        never be able to leave here.  I 
                        waited to die.  

           Roland opens a closet.  Wall to wall TOILET PAPER.

                                 ROLAND
                        But it all changed in a split second.  
                        Come on, walk and talk!

           Roland puts on a backpack, and he’s rushing out the door.  

           INT. ROLAND’S PRIUS - DAY

           Jasper and Roland head Downtown.  Roland drives with purpose, but 
           all of his fear is gone.

                                 ROLAND
                        I was taking a bath, just sitting 
                        there, stewing in my own filth.  I 
                        kept propping myself up because I 
                        didn’t want to drown.  When I got 
                        out, I didn’t have a towel.  I 
                        reached for the lamp, not noticing 
                        the switch had fallen out.  I was 
                        soaking wet and stuck my hand right 
                        into an open socket.  I couldn’t pull 
                        my hand away.  My heart was jumping 
                        out of my body.  I thought, this is 
                        it.  Finally, I fell to the floor.
                             (long beat)
                        Then, it hit me.  I’M NOT DEAD.
                             (then)
                        But, I can die anywhere.  ANY TIME.  
                        Forget fear.  Conquer that!    
           Roland double-parks and hops out of the car.  They are in front 
           of a PINK SKYSCRAPER, the biggest building in Portland.

           EXT. ”BIG PINK” (THE US BANCORP BUILDING) - CONTINUOUS

           Roland bee-lines for the front doors of the building.  Jasper 
           gets out, stares up at the skyscraper.

                                 JASPER
                        Why are we at Big Pink?

           INT. ELEVATOR - BIG PINK - DAY

           Jasper and Roland take the elevator up to the 42nd Floor.

                                 JASPER
                        Wanna tell me what we’re doing here?

                                 ROLAND
                        Everyone’s future has one thing in 
                        common --

           EXT. ROOF - BIG PINK - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper tries to keep up with Roland.  It’s cold and windy on the 
           roof, we can see all of Portland.

                                 ROLAND
                        Maybe mine will be today, tomorrow, 
                        or sometime in the next 10 years.   
                        It almost happened last night.  At 
                        least I’m gonna die not being afraid 
                        to die.  On my own terms.

           Roland keeps walking towards the edge of the roof.  He opens   
           his backpack and never stops.  

                                 JASPER
                        Slow down, Roland!

                                 ROLAND
                        By the way, I’m bisexual, but I   
                        lean heavily towards men.

           Roland goes into a quick run...

                                 ROLAND
                        TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS!

           He never stops running, JUMPS OFF THE BUILDING.
                                 JASPER
                        Roland!!!

           Jasper rushes to the edge.

           JASPER’S VANTAGE POINT:  

           Roland FREE-FALLS for 5 seconds, then TOSSES A PARACHUTE out of 
           his bag and FLOATS TO THE GROUND.  

           He just base-jumped off Big Pink!

           INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper frantically presses the elevator button over and over.

           INT. STAIRWELL - BIG PINK - MOMENTS LATER 

           Jasper sprints down 40 flights of stairs.

           EXT. BIG PINK - STREET - DAY

           Jasper runs out of Big Pink to find an elated Roland being 
           escorted away by two SECURITY GUARDS.  He looks like Superman, 
           the parachute is his cape.    

           A POLICE CAR pulls up.  COPS jump out, cuff Roland and stuff him 
           in the back of their squad car.  

           Jasper just stands there, stunned.  

                                 ROLAND
                        Jasper, maybe we can change our fate.

           The Cop Car pulls away.  HOLD ON JASPER...

           INT. WALGREEN’S - DAY

           Nicole pushes a cart down an aisle.  From the shelf, she grabs  
           Gift Wrapping Paper, Scotch Tape.  Then another aisle.  Soap.  
           Toilet Paper.  And an EPT HOME PREGNANCY KIT.

           EXT. JASPER’S APARTMENT ENTRANCEWAY - NIGHT

           Jasper arrives to find a WRAPPED GIFT leaned against his door.
           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Jasper opens the wrapping, takes out a frame.

           INSERT PHOTOGRAPH:  

           A hand colored BLACK & WHITE of THE KIDS PLAYING IN THE PARK.

           The PICTURE COMES TO LIFE, re-enacting Jasper’s fantasy.  

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. NICOLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Nicole opens the door and gives Jasper a warm embrace.  

                                 JASPER
                        I always wanted to take a picture of 
                        them.  I guess I was just afraid I’d 
                        get arrested.

           She kisses him.  

           Jasper looks around the apartment - Packed boxes are everywhere.  
           He fills with panic.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m not letting you leave. 

                                 NICOLE
                        I have to go.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll go with you.  Toronto... 
                        Kitchener.  It sounds perfect.

                                 NICOLE
                        Yeah, maybe to you.  I’m not going 
                        back there.  You don’t know what I 
                        went through. 

                                 JASPER
                        No, I don’t.  Tell me, let me help 
                        you.

           Her wounds bleed through him.   

                                 NICOLE
                             (tears in her eyes)
                        I can’t go back.

           CLOSE ON JASPER:  His mind is hurtling a million miles an hour.  
           ECU:  Packed boxes.

           ECU:  The furniture is gone.

           ECU:  Bubble wrap everywhere.

                                 JASPER
                             (reeling)
                        Marry me.

                                 NICOLE
                             (taken aback)
                        You don’t have to say that.

                                 JASPER
                        I want to marry you.  I know we can 
                        create a different future.

           Nicole is moved, troubled.  A jumbled mix.

                                 NICOLE
                        I can’t stay.  I didn’t renew my 
                        lease.

                                 JASPER
                        People who are married usually live 
                        together.

                                 NICOLE
                        I sold my car.

                                 JASPER
                        You can have mine.  I’m not that 
                        strong a driver anyway.

           Jasper takes her in his arms.  She breaks the hug.

                                 NICOLE
                        Jasper, I’m pregnant.

           These words rattle around in Jasper’s brain.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I wasn’t sure if I would tell you   
                        or not.  You were gone, and...

           He tries to catch his breath.

                                 NICOLE
                        I don’t know what to do.  

           A long beat.
                                 JASPER
                        I mean, this is...having a child, 
                        it’s the biggest...oh my God...
                             (pulls the trigger)
                        I want you to keep it!  We should 
                        keep it!

                                 NICOLE
                        You want to have a baby with me?

                                 JASPER
                        Marry me.  Have a baby with me!   
                        Yes, This, all of it.

           Now, she’s crying.  They kiss.  It’s emotional and electric.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           OPEN TIGHT ON NICOLE.  Sleeping.  WIDEN TO REVEAL:  Jasper is 
           sitting in a chair next to the bed, watching her sleep.  He is 
           pensive, having an inner debate.  The LETTER is in his hand.  

                                 JASPER
                        I got a letter from myself in the 
                        future.  It told me not to be with 
                        you.
                             (beat)
                        But I can’t help myself.  

           She doesn’t stir.  He just sits there, watching her.

           EXT. BALCONY - JASPER’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

           ECU:  THE LETTER is ON FIRE.  

           As the flames get down to his fingertips, Jasper lets go.  The 
           letter has disappeared.  A trial by fire.  No turning back now.

           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper slides back into bed next to Nicole, and we...

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. WOMEN’S CLINIC - DAY

           Jasper and Nicole stand on the street, outside the clinic.

                                 NICOLE
                        I don’t have insurance.
                                 JASPER
                        I’m paying.  Are you sure you don’t 
                        want me to come in with you?

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s nothing.  Just some blood work.  
                        I’ll be in and out in a half hour.

                                 JASPER
                        By the way, you never said “yes”    
                        or “no.”

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s yes!  That should go without 
                        saying, I love you.

                                 JASPER
                             (giddy)
                        Let’s give him a cool middle name, 
                        like Mac.  Good for a boy, or a girl.  
                        Or George...that’s probably better 
                        for a boy.

           Nicole sweetly kisses Jasper, then disappears into the Clinic.

           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Jasper sits in the park, beaming as he watches the kids play.  

           He gets a beep on his phone.  “WORDS WITH FRIENDS”

           INSERT:  “WORDS WITH FRIENDS.”  

           Overjoyed, he texts his opponent... Jasper:  ”I’m having a baby!”

           After a beat, his opponent texts back.  MaShure248: “Your move.”

           EXT. WOMEN’S CLINIC - DAY

           Jasper paces on the street.  He checks his watch.  Finally, he 
           can’t take it anymore.  

           As he’s about to barge through the doors, a NURSE wheels Nicole 
           out in a wheelchair.  She is groggy and ashen.  

                                 NURSE
                        Sir, are you her ride?

                                 JASPER
                        Why are you in a wheelchair?
                                 NURSE
                        It’s just procedure.  Sign this, 
                        please.

           The Nurse sticks a clipboard and release form in Jasper’s face.  
           Everything is happening so fast.  He signs.  The Nurse disappears 
           back into the clinic.

                                 JASPER
                        What happened? 

                                 NICOLE
                             (starts to cry)
                        I lost the baby.

           Jasper is jolted.

                                 NICOLE
                        Something...went wrong.

           The wind is sucked out of him.

                                 JASPER
                        Are you sure there’s nothing they  
                        can --

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s over, Jasper.

           Crushed, they hold each other.  

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jasper tucks Nicole into bed.  He gets in with her.  

                                 NICOLE
                        I just want to stay in bed forever.

           She is vulnerable, he is protective, and we...  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Jasper and Nicole sit at the kitchen table.  

                                 NICOLE
                        What if we went away somewhere?  It 
                        was Prague, you said...right?  What 
                        if we went to Prague?
                                 JASPER
                        Now’s not a good time for Prague.

           Jasper has his laptop out, scrolls through “JOBS” on Craigslist.  

                                 NICOLE
                        We could try to sell the pictures?

           ANGLE NICOLE’S PHOTOGRAPHS:  Her pictures are everywhere.  There 
           isn’t an empty space of wall.

           CLOSE IN ON:  “The Kids in the Park.”

                                 JASPER
                        All of them, but that one.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - NIGHT

           Filled with people, Nicole’s photo expo is in full swing.  GUESTS 
           have wine and cheese.  An eclectic crowd, mixed with everyone 
           from Jasper’s Group.

           CU PHOTOGRAPHS:  “HANNAH PRICE” is signed on every one of them.

           ANGLE KEVIN & ANDREA - Standing in front of a PHOTO.

                                 ANDREA
                        I like this.  I’m gonna buy it.

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s a better investment than all 
                        those fluffer-nutters you throw down.

                                 ANDREA
                             (takes a calming breath)
                        Kevin, there’s a possibility I could 
                        lose weight.  I hope I will.  But 
                        you, you’ll never, ever be able to 
                        change your stupid, ugly, smug little 
                        face.  I’ve been taking your shit 
                        since you were 15.  I’m done!

           Kevin is silenced.  Andrea is triumphant.

           FIND JASPER & NICOLE, joined at the hip, talking to their GUESTS.

                                 NICOLE
                        You have so many friends.
                                 JASPER
                        If you don’t know someone’s last 
                        name, “friend” should be used 
                        loosely.

           Roland approaches, holding hands with GUS, stocky, 50’s.

                                 JASPER
                        Roland, this is...

           Jasper looks at Nicole, unsure how to introduce her.

                                 NICOLE
                        Nicole.

                                 JASPER
                        Call her Hannah.

           Ad-lib introductions and hellos.

                                 ROLAND
                        And this is Gus.

                                 JASPER
                        Gus of Gus Cuts?

                                 GUS
                        One and the same.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m thinking about putting a barber 
                        chair in here.  So comfortable.

                                 GUS
                             (smiles)
                        Hannah, I love your work.  I had a 
                        question about that one over there.  

           Nicole takes Gus over to look at a PHOTO.  Roland and Jasper are 
           left alone.  They share a smile.

                                 JASPER
                        I guess you got paroled.

                                 ROLAND
                             (scoffs)
                        They charged me with trespassing   
                        and reckless endangerment.  

           Roland is a different person.  Jasper is impressed. 

                                 ROLAND
                        You’re throwing caution to the wind 
                        with her.  
                                 JASPER
                        I can’t let my life be dictated by 
                        some crazy suicidal drunk...even if 
                        that angry drunk is me.  

                                 ROLAND
                             (a wry smile)
                        Gus and I are leaping off the Space 
                        Needle next week if you want in.

                                 JASPER
                        Tempting, but I’m gonna pass.

           SLOWLY, ALL THE ART DISAPPEARS OFF THE WALL, and we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Jasper and Nicole drink their coffee.  His to-go cup says “Jack,” 
           hers says “Hannah.”  

           They count the checks from the ART SHOW.  

                                 JASPER
                        We should set up a joint account.

                                 NICOLE
                        This is like playing house, except 
                        we’re really playing house.
                             (kisses him)
                        I’m gonna go pick up the forms for 
                        the marriage license.

                                 JASPER
                        I bought you an umbrella.  

           Jasper hands her a new UMBRELLA. 

                                 NICOLE
                             (touched)
                        Coming from you...that’s a beautiful 
                        gesture.

                                 JASPER
                        It went against everything I believe 
                        in...but at least you’ll be dry.

           She accepts the umbrella with a smile and leaves the apartment.
           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT ENTRANCEWAY - DAY

           Jasper opens the mailbox.  One ENVELOPE.  Jasper takes it out  
           and stares at it for a long beat.  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jasper opens the ENVELOPE.  It’s a BILL from the WOMEN’S CLINIC:  

           INSERT BILL:  Totalling $2,600.  It’s itemized, with the biggest 
           charge being for “D & E”.

           QUICK CUT TO:  MOMENTS LATER.  Jasper is on the phone.

                                 JASPER
                        Hi, I’m calling regarding a bill.  
                        Patient Number #4711, Nicole Price.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (V.O.)
                        How can I help you, sir?

                                 JASPER
                        I just want to clarify a charge for  
                        a “D & E,” for $1,600.  What exactly 
                        is a “D & E?”

           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - EVENING

           Jasper sits in the dark.  Nicole enters, armed with groceries.

                                 NICOLE
                        Don’t worry, this meal is very 
                        minimal labor required.  I hope you 
                        like truffle oil.

           Nicole goes over to Jasper, kisses him on the cheek.  

                                 JASPER
                        I just got the bill from the clinic.

                                 NICOLE
                        Oh no, was it really expensive?

                                 JASPER
                        Why didn’t you just tell me?

                                 NICOLE
                        Tell you what?

                                 JASPER
                        Oh, I don’t know...that you had an 
                        abortion?
           She deliberates for a long beat.    

                                 NICOLE
                        The baby wasn’t yours.

           Nicole sits down next to Jasper.  She tries to take his hand.

                                 NICOLE
                        It was before we met, a mistake.  I 
                        didn’t know, I was 12 weeks...
                             (breaks down)
                        I should have told you.  But I  
                        didn’t know how.

                                 JASPER
                             (incredulous)
                        You didn’t know how?  You just do  
                        it, you tell me, that’s how!  

                                 NICOLE
                        If it had been yours, I would’ve kept 
                        it.  I want to have a real baby with 
                        you.  A real family.  You can’t even 
                        comprehend how much I love you.

           In a stupor, Jasper walks out of the room.  Nicole starts to cry.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Jasper sits on the spiral staircase, watching Nicole sleep.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jasper gets dressed in the mirror.  He can’t tie his tie.   
           Nicole comes down the steps.

                                 JASPER
                        Are you sure there’s no one you want 
                        to call, someone to invite?

           ANGLE TIE - Jasper keeps missing the knot.

                                 NICOLE
                        No, what about you?

                                 JASPER
                        Maybe we should...I mean, Rose would 
                        want to be there.
                                 NICOLE
                        We can wait...or, do it now and throw 
                        a party in a few weeks.  I mean... 
                        what if one of us gets cold feet?

           She laughs.  He misses the knot again, and we go to...

           INT. PORTLAND CITY HALL - DAY 

           Filled with COUPLES waiting to be married.  Some are in costume.  
           At the front of the room, a JUDGE administers vows to a FILIPINO 
           COUPLE in a wedding gown and blue tuxedo.

           Jasper and Nicole wait their turn in the audience.  Jasper wears 
           a tie, Nicole in a dress.  She looks beautiful, holds his hand.

           ECU JASPER:  He is lost in thought.

                                 NICOLE
                        Why don’t we go up and see your   
                        Aunt Rose tomorrow?  We can say our 
                        vows again.  We won’t tell her we 
                        already did it.

                                 JASPER
                        You weren’t adopted.

                                 NICOLE
                             (laughs)
                        What?

           Jasper is calm and calculated.

                                 JASPER
                        You.  Were not.  Adopted.

                                 NICOLE
                        Why would I make something like that 
                        up?  That’s -- I mean, who would  
                        ever do that?  I love you, Jasper.

                                 JASPER
                        Trauma at 3 hours old?

                                 NICOLE
                        I didn’t say that, it was my 
                        therapist!  I said she was a saint, 
                        remember?  I love you.

                                 JASPER
                        Stop saying that.
                                 NICOLE
                             (raging)
                        Don’t tell me what to do!  Don’t  
                        tell me what to say!  You don’t know 
                        me.  I would never make something 
                        like this up.

                                 JASPER
                        But you did.

           Jasper stays stone-faced.

           In the front of the Room, the Filipino Couple both says “I DO”.  
           A few people CHEER.

                                 CLERK
                        Mr. Ayles.  Ms. Price.

                                 NICOLE
                        It’s our turn.

           Nicole stands.  She grabs his hand.

                                 JASPER
                        If you were really adopted, thought 
                        life was a gift and your mother was a 
                        saint, I don’t think there’s any way 
                        you could have done what you did, the 
                        way you did it.  Without thinking, a 
                        snap, impulsive decision.  

                                 NICOLE
                        Fuck you!  Who are you to judge?

                                 JASPER
                        To have a “real baby” some day?

                                 NICOLE
                        You knew what I meant.  

                                 JASPER
                        A real baby???

                                 NICOLE
                        You’re really sick.  Such a fucking 
                        loser.

                                 JASPER
                        My aunt wasn’t my real mother but I 
                        was a real kid.

                                 CLERK (O.S.)
                        Mr. Ayles.  Ms. Price.
           A silence between them.  Nicole sits back down with Jasper.

                                 NICOLE
                             (starts to cry)
                        I made it up.  I wanted you to love 
                        me.

           The air is vacuumed out of Jasper’s lungs.

                                 JASPER
                        Did you ever love me?

                                 NICOLE
                        I DO love you.  I do.

                                 JASPER
                        Was all this just for a green card?

                                 NICOLE
                        No.  I love you.

                                 JASPER
                        Stop.  Saying.  That.
                             (then)
                        Does your Visa really expire in  
                        three days?

           Nicole takes a long beat.

                                 NICOLE
                        I’m not from Canada.  

           Jasper laughs in disbelief.  Resigned, he stands up.

                                 NICOLE
                        Do you know how many other men    
                        want me?

           Jasper walks out of City Hall.  Nicole fills with sadness.

                                 NICOLE
                             (barely audible)
                        Don’t leave me.

           EXT. PORTLAND STREETS - NIGHT

           Jasper walks all night with nowhere to go. 

           EXT. PARK - DOWNTOWN PORTLAND - MORNING

           Jasper sits on a bench, watches the KIDS play on a jungle gym.
           PUSH IN ON JASPER:  He’s lost in thought as he watches them.

                                                          FLASH CUT TO:

           THE KIDS IN THE PARK

           Every CHILD wears a different COLORED UNIFORM...RED, YELLOW, 
           WHITE, BLUE...

           Several ADULTS spot for them.  Each wears a DIFFERENT COLOR.

           CU KID:  With tousled, curly hair.  Dressed all in GREEN.  He 
           climbs the jungle gym.  He goes higher and higher.  

           When the Kid reaches the top, he celebrates, safe and out of 
           harms way.  Suddenly, he loses his footing and falls.

           CU JASPER:  The SPOTTER.  He too wears GREEN.  Jasper leaps to 
           his feet, runs toward the Boy with outstretched arms.  He can’t 
           move fast enough, his feet are in quicksand. 

           Jasper dives for the boy, tries to catch him and comes up short.  

           The Boy CRASHES TO THE GROUND.

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           CU JASPER:  AS BEFORE

           Paralyzed in fear.  His eyes are red rimmed and wild.

           BACK TO THE KIDS:  They safely continue to play.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE PORTLAND PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT

           FIND JASPER in the audience of “THE CHERRY ORCHARD.”  It’s so 
           quiet you can hear a pin drop.

           ON STAGE:

                                 ACTOR (TROFIMOV)
                        “Remember, human beings are 
                        constantly progressing.  And their 
                        powers keep growing.  That seems 
                        impossible to us nowadays, when all 
                        we see are problems.” 

           Jasper looks around in disgust; a pressure cooker ready to blow.
                                 JASPER
                             (yells out)
                        Why is nobody laughing?!

           Jasper gets up and pushes his way to the aisle.  The Actors 
           continue the scene as he approaches the stage.  

                                 JASPER
                        This is a comedy!  How does nobody 
                        understand that?

           Jasper CLIMBS UP ONTO THE STAGE -- He walks right INTO THE SCENE.  
           The ACTORS all stop as Jasper snags a bottle of Vodka from the 
           dinner table.  GASPS in the AUDIENCE.  

                                 JASPER
                        This is water!  That’s your problem 
                        right there.

           Jasper is pulled away by several STAGEHANDS.

           INT. JASPER’S LOFT - EVENING

           Jasper enters his loft.  ALL OF NICOLE’S STUFF IS NOW GONE.  
           There is no sign that she was ever here, except for the PICTURE 
           OF THE KIDS IN THE PARK.

           Jasper punches his fist through the frame.  His hand is cut 
           apart, starts bleeding.

           ECU:  “HANNAH” on the picture, covered in broken glass.

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The ALARM BLARES Jasper awake.  Hazy, he puts the LIGHT THERAPY 
           BOX on his chest.  Blinding U.V. RAYS SHINE in his face. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           VARI-SPEED FLUTTERING IMAGES

           Of JASPER’S ROUTINE.  Days?  Weeks?  Months pass?

                                                          SLOW FADE TO:

           INT. WHOLE FOODS - DAY

           Jasper is an absolute disaster.  His hair is matted under his 
           hoodie, it looks like he hasn’t bathed in a while.  
           We FIND HIM in the LIQUOR AISLE, analyzing VODKAS.  He chooses a 
           bottle, opens it, and takes a very large swig.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:  A COUPLE is in the produce section, arguing 
           over the ripeness of fruit.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        We need to stop at the co-op.  They 
                        have better mangoes and flaxseed.

           Jasper takes another swig of the Vodka, just as --

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Jack?

           Jasper turns - The Couple is very happy to see him.  Jasper 
           doesn’t recognize them, but we do.  

           It’s ALEXIS the HOOKER and her HUSBAND.

                                 HUSBAND
                        Alexis and Mark from the Sunburst 
                        Motel!

                                 ALEXIS
                        I don’t think we ever told him our 
                        names.

                                 MARK
                        Mark, bro!

           Jasper just stands there, feeling the effects of the Vodka.  

                                 JASPER
                        What’s the haps?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Guess who’s certified now?

                                 MARK
                        In massage.  You should definitely 
                        book an appointment.

                                 ALEXIS
                        It’s totally legit.  But not totally.  
                             (winks)
                        I still owe you, so we can make it a 
                        little sexy.

                                 MARK
                        A lot sexy, chicken-bear!

                                 JASPER
                        How about right here, right now?
           They both laugh, somewhat uneasy.  Mark hands Jasper a business 
           card that reads “Heavenly Hands.”

                                 MARK
                        Heavenly Hands!  I came up with that.

           Jasper takes another huge swig of Vodka.  

                                 JASPER
                        How ‘bout a shot?

                                 ALEXIS
                        I would, but I’m...

           Alexis rubs her belly to show she’s pregnant.

                                 JASPER
                        Gonna keep it?

                                 ALEXIS
                        Actually, I’m just carrying.

                                 MARK
                        And then we’re gonna give him up for 
                        adoption.  This rich lady already 
                        gave us $20 grand.

                                 JASPER
                        You might be a saint.  
                             (holds up Vodka)
                        To life!

           Jasper hands the Vodka to Mark - He takes a swig.  Jasper puts 
           the half empty bottle back on the shelf, then takes a new one.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jasper stands on the balcony.  The only remnant of his LETTER is 
           the fire stained patio.  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper catches a reflection of himself in the television.  He is 
           wearing the same gray hoodie he has worn the whole movie.

                                 JASPER
                             (full of self loathing)
                        Look at you.  You and your fucking 
                        gray hoodie.
           Jasper loses it.  He wrestles to rip the hoodie off his body.  

                                 JASPER
                        You’re a fucking gray hoodie!!!

           He tears it from the neck down.  The fabric is in shreds and he 
           tosses it away in disgust.  Then he rips off his shirt.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           LATER:  Still shirtless, Jasper puts a needle on a record.  

           “FEELIN’ GROOVY” by SIMON & GARFUNKEL. 

           Jasper sits at his desk.  His box of stationery is OPEN.  A pen 
           is in his hand, he tries to write, but nothing comes to him.  

           Finally, he opens the drawer, takes out the GUN.  He checks the 
           chamber, it’s empty.

           INT. JASPER’S CLOSET - DAY

           MOMENTS LATER:  MUSIC CONTINUES.  Jasper rifles through his 
           closet.  There is stuff packed in from his feet to his head.  

           Jasper reaches up on a shelf, reaches for something, and is 
           avalanched by his hoodies.  

           In the debris, Jasper finds the BOX OF BULLETS.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY 

           Jasper puts a bullet in each chamber.  He thinks about this, 
           pours out all the bullets on the kitchen table.  He puts one 
           bullet in the chamber, clicks it into place.

           Jasper puts the gun in his mouth.  He tries it at several 
           different angles, then bites down on the muzzle.  He takes a swig 
           from a bottle of Vodka.

           Continue to HEAR “FEELIN’ GROOVY”.  

           Jasper places the gun against his temple then his forehead.  
           Holding it there, he starts to cry.
                                 JASPER
                             (laughs through tears)
                        If you show a gun, you have to    
                        fire it.

           He downs another shot of Vodka.  As the song ENDS, he cocks the 
           hammer, readies to blow his brains out the window.

           CU JASPER:  His eyes close.

           THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.  We wait for the GUN SHOT.  A long 
           silence...

           The DOOR BELL RINGS.

           After a beat, there is a KNOCK at the door.  Jasper takes the gun 
           away from his temple. 

           Jasper goes to the door with the gun still in his hand.  He opens 
           the door to the chain-link, puts the gun behind his back.

                                 JASPER
                             (through the chain)
                        Hello?

                                 WOMAN
                        It’s Lindsey Whitehead.
                             (beat)
                        ...Mary’s daughter.

           Jasper can make out Lindsey through the chain-link.  He looks 
           down and sees the shoes of a LITTLE KID.

           Jasper drops the gun in a potted plant.

           He composes himself, takes a deep breath and opens the door to 
           REVEAL:

           LINDSEY, and ETHAN, a 3 year-old with full locks of curly hair.  
           (NOTE:  Ethan will be played by the same actor as the kid from 
           the jungle gym in Jasper’s fantasy).  

           Jasper is in disbelief.  How the hell is she here?  Almost 
           surreal.  An awkward beat, he ushers them in.  

           She sees he’s not wearing a shirt, how out of sorts he is.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Are we interrupting something?

                                 JASPER
                        No.  Sorry about my outfit.  I 
                        was...meditating.
           A long beat.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Ethan, this is your Uncle Jasper.

           Jasper bends down to Ethan’s level.  He shakes the boy’s tiny 
           hand.  He has no idea what to say to a kid.

                                 JASPER
                        Hi.

                                 ETHAN
                        You have funny ears.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ve always thought that, too.

           Lindsey laughs.  Then, a long, tense silence.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I found this.

           From her purse, Lindsey hands him an old, beat-up photo.

           It’s a PICTURE OF JASPER, at 2, held by a happy MARY.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You look about two years old.  It 
                        says 1984 on the back.  

           Jasper is mesmerized by the picture.  

           ZOOM IN ON THE PHOTO:  Young Jasper is beaming.  There is a 
           stuffed animal in his hand.  It’s a LION.

           Jasper looks across the apartment.

           ECU:  The same stuffed LION is on Jasper’s book shelf.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Maybe we can let Ethan watch some tv.

           Jasper puts on the TV.  Lindsey plops Ethan down on the couch, 
           then turns to Jasper.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I owe you...such an apology.

                                 JASPER
                        No, you don’t.  I was so out of line.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I just had no idea.  She never, ever 
                        mentioned anything to me.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LINDSEY (CONT'D)
                        Or my father.  How could she...do 
                        that?
                        She should be ashamed.  I’m ashamed.

                                 JASPER
                        You didn’t do anything to be ashamed 
                        of.

           Lindsey takes a long pause.

                                 LINDSEY
                        She was a good mother...to me.  But 
                        now I just don’t think I can ever --

                                 JASPER
                        Let her be the way she was then.

                                 LINDSEY
                        You must hate me.  Why did I...get 
                        the good Mary?

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t hate you.  And I don’t...want 
                        to hate her.

           Lindsey smiles at Ethan.

                                 LINDSEY
                        She was an amazing grandmother.

           Jasper looks over at Ethan, who is peeling off self-adhesive 
           stamps and sticking them to Jasper’s furniture.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’m sorry, he’s wasting your stamps.

                                 JASPER
                        It’s ok, I hate stamps.

           Jasper looks at Lindsey with amazement and gratitude.

                                 JASPER
                        Did you come here to rescue me?

                                 LINDSEY
                        I want to know you, Jasper.

                                 JASPER
                        And that’s all I want.
           EXT. PARK - DAY

           Jasper has showered and changed.  He and Lindsey watch Ethan on 
           the jungle gym with the other kids.

                                 JASPER
                        How long are you in town?

                                 LINDSEY
                        I don’t go back to school for a few 
                        weeks.  We’re staying with a friend 
                        of mine who just moved here.

                                 JASPER
                        You’re welcome to stay with me.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Thanks.  Maybe we’ll split it up.

                                 JASPER
                        I think you should meet Rose.

                                 LINDSEY
                        My Aunt.  Does she still live in 
                        Australia?

           Jasper starts to laugh.  Lindsey realizes why and laughs too.

           ANGLE ETHAN:  He triumphantly reaches the top of the jungle gym.

           Nobody is falling or cracking their skull.  

           Jasper is filled with happy tears.

                                 JASPER
                             (smiles at them)
                        We have so much time to make up for.

           EXT. FERRY - DAY

           Jasper, Lindsey and Ethan stand on the bow.  Jasper holds Ethan, 
           points out at Puget Sound.  

           Calm comes over Jasper as the wind whips through their hair.

           EXT. AUNT ROSE’S HOUSE - BAINBRIDGE ISLAND - DAY

           Rose greets them out on the porch.  Hugs all around.  She looks 
           at Lindsey with a wistful nostalgia.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        You look just like her.
                                 LINDSEY
                        She used to say I looked like you.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I wish.  Where did she tell you I 
                        was?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Australia.

           This is hard even for Rose to believe.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’ve come to realize she was a  
                        little bit of a liar.

                                 JASPER
                        I have an Achilles heel for women  
                        who lie.

           Rose kneels down to properly meet Ethan.  She hands him $20 in 
           quarters, which is more money than the kid’s ever seen.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I’m your Auntie Rose, and I’m gonna 
                        spoil you stupid.

           INT. RUSTY SKUPPER BAR - BAINBRIDGE ISLAND - DAY

           Ethan sits on Jasper’s shoulders.  He hands Ethan the ball, the 
           kid shoot baskets on the pop-a-shot.  They cheer on every shot.  

           Rose and Lindsey drink beers at the bar.  The Mariners play the 
           White Sox on TV.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        So...is there a Mr. Lindsey?

                                 LINDSEY
                        Zack.  He forgot to pull out.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I love that, when they “forget”.  
                        It’s not like you didn’t remind him 
                        12 times during.

                                 LINDSEY
                             (laughs)
                        I know, right?

           Rose laughs, then takes Lindsey’s hand.
                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I loved your mother.  But, she 
                        couldn’t be in my life.  Not after 
                        him.

           They both look over at Jasper playing with Ethan.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        ...then, after all those years, it 
                        was too late for us.  You were what 
                        she needed and she was finally ready.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I can’t believe she never told my 
                        dad.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        She had to hide from it.

           Lindsey starts to tear up.  So does Rose.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I wish you knew the Mary I knew.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I knew that Mary...

           Her voice trails off.  Rose won’t let herself go there.  She 
           quickly puts up her guard.  

                                 AUNT ROSE
                             (looks up at the tv)
                        Mother-fucker!  How the hell do they 
                        strand 1st and 3rd with no outs?

           EXT. DOCK - BAINBRIDGE - DAY

           A FOGHORN in the distance as Rose kisses them each good-bye.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        Next time you guys come, I’ll make  
                        my famous gumbo.

                                 ETHAN
                        I’m glad you’re back from Australia.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                             (a wry smile)
                        Me too.

           Lindsey picks Ethan up, gives Rose a moment alone with Jasper.
                                 AUNT ROSE
                        I’m sorry, Jazzy, I thought I was --

                                 JASPER
                        You did what you had to do.

                                 AUNT ROSE
                        And you became the most important 
                        thing in my life. 

           Rose hugs Jasper with everything she has.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           OVER BLACK, WE HEAR...

                                 JASPER’S VOICE
                        “If you always do what you’ve always 
                        done, you’ll always get what you’ve
                        always gotten.”  

           INT. JASPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The ALARM CLOCK BEEPS.  Jasper grabs his LIGHT THERAPY BOX.  He 
           tears it out of the wall and buries it in the trash.

           INT. CLOSET - MORNING

           Jasper chooses a DIFFERENT OUTFIT to wear.  The hoodies are gone. 

           INT. JASPER’S KITCHEN - MORNING

           Jasper discards the Grape Nuts.  

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Jasper CLOSES THE BIRD CAGE DOOR and the WINDOW.

           EXT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           It is a perfect Sunny day.  Jasper takes a step into the street.  
           Just as, the bevy of CYCLISTS FLY BY HIM.  

           CU JASPER:  He breathes it in as they PASS HIM ON ALL SIDES.  
           EXT. STEEL BRIDGE - DAY

           In shorts, Jasper rides his bike in tandem with the other 
           CYCLISTS, over the Steel Bridge, continues on through the city, 
           enjoying the sunshine.  

           PUSH IN ON JASPER:  He is all smiles, full of life.

           EXT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - EVENING

           Jasper rolls up on his bike.  He opens the door to the barber 
           shop.  They are in the middle of Group.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m sorry, I don’t mean to break up 
                        the circle, but I need to take a 
                        little sabbatical.  Beautiful day, 
                        gotta get to it.

           Jasper rides off, filled with purpose.  Roland is proud of him.  
           The rest of the Group is too, if a bit envious of his freedom.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. PORTLAND STREET - EVENING

           Jasper walks with an air of confidence. 

           CU JASPER:  He is finding his mojo.  In a nice blue shirt, he   
           is giving it some effort and looks good.  He is vibrant. 

           INSERT - He holds the “KIDS IN THE PARK” picture.  The frame is 
           still broken.

           Jasper looks across the street - sees The Bitter End Pub.       

           INT. THE BITTER END PUB - EVENING

           OPEN TIGHT ON NICOLE 

           Flirting with a GUY at the bar.

                                 NICOLE
                        Me too, I grew up in Chicago!  
                        Youngest of 5 brothers and sisters.

                                 MAN
                        Wow, big family.
                                 NICOLE
                        So, here’s the deal.  I think it’ll 
                        probably take me about three weeks, 
                        but I’m pretty sure you’re gonna ask 
                        me out.  But who knows if I’ll still 
                        be here in three weeks, so...let’s 
                        just say tonight.

                                                        CUT OUTSIDE TO:

           EXT. THE BITTER END PUB - SAME TIME

           Jasper, watching Nicole through the window.  He hasn’t heard her 
           words.  He doesn’t need to.  Her light, carefree smile and 
           seductive flirtation tells it all.

           Jasper sets the PHOTOGRAPH down in the doorway of the Bitter End.  

           CU JASPER:  The relieved smile of a man who has just dodged a 
           bullet.  He picks up the pace with a new lease on life.

           EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Jasper trots up the steps of a little craftsman house in the 
           Goose Hollow neighborhood of Portland.  

           INT. HOUSE - EVENING

           Lindsey opens the door.  Ethan comes like a bat out of hell at 
           Jasper, over the moon to see his uncle.  Jasper matadors out of 
           the little devil’s path, saving his own balls at the last moment.

                                 LINDSEY
                        Agile.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m a little bit of an athlete.

           She laughs, escorts him in.

                                 JASPER
                        I like this place.

                                 LINDSEY
                        My friend’s letting us stay for    
                        the summer.  I may take a few  
                        classes at Reed.

           Lindsey escorts Jasper outside into the backyard. 
           EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

           Ethan charges past them, chasing around a fat French bulldog.  

                                 LINDSEY
                        He’s obsessed with that dog.

           Jasper and Lindsey sit down on deck chairs.  She hands him a beer 
           from a cooler.

                                 JASPER
                        You know, I was thinking, some day, 
                        maybe you could put me as Ethan’s 
                        emergency contact.

                                 LINDSEY
                        I’d love to, but --

                                 JASPER
                        But what?

                                 LINDSEY
                        You’re not supposed to put a family 
                        member as your contact.

           Lindsey kisses him on the cheek.  Jasper is finally at peace.  
           He’s found HOME.

           INT. GUS CUTS BARBER SHOP - MORNING

           Gus finishes cutting Jasper’s hair.  He turns him around to look 
           at himself in the mirror.  Jasper likes what he sees.  He reaches 
           for his wallet.

                                 GUS
                        The first one’s on the house.

                                 JASPER
                        I insist.  I’m fairly certain I’m 
                        gonna win the lottery in a few years.

           INT. POWELL’S BOOKSTORE - DAY

           Jasper appears in front of Gwen at the counter.  He is in full 
           cyclist gear, and he’s owning it.

                                 GWEN
                        I thought the club was over.  Wait --
                        Why are you tan and what are you 
                        wearing?

           Jasper looks down at his farmer tan and outfit.
                                 JASPER
                        I’m kind of a cyclist now.
                             (swigs from his water bottle)
                        Can I have my books back?

                                 GWEN
                        You should probably wait until they 
                        go on sale.

                                 JASPER
                        What?

                                 GWEN
                        You kept them in such good condition, 
                        we’re selling it all at full price.

                                 JASPER
                        They’re my books.

                                 GWEN
                        They were.  Now they’re ours.

                                 JASPER
                        I’ll buy everything back.

           Gwen bends down, picks up the BOX of Jasper’s BOOKS and puts them 
           on the counter.

                                 JASPER
                        They’re not even on display.

                                 GWEN
                        Want’em or not?

           A beat.

                                 JASPER
                        That’s just criminal.

                                 GWEN
                        So are your shorts.

           Finally, Gwen laughs and hands over the RUSSIAN LITERATURE.  

           Jasper peers into the box.  He takes a pause.

                                 JASPER
                        You know what...sell them.

                                 GWEN
                        Seriously?

                                 JASPER
                        It’s time to melt the snow.
           Gwen smiles at this.  Jasper stares at her for a long beat.

                                 JASPER
                        You wanna...maybe get coffee with   
                        me sometime?

                                 GWEN
                        I’ve had coffee with you before.

                                 JASPER
                        No, like “coffee” coffee.

           She regards him curiously.

           They both just stand there, smiling at each other.

                                 JASPER
                        How about now?

                                 GWEN
                        Easy, bro.  Some of us have jobs.

                                 JASPER
                        What time do you get off?

                                 GWEN

                                 JASPER
                        Stumptown Coffee, 6:08.

                                 GWEN
                        At 6:12, I leave.  You got a four 
                        minute window.

           She playfully shoos him away, and we go to...

           INT. STUMPTOWN COFFEE - NIGHT

           Jasper and Gwen wait for their coffee.

                                 GWEN
                        Your hair looks better.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m not saying shit about yours.

                                 GWEN
                        Still moving away?

                                 JASPER
                        That’s kind of on hold right now.
                                 GWEN
                        Wherever you go, you still gotta be 
                        you.

           Jasper takes this in.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m restarting my dissertation.

                                 GWEN
                        Is this one gonna be pretentious and 
                        long winded?

                                 JASPER
                        Probably.  All I need now is a new 
                        topic.

           Kenny, the barista, calls out to Jasper.

                                 KENNY
                        “Jasper?”  That’s a good name for 
                        you.

                                 JASPER
                        Let’s try it for a while, Kenny.

           Jasper and Gwen get two cups with “Jasper” written on them and 
           exit Stumptown Coffee.

           EXT. STUMPTOWN COFFEE - CONTINUOUS

           A slab of wet cement has just been laid down on the sidewalk.  
           Gwen takes off her shoes, hands them to Jasper.

           ANGLE GWEN:  She steps barefoot in the wet cement.

                                 GWEN
                        You gotta make your mark wherever  
                        you can.

           Jasper loves this.  He takes off his shoes and socks and plants 
           his feet into the wet cement.  Then, they each sign their names 
           next to their prints.

           They clean off their feet, start to put their shoes back on.  
           Gwen ties Jasper’s shoes.  He finds it endearing.

           Jasper & Gwen walk off together, with nothing but potential ahead 
           of them.

                                                              FADE OUT.
           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Jasper enters.  He hears a SOUND and glances at the bird cage.

           CU PRETTY WHITE BIRD:  Sitting on his perch inside.

           Jasper isn’t surprised to see the bird.  Actually, it’s kind of 
           obvious to him.

                                 JASPER
                        Hey, Tony.

           INT. JASPER’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Jasper sits down at his desk.  He takes out his LETTERHEAD 
           STATIONERY and begins to write.

                                 JASPER’S VOICE
                        “Dear 20 year-old Jasper...Your 
                        mother is still alive.  Go find her.  
                        Maybe she doesn’t deserve a second 
                        chance, but you do.  She will lead 
                        you home.  Your life depends on 
                        it...”

           He keeps writing, the words flow out of him, and we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           PITCH BLACK. 

           Then, a LIGHT at the end of the TUNNEL.

           POV - FROM THE INSIDE OF A MAILBOX

           The mailbox opens, and we see 20 YEAR-OLD JASPER.  

           He reaches in and pulls out the same ENVELOPE we just saw.

           PUSH IN ON 20 YEAR-OLD JASPER:  Bright eyed and full of 
           innocence.  

           He opens the envelope and takes out the LETTER.

           HOLD ON 20 YEAR-OLD JASPER’s FACE as he reads, and we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                            THE END
