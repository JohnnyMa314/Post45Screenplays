           INT. PRIUS - NIGHT

           JAY, (27, friendly and responsible), is driving. His 
           girlfriend CAITLIN, (26, attractive) rides shotgun. They ride 
           in silence. The kind of silence that is earned. Silence that 
           only exists when two souls are in love.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay. I’m seeing someone.

                                 JAY
                        (playing along) Yeah? Me too. You 
                        thinking Orgy? Partner swap? Little 
                        Chinese Fire Drill action? 

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay, please don’t make a joke right 
                        now. I’m seeing someone.

                                 JAY
                             (confused)
                        You mean like a therapist?

                                 CAITLIN
                        No, Jay, I’m seeing someone...else. 
                        I wanted to tell you sooner but... 

           This is hard for her. More silence. Panic rising.

                                 JAY
                        Wait, wait. Are you telling me that 
                        you are banging another dude? Is 
                        that what is happening right now?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay --

                                 JAY
                        Are you sleeping with someone else?

                                 CAITLIN
                        That’s not the point. The point is - 

                                 JAY
                        WHO IS IT?

           Jay looks like he’s about to lose his biscuits. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        (Very calm) Who. Is. It. 

           Long pause.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        (Not calm at all) Look, Caitlin, up 
                        until about three minutes ago I 
                        still thought you were moving in. I 
                        honestly was kinda hoping to marry 
                        you. I love you. 

           Jay takes a moment to collect himself.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So, would you please tell me who 
                        you have been fucking on the side 
                        while I’ve been planning our lives 
                        together? (long pause) If you don’t 
                        say a name in five seconds, I’m 
                        gonna wreck the car into something.

           5, 4, 3, 2...Jay puts on his seatbelt while staring at her 
           and begins slowly turning the wheel.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

                                 CAITLIN (O.S.)
                        JAY!!!

           The Prius CRUSHES itself into a pole.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Ugh. Ugh.

           INT. PRIUS - NIGHT

           The airbags have been DEPLOYED. Jay looks rattled and a 
           little busted up. His forehead is BLEEDING. Caitlin is 
           TOTALLY FINE.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay! Are you crazy?! You could have 
                        killed us!

                                 JAY
                        Who is it?

                                 CAITLIN
                             (sighs)
                        It’s no one in particular. I don’t 
                        know why I said that, but you 
                        didn’t let me explain myself. For 
                        the past few months I’ve been 
                        trying to act like I was single to 
                        see if it felt more comfortable. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAITLIN (CONT'D)
                        We’ve been growing apart, you can’t 
                        deny that. I wasn’t sure what I 
                        wanted, so I told myself to see 
                        some other people. See what that 
                        was like, then reevaluate us. Does 
                        that make sense? I’m so sorry Jay, 
                        but I can’t do this anymore. I 
                        can’t be in a relationship with 
                        anyone right now. Please say 
                        something.

           Jay closes his eyes. Like he’s focusing on the perfect thing 
           to say to win her back. But instead, he promptly passes out 
           into the deployed airbag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN STREET - 40 MINUTES LATER

           Jay is on a stretcher and being wheeled into an ambulance by 
           a PARAMEDIC. He is in a neck brace and thus can only look 
           straight ahead. Caitlin walks alongside as a crowd gathers to 
           see the accident. 

                                 JAY
                        I don’t believe this. The shit you 
                        just pulled, and I’m the one going 
                        to the hospital. Look at you, not 
                        even a scratch. Do you have a 
                        headache? 

           He’s clearly woozy from the crash. She touches his arm. 
           Slightly confused.

                                 CAITLIN
                        What do you mean?

                                 JAY
                        I’m asking if the impact from the 
                        collision has at least given you a 
                        headache.

                                 CAITLIN
                        I’m sorry Jay, I’m not sure what 
                        else to say...I look at you and you 
                        have no doubts about me, but I just 
                        don’t feel the same anymore. I 
                        can’t help the way I feel.

                                 JAY
                        Does your head hurt?
                                 CAITLIN 
                        Jay--

                                 JAY
                        Does your head hurt? Tell me you 
                        have a headache. Do you have a 
                        headache?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay, I’m trying to explain myself 
                        to you. 

                                 JAY
                        (sternly) Please just say you have 
                        a headache.

                                 CAITLIN
                        OK fine! I have a headache. There, 
                        are you happy?

                                 JAY
                        Do you actually have a headache?

                                 CAITLIN
                        No.

           Caitlin walks away as the paramedic loads Jay into the 
           ambulance. The doors close.

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                             FUUUUUUCKKK YOUUUUUUU

           As Jay’s long, muffled “FUCK YOU” is still being screamed 
           from inside the ambulance.

           TITLE CARD: THE KILLING SPREE

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           ECU on a web browser. iTunes opens and the mouse double 
           clicks “Nothing Compares 2 U” by Sinead O’Connor. The pitiful 
           song begins to play as the OPENING CREDITS ROLL. 

           Now Safari is opened. A few taps of the keyboard as F-A-C-E 
           is being typed into the browser. Enter. 

           FACEBOOK.COM

           The mouse stops inside the “search” box. Click. A blinking 
           cursor. The sounds of typing. C-A-I-T-L-I-N. “Caitlin Pratt” 
           is highlighted in blue. 88 mutual friends. Click.

           CAITLIN’s Facebook profile. 
           Hardcore facebook stalking ensues. Photos, status updates, 
           info, likes, etc. Now photo after photo of Jay and Caitlin as 
           a happy couple. 

           The mouse clicks on a photo album entitled “Spring Break.” We 
           begin blasting through photos until we stop on a bikini shot 
           of Caitlin. We stare at this photo for an uncomfortable 
           amount of time. 

           A new tab opens.

           PORNHUB.COM

           The search box is filled with “skinny blonde spring break.” 
           We scroll down to some of the options presented, then back up 
           to the search box. Those words are then deleted and replaced 
           with a weirdly specific description. “skinny blonde with 
           reassuring smile, playful eyes, not too tan but not pale.” NO 
           RESULTS.

           Back to Facebook. Jay clicks on his own profile. He looks 
           DEEPLY UNHAPPY in his profile picture. 

           Jay updates his status, types in a quote: “tomorrow is just 
           another lonely day” - Ben Harper. 

           We go through a few more pictures of a bleak few months, 
           until we HOLD on a tagged photo of Jay at dinner looking like 
           a DOWNER while everyone else couldn’t seem happier. The 
           picture comes to life. END CREDITS.

           SUPER: TWO PATHETIC MONTHS POST-BREAKUP

           INT - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Meet Jay’s crew. On Jay’s side of the table - DICKIE (27, 
           fast-talker) and WES (27, very attractive, and very dumb). 
           Seated across from them are DAVE (27, ex-frat dog, 
           dependable) and his girlfriend MAGGIE (25, cool).

                                 DICKIE
                        What’s the over-under on number of 
                        words spoken by Jay tonight?

                                 WES
                        Ten words.

                                 DAVE
                        You kidding? I’ll take the under. 
                        What about you, Mags?

           Two girls walk past the table. Dickie flashes them a quick 
           smile and tracks them as they saddle up to the bar.
                                 MAGGIE
                        You three haven’t shut up all 
                        night, no one else could get a word 
                        in anyways.

                                 WES
                        Please don’t defend him. Dickie, 
                        over / under?

                                 DICKIE
                        Over. You guys are forgetting about 
                        his exchange with the waitress. 
                        (Counting off) ‘I’ll. Have. A. 
                        Side. Salad. Cause. I’m. A. Giant. 
                        Fucking. Pussy’...that’s eleven 
                        words.

           Dickie stands up and motions to the two girls who just walked 
           in.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get us some drinks. Wes, 
                        come with me. 

           They make their way to the bar, leaving Jay alone with Dave 
           and Maggie.

                                 DAVE
                        Alright, what’s wrong?

                                 JAY
                        Nothing. I’m good. Just kinda 
                        tired.

                                 DAVE
                        You’ve been sitting here thinking 
                        about Caitlin all night haven’t 
                        you?

                                 JAY
                        Yep. The entire night. I can’t stop 
                        looking at her facebook photos on 
                        my phone. It’s taking over my life.

           He holds up his iPhone with Caitlin’s Facebook profile on his 
           screen.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That sucks.

                                 DAVE
                        The internet age has been a giant 
                        step backwards for heartbroken 
                        dudes, huh.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Used to be, when our folks were 
                        young, you just lost the girl’s 
                        number and you never saw them 
                        again. Now, there are pictures of 
                        these broads everywhere. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Don’t say “broads.”

                                 JAY
                        I stare at her pictures and concoct 
                        these insane scenarios that always 
                        end with her in some weird sex 
                        party on a yacht or in a grotto or 
                        something.

                                 MAGGIE
                        (genuine) Aww, you gotta stop. 
                        Maybe you should defriend her? 

                                 DAVE 
                        Don’t do that. That looks terrible. 
                        You realize you’re losing this 
                        breakup right? Caitlin is out there 
                        running around, having a good ol 
                        time. What are you doing? Sitting 
                        here like a little bitch.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dave!

                                 DAVE
                        No, I’m being serious. This has 
                        gotta stop...Tonight. Maggie, don’t 
                        take this the wrong way, but you 
                        can’t come out with us tonight. 
                        We’re going out as a pack of dudes 
                        and getting Jay laid.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You promised we were going to stay 
                        in tonight. You can’t be hungover 
                        for brunch with my mom.

                                 DAVE
                        Duty calls, babe.

           Maggie doesn’t say anything, but she is pissed.

                                 JAY
                        Appreciate the thought, but I’m not 
                        going out.
                                 DICKIE (O.S.)
                        Bull shit!

           Dickie and Wes return with beers.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Johnny Cashmere’s having a ripper 
                        tonight. It’s going to get real 
                        weird. You’re coming.

                                 JAY
                        I’m going home and I’m going to 
                        bed, ok. Don’t give me shit. Not up 
                        for debate.

           It’s obvious he’s not going to budge.

                                 DAVE
                        (To Maggie) I was just kidding 
                        about going out. Let’s just go home 
                        and watch a movie. Be fresh for 
                        brunch.

           Dave tries to kiss Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ew, get away from me.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           POV from the street through the window of a house - Caitlin 
           is making herself some dinner. PULL OUT to reveal we’re 
           seeing it from Jay’s eyes. He’s in his car, idling for a 
           minute outside. His face looks pained before he drives off. 

           INT. JAY’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Jay sits in front of his laptop. We HOLD on a framed photo of 
           Jay, Dave, Dickie and Wes at their high school graduation. 
           Tucked into the corner is a picture of Caitlin. 

           He’s going through pictures of her on Facebook. Looking at 
           his phone, we see a series of text messages he’s previously 
           sent to Caitlin - ‘what was the name of that restaurant in 
           Palm Springs? Such a great night...’, and ‘do you still go 
           houseboating?’. All of which she has NOT responded to. 

           He begins typing up another text, “I miss you” but thinks 
           better of it and puts his phone away. Jay kills the lights 
           and crawls into bed with his laptop.

           Back to Facebook. 
           We stop on a photo of Caitlin standing with KOBE BRYANT.  She 
           is wearing khakis, a polo, and has credentials around her 
           neck. They are in the Lakers’ locker room immediately 
           following a game.  

           Jay rolls over to go to bed as the picture comes to life and 
           we fade into...

           INT. LOS ANGELES LAKERS’ LOCKER ROOM - JAY’S NIGHTMARE

           Kobe Bryant and Caitlin begin passionately KISSING EACH 
           OTHER.  

           Then DWIGHT HOWARD and RON ARTEST come out of the shower, 
           with only tiny towels covering their HAMMERS. 

           They join in the action. Artest takes off Caitlin’s shirt as 
           Howard begins kissing her neck.  

           Next, a couple of ROOKIES wander in. This is slowly turning 
           into an ORGY.

           Head Coach MIKE BROWN sits to the side with a clipboard 
           taking notes and recording on video. All of a sudden he looks 
           up angrily and THROWS the clipboard to the ground as we --

           INT. JAY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jay wakes up in a cold sweat from the nightmare. He looks 
           over at the glare from his laptop, still open to the picture 
           of Caitlin and Kobe. Jay closes the computer and stares up at 
           the ceiling. It’s going to be (another) long night. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WORK PLACE, ESTABLISHING

           Jay walks through the doors of his office lobby, dragging his 
           bag behind him. He is greeted by the male RECEPTIONIST.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        ‘Morning, Jay.

                                 JAY
                        ‘Morning, Barry.

                                 BARRY
                        You catch that Laker game last 
                        night?
           Jay puts his head down and continues to the elevators. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAY’S CUBICLE - MORNING

           CLOSE on his computer as Jay browses gmail. To the left, we 
           see Caitlin is on g-chat. 

           The mouse hovers over her name and the icon expands. Status 
           message reads, “sore from yoga.” Jay sighs, resigned. He 
           clicks the box to write her a message. 

           He types, “Dear Caitlin. You are a dirty, rotten whore. I 
           hope your soreness is not from yoga but from a gang rape. 
           Also, I never told you this but I hate your mom and dad. Burn 
           in hell...Nevermind. I didn’t mean that. I’m so sorry. You’re 
           perfect, I love you.” He then highlights it, and deletes the 
           text. 

           A gchat pops up from Dave, as he closes the box to Caitlin. 
           “Stop thinking about Caitlin! I’m starting to think you have 
           PTSD”. 

           He doesn’t respond. Instead, he takes out his phone and goes 
           to the photo library, opening an album of “Caitlin” pics. He 
           stops at a TOPLESS photo of Caitlin, smiling bashfully at the 
           camera. He stares at the photo for a while. We can’t tell 
           what he’s thinking. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAITLIN’S KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)

           As some upbeat Van Morrison plays, Jay and Caitlin laugh 
           while attempting to bake. 

                                 JAY
                        You’re all filthy.

           Caitlin takes a step back.

                                 CAITLIN 
                             (smiling)
                        Oh yeah? 

           She takes off her shirt, standing topless in front of him. 

                                 CAITLIN (CONT’D)
                        How about now? 
           They start making out and --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM STALL, JAY’S OFFICE (PRESENT)

           Jay is sitting on the toilet, MASTURBATING and CRYING while 
           starting at the picture.

                                 BARRY
                        Uhh, Jay is that you? Are you ok in 
                        there? One of the interns said they 
                        heard someone crying.

           Jay just closes his eyes. Another lost day. 

           INT. O’BRIENS - NEXT NIGHT

           The guys and Maggie sit in a booth at a local watering hole, 
           a couple empty car bombs in front of them. Dave comes back 
           from the bar with five fresh beers. 

           The rest of the crew nods to him. Dave nods back.

                                 DAVE
                        Ok, look Jay. We brought you out 
                        tonight for a reason, and if this 
                        feels like an intervention, that’s 
                        because it’s exactly what it is.

                                 DICKIE
                        We know your heart’s broken. It 
                        sucks. But it’s officially time to 
                        move on. Phase 1 is over. That was 
                        the “you’re embarrassing yourself 
                        and all of us”, phase. 

                                 WES
                        The jig is up.

                                 DICKIE
                        It’s time for phase 2 to finally 
                        kick in. You’ve gotta bang other 
                        chicks. 

                                 WES
                        Fuck somebody dude!

                                 DAVE
                        Wes is right - if you don’t start 
                        sleeping with other girls you’re 
                        never going to get over this. 
                                 JAY
                        I’m not ready. 

                                 DICKIE
                        I’m going to ask you a question. 
                        Answer honestly: how many girls 
                        have you slept with in your life?

                                 JAY 
                        I don’t know, I’ve never really 
                        thought about it or added up my 
                        total...

                                 MAGGIE
                        Dude. We all know your total.

                                 DAVE
                        We’ve known each other our whole 
                        lives Jay, we all know the answer.

                                 JAY
                        Then why are you asking me if you 
                        already know the answer?! (everyone 
                        stares at him). Ok, fine. Three 
                        girls. 

                                 WES
                        That’s not a high number.

                                 DAVE
                        I slept with 3 girls my first week 
                        of college. (To Maggie) Sorry.

                                 MAGGIE
                             (shrugs)
                        So did I. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Humor us...who did you lose your 
                        virginity to?

                                 DICKIE
                        Right. And how long did you end up 
                        dating her, all told?

                                 JAY
                        Seven years. 
                                 DICKIE
                        Yep. Then you broke up sophomore 
                        year, and two weeks later you 
                        started dating...

                        Who you dated for the rest of 
                        college plus one year after we 
                        moved out here. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Until you inevitably broke up. Then 
                        you were single for a total of one 
                        month until you met the C word. 

                                 WES
                        He means both ‘Caitlin’ and ‘Cunt’. 
                        But for the same person. 

                                 JAY
                        Ok, ok, point taken. But I don’t 
                        know if I’m ready to just jump in --

                                 WES
                        You’re ready. You can’t keep going 
                        at this pace. 

                                 DAVE
                        Maggie, back us up here.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Honestly, I think you’ve got to get 
                        back out there. It’s really boring 
                        hanging out with you now when 
                        you’re all mopey. (beat) Sorry.

                                 JAY
                        I’m trying, guys, I really am. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Are you though? She’s not gonna 
                        come back. 

           The guys all look to Maggie as if she has the definitive 
           answer. She shrugs.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She’s not. Sorry Jay. 
                                 JAY
                        Yeah but she might - she didn’t 
                        leave me for somebody else, she 
                        broke up with me because she didn’t 
                        want to be in relationship with 
                        anyone. Once she figures out her 
                        issues, I feel like she could 
                        realize what we had and come back.

                                 MAGGIE
                        That’s...probably not going to 
                        happen.

                                 DICKIE
                        It’s over, bro.

                                 WES
                        Over.

                                 DAVE
                        Listen, the last thing I’d ever do 
                        in my entire life is take 
                        relationship advice from ‘Of Mice 
                        and Men’ over here, but they’re 
                        right. You’ve gotta get angry! 

                                 WES
                        You know what I used to do when I 
                        got crushed by Samantha? Whenever I 
                        would start thinking about her and 
                        the rotten things she did to my 
                        heart, I’d put on DMX’s “Ruff 
                        Ryder’s Anthem” and cruise the 
                        town. Just get in that murderous 
                        frame of mind. 

                                 DAVE
                        Samantha, that girl who worked at 
                        Robek’s? You dated her for like a 
                        week.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Didn’t you break up with her?

                                 DICKIE
                        You know what you need to do? (to 
                        Wes and Dave) You know what he 
                        needs to do? Killing Spree. 

           On the brink of a revelation.

                                 DAVE
                        He’s right. 
                                 JAY
                        A killing spree?

                                 DICKIE
                        It’s an old strategy made famous by 
                        Cherokee warriors. Essentially, you 
                        need to bang literally every single 
                        girl in a 5 mile radius, with 
                        reckless abandon. Like in the movie 
                        “Kids”.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ok first of all, gross. But second 
                        of all I actually read an article 
                        about this, that the best way to 
                        get over someone is to have a bunch 
                        of meaningless hook-ups. 

                                 WES
                        Everyone knows this. 

                                 DICKIE
                        What separates a killing spree from 
                        just going out and trying to get 
                        laid is that the spree has the 
                        single-minded goal of getting over 
                        a chick. It’s about your numbers, 
                        plain and simple. The more girls 
                        you take down the less you think 
                        about Caitlin.

                                 JAY
                        I don’t know, I don’t think I can 
                        do that. Just thinking about being 
                        with another girl makes me 
                        physically ill. 

           The gang stares.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I mean, I’ll give it a shot or 
                        whatever. 

                                 GROUP
                        YEAH! Good enough for me. 

           They all clink their beers.

                                 DICKIE
                        Ok, look, Wes and I are going to 
                        work the room a bit for you, get 
                        you a good hand of cards to play 
                        with. 
                                 WES
                        Let’s get out there and wheel some 
                        broads.

           A Top 40 rap monster kicks in and we -

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. O’BRIENS - LATER

           Dickie and Wes are running game on a group of hipster girls. 
           Jay is on the sidelines, clutching a whiskey. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Hold up - (to GIRL 1) - you really 
                        remind me of someone. I can’t put 
                        my finger on it but it’s someone 
                        obvious. I’m serious, it’s actually 
                        really bothering me. Do people ever 
                        say you look like anyone?

                                 HOT HIPSTER 1
                        Hmm, I don’t know...sometimes, I 
                        guess?

                                 DICKIE
                        Wait. I got it. “Full House”.

           Off her confused look.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        You look just like that girl from 
                        Full House. 

           She is confused. Stephanie Tanner? Uncle Jessie’s wife? 

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Wes)
                        The annoying neighbor. What was her 
                        name?

                                 WES
                        Kimmy Gibler!

                                 DICKIE
                        Yes! Bingo! You look exactly like 
                        Kimmy. Gibler. 

           The girl playfully hits Dickie on the should kinda like “oh 
           hehe, stop it I don’t look like Kimmy Gibler.”
                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                             (playful)
                        Hey! It’s not my fault! It’s a 
                        compliment, right Jay?

           Jay perks up, tries to get involved. The girls are staring at 
           him. 

                                 JAY
                        More like Uncle Joey, right? 
                        Hehe...(acting it out) Cut. It. 
                        Out. Right? Cut. It. Out. Cut. It. 
                        Out. 

           He starts making scissors in the air towards one of the 
           girls.

                                 HOT HIPSTER 2
                        Ew, no. Seriously, cut it out. (To 
                        her friends) Umm, come with me to 
                        the bathroom? 

                                 HOT HIPSTER 1
                             (to Dickie)
                        Sorry...find me later? Your friend 
                        is out of control.

           They leave.

                                 DICKIE
                        Umm, dude? What the shit? 

                                 WES
                        That was our best Kimmy Gibler! 
                        It’s a classic! It works every 
                        time.

           Jay looks genuinely hurt. 

                                 JAY
                        I told you I can’t do this. I’m an 
                        idiot, I’m a fucking idiot...

           He is spiraling fast. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Ok, no biggie. (Pointing to the 
                        girl next to them at the bar) Try 
                        something out on this girl. We’re 
                        here for back up if you need it but 
                        just keep it light, keep it fun, 
                        keep it no-tears. 
                                 JAY
                        Ok.

                                 WES
                        Swing away.

           Jay turns to the girl whose back is towards him. This is 
           HARPER, mid-20’s, gorgeous. He takes a step but then backs up 
           quick.

                                 JAY
                        I can’t. Abort. She’s way too hot. 

                                 DICKIE
                        There is no such thing dude. Tell 
                        you what - Wes and I will get over 
                        there, soften up the audience for 
                        you, ok? Give us one minute. Wes, 
                        you good?

                                 WES
                        10-4.

           Wes and Dickie break off. We stay with Jay as he stands at 
           the bar by himself, trying to play it cool.

           He spots a CO-ED standing by herself and approaches.

                                 JAY
                        Excuse me. You look just like Kimmy 
                        Gibler.

                                 CO-ED
                        If my boyfriend sees you talking to 
                        me, he’s going to kick your ass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. O’BRIEN’S - BOOTH, SAME

           Dave and Maggie are sipping their drinks, watching the 
           activity. 

                                 DAVE
                        C’mon, let’s get out there, shake a 
                        leg.

           Maggie yawns.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Can we actually just go home? I’m 
                        kinda tired. 
                                 DAVE
                        You can go, I’ll meet you at my 
                        place in like an hour? I wanna 
                        hang.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ugh, no that’s so annoying. I have 
                        to feel my way around the back of 
                        the house and go in through the 
                        glass door because you don’t have a 
                        key, then I get woken up by your 
                        roommates when they come in banging 
                        around like two year-olds. 

                                 DAVE
                        You love two year-olds!

           She just looks at him.

                                 MAGGIE
                        This would be so much easier if we 
                        had our own place...It sucks that 
                        we both have roommates.

                                 DAVE
                        I know - one day, I promise.

                                 MAGGIE
                        One day?

                                 DAVE
                             (He’s done this before)
                        I still like living with my 
                        friends. I don’t want to feel like 
                        I’m missing out on things. 
                        Especially with Jay going through 
                        this shit.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ok, whatever, I’m going to take a 
                        cab back to my place then. I’ll 
                        talk to you tomorrow. 

           Maggie gets up and gets out of there quick.

                                 DAVE
                        Wait -- ah, shit. 

           We hear some laughter from off screen, where Dickie and Wes 
           are entertaining the girls. We see Jay at the bar still, by 
           himself.
                                 WES (O.S)
                             (yelling)
                        Yo Jay. Jay. Come here bro. 

           Jay walks up. Wes is standing with Harper. Dickie and a group 
           of girls are behind them lining up shots. 

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Jay, this is Harper. She was just 
                        telling me that she did a semester 
                        at sea in college. (winking) Just 
                        like you did. (to Harper) He never 
                        shuts up about it. 

                                 HARPER
                        Where were you? Caribbean? 

                                 JAY
                        ...Yes? 

           He looks to Wes for help. 

                                 WES
                        Right, well I hear a Jaegerbomb 
                        being poured with my name on it. 
                        You kids stay here and keep it PG-
                        13, ok?

                        Ok so, what? Did you do a semester 
                        at sea or not? 

                                 JAY
                        I definitely did not. I don’t know 
                        why they said that. I’m not sure I 
                        even have any idea what that is or 
                        what it entails. I think that was 
                        just my ‘in’ to get you to talk to 
                        me.

                             (laughing)
                        It’s like studying abroad but the 
                        whole thing’s on a boat. And you 
                        spend a week in each country as you 
                        sail around. It’s really awesome.

                                 JAY
                        Whoa. That actually does sound 
                        awesome.

                        I studied abroad in Scotland and I 
                        just remember the people really 
                        loved Burger King but didn’t like 
                        Americans...but yours sounds a lot 
                        better. Like a semester long spring 
                        break. 

                                 HARPER
                        It really is - it’s basically one 
                        huge party. It got super weird at 
                        the end because everybody had 
                        hooked up with everyone else, and 
                        no one knew how to feel about that. 
                        Feelings got hurt. Standard college 
                        drama.

           Is there a connection here?

                                 JAY
                             (awkwardly)
                        So does that mean you like hooking 
                        up with people?

                                 HARPER
                        What?

           He’s been out of the game too long. 

                                 JAY
                        Nevermind. That was the Jaeger 
                        talking. Why wouldn’t you like 
                        hooking up with people? Dumb 
                        question...

                             (joking)
                        Well, I don’t like it, I love it. 

           She smiles and takes a sip of her drink. That was his cue. He 
           leans in for the KISS. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck are you doing?? Did 
                        you just divebomb me?

                                 JAY
                             (beyond embarrassed)
                        Sorry.

           Long weird pause. She’s just staring at him like, bro you 
           need help.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I just got out of a long 
                        relationship.

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah no shit. 

           She turns and walks away. 

           Jay looks to Dickie and Wes, still with the other girls. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAY’S BEDROOM - 2AM

           Jay opens his computer and starts bumming around on facebook. 

           Through the walls he can hear girls laughing. Dickie and Wes 
           clearly brought some girls back, which makes him feel even 
           more alone. 

           Jay checks out his news feed, then goes to his wall, a link 
           takes him to Maggie’s page. Looking at her wall, he see’s a 
           picture she posted and checks out the 10 “likes” on the page. 
           The first one stops him cold. “Caitlin Pratt” likes this.

                                 JAY
                             (into the glow of the 
                              screen)
                        Well isn’t this magical.

           He clicks her name to see her profile, and his eyes go WIDE.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        NO.

           Caitlin’s profile pic, recently changed, is her and a dude 
           Jay has never seen before. He expands the photo. Caitlin and 
           this asshole out on a hike, smiling and happy as can be. He 
           goes back to her main profile page and sure enough.

                                                               ZOOM IN:

           CAITLIN PRATT IS IN A RELATIONSHIP

           Jay is floored. Steam coming from his ears. He bombs out of 
           the room.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Dickie, Wes, and the two girls are playing strip beer pong. 
           The two girls are on one side of the table, totally TOPLESS.

           We pan around to the other side of the table.  Wes in his 
           boxers and Dickie is COMPLETELY NAKED with only his hand 
           covering his bird. 

           Wes takes a shot and hits the final cup.  

                                 DICKIE
                        That’s game, ladies. Pants off.

           The girls look at each other and giggle. They start taking 
           off their pants as Jay STORMS IN.

                                 JAY
                        SHE IS NOW IN A FUCKING 
                        RELATIONSHIP! 

                                 DICKIE
                        Um, we’re kind of in the middle of 
                        something here pal. Who is in a 
                        relationship?

                                 JAY
                        Caitlin. I’m ready. Let’s start 
                        this killing spree ASAP. Teach me.

           He slaps himself in the face.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        LET’S! FUCKING! GO!

           Dickie and Wes get quiet. The girls are weirded out. 

                                 WES
                        Ok. Training starts tomorrow, first 
                        thing. Now...can you go back in 
                        your room please? 

           EXT. BACKYARD - NEXT MORNING

           On the back porch, Dickie and Wes have set up a ‘war room’ 
           for the Killing Spree. They have props. A chalkboard, venn-
           Diagrams, stacks of paper, etc. They’ve also built two large 
           boards. One says ‘Kill Count’ and the other says ‘Extra 
           Board’. 

           They stand at attention in front of the chalkboard, dead 
           serious. Jay sits in front of them with a notebook.
                                 DICKIE
                        Alright, so here’s the deal. As 
                        last night has taught us, you’ve 
                        been out of the game for a long 
                        time. You’re not going to get laid 
                        just by running around trying to 
                        haphazardly make out with every 
                        girl you talk to. You’ll see, 
                        getting laid can be easy, but it’s 
                        not that easy. 

                                 WES
                        I’m great looking, and even I 
                        strike out sometimes.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah but you’re dumb as rocks.

                                 WES
                        Right.

                                 DICKIE
                             (to Jay)
                        For you, this is going to be about 
                        premeditation, learning the skills 
                        of the trade and turning training 
                        into instinct. 

           Jay is nodding along.

                                 WES
                        The goal is to turn you into a cold 
                        blooded fuck machine. Is this for 
                        an emotional connection with a 
                        potential soul mate? No.

                                 DICKIE
                        This is about the calming beauty of 
                        numbers and mathematics.

                                 JAY
                        Sounds...nice.

                                 DICKIE
                        And to track your progress, we have 
                        your “kill count”. Every time you 
                        sleep with someone, the count 
                        increases. Remember: more kills, 
                        less Caitlin. That is your mantra. 
                        Say it with me: more kills equals 
                        less Caitlin.

                                 JAY
                        More kills, less Caitlin. 
                                 WES
                        By the time this is over, you’ll 
                        have bodies in the dirt from here 
                        to West Covina. 

                                 JAY
                        Got it.

                                 WES
                        And the “extra board” here is to 
                        store information on your potential 
                        targets.

                                 DICKIE
                        Right. Let’s begin. Any questions 
                        before we get started?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah. How did you guys get all this 
                        school equipment? 

           Behind Dickie, Wes begins writing on the chalkboard: “4 Areas 
           Of Focus”. An epic pump up song kicks in to accompany the 
           training. Think Redford schooling Brad Pitt in “Spy Game.”

                                 DICKIE
                        The 4 areas that we’re going to 
                        focus on are: Interpersonal Skills, 
                        Technology, The Long Con, and 
                        Winning Time. We’re going to start 
                        off with Interpersonal.

           Wes writes “Interpersonal Skills” on the chalkboard. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           The guys are posted up by some jars of tea and coffee 
           paraphernalia.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D.) 
                        Obviously the hardest part at first 
                        is going to be initial contact, and 
                        starting the conversation. The 
                        simple step of going to talk to a 
                        girl has been crippling for many an 
                        otherwise normal man. 

                                 WES
                        Girls are wary of guys always 
                        trying to hit on them, but also 
                        kind of excited for it to happen. 
                                 DICKIE
                        Once you get past her first wall 
                        it’s actually not so hard to close 
                        on a phone number. That’s why 
                        premeditation is so important. You 
                        need to have a conversation ready 
                        at all times. 

                                 JAY
                        Makes sense. 

           We see a hot girl get her coffee and head over to the milk 
           and sugar. 

                                 DICKIE
                        So, three steps. Make Contact. 
                        Charm her. Get the number. 

                                 WES
                             (Nodding at the hot girl)
                        Here we go. 

                                 JAY
                        What? No. How?

                                 DICKIE
                        When she walks out the door, follow 
                        her out and tell her she dropped 
                        this. 

           He hands Jay a five dollar bill. 

                                 WES
                        Most likely she’ll say it’s not 
                        hers. 

                                 DICKIE
                        So then you hit her with something 
                        witty. Turn on the charm, and say 
                        “how about I trade you the five 
                        dollars for your number.”

           Jay does a couple quick jumps and stretches his neck, getting 
           ready. 

                                 JAY
                        Ok.

                                 DICKIE
                        And smile when you say it. Always 
                        smile. If you don’t smile, you’ll 
                        come off like a creep. 

           Hot girl is making her way out the door.
                                 WES
                        GO!

           Jay goes out the door. We watch the whole thing play out 
           through the window from Dickie and Wes’s POV. Initial 
           contact. Hands her the bill. The hot girl kinda smiles. But 
           then she loses the smile, hands the bill back to Jay and 
           walks off. 

           Jay returns to the guys.

                                 JAY
                        I just made a fool of myself. She 
                        basically told me to fuck off. 

                                 WES
                        Who cares? This is just practice.

                                 DICKIE
                        Nobody scores every time. It’s like 
                        baseball - if you go 3 for 10 for 
                        your career, you’re in the hall of 
                        fame. But we’re not leaving until 
                        you get a number. Smile more. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

           Jay tries to hand a hot blonde a $5 bill.

                                 BLONDE
                        Fuck off, idiot.

           Jay sighs, resigned to a long afternoon. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Jay sits at the bar with Dickie and Wes. 

                                 DICKIE
                        The other aspect of Interpersonal 
                        is what some call ‘the old school’. 
                        It’s about body language, reading 
                        cues, doing quick algorithms in 
                        your head to determine chances of 
                        success. And by success we mean?

                                 JAY
                        Uh. Getting laid?
                                 WES
                        Bingo. 

           We see an attractive girl sitting alone at the bar, smiling 
           and playing with her hair, chatting with the bartender.

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Want to take a shot at her?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah I can try.

           Wes slams the bar, loud. People look.

                                 DICKIE
                        WRONG! 

                                 WES
                        She’s engaged, dude. Look again.

           We watch the girl.

                                 DICKIE (V.O.)
                        She’s wearing a rock. I checked as 
                        soon as we walked in. So did Wes. 
                        You need to survey a room as soon 
                        as you walk in. Knowing who is 
                        ready to party is at least 85% of 
                        the battle.

                                 JAY
                             (eager to learn)
                        Right, got it. Rookie mistake. What 
                        about these girls, they look like 
                        they’re ready to have some fun.

           Jay points to the other side of the restaurant, where a group 
           of 4 girls finish their dinner and have cocktails. 

                                 WES
                        Hmm yeah, tough because they’re a 
                        big group. But not impossible.

                                 DICKIE
                        A few ground rules for approaching 
                        a group - before you go anywhere 
                        near the situation, know who the 
                        target is and don’t waver. Once you 
                        bet on a horse you ride it all the 
                        way. Second, you can’t just try to 
                        run game while her friends look on. 
                        No one likes an audience, so 
                        incorporate everyone. You’ve gotta 
                        be creative. Like try this one.
           He motions for a waitress. She comes over.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Hi. Can you do me a favor? See the 
                        girl with blonde hair at the booth 
                        over there? Next to the girl in 
                        that old lady hat? 

           Next to the attractive blonde is a girl wearing one of those 
           floppy hats.

                                 WAITRESS 
                             (laughing)
                        Yeah?

                                 DICKIE
                        Yeah, will you bring her a Shirley 
                        Temple and tell her it’s from my 
                        friend Jay here? $20 should cover a 
                        Shirley Temple?

           CUT TO the waitress delivering the drink and pointing to Jay. 
           All four girls look over in his direction. He just smiles and 
           gives a little salute. The girl smiles. 

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, we just let it marinate for a 
                        second here. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Dickie, Wes, and Jay sit at a table, still going over the 
           training.

                                 WES
                        And obviously the more comfortable 
                        you get, the more confident you 
                        will become. And with confidence 
                        comes creativity. And ultimately 
                        more creative ways to pick up and 
                        sleep with women. 

           Jay is scanning the bar for potential suspects. He sees one.

                                 DICKIE
                        Go get her...

           Jay heads to a girl on the dance floor and does an 
           intentionally awkward move, endearing and harmless. She 
           smiles but turns back to her friends. Jay returns to the guys 
           and shrugs, smiling. 
           We can see even this is a step in the right direction - he’s 
           learning to handle the rejection without taking it 
           personally. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Jay still at it, working the $5 dollar bill trick. He makes 
           contact with a girl and hands her the bill, but again she 
           hands it right back to him. 

           We see a quick cut of him trying again, with a different 
           girl. This time, the girl just takes the money and leaves. 
           For a moment Jay stands there confused. Dickie and Wes love 
           it.

           Jay approaches a girl. Step one. Jay makes contact, hands her 
           the bill. He’s smiling. They’re talking. Step two. He’s 
           charming her, she’s laughing. Then, finally, step three, Jay 
           takes out his phone and enters her digits. Wes and Dickie 
           look at each and bump fists. 

           INT. BOOKSTORE / COFFEE PLACE - DAY

           Jay, Dickie, Wes and Dave are at a trendy bookstore/coffee 
           shop, sitting around a table drinking coffee. Dave texting, 
           looking annoyed.

                                 DICKIE (TO DAVE)
                        So what’s going on with you and 
                        Maggie? You guys cool?

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, we’re fine. She was pissed 
                        about the other night, but I 
                        smoothed it over. (beat) I’m pretty 
                        sure she wants to move in together. 
                        Actually I know she does.

                                 JAY
                        Why, what’d she say?

                                 DAVE
                        She literally said, “Dave, I want 
                        to move in together.”

                                 WES
                        Whoa, heavy.

                                 JAY
                        What are you gonna do?
                                 DAVE
                        I don’t know. Fuck! I’m not ready 
                        to graduate. I like living with my 
                        mates and blacking out. I can’t 
                        miss out on that shit. Especially 
                        with this Killing Spree in effect.

                                 JAY
                        But you don’t even hook up with 
                        other girls.

                                 DAVE
                        It’s not about that. It’s about 
                        being able to be out until sunrise, 
                        and do weird drugs. Look, I 
                        obviously love her and I’m 99% 
                        going to marry her. But moving in 
                        with her is just one step closer to 
                        marriage which is one step closer 
                        to children, and that scares the 
                        fuck outta me.

                                 WES
                        But wait, when you say she wants to 
                        move in, you mean she’s going to 
                        come live with us?

           They just look at him. Suddenly, Jay’s eyes go WIDE.

                                 JAY
                        Don’t look now, but the girl 
                        ordering coffee at the counter, 
                        that’s the girl I tried to make out 
                        with at the bar a few weeks ago.  

                                 DICKIE
                        Huh. She’s hotter than I remember.

                                 JAY
                        I think I’m gonna give this a shot 
                        again. What do I do?

                                 WES
                        Well you better do something fast, 
                        cause she’s leaving.

           We see HARPER, coffee in hand, exist the coffee shop and 
           enters the bookstore area.

                                 JAY
                        I’m going. Gimme a $5 bill.
                                 WES
                        Wait - just so you know, if you 
                        blow it, I’m taking a crack at her. 

           Jay exits and sneakily follows Harper around the store for a 
           good minute or two. It’s kinda creepy. He posts up behind a 
           book display and kneels down so as not to be seen. Jay is 
           staring at Harper between stacks of books. He psyches himself 
           up, and goes for it.

           Harper is flipping through a book as Jay is honing in. He’s 
           twenty feet from her. Ten feet from her. Five feet from her, 
           when a bookstore employee approaches him. Jay stops dead in 
           his tracks, intercepted.

                                 BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE
                        (way too enthusiastic) Hi! Can I 
                        help you find anything?

                                 JAY
                        (aggressive) No thanks. 

           Jay side steps him and just as he’s about to engage Harper, 
           her phone rings.

                                 HARPER
                        (into her phone) Hey Mom.

           This mission wasn’t meant to be. Jay gives up. He turns 
           around and meanders his way through the bookstore back to his 
           friends. Jay is approaching the door to the coffee shop when 
           SMASH... Jay literally collides with a random girl. Her stuff 
           goes flying everywhere. It’s a yard sale.

           She’s on her knees collecting her things. She looks up and 
           IT’S HARPER. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You should be more careful.

                                 JAY
                        Sorry.

           Harper continues to gather her things. Jay isn’t helping. 
           He’s just standing there.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        You tried to make out with me at 
                        the bar.

           Harper looks up. She stares at Jay for a second until her 
           stone expression gives and she cracks the smallest of smiles. 
                                 HARPER
                        Well, well, well. If it isn’t 
                        Mister I just got out of a long 
                        relationship. What are you doing, 
                        scrounging around the bookstore 
                        looking for girls to divebomb?

                                 JAY
                        Oh come on, cut me some slack. 
                        (jokingly) I just got out of long 
                        relationship. But I am sorry about 
                        that. So this is me apologizing.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s ok. Strangers try to make out 
                        with me all the time. I’m totally 
                        used to it by now.

                                 JAY
                        I’m sure you are. I’m Jay by the 
                        way. In case you forgot.

           They shake hands. 

                                 HARPER
                        Harper.

                                 JAY
                        So, do you live around here or 
                        something?

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, right up the street. The 
                        apartment is tiny, but at least the 
                        rent is real expensive. 

                                 JAY
                             (laughing)
                        That’s what’s great about Venice. 
                        Shitty apartments, tons of bums, 
                        expensive rent. 

                                 HARPER
                        That’s what it’s all about, I 
                        guess.

           Awkward pause as both of them smile at each other.

                                 JAY
                        So listen - let me properly 
                        apologize for the other night by 
                        taking you out sometime, how does 
                        that sound?
                                 HARPER
                        I’ll think about it.

                                 JAY
                        Fair enough. Sleep on it. But just 
                        fyi, the dress code for dates with 
                        me is formal. So you might want to 
                        make sure you have a good pair of 
                        Spanx handy. Can I grab your 
                        number? 

           She playfully hits him on the shoulder.

                                 HARPER
                        Here give me your phone.

           Harper enters her number. 

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Here you go. Text me tomorrow.

           She walks off. We see from Dickie, Dave and Wes’ POV as he 
           walks back with the number. They’re impressed.

           EXT. BACKYARD

           Wes and Dickie are standing up by the board. Under the first 
           section, ‘Interpersonal Skills’, we see a few bullet points 
           (”creative conversations”, “reading the room”, etc.). Wes has 
           just started a new section: “Tech.”

                                 DICKIE
                        So once you get a girl’s number, a 
                        great technological gateway drug, 
                        as far as wheeling chicks, is 
                        texting. Some people truly have it 
                        down to a science. Girls will 
                        literally slide out of their seats 
                        just from reading a couple eloquent 
                        lines. 

                                 WES
                        I’ve seen it fucking happen.

                                 DICKIE
                        Others, they give off a strong 
                        rapey vibe. You accidentally hit a 
                        couple capital letters and a 
                        playful ‘come over’ turns into an 
                        abusive COME OVER!!!
                                 WES
                        There are a couple ground rules to 
                        help you get started. (writing) 
                        Number 1: No emoticons. 

                                 JAY
                        Really? I thought girls loved those 
                        things? 

                                 DICKIE
                        Frankie Muniz sends emoticons. It’s 
                        literally the whackest move out 
                        there. 

                                 JAY
                        Got it. 

           EXT. BEER GARDEN - NEW LOCATION

                                 DICKIE
                        Number 2: keep it individual. Never 
                        send out a group text, too hard to 
                        cover your tracks and makes you 
                        seem as sleazy as you are actually 
                        trying to be. Oh and tangentially, 
                        here’s some advice on targets: At 
                        the end of the day, there are 3 
                        types of girls.

           As Dickie speaks, we see the different scenarios play out as 
           fantasies, with Jay in each scene:

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 

           Jay is sitting at a table, dressed to the nines, with a 
           beautiful, Victoria’s Secret-level girl. They’re laughing and 
           toasting champagne flutes. 

                                 DICKIE (V.O.)
                        One. The girls you really need to 
                        wine and dine. These are quality, 5 
                        diamond, Zagat rated smokeshows. If 
                        you land one of these then god 
                        bless, hang on for dear life. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - SAME NIGHT

           We see Jay and the model walk in the front door holding 
           hands. 
           They are confronted with Dickie, Wes and Dave, drunk, wearing 
           hockey helmets and playing indoor living room hockey. The 
           girl freaks and leaves. Jay hangs his head in shame. 

                                 DICKIE (V.O.)
                        Girls of this caliber don’t need to 
                        be picked up at some bar by a bro 
                        who lives with three roommates in a 
                        shithole. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           The whole crew (Dickie, Wes, Dave, Maggie) is standing around 
           a table with empty Margherita yards in front of them. Dickie 
           and Wes are entertaining a group of girls. Everyone is 
           laughing and having a good time. 

           Off to the side, Jay is three-point-stance’ing a girl by the 
           jukebox, smiling and nodding along as the girl tells a long 
           story. She stops for a second to take a sip of her drink. 
           When she looks up, Jay goes in for the kiss and they start 
           making out. 

                                 DICKIE (V.O.)
                        Second, there are girls that you 
                        can just meet up with, with your 
                        friends and her friends, like at a 
                        bar or a party or something. 
                        They’re usually a little 
                        more...morally flexible. They 
                        require about 30 minutes of 1-on-1 
                        time at some point in the night, so 
                        do your research and have some 
                        lines handy and then just listen. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAY’S ROOM

           Jukebox girl is on top of Jay, riding him. We hear a “Gong” 
           and see the kill count board go to “1.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CLUB - CLOSING TIME

           It’s late, and everyone is drunk. Dave and Maggie are asleep 
           in a corner. 
           Jay is sitting at a table, drunkenly watching the dance 
           floor. A girl (solid 6) is dancing by herself, making eyes at 
           him. 

           Jay stands up and walks over to the girl. He shakes her hand 
           and we see him mouth, “Hi, I’m Jay. Want to get out of here?” 
           She nods and they walk out, arm in arm. 

                                 DICKIE (V.O.)
                        Number 3. There are the girls that 
                        you can pluck right out of the bar 
                        with little to no effort. 
                        Obviously, these are the chicks 
                        with low self esteem and daddy 
                        issues. (beat) This is the category 
                        you might want to target at the 
                        moment. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GIRL’S ROOM - SAME NIGHT

           Jay in bed with girl from the club, getting his clothes and 
           getting out of there. Gong sounds. #2.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DIFFERENT GIRL’S ROOM - DIFFERENT NIGHT

           Jay is going to pound town with a different girl. Gong 
           sounds. #3

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UPSCALE LOUNGE - NIGHT (BACK TO REALITY)

           The guys are at a quieter, high-end lounge. A Cougar pickup 
           joint. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Actually, there is a fourth kind of 
                        woman. The 45-year old divorcee. 

                                 WES
                        These girls will fuck anything. 

           Jay nods and walks over to a COUGAR sitting at the bar.

                                 JAY
                        Hey there. Just wanted to say, you 
                        are stunning. 
                                 COUGAR
                        How old are you, small fry? 

                                 JAY
                             (intimidated)
                        Uh...27?

                                 COUGAR
                        Listen, I’m not here to babysit. 
                        Why don’t you try the AMC Cineplex, 
                        I think there’s a new “Twilight” 
                        movie coming out. 

                                 JAY
                        Oh. Ok.

                                 COUGAR
                        Seriously, get the fuck away from 
                        me. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEER GARDEN - NEXT DAY

           The mates are laughing.

                                 DICKIE 
                        Ok, maybe better to stick to your 
                        age bracket at this point.

                                 WES
                        Just keep working on your stroke in 
                        the minors. After a while you’ll be 
                        able to move up to The Show.

                                 JAY
                        What about that girl Harper? What’s 
                        my approach there?

                                 DICKIE
                        I’ve seen Harper, and she’s the 
                        ‘wine and dine’ type. You need to 
                        take her out first if you want a 
                        shot at banging her. But as we were 
                        just telling you, texting is the 
                        best way to facilitate that. She is 
                        going to be your first “long con”. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           They’re back at the board. “Long Con” written behind them. 
           There is a picture of Harper already up there. Jay is taking 
           notes.

                                 DICKIE
                        Do the research, get the intel, and 
                        carry out the mission. This is 
                        going to be your biggest challenge, 
                        but we’re behind you 100%. The 
                        payoff at the end of this is going 
                        to be some evil, rotten, Keyser 
                        Soze shit. Trust us.

                                 JAY
                        I do. Harper is the white whale.

                                 WES
                        Oh, come on. She’s not that fat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           The guys sip their drinks quietly. A big group of guys and 
           girls are at the bar, behind Jay. 

                                 WES
                        Well?

                                 JAY (WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE GROUP)
                        Looks like the brunette in the 
                        spaghetti straps is engaged, but no 
                        wedding band yet. Fully in love 
                        with black jeans. So she’s a pass.

           Sure enough, the Brunette in question snuggles up to a guy in 
           black jeans who just walked in. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        The other girls are all single and 
                        looking to get it. 

                                 WES
                        You’re doing great, kid. 

           Jay smiles. He’s getting the hang of this. He starts to rise 
           from his chair. 

                                 JAY
                        Now let’s go run some game. 
           INT. RESTAURANT / LOUNGE - ANOTHER NIGHT

           Jay, Dickie, Wes, Maggie and Dave are having dinner. Jay 
           looks serious, like he’s focused only on girls. He’s locked 
           in on a table a little ways down from them, where some girls 
           are having a few cocktails. The waiter puts down a Shirley 
           Temple in front of one of the girls, and points over to Jay. 
           The girl looks and smiles. Jay smiles back.

                                 DAVE
                        He’s learning, huh? Wow.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Yeah, Jay, you’re making a lot of 
                        progress here. Can’t say you’re the 
                        chattiest dinner companion now, 
                        though..

                                 DICKIE
                        Hey come on Maggie, cut the kid 
                        some slack. Let him get a couple 
                        kills under his belt before he goes 
                        back to being your dinner party 
                        clown.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, babe. Have a heart. 

                                 JAY
                        Excuse me.

           Jay gets up and we follow him over to the girl’s table. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So how come you haven’t touched the 
                        Shirley Temple? I would have sworn 
                        that was your favorite.

                                 SHIRLEY TEMPLE
                             (smiling)
                        How many roofies did you put in it? 

                                 JAY
                        How many? Obviously you’re not 
                        super familiar with roofies. Those 
                        things are expensive, I could only 
                        afford one. (smiling) Hi, I’m Jay. 

           From our group’s point of view we watch Jay shake hands with 
           Shirley Temple, then expertly make his way around the table, 
           charming her friends as well. 

           Jay waves over Dickie and Wes. 
                                 DAVE
                        Attaboy. Helping out the mates. 

           Dickie and Wes stand up and smooth themselves out to head 
           over to Jay.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                             (to Maggie, a little 
                              bummed)
                        Who needs ‘em, am I right?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Awww, do you want to go run game on 
                        some random broads? 

                                 DAVE
                             (scoffing)
                        Psshh no. That’s what LOSERS do. 
                        Real cool men go home and watch 
                        House Hunters with their 
                        girlfriends.

           Maggie kisses him on the cheek. He steals one more jealous 
           glance over to the guys, who are knee-deep in delightful 
           flirting. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GIRL’S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - MORNING

           Jay kisses the Shirley Temple girl goodbye. Gong sounds. #5.

           EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

           The “Kill Count” and “Extra Board” now shows several weeks of 
           training. 

           Dickie, Wes, Dave, and Jay sit around the backyard casually 
           drinking some beers. 

                                 JAY
                        Is there anything on the lesson 
                        plan today? What are we-

                                 WES
                             (interrupting, looking at 
                              his phone)
                        Shhhhhhh dude shut the fuck up. 
                        Give me a second. 

           The guys watch him bang out a text, waiting. 
                                 DICKIE
                        Status?

                                 WES
                        He’s a minute out. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Great. Ok, Jay, we’ve got a guest 
                        lecturer for class today. Johnny 
                        Cashmere is coming over. 

                                 DAVE
                        The Menace of Venice? I’m not sure 
                        I want him around the house when 
                        the sun is out. Why is he coming? 

                                 WES
                        He has bulletproof internet game. 
                        The Mark Zuckerberf of pulling 
                        trim.

                                 DICKIE
                        And he’s coming over for the sole 
                        purpose of helping Jay pull off the 
                        Long Con with Harper.

           From inside the house, some ruckus is made, like pots and 
           pans falling. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE (O.S.)
                        Hot shit new shit!! What’s up you 
                        fucking squids! 

           Dave rolls his eyes.

                                 WES
                        What’s up Johnny, how you doing?

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Just closing mad deals and banging 
                        mad pussy. 

                                 JAY
                        Hey, John. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        What’s up, slugger. Wes filled me 
                        on what’s up with this Harper girl - 
                        I’m going to a model party in a 
                        couple hours so want to make this 
                        snappy. 
                                 DICKIE
                        Jay, your facebook gives off the 
                        impression you’re still fully 
                        consumed with your ex-girlfriend. 
                        She is gonna sniff that out real 
                        quick. Johnny, tell him your 
                        secrets.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Basically, I have a legit 
                        specialty. To put it bluntly, I’ve 
                        adapted to the times and maximized 
                        my web presence and enhanced my 
                        personal brand. To put it even more 
                        bluntly, I manipulate the internet 
                        to bang chicks in a less-than-
                        truthful way. 

                                 JAY
                        Ok...

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Let me show you what this can do 
                        for you and your long con. Wes, 
                        handle the computer for your boy. 

           Cashmere motions for a laptop, Dickie brings it right over 
           and hands it to Wes. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE (CONT’D)
                        Facebook is best for a farm system 
                        of prospects to recruit. In the old 
                        days, to get pictures of girls in 
                        bikinis, or learn their favorite 
                        music, you’d have to be a close 
                        friend, or be in the CIA. Now you 
                        just go on facebook. 

           Wes starts pulling up examples of random girls on facebook as 
           Johnny talks.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE (CONT’D)
                        You can get a great sense of hook 
                        up potential for girls you barely 
                        know. For example, this girl right 
                        here - relationship status 
                        ‘single’, but there are a lot of 
                        pictures with her and this hardo. 
                        Look at the time stamp on this one - 
                        1 month ago. That means this girl 
                        just got out of a long term 
                        relationship and is vulnerable. 
                                 DICKIE
                        Ripe for the kill.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Exactly Dickie. And of course there 
                        are more obvious photo tells. You 
                        meet a girl at work, you see her in 
                        professional clothes, not smiling. 
                        But her profile shows her wearing 
                        those weird jean cutoff shorts with 
                        the high waist, and a neon pink 
                        tank top. Homegirl loves to do 
                        drugs and party. 

                                 JAY
                        Interesting.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        But of course I’m being a little 
                        too detailed, because I know that 
                        today you’re not browsing, you’re 
                        buying. 

                                 DAVE
                        Harper is the target.

                                 JAY
                        Yeah. She’s so hot it makes me want 
                        to puke.

                                 DAVE
                        Can we pull up her facebook page?

                                 JAY
                        I’m not friends with her yet, 
                        unfortunately. And she knows how to 
                        work the privacy settings.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Ok - so let’s just go over the 
                        general ground rules to get you 
                        ready. 

           Wes begins writing. “1. Stability and / or Responsibility.”

                                 JAY
                        Stability? 
                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Harper may be the type of girl that 
                        is going to check you out on 
                        facebook and want to be reassured 
                        that you have a steady job, a car, 
                        a working shower, some clean 
                        clothes. You’re responsible and 
                        while you like to cut loose, your 
                        priorities are professional and 
                        personal success. 

                                 JAY
                        What else would I want to convey? 
                        That seems like the only option. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Not in LA dude. A lot of people 
                        here are children. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Some girls are getting out of 
                        relationships or are recent college 
                        graduates, or are just free 
                        spirits, and they want to see a 
                        fellow flower child. So once again, 
                        you adjust your profile accordingly 
                        depending on the digital vibe 
                        Harper gives off. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Example. Right now, I’m really 
                        trying to hook up with this girl 
                        who works at Baby Blues. This is 
                        her pic -

           We see a girl sitting in a field, wearing a floppy hat and 
           holding a guitar.

           He pulls up his profile. 

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        So for my profile photo I’ve got 
                        this instagram thing of me when we 
                        ate mushrooms in Joshua Tree. I’m 
                        wearing a bandana. And for the 
                        banner shot, it’s a black and white 
                        pic of a young Cat Stevens. Boom.

           Wes writes “2. Popularity”. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Wanna take a crack at this, Dave? 
                                 DAVE
                        Yeah this is day one stuff - you 
                        can’t trust a loner. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Exactly. You need pictures of you 
                        with buddies, somewhere near the 
                        forefront of the page. What type of 
                        pictures is up to you - try not to 
                        make them all bar shots like this -

           He shows the group a picture of themselves, all wearing 
           collared shirts and holding beers, clearly at a bar.

                        You get the idea - you want to show 
                        Harper that you’re a popular guy, 
                        well liked by at least a few people 
                        out there. Next lesson-

           “3. Cultural fluency”.

                        Girls in their 20’s, these girls 
                        are whip smart and up on their 
                        shtick. Blogs, tumblrs and buzzfeed 
                        lists. To stay on top of it all and 
                        to contribute something takes a lot 
                        of effort. You’ve gotta show them 
                        that you’ve got your finger on the 
                        pulse. Hit ‘em with something that 
                        says, “I can teach you something 
                        about what’s going on.” But going 
                        hand in hand with Cultural fluency 
                        is Intellectual fluency.

           “4. Intellectual Fluency”.

                        Girls don’t want to date a moron. 
                        No offense Wes.

                                 WES
                        Huh?

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        I have a few go to’s to make me 
                        seem a little more “educated”. Main 
                        one is a quote from Charles 
                        Bukowski. “

                        You have to die a few times before 
                        you can really live.” Ask me if I 
                        know what that means or if I give a 
                        fuck. But put something like that 
                        shit on your profile and Harper 
                        will think you’re a genius. 

                                 DAVE
                        I’ve never even heard of Charles 
                        Bukowski. That’s great. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Work on the profile and the status 
                        messages and everything else is 
                        cream cheese. And when you start 
                        compiling intel on her, keep it 
                        somewhere.

                                 WES
                        That’s what these boards are for.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Um...yeah ok. On that note, I’m out 
                        pussies! Don’t let your meat loaf!

           INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

           The bar is thinning out. It should be clear it’s late in the 
           night. There are a few girls hanging around, but the guys 
           make their way over to a booth. Jay surveys the scene. 

                                 DICKIE
                        It’s time for the last lesson, Jay.

                                 JAY
                        Really? Holy shit.

                                 WES
                        This one is easy.

                                 DICKIE
                        Real easy. We call this lesson, 
                        “winning time”. 

                                 DAVE
                        Ah, yes, the hour before last call, 
                        until sunrise. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Jay, if you ever just need to get 
                        laid, just to get one out of your 
                        system, you play the odds and stay 
                        out real late. 
                                 WES
                        Girls hanging around after the bars 
                        close are only out for one reason - 
                        to howl at the moon. 

                                 DICKIE
                        And that’s what Winning Time is all 
                        about...WINNING. It’s Reggie 
                        Miller’s time to score 12 points in 
                        the final minute. It’s the end of 
                        the game when chalking one up in 
                        the ‘win’ column is the only 
                        priority. 

                                 WES
                        When all else fails (he fumbles in 
                        his pocket, taking out a baggie), 
                        you employ the last resort. Give 
                        them cocaine. Winning time!

           Jay laughs. The others don’t. 

                                 JAY
                        Give them coke?

                                 DICKIE
                        Show them drugs and they’ll show 
                        you the promised land. But a word 
                        of warning: these are the girls 
                        that carry disease. You definitely 
                        need to put a hat on your dick for 
                        these situations.

                                 WES
                        It can get real dark. 

                                 JAY
                        Roger that.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MONTAGE

           Various scenes of Jay employing all the techniques and 
           hooking up with girls. Lots of sex. Every time he sleeps with 
           someone the gong sounds and the kill count goes up by one. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. THE HOUSE - MORNING

           Dickie, Wes and Dave are at the kitchen table eating 
           breakfast before work. We hear footsteps and Jay emerges with 
           a girl. Short skirt, bright blue tank top and her “going out” 
           purse over her shoulder.

           Jay walks her to the door, gives her a long kiss.

                                 JAY
                        I’ll call ya.

           He shuts the door behind her, turns to his boys and raises 
           his hands as if he just scored a playoff goal. 

                                 DAVE
                        Who. The. Fuck. Was. That???

                                 JAY
                        I’m not just trying to sound cool 
                        here, but I don’t know her name.

                                 DAVE
                        Seriously Jay. Thank you.

           When Jay gets laid, it’s like they all get laid. Everyone is 
           fired up. 

           Jay walks over to the Kill Count. Picks up the mallet and 
           sounds the gong. He then proceeds to change the placard to 
           “15” indicating his fifteenth “kill.”

           Jay pours a bowl of cereal and joins his pals at the table. 

                                 JAY
                        You guys realize I haven’t thought 
                        about Caitlin once in, I can’t even 
                        remember when.

                                 DICKIE
                        That’s great.

                                 WES
                        Whatever happened with the Harper 
                        girl?

                                 DAVE
                        The long con?

                                 JAY
                        (mouth full) Yeah - she was out of 
                        town for awhile.
                                 DICKIE
                        You gotta text her today. See if--

                                 JAY
                        (cutting him off) I already did. 
                        Texted her this morning. I’m taking 
                        her out on Thursday. 

                                 WES
                        You texted her this morning? Even 
                        with Night At The Roxbury in your 
                        bed?

                                 JAY
                        Yep.

                                 DICKIE
                        This kid is unstoppable. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - LATE AFTERNOON

           Jay and Harper are strolling the infamous boardwalk in 
           Venice. Harper is carrying a stuffed animal dinosaur, won at 
           some carnival game at the Santa Monica Pier.

                                 HARPER
                        Look, I’m just saying the life of a 
                        Brontosaurus is less hectic. They 
                        basically hang out all day, they 
                        eat plants and trees, so they don’t 
                        have to hunt. It just seems like a 
                        nice relaxing life. Imagine how 
                        stressful being a T-Rex would be?

                                 JAY
                        You win. The Brontosauaus is 
                        officially my new favorie dinosaur. 
                        Forever.

           They pass an old and very destitute bum standing against a 
           wall and itching himself profusely.  Jay drops a few bucks in 
           his cup.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        I always give cash to this guy. A 
                        few weeks ago I saw him sitting out 
                        front of Starbucks, drinking a pink 
                        frappachino.  With whipped cream. 
                                 HARPER
                        He has expensive taste. He’s not a 
                        businessman, he’s a business, man. 
                        You know, I’ve never given money to 
                        a bum.  Is that mean?

                                 JAY
                        Kinda.

                                 HARPER
                        I’ve always wanted to.  Can I do it 
                        today?

                                 JAY
                        Let’s do it right now.

                                 HARPER
                        Ok, help me pick the right bum.

                                 JAY
                        (pointing) How bout this one?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s so on.

           They appraoch the bum.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        Hi. Here ya go. 

           She smiles sweetly and holds out a five dollar bill.  She 
           looks over to Jay excitedly kinda like “look I’m doing it.” 
           The bum stares at her, confused.  

                                 BUM
                        (annoyed) What?

                                 HARPER
                        Here ya go. This is for you.

           She holds her hand outstretched for about ten seconds.  The 
           bums confusion turns to frustration.

                                 BUM 
                        (annoyed) Why are you handing me a 
                        five dollar bill?

                                 HARPER
                        (confused) Uh. I just thought maybe 
                        you could use it?

                                 BUM
                        Get away from me. (beat) I’m not 
                        homeless you fuckin idiot!!!
           Harper is embarassed and does the only thing she can think 
           of.  She laughs right in his face and then just runs away.

           Jay is staring at the non-bum.

                                 NON-BUM
                        I went to Vassar.

           Jay turns and runs after Harper, who is standing about 30 
           yards away laughing hysterically. When he gets to her she 
           hugs him and hides her head laughing.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Jay and Harper are at dinner. He’s teaching her the rules of 
           sake bombing. The chopsticks are on top of their pint glasses 
           with a shot of sake on top. They do the chant, then pound the 
           table then chug their sake bomb.

                                 JAY
                        I can’t believe you’ve never done 
                        this before. You’ve never given 
                        money to a bum, you’ve never done a 
                        sake bomb. What ARE you?

                                 HARPER
                        (tipsy) I’m kinda drunk.

           She giggles like an idiot. Jay smiles.

                                 JAY
                        You have really nice collar bones.

                        (looking down) I’ve definitely 
                        never been told that before. Thank 
                        you. For some reason that’s the 
                        nicest compliment I’ve ever heard.

           They stare at each other for a pregnant pause.

           Jay takes a drink from his glass of water and chews his ice.

                                 JAY
                        (mouth full) Wanna know something 
                        wierd? I love the sound of chewing.

           Harper looks at him skeptically.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        It’s by far my favorite sound.
           Harper takes a drink from Jay’s glass and chews a piece of 
           ice.

                                 HARPER
                        (chewing ice) Come here. I’ll give 
                        you the goods.

           She leans across the table.  Jay leans across to meet her. 
           the side of her jaw is against Jay’s ear, chewing while Jay 
           listens.

                                 JAY
                        One more time.

           She gets another piece of ice.  Same thing, his ear up 
           against her jaw. Jay pulls away and KISSES her.  Right at the 
           table. 

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        Sorry. I couldn’t wait till later. 
                        Also, I watched Good Will Hunting 
                        yesterday, which may have had some 
                        influence on that move. 

           She smiles and gets another piece of ice.

                                 HARPER
                        Let’s do one more.

           They kiss again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

           We’re staring at an empty apartment when the door busts open. 
           Jay and Harper stumble into her apartment making out like 
           drunk teens. They fall to the couch.

           Harper straddles Jay as they continue to make out.

           Jay attempts to remove her shirt.

                                 HARPER
                        (shutting him down) Whoa. Not 
                        tonight buddy. Clothes stay on.

           She goes back to kissing Jay. They’re both very into it. 
           Jay’s hands are wandering.

                                 JAY
                        Do you have a condom?
                                 HARPER
                        (laughing) Are you serious? I tell 
                        you my clothes are staying on and 
                        you ask if I have condoms. No, I 
                        don’t have condoms.

           She goes back to kissing Jay.  He pulls a wrestling move and 
           switches positions. Jay is now on top of Harper.  They’re 
           ferociously making out.

           Jay begins initial descent. He’s making his way down. He’s no 
           longer visible on screen.

           Harper smacks his head.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        Excuse me??

           She thinks this is hilarious.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        Let’s recap here. I basically tell 
                        you there’s no way we’re having sex 
                        tonight. Then you ask for condoms. 
                        Then I reiterate, what I just told 
                        you, and now you’re trying to go 
                        down on me. You think I’m gonna 
                        fall for that? It’s the oldest 
                        trick in the book, dude.

           Jay’s staring up at Harper, head basically in her crotch. He 
           smiles. Harper laughs.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        Get up here.

           They lie next to each other for a moment.

                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        You’re funny. I like you.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           FADE IN:

           INT. THE HOUSE, A FEW DAYS LATER

           ECU of Harper’s Facebook page. Wall posts, status updates, 
           and interests are followed up with tagged photos. 

                                 WES (O.S.)
                        Jay, you know where my weed is? Oh, 
                        here it is.
           Wes enters the room.

                                 JAY
                             (nodding to computer)
                        Yo, what’s a good, recent novel I 
                        can list on my page? Harper 
                        accepted the ole friend request. 
                        Looks like she is really into 
                        contemporary fiction. Franzen, 
                        Junot Diaz...

           Wes looks at him.

                                 WES
                        Uhhhh....

                                 JAY
                        Yeah good point. 

           Dave and Dickie enter with a few beers.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking the Cashmere approach 
                        here and polishing up my profile. 
                        But look at Harper. Christ. She is 
                        on point. 

           He looks up to find Dickie staring at him.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DICKIE
                        Jay, don’t try to pull the wool 
                        over my eyes.  What was rule number 
                        one?

                                 JAY
                        No girlfriend.  I’m not--

                                 DICKIE
                        Right.  You’re sitting here in your 
                        little rat hole. Bombing through 
                        pics and picturing yourself dating 
                        this girl. I know you too well.

                                 JAY
                        No man.  I promise. She’s the long 
                        con.  This is research right now. 
                        I’m compiling intel so I can sleep 
                        with her, and get her up on the 
                        extra board and be done with it.  I 
                        promise. 
                                 DICKIE
                        OK. Fine.  I believe you.  Just 
                        remember, we’re watching you.  

                                 WES
                        Don’t try to pull the window over 
                        our eyes bro.

                                 JAY
                        I...won’t?

           The guys are exiting Jay’s room.  Right before Dave shuts the 
           door.

                                 WES
                        (pointing at Jay) No girlfriend 
                        Fuck Boy.

           An upbeat songs kicks in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MAIN STREET, SANTA MONICA - AFTERNOON

           Jay’s on his lunch break, walking around. 

                                 GIRL (O.S.)
                        Jay?

           Jay stops and turns around. It’s CAITLIN. 

           They stare at each other for a few seconds then awkwardly 
           hug.

                                 CAITLIN
                        (excitedly) Oh my God. 

                                 JAY
                        Caitlin, whoa. Uh, hi.

           More awkward staring.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        So how’ve you been?

                                 CAITLIN
                        Been OK. Ya know. My birthday was 
                        last week, so I did some birthday 
                        stuff. Other than that, 
                        everything's pretty much the same.  
                        How are you?
                                 JAY
                        Your birthday? Hmm, I completely 
                        forgot about that. Sorry, I would 
                        have texted you. (proud for 
                        actually not remembering). Hmm, 
                        sorry about that.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Oh, it’s fine I know you’re busy 
                        and everything. How’s work going?

                                 JAY
                        Really good.  On my lunch break!

                                 CAITLIN
                        That’s great. Listen, do you maybe 
                        want to grab a drink sometime? I’d 
                        love to catch up... Somewhere, you 
                        know, that’s not the side of the 
                        road. I hate the way we left 
                        things...

           She smiles.

                                 JAY
                        Um sure, maybe next month? Well...

           Jay hugs her.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        It was great seeing you.

           He peels away and continues his stroll down Main Street, in a 
           great mood.

           Caitlin turns, walks off, but stops, turns and watches Jay as 
           he walks away.  Hoping he’ll turn around too.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - SUNDOWN

           Dickie is driving. Jay rides shotgun. Wes, Dave and Maggie 
           are in the back. Mid conversation.

                                 DICKIE
                        Wait, where the fuck is this place? 
                        I hate the hills.

           Jay grabs his iPhone and checks the GPS.

                                 JAY
                        Keep going. Relax. 
           Wes puts his head out the window like a dog.

                                 DAVE
                        What are you doing?

                                 WES
                        (head out the window) I get car 
                        sick.  You know that. 

                                 JAY
                        (to Dickie) Make a left at the stop 
                        sign. Ok Maggie, back to what we 
                        were talking about earlier. This 
                        girl Harper is coming tonight.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I know, I know. The long con. You 
                        want to bang her, and need my help. 
                        I got it. But, you think me 
                        becoming besties with her will make 
                        her want to sleep with you? I don’t 
                        see the logic here guys.

                                 DICKIE
                        It’s a subliminal tactic Maggie. 
                        Art of war type shit. She’ll see 
                        Jay in his element. With his close 
                        friends. Being the fun party guy, 
                        who also has a job. They’ll get 
                        drunk. Have fun. She’ll realize 
                        he’s a catch, and then he’ll take 
                        her down.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Romantic. 

                                 JAY
                        She’s tough though. Not easily 
                        “conned” so to speak. That’s why 
                        I’m requesting your services.

                                 DAVE
                        We’re counting on you babe.

                                 WES
                        (head still out the window) Yeah, 
                        we’re counting on you.

                                 MAGGIE
                        OK, OK, I’m on it. I’ll pump your 
                        tires. Let her know you’re a good 
                        guy, blah, blah, blah. Happy to 
                        support the cause.
                                 JAY
                        I love you. Can you just make sure 
                        you get her alone early? Ya know, 
                        solid one on one “just us girls 
                        talking” type shit. Locate any 
                        exploitable weaknesses?

                                 MAGGIE
                        (kinda laughing) You sound like a 
                        rapist. (to the rest of the group) 
                        You guys created a monster.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - LATER

           Various shots of a house party. Over the raucous party sound 
           we see Jay as he hugs Harper. They make their way through the 
           throng of people. Hold on a guy passed out face down on the 
           couch. Jay and Harper take note and laugh.

           They walk over to a table in the kitchen where Dave and Wes 
           are seated, playing a drinking game.

                                 JAY
                        Guys, this is Harper. (To Harper) 
                        You met Wes at the bar a few months 
                        ago. Do me a favor and don’t start 
                        liking him. Once you get past the 
                        looks there’s not much there. This 
                        is Dave.

           Dave half stands up and they shake hands, right as Dickie 
           approaches with an 18 pack of beers.

                                 DICKIE
                        (not noticing Harper) It’s insane 
                        how much pussy is at this house 
                        right now. 

           Harper just kinda stares at Dickie smiling.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        (realizing) Pardon my language. 
                        (kissing her on the cheek) Good to 
                        see you again. Want a beer?

           He hands her a can of beer then administers beers to the rest 
           of the group.
                                 DAVE
                        Should we shotgun these before 
                        Maggie gets out of the bathroom? 
                        For old time’s sake?

                                 JAY
                        You say for old time’s sake as a 
                        way of remembering something 
                        pleasant from the past. We 
                        shotgunned beers last weekend.

                                 DAVE
                        Let’s not get into semantics OK? 
                        Let’s just hurry up and do this 
                        before my girlfriend gets back and 
                        yells at me.

           Harper is the first to puncture a hole in her can.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, you’re in too? I love it.

                                 HARPER
                        (smiling) For old time’s sake.

           SMASH. The rest of the group uses their keys to cut holes in 
           the can and they proceed to SHOTGUN their beers.

                                 DAVE
                        (way too loud) Ahh!!! College!!! No 
                        parents!!!

           He high fives Harper.

           Maggie is back from the bathroom and joins the group.

                                 MAGGIE
                        The line for the bathroom is the 
                        longest thing I've ever seen in my 
                        life. I couldn’t wait any more. 
                        (noticing Harper) Oh my God, hi, 
                        you must be Harper.

                                 JAY
                        Harper, this is Maggie. Dave’s 
                        girlfriend. 

           They shake hands.

                                 HARPER
                        (pointing at Dave) He just 
                        shotgunned a beer.
           Dickie and Wes love this. Everyone laughs at Dave for getting 
           burned by the new girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                        (laughing) He wishes he was still 
                        in college so bad it’s ridiculous. 
                        Lemme guess, soon as he was done he 
                        screamed “College! No parents!” 
                        (beat) Actually, will you be my 
                        wingman for this insane bathroom 
                        line?

                                 HARPER
                        Absolutely.

                                 DICKIE
                        (fake coughing) Long con. (cough 
                        cough) Long fucking con.

           Harper gives him a weird look but shakes it off.

           As they’re walking away, almost out of earshot we can hear 
           Maggie say to Harper.

                                 MAGGIE
                        It’s weird, he’s always trying to 
                        shotgun beers behind my back as if 
                        I’ll get mad at him or something.

           Harper lets out a nice laugh.

           Quick cuts of the party as it turns into a full blown rager:

           - Our entire group shotguns another beer.

           - Harper and Maggie take a shot and are laughing as if 
           they’re best friends.

           - The entire party has formed a dance circle in the middle of 
           the living room. 

           - Jay twirls Harper in the middle of the circle.

           - Maggie doing a keg stand. Dave is holding her up counting 
           out her time.

           - Wes is power-lifting two cases of beer as a bored crowd 
           looks on.

           - A random dude is aggressively making out with a drunk chick 
           as Dickie and Wes watch, applauding. The guy makes an attempt 
           to put his hand down her pants. She lets him and the crowd 
           ERUPTS!
                                 DICKIE
                        Yes! I told you! Pay up, 
                        motherfuckers!!

           - A random guy hands Dickie a stack of bills.

           - A game of chicken. Jay is on Dickie’s shoulders. Standing 
           in front of them is Harper on the shoulders of a random girl 
           as Jay and Harper wrestle.

           - A drunk partier pours a beer on his head.

           - Two people are racing to see who can finish a beer bong 
           first. The entire party cheers them on.

           - the drunk partier from earlier is passed out. He’s getting 
           sharpie’d. Someone has written “teabag me” on his forehead. 

           - Back to the chicken match. Only it’s no longer a chicken 
           match. It’s a make-out match. Jay and Harper (both still on 
           shoulders) are making out, while Dickie and the random girl 
           are on the bottom making out with each other.

           End Montage.  Fade out, then back in.

           INT. HOUSE PARTY - LATER ON

           The party is over and the house is DESTROYED. The camera pans 
           the house until we get to the living room.

           Jay, Harper,Dave, Maggie, Dickie and Wes are sitting around a 
           table casually drinking beers and passing around a joint. 

                                 JAY
                        That was the most fun I’ve had in a 
                        long time.

                                 HARPER
                        That was the most fun I’ve had in 
                        my entire life.

           They look at each other, smiling.

                                 MAGGIE
                        How are we getting home by the way?

                                 JAY
                        I’ll robe it home.

           Dickie, Wes and Dave laugh.

                                 DAVE
                        Yes!
                                 HARPER
                        What is “robe it home” mean?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAR - TEN MINUTES LATER

           Jay is driving. He’s also wearing a bath robe. Harper rides 
           shotgun. The rest of the group is stuffed in the back-seat. 

                                 JAY
                        Harper, no judgment here. Sometimes 
                        driving home when you’ve been a 
                        little overserved is inevitable in 
                        LA. Like tonight. Whoever is 
                        driving wears the robe in case we 
                        get pulled over. This way if--  I 
                        don’t believe this. Holy fuck. 
                        We’re getting pulled over.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck.

           Jay pulls the car to the side of the street. Dickie hands him 
           a handful of change.

                                 DICKIE
                        Here, put these in your mouth.

                                 JAY
                        No dude.

           He knocks the coins out of his hand as the cop is approaching 
           the window. 

                                 COP
                        License and regis-- (noticing the 
                        robe) What’s going on with that 
                        outfit, son? Have you been 
                        drinking?

                                 JAY
                        Oh, no sir. Quite the opposite 
                        actually. I was just in bed 
                        sleeping, I have work tomorrow. I 
                        received a call from my friend Wes 
                        back there.

           Wes waves to the cop.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        They were out partying and were 
                        having a hard time finding a cab 
                        and were considering driving home 
                        intoxicated. Instead of letting my 
                        friends drive home drunk, I woke up 
                        and came and got them.  Hence the 
                        robe. 

           Jay flashes a real full of shit smile. Long pregnant pause as 
           the cop thinks.

                                 COP
                        Well, I pulled you over cause I saw 
                        some feet sticking out of the back 
                        window. But it’s very responsible 
                        of you to do this for your friends. 
                        Get these clowns home safely. 
                        You’re a good friend. And get some 
                        sleep for Chrissakes.

                                 JAY
                        Will do officer. Have a good night.

           Jay pulls away. NO one says a word for a few seconds. Then 
           the car breaks out in laughter. Jay turns the music up to 
           full blast.

                                 HARPER
                             (laughing)
                        You guys are assholes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HARPER’S HOUSE

           Jay pulls up to her house.

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        This is me right here.

           Harper gets out and goes over to Jay’s window. A moment of 
           awkward silence.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Uh, do you want to come up?

           The second she finishes her sentence everyone cheers and 
           beings razzing Harper and Jay.

                                 DICKIE
                        Get some!
                                 DAVE
                        Yeah, get some!

           Harper is embarrassed but can’t stop laughing.

           Maggie, moving up to sit shotgun, calls out to Harper.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I had so much fun tonight. Let’s 
                        have a girls night soon.

                                 HARPER
                        Can we please do that? (to the 
                        boys) Bye guys. Thanks for an 
                        awesome night. 

           Jay and Harper walk up to Harper’s door. Meanwhile, at the 
           car, Dickie opens the trunk and puts on his own robe.

           INT. HARPER’S BEDROOM - LATER

           The aftermath of some energetic, first-time sex. There is 
           giggling and sheets moving, and Harper’s face comes into 
           view, blowing hair out of her eyes. Jay comes up for air a 
           second later. 

                                 JAY
                        My god, woman, you know what you’re 
                        doing. That was fun.

                                 HARPER
                        Glad it was for one of us. 

                                 JAY
                        Wait, what?

           Harper tries to keep a straight face, but can’t hold out.

                                 HARPER
                             (smiling)
                        Too soon to joke about that?

                                 JAY
                        Extremely so. This is the first 
                        time my dick’s been inside of you! 

           They’re both laughing.

                                 HARPER
                        Ok, good to know. 

           She leans over to give him a kiss on the cheek. 
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to go get ready for bed, 
                        you want a glass of water or 
                        something?

                                 JAY
                        Um, no. I’m good. 

                                 HARPER
                        K, be back in a minute.

           He forces a smile but something’s bothering him. He stares at 
           the ceiling for a second, then gets up to check out Harper’s 
           stuff. 

           As we stay on Jay’s uneasy face, we hear previous 
           chastisement from his friends playing in his head: “no 
           girlfriend, fuck boy”, “you’re a pussy”, “no girlfriend, no 
           girlfriend, NO GIRLFRIEND!”.

           Jay picks up a book from her shelf. “Love Is A Dog From 
           Hell”, by Charles Bukowski. 

                                 JAY
                             (shouting to Harper)
                        You like Charles Bukowski?!

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Yeah he’s great! One of the best LA 
                        writers. Why, you like him? 

                                 JAY
                        A friend of mine is really into his 
                        writing...he’s got a few good 
                        quotes and stuff, I guess...Hey I’m 
                        going to help myself to that glass 
                        of water ok?

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Yeah you earned it, knock yourself 
                        out. 

           INT. HARPER’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jay is chugging water at the sink. 

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Everything ok? 

           Harper comes up from behind and stands next to him, taking a 
           sip.
                                 JAY
                        Yeah...Listen, I think I’m going to 
                        get going, get out of your hair. 

           A beat.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, yeah ok, sure. 

                                 JAY
                        I’m just not feeling that well. 
                        Probably heartburn. Nothing a dozen 
                        Tums can’t fix...I’ll call you? 

                                 HARPER
                        Are you asking yourself that?

                                 JAY
                        Sorry, I meant, I’ll call you. 
                        Just, gotta run. 

                                 HARPER
                        Alright...sounds good?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VENICE STREET - LATER

           Jay is walking home, fast. He’s flicking through his phone, 
           trying anyone he can think of. A couple rings.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                             (through phone, voicemail)
                        You’ve reached Dave, sorry I can’t 
                        come to the ph--

           Jay hangs up. Fuck. Tries another.

                                 WES (O.S.)
                             (through phone)
                        Hi! You’ve reached Wes at Cardiff 
                        Giant. If this is an emerg--

           Jay hangs up. One more.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE (O.S.)
                        Yo, King Jay! You still out?! Come 
                        to this Condo I’m at. Low hanging 
                        fruit everywhere. I’ll text--

           CLICK. Jay sighs. Guess he’s just going home to sleep it off. 
           INT. THE HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Jay is home alone, lying on the couch. He’s on his laptop, 
           checking out twitter and facebook. He types in Harper’s name 
           and checks out her profile. On her wall, it says, “Harper 
           Jensen is now friends with 4 people.” Jay clicks to expand 
           it. The list is Dave, Wes, Dickie, Maggie. He sighs. It 
           appears sleeping with her and being done with her is getting 
           harder and harder. 

           He’s checking out her pictures, and the mates loudly enter 
           the house. 

                                 DAVE
                             (to Dickie)
                        To the surprise of literally no 
                        one, you sound like a fucking fool, 
                        again.

           The gang notices Jay. 

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Yo Jay-Bone! How’d last night end 
                        up? 

                                 DICKIE
                        Bro, Harper is awesome.

                                 WES
                        Did you get your dick wet?

                                 DAVE
                        She’s fun as fuck dude.

                                 DICKIE
                        Did you at least finger blast her?

                                 JAY
                        Ok, ok, I get the point. You guys 
                        like Harper, christ.

                                 MAGGIE
                        She really is cool, Jay, well done.

                                 JAY
                        Who cares if she’s cool?

                                 DAVE
                        So does that mean no sex? I mean it 
                        would have been a long shot, you’ll 
                        have more opportunities with her...
                                 JAY
                        What does that mean? Look guys I’m 
                        glad you liked hanging out with 
                        her, but she’s just for the kill 
                        count. She’s ‘long-con’ experience, 
                        that’s all. And yeah, for the 
                        record, we had sex, and I’ve been 
                        sitting here all day waiting for 
                        you guys to get home so we can add 
                        her to the Extra Board and ring the 
                        fucking gong and now it’s all 
                        ruined because you guys all want to 
                        date her at the same time and I’m 
                        here with my dick in my hands 
                        looking to get my numbers up and I 
                        guess from here on out I’m doing it 
                        alone? Is that it? What the fuck? 

           Silence from the group.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Ooookay.

                                 JAY (STANDING UP)
                        Just forget it. 

                                 DICKIE
                        No no no - guys, we’re proud of 
                        Jay, right? Fuckfest 2012 is still 
                        going strong! Let’s clap it up!

           Dave and Wes look at each other, shrug, and start clapping. 

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Go get that board, baby, let’s put 
                        Harper on that bad boy!

           Jay brings the board out from his room, but he’s not happy 
           about it. He writes ‘Harper’ at the top of the Extra Board, 
           and swats at the gong with no effort, then changes the Kill 
           Count to “18”.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, good, we’ve got that out of the 
                        way. Now let’s just watch some TV 
                        and relax, huh? By the way, Harper 
                        was telling us about this Teriyoke 
                        Bar idea.  Apparently you sing 
                        karaoke while the audience squirts 
                        you with teriyaki sauce. How--
                                 JAY
                        Jesus Christ! You tell me just to 
                        bang this girl and now you can’t 
                        shut up about her!

           A beat as everyone looks to each other.

                                 WES
                        Jay, there’s no harm in liking this 
                        chick. We all had fun hanging out 
                        with her.

                                 JAY
                        That’s not the point! The point is 
                        this is not about finding a “soul 
                        mate”, remember! Random sluts! You 
                        taught me that. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        So what if you want to date her? 
                        You’re over Caitlin right? 

           Jay shakes his head and heads for the door. 

                                 JAY
                        I’m going out. Alone. And I’m going 
                        to bang some hot piece of ace and 
                        add another kill. I’ll see you 
                        later.

           SLAM. 

           Everyone kind of looks at Maggie.

                                 MAGGIE
                        What did I say?

                                 WES
                        You. Are. Terrible.

           INT. DIVE BAR - EARLY EVENING 

           It’s a Sunday night and the scene is bleak. A few boozebags 
           are scattered around watching sports, and some locals down 
           shots. Dubstep music is playing to an empty dance floor, 
           making things worse. 

           Jay fiddles with his drink alone at the bar, looking around 
           for potential targets. He makes eye contact with a real WOOF, 
           drinking alone. Gotta have at least 5 years on Jay but looks 
           like it’s 15. Jay looks down at his glass and takes down his 
           drink in one gulp before heading over for the kill. The woman 
           tracks him during the entire long walk over. 
                                 JAY
                        You know, I was over at the other 
                        end of the bar, and --

                                 WOOF
                             (interrupting)
                        Hi. 

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, hi. Anyway, I was over there 
                        and thinking you really remind me 
                        of someone. And then I got it, 
                        “Full House”. You ever -

                                 WOOF
                             (interrupting, again)
                        I’m Liz. 

                                 JAY
                        Oh, ok. I’m Jay. So do people ever 
                        tell you that? It’s someone from 
                        Full House...

                                 LIZ
                        What do you mean? Like the TV Show? 
                        I don’t really get it...

                                 JAY
                        Just forget it. 

           This isn’t going anywhere. 

                                 LIZ
                             (trying to be flirtatious)
                        Do you want to buy me a drink? 

           Jay thinks for second. Closes his eyes. Let’s just cut to 
           winning time and hurry this shit up. 

                                 JAY
                        How about we get out of here and 
                        party a bit? I’ve got some coke 
                        burning a hole in my pocket. 

           Liz is taken aback, just stares at him. He gives his best 
           phony smile. Finally she smiles back and - 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT - BATHROOM - LATER

           Jay is going at Liz doggystyle in a bathroom stall. It’s 
           gruesome. 
                                 LIZ
                             (moaning)
                        C’mon, hoss. Pull my hair. Grab 
                        that shit.

                                 JAY
                             (just trying to get this 
                              over with)
                        Give me a sec, here. Just, stay 
                        still for a sec, I can’t get any 
                        traction, this is going to take 
                        forever.

                                 LIZ
                        Yeah baby, last all night. (real 
                        throaty) I’m gonna cum all over 
                        your dick!

                                 JAY
                        Oh fuck.

                                 LIZ
                             (misunderstanding, 
                              thinking he’s into it 
                              too)
                        Yeah! FUCK!

                                 JAY
                        FUCK.

                                 LIZ
                        FUUUUCKKKKK!

                                 JAY
                             (puts his head on her 
                              back, resigned to his 
                              fate)
                        I regret this immediately. 

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Jay’s walking home from the bar, feeling like shit. 

           As he’s walking, disgusted with himself, his phone starts 
           buzzing. He takes it out of his pocket and see’s an incoming 
           call from Harper. His face lights up.

                                 JAY
                        There she is, Miss California 2012!

           Intercut with Harper.
                                 HARPER
                             (Laughing)
                        Hey, man. 

                                 JAY
                        What’s going on? Can’t even go a 
                        full day without hearing my voice?

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah, something like that. Was just 
                        checking in to see how the hospital 
                        was - I’m assuming your appendix 
                        burst or something the way you shot 
                        out of here?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah, sorry about that... 

                                 HARPER
                        Well I was thinking you could make 
                        it up to me tonight. I’ve got a bad 
                        case of Mr. Scary, I need to do 
                        something. 

                                 JAY
                        Mr. Scary?

                                 HARPER
                        You know, when you get that life 
                        anxiety on Sunday nights after 
                        boozing for the weekend? You feel 
                        that stress about what you’re doing 
                        with your life and get real 
                        depressed? In college we called it 
                        Mr. Scary, coming to visit. 

                                 JAY
                             (laughing)
                        I love that. I think I met Mrs. 
                        Scary tonight too. 

                                 HARPER
                        What’s that?

                                 JAY
                        Nothing, just saying I love that 
                        expression. I’m definitely taking 
                        that and claiming I came up with 
                        it, and that you say it because you 
                        know me. Cool?

                                 HARPER
                        Not even your roommates will 
                        believe that, so go ahead.

                        But in the meantime, wanna come 
                        over and watch a movie or 
                        something? 

                                 JAY
                        Yes. Very much so.

           Jay and Harper watching a movie.

           ECU of Harper’s phone. We navigate through Instagram. She has 
           a ‘notification’; “@yesthatJAY” is now following you.” She 
           follows him back. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jay and Harper at the beach, getting a surf lesson. Harper 
           gets the hang of it right away - Jay can’t ‘pop up’ on the 
           board even on dry land. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Pictures from a facebook album, “The Summer of Yes.” Jay and 
           Harper with wet suits on, smiling, standing behind two huge 
           surf boards; a picture taken of themselves, arm outstretched, 
           at the sunset. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           At a Dodgers game. We hear a ton of boos and see Jay first, 
           creeping lower into his seat wishing he were invisible. We 
           see Harper, decked out in San Francisco Giants gear, getting 
           yelled at mercilessly. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Jay is in his room, retiring the Kill Count and Extra Board. 
           As he puts it in the back of his closet the roommates watch, 
           paying tribute. When he closes the closet door on that 
           chapter, they bring it in for a group hug. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           We see the beach at nighttime and hear hooting and hollering 
           as Jay, Harper, Maggie and Dave run into the ocean naked for 
           a midnight skinny dip.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Harper and Dave are finishing their game. Dickie and Wes 
           enter.

                                 WES (O.S.)
                        I got next!

           They sit on the couch next to Jay and Maggie. 

                                 JAY
                        Actually, we should go soon. 
                        Reservation is for 7:30.

                                 DICKIE
                        Double date night? Classy shit. 

                                 MAGGIE
                        You know it. 

                                 DAVE
                        Alright, we’re going to cut this 
                        game short, but I want you to know 
                        it’s only because we’re going to 
                        dinner, not because you’re beating 
                        me. I’m always best after the 80th 
                        minute.

                                 HARPER
                        Whatever you say. 

                                 JAY
                             (to Wes and Dave)
                        Hold down the fort while we’re 
                        gone.

                                 HARPER
                        Bye guys.

                                 DICKIE
                        Yeah, see ya.

           Maggie, Dave, Jay, and Harper leave. Wes and Dickie sit on 
           the couch in silence.

                                 DICKIE (CONT’D)
                        Well, fuck us I guess. 
                                 WES
                        Yep.

                                 DICKIE
                        Christ, at a certain point, we’re 
                        going to need to get girlfriends or 
                        something ourselves, huh?

                                 WES
                        My mom asks me once a week if I’m 
                        seeing anyone yet.

                                 DICKIE
                        Mine too.

                                 WES
                        Are we turning into a couple of 
                        jokes?

                                 DICKIE
                        Maybe.

           Silence.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The two couples are sitting around a table, mid-dinner and 
           mid-conversation. 

                                 DAVE
                        So the group of us are in our first 
                        grade homeroom, and Ms. Sullivan is 
                        doing a spelling bee, right? 

                                 JAY
                        She was hot.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You were six.

                                 JAY
                        Doesn’t make it less true.

                                 DAVE
                        Anyway, so Ms. Sullivan goes around 
                        and says, ‘say what your father 
                        does for his job, then spell the 
                        word and give the definition.’ So I 
                        say, my dad is a banker, b-a-n-k-e-
                        r, he keeps people’s money safe. 
                        Jay says, my dad is a doctor, and 
                        so on. 
                                 HARPER
                        Ok.

                                 DAVE
                        So it’s Wes’s turn and he says, ‘my 
                        dad is a lawyer. L-o-y-e-r’. Ms. 
                        Sullivan stops him and goes, no Wes 
                        that’s not right, lawyer is spelled 
                        l-a-w-y-e-r. Take out a pencil and 
                        sheet of paper and practice 
                        spelling lawyer 25 times and at the 
                        end of class we’re going to come 
                        back to you and make sure you can 
                        spell it correctly. So finally, she 
                        gets to Dickie, and Dickie says, my 
                        dad is a bookie, b-o-o-k-i-e, and 
                        he’s giving 5-2 odds that the moron 
                        in back still won’t know how to 
                        spell lawyer at the end of class. 

           Everyone laughs. 

                                 JAY
                        And that’s literally how we all 
                        became friends. 

                                 DAVE
                        Exactly - Wes clocked Dickie in the 
                        face and they’ve been joined at the 
                        hip ever since.

                                 HARPER
                        Wait, his dad is a bookie?

                                 JAY
                        Nah that’s just part of the joke, 
                        babe. Dickie was quick like that 
                        even in first grade.

                                 CAITLIN (O.S.)
                        Maggie?! Oh my god hey guys!

           Sure enough, Caitlin comes up to the table, all smiles. We 
           see that Caitlin notices Harper right away.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Hey, Caitlin...

                                 DAVE
                        Hey there.

           Hugs all around. Jay half-rises to greet her. 
                                 CAITLIN
                        I didn’t know you guys were going 
                        to be here. We’re over there for 
                        Alyssa’s birthday.

           A group of girls waves over. 

                                 JAY
                        Oh, cool.

                                 CAITLIN
                        Jay we should still get that drink 
                        sometime. Our last hang out was way 
                        too brief. 

                                 JAY
                        I know, I know. Work’s been crazy. 
                        Um, Caitlin, this is Harper.

                                 HARPER
                        Hi. Nice to meet you.

                                 CAITLIN
                        You too. (awkward) Ok, well. 
                        Anyways, it was nice seeing you 
                        guys. And nice meeting you, Harper.  

           Caitlin walks back to her group of friends.

                                 HARPER
                        She looks better in pictures.

           Everyone looks at Harper, surprised. She smiles.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What, you think I haven’t facebook 
                        stalked Jay’s ex?

                                 JAY
                        That was a touch awkward. 

                                 DAVE
                        Awwwwwwwwk. Warrrrrrrrd.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Anyone wanna come pee with me?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Harper and Maggie are staring at themselves in the mirror.
                                 HARPER
                        Can I ask you a kinda weird 
                        question?

                                 MAGGIE
                        Of course.

                                 HARPER
                        Do you think Jay is over Caitlin?

                                 MAGGIE
                             (thinking)
                        I do. Yes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Dave and Jay are at the table while the girls are in the 
           bathroom.

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah dude, shit is getting real. 
                        It’s to the point where we argue 
                        about it everyday. I got that 
                        ultimatum.

                                 JAY
                        Wait, seriously?

                                 DAVE
                        She said if we don’t move in 
                        together by the end of the summer, 
                        it’s over. She wants to know I feel 
                        the same way about the future.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 HARPER
                        So you don’t think he’s just like 
                        passing time with me and secretly 
                        hoping to get back together with 
                        her?

                                 MAGGIE
                        No way.
                                 HARPER
                        Jesus. I’m sorry to even ask you 
                        all this, I so don’t want to be 
                        that girl.

                                 MAGGIE
                        You have nothing to worry about. I 
                        promise.

                                 HARPER
                        Ok good, cause I really like him. 
                        Like a lot.

                                 MAGGIE
                        No, I know. He’s crazy about you 
                        too. He talks about you non-stop.

           Harper gives Maggie a hug.

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you so much for this.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        I’m too afraid to grow up. 
                        Honestly, if I could break up with 
                        her I would. I love hanging with 
                        the mates. But I’m in love with 
                        her, there’s nothing I can do about 
                        it. (beat) I don’t know what to do, 
                        bro.

                                 JAY
                        Sounds to me like you know exactly 
                        what to do.

           INT. JAY’S ROOM - LATER

           Home from the double date, Jay and Harper are in good spirits 
           as they fall to the bed. 

           Jay’s on top of Harper, kissing her but also just lying 
           there, not really making a bid. 

                                 JAY
                             (between kisses)
                        That was a lot of fun tonight. And 
                        I think that waitress wanted to 
                        bang me. Hard.
           Harper laughs in between kisses. 

                                 HARPER
                        I think she was more into me, 
                        actually.

           Jay stops.

                                 JAY
                        Real talk for a sec? Can we 
                        actually just go to sleep? Not sure 
                        Jay Jr. is up for it tonight.

                                 HARPER
                             (laughing, relieved)
                        I don’t want to hook up either! 
                        Nice! 

                                 JAY
                        Figure this is the good part of 
                        being in a relationship, right? You 
                        can get a good night’s sleep 
                        without feeling like you’re blowing 
                        an opportunity. 

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t know if I see it in the 
                        same romantic terms, but yes, I 
                        agree. I still get to sleep with 
                        you, but without having to put out. 
                        It’s a win-win. 

                                 JAY
                             (getting up)
                        Alright, I’m going to go take out 
                        my contacts. I want to be asleep in 
                        10 minutes so fine by me if you 
                        don’t want to wash your face.

           Harper laughs as he leaves the room. 

                                 HARPER
                        Can I get a t-shirt and boxers to 
                        sleep in? 

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        Check the bin in my closet, it’s 
                        clean stuff.

           Harper goes to the closet and opens the door, taking off her 
           shirt to put on one of Jay’s T-Shirts. Looking through the 
           laundry basket, she’s sees the Kill Count and Extra Board.
           Pushing some other stuff out of the way, she can see a couple 
           of the first entries. Girls names (”Lizzy”, “Shannon”) and 
           some pictures and notes. Confused, she starts pulling the 
           board out of the closet. 

                                 HARPER
                        Uh, Jay, what is this stalker board 
                        you have in your closet? 

                                 JAY (O.S.)
                        What? What did you say? 

           Now able to see the entire board, Harper sees her name and 
           picture on it as well. 

           Jay walks back into the room brushing his teeth, and stops 
           when he sees the board.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck. 

                                 HARPER
                        Jay, what the fuck is this? What is 
                        this creepy weird fucking list of 
                        chicks? 

           Jay has nothing.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Jay? Why do you have something in 
                        your closet with a lot of random 
                        chicks on it, and what looks like a 
                        bunch of personal information. AND 
                        OH YEAH ME. I’M ON THE FUCKIN 
                        BOARD!

                                 JAY
                        Ok, yeah this looks really bad, but 
                        it’s not as stalker-y or whatever 
                        as you think. It was a thing Dickie 
                        and Wes suggested, to get over my 
                        old girlfriend. 

                                 HARPER
                        Like a vision board or something? 
                        What?

                                 JAY
                        No, not exactly, although...that’s 
                        actually not a bad idea at all, for 
                        someone else in the future...

                                 HARPER
                        I think I better go. 
           She stands to leave, putting back on her shirt. 

                                 JAY
                        Harper, stop -

                                 HARPER
                        This is so fucked. 

           She heads out the bedroom door, Jay is following behind. 

                                 JAY
                        Look, when Caitlin broke up with 
                        me, I was really depressed, ok? As 
                        you saw me the first night we met, 
                        I was a mess. I didn’t know what I 
                        was doing out at bars and I was 
                        acting like an idiot at work. 

           Harper stops at the front door, willing to listen. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        My friends, the jackasses that they 
                        are, they suggested this. We called 
                        it a “Killing Spree.” I guess the 
                        idea was for me to sleep with 
                        random chicks with no emotional 
                        attachment, in order for me to get 
                        Caitlin off my mind. 

                                 HARPER
                        You guess?

                                 JAY
                        No, that’s what it was.

                                 HARPER
                        Did it work?

                                 JAY
                        Yes! I am totally over Caitlin, you 
                        know that! You saw it tonight. I 
                        don’t give a FUCK about her. I’m 
                        really happy with you, Harper.

                                 HARPER
                        (skeptical) So sleeping with 
                        anonymous girls fixed you?

                                 JAY
                        The whole thing worked, it wasn’t 
                        really about sleeping with girls, 
                        it was about being a better guy...
                                 HARPER
                        Don’t change the topic like that! 
                        You slept with a lot of girls, 
                        yeah?

                                 JAY
                        Yes.

                                 HARPER
                        And I was one of them?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah.

           Pause.

                                 HARPER
                        At the top of the board, it said, 
                        “Kill Count: 19.” Did you have sex 
                        with 19 girls since Caitlin? Really 
                        dude? 

                                 JAY
                        It was a dark time, I was not in a 
                        good place, and they were all one 
                        night things. But Harper, the 
                        killing spree -- 

                                 HARPER
                        Stop saying killing spree!

                                 JAY
                        Ok. The random hooking up made me 
                        the kind of guy that was able to 
                        ask for YOUR number, take YOU to 
                        dinner, and be charming and happy 
                        enough for YOU to tolerate 
                        dating...at least until about like 
                        10 minutes ago...

                                 HARPER
                        I’m going to ask one more question. 
                        Just be honest.

                                 JAY
                        I will, of course.

                                 HARPER
                        Am I #19? 

           Fuck. Jay breathes deep.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Am I the last person you slept with 
                        Jay? 

           Silence.

                                 JAY
                        No. But no one else meant a thing. 
                        And I didn’t know that we would 
                        turn into this.

           Harper scoffs and turns to leave.

                                 HARPER
                        Fuck you.

           Jay is left alone on his front steps, at a loss for what to 
           do now. 

           FADE TO BLACK

           While the screen is still dark, we hear some rustling and 
           some seemingly random clacking sound. The synthesizer then 
           hits and we’re listening to the opening of “Ruff Ryder’s 
           Anthem”, by DMX. 

           FADE IN:

           INT. JAY’S CAR - NIGHT

           Jay is cruising around by himself. He is wearing a robe.

           He stops for a beat outside Harper’s place. No lights are on. 
           He drives off.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAWN

           Hold on a long shot of the guys’ house. The sun is coming up. 
           Jay’s car pulls into the driveway, he gets out and slowly 
           slinks into the house.

           As the door slams a brief time lapse occurs. The sun coming 
           up and down and up and down, signifying the passing of 
           several days. 

           FADE OUT.
           INT. THE HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Jay sits on the couch staring at the TV, remote in one hand, 
           bottle of beer in the other.  He hasn’t shaved in about a 
           week and for the most part just looks kinda dirty.

           Dave and Maggie are readying to leave for a lovers getaway. A 
           pair of packed bags are waiting by the front door. 

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Our reservation at Sea Grass is for 
                        7pm, so we gotta get on the road 
                        babe.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        I know. Be ready in one minute.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Wait till you see our room. Daddy 
                        booked us in the Rain Man suite.

           Jay continues to sit on the couch listening. Sounds of 
           kissing can be heard. He is stewing. 

           He storms off screen. Pounding footsteps are heard as Jay 
           marches throught he house. He promptly returns to the living 
           room with the Extra Board and Kill Count underneath his arm.

           He reassembles the props to look exactly like they did 
           earlier on. Jay takes a step back to admire his work, but 
           doesn’t notice Dave standing behind him, observing.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           Jay turns around but doesn’t respond.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        You should shave that rat beard. 
                        You look creepy. (beat) OK, we’re 
                        outta here. Be back Sunday night.

           Dave slings the bags over his shoulder

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        Don’t wait up!

           Maggie says goodbye and they are gone.

           Jay goes back to staring at the Extra Board. He’s going down 
           the list of names.
           Jay pulls out his phone to send a text, but his text history 
           with Harper pops up.  ZOOM on a text that reads “Dave and 
           Maggie want us to go wine tasting in Santa Barbara in two 
           weeks. You in?” Harper responded “I’m so in :-)”

           Jay erases his entire text history with Harper, then goes 
           back to staring at the Extra Board.  

           Dickie and Wes barge through the front door.

                                 DICKIE
                        Whoa. What’s going on here? The 
                        Extra Board is back out? 

                                 JAY
                        I was about to go to a dark place 
                        fellas, but not letting that happen 
                        again.  This is my fate now. 

           Jay looks deep into Dickie and Wes’s eyes.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        (dead serious) we’re going out 
                        tonight. We’re going to black out. 
                        And we’re going to get laid.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JAY’S BEDROOM - A LITTLE LATER

           The MISSION IMPOSSIBLE theme song plays, as Jay sits at his 
           laptop. He’s up to something. 

           Jay retrieves paper from his printer and we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DAVE’S CAR 

           Dave and Maggie are en route to Santa Barbara. They drive in 
           pleasant silence. Out of nowhere...

                                 DAVE
                        Babe, am I a good boyfriend?

           Maggie looks over and smiles.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Is this a trick question?
                                 DAVE
                        I mean, I guess I am in the sense 
                        that I’ve never cheated on you. And 
                        I don’t, like, beat you or 
                        anything. But I know deep down 
                        you’ve always wanted more outta me.  

                                 MAGGIE
                        This is weird. Are you about to 
                        break up with me?

                                 DAVE
                        What? No! I’m telling you that I 
                        love you. And that I’m going to be 
                        better. I promise. 

           She holds Dave’s hand.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I love you too. Look, yeah, we 
                        argue sometimes. What couple 
                        doesn’t? But yes, you are a great 
                        boyfriend. I promise.

                                 DAVE
                        I’m trying to be. (beat) One more 
                        question.

           Maggie looks over.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        When we get home, can we start 
                        looking for places to live? Just me 
                        and you? I’m tired of living in a 
                        shitbox.

           Maggie’s face lights up, touched.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           Dickie and Wes drink beers on the couch. Jay enters the 
           living room, and hands them each a sheet of paper.

                                 WES
                        The fuck is this?

                                 DICKIE
                        Boarding passes?
                                 JAY
                        Yeah. Spirit Air is running a 
                        special. Nineteen dollar tickets to 
                        Vegas.

                                 DICKIE
                        I’m not going to Vegas, bro. 

                                 JAY
                        No one’s going to Vegas. We’re 
                        going to LAX. Thought you were a 
                        big picture guy. There’s no other 
                        place on the planet with a larger 
                        collection of hot women confined to 
                        such a small area. It’ll be like 
                        shooting fish in a barrel. If you 
                        can’t find a girl to bang at the 
                        airport, I suggest you turn your 
                        dick in.

                                 DICKIE
                        That’s the dumbest fucking idea 
                        ever.

                                 WES
                        I gotta say I agree with the man. 
                        This is the type of shit I usually 
                        say.

                                 JAY
                        Fine. I’ll go alone.

                                 DICKIE
                        Fine.

           Jay takes this all very personal.

                                 JAY
                        No, no, no. You guys arene’t 
                        backing out of this. We’re going to 
                        the airport.

                                 DICKIE
                        Are you fuckin delusional? Get a 
                        grip, dude. 

                                 JAY
                        Delusional!?  Delusional??!!?? I 
                        wasn’t going to bring this up, but 
                        this whole mess is both of your 
                        fault, and there’s no way you guys 
                        are leaving me in the cold. Talk 
                        about delusional!
                                 DICKIE
                        (raising voice) Our fault? What 
                        exactly is OUR fault?

           This is now a full blown argument.

                                 JAY
                        This whole thing with Harper is 
                        YOUR fault. I had a great thing, 
                        and now I have nothing. And it’s 
                        because of YOU. And YOU. Yeah, I’ve 
                        always been the relationship guy. 
                        And that was fine with me. I liked 
                        it that way. Then you two started 
                        making me feel inadequate about it. 
                        Like I needed to be doing what you 
                        guys do. (mocking) Getting numbers, 
                        wheeling bitches. Misery loves 
                        company huh? And you guys tricked 
                        me when I was at my lowest to 
                        thinking I should be like you. Fuck 
                        you for that. The last thing I’d 
                        ever want to be is like either of 
                        you. You guys are fucking pathetic.

           Jay walks away, out of the house. 

                                 DICKIE
                        You’re gonna wish you could take 
                        all that back.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LOS ANGELES INT’L. AIRPORT - SECURITY LINE

           Jay and JOHNNY CASHMERE are standing in the security line, 
           waiting to go through the metal detector. 

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        This is a great fucking idea, dude. 
                        Best I’ve heard in a LONG time. 

                                 JAY
                        (uninterested) Thanks. 

           INT. AIRPORT BAR - CONTINUOUS

           The guys saddle up to the bar and scope the scene. Or lack 
           thereof. It’s a few couples. Two male pilots taking shots. 
           And a seemingly attractive girl asleep at the end of the bar 
           wearing a tempur-pedic travel neck pillow.
                                 CASHMERE
                        Jesus Christ, this place is fuckin 
                        dead.

                                 JAY
                        (to the bartender) Two car bombs 
                        please.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Car bombs? Ha! This ain’t the 
                        Saddle Ranch pal.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        Just give us two beers.

                                 JAY
                        And do me a favor? Can you or a 
                        waitress bring a Shirley Temple 
                        over to that girl there? 

           The guys get their beers and settle in. We see a waitress 
           bring a Shirley Temple over to the girl asleep in her neck 
           pillow. The waitress nudges her but the girl won’t wake up.

           CUT TO about three beers later. The scene has obviously not 
           picked up. The guys look miserable.

                                 JOHNNY CASHMERE
                        I knew this was a bad idea. Let’s 
                        just go to Q’s and pick up college 
                        chicks. 

           HOLD on the girl still sleeping at the bar. The Shirley 
           Temple still sitting in front of her, untouched. 

                                 JAY
                        You go. I’m gonna stay and see how 
                        this plays out. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. LAX - LATER

           Jay is boarding an airplane. He’s going to Vegas alone.

           CUT TO a plane as it flies over the Las Vegas strip and lands 
           on the runway.

           A fun song kicks in and we are assaulted with rapid fire 
           shots of Las Vegas.

           -The scintillating Strip.
           -High rollers winning money.

           -Gorgeous women dancing at a night club.

           -Gorgeous women at a hotel pool party. 

           -Gorgeous women everywhere.

           It’s an onslaught of Las Vegas and all its epic glory. Then 
           we PULL BACK to reveal that Jay is standing in the Las Vegas 
           airport watching a “Visit Las Vegas” commercial.

           INT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT

           The Vegas airport, on the other hand, is a disgusting and 
           very sad shit hole.

           As Jay takes in the pathetic scene unfolding before him, he 
           sees a row of 90 year old women, all with oxygen tanks 
           attached to their noses, playing penny slot machines. 

           A 65 year-old PIMP walks past Jay with a very overweight 
           prostitute on his arm.

           GROUPS of Chinese tourists are everywhere.

           This is a sad scene and Jay knows it. 

                                 JAY
                        (sotto) What the fuck am I doing?

           He sits down and fishes out his phone. 

           He calls Wes but gets voicemail. He tires calling Dickie as 
           well.

                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                        (leaving a message) Dickie, Wes. 
                        It’s me. Listen, to say I’m sorry 
                        is an understatement.  You’re 
                        right, I would give anything to 
                        take back what I said. I didn’t 
                        mean any of it.  Please call me 
                        back. I need your help. (beat) I’m 
                        in Las Vegas.

           EXT. LAX ARRIVALS - NIGHT

           Jay waits anxiously, pacing back and forth. Dickie and Wes 
           pull up in their car.
                                 WES
                             (from passenger seat)
                        We know, we know, you were wrong, 
                        we were right. You’re sorry, we’re 
                        sorry too. Get in the fucking car, 
                        we don’t have much time. 

                                 JAY
                        Ok, great. 

           INT. DICKIE’S CAR 

           Jay gets in the back. We see the car is already full of 
           stuff. 

                                 JAY
                        What’s all this?

                                 DICKIE
                        What I think Wes was trying to say 
                        was that we feel a little 
                        responsible for this situation too. 
                        We’ve been part of the problem, so 
                        now we’ve done our part to be part 
                        of the solution. 

                                 WES
                        We put together a little “get your 
                        girlfriend back” kit. We’ve got:

           Holds up Chocolates.

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Truffles from Jin Patisserie. I was 
                        looking through your instagram feed 
                        and saw you two lovebirds having a 
                        cup of hot chocolate there like two 
                        months ago. Boom. 

           Holds up a T-Shirt that reads, “Venice: Where Art Meets 
           Crime”. 

                                 JAY
                        That’s that shirt from the 
                        boardwalk.

                                 DICKIE
                        Right. The day we were all at the 
                        beer garden, Harper and I had a 
                        real good laugh about it. This is 
                        going to show her we’re all behind 
                        ya. 
           Jay picks up a painting.

                                 JAY
                        Holy shit, how the fuck did you 
                        guys get this? This is from that 
                        house on Millwood. 

                                 WES
                        We knocked on the door and asked. 

                                 DICKIE
                        You’ve got chocolates, a corny 
                        gift, and an epic piece of local 
                        art. You’re ready to go. Now, as 
                        driver, may I ask where that may 
                        be? 

                                 JAY
                        One second...

           Jay pulls out his phone and starts doing some serious recon. 
           He pulls up Harper’s facebook page. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Ok, looks like she’s at an after 
                        work Yoga Class on Lincoln, right 
                        by the Whole Foods. I fucking love 
                        you, Zuckerberg!

                                 WES
                        Shit.

                                 DICKIE
                        Why ‘shit’? That’s awesome. Grand 
                        romantic gesture, son!

                                 JAY
                        Thanks, guys.

           The guys smile.

                                 WES
                        You’re very welcome.

                                 JAY
                        Can you just swing by the house 
                        first real quick? Got one more 
                        thing to pick up to make this kit 
                        complete.
           INT. YOGA WORKS CLASS - LATER

           A yoga class is in session. Harper is a couple rows back, in 
           the zone. 

           Suddenly, there is a loud CRASH from outside the door that 
           makes everyone look up and stop what they’re doing. 

           INT. YOGA WORKS FRONT DESK - SAME TIME

           Jay is tussling with the woman at the front desk.

                                 WOMAN
                             (grabbing onto him)
                        Hey asshole! You can’t go into the 
                        class unless you’re signed up!

           Jay is desperately trying to get by her, but she’s putting up 
           a fight. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. YOGA WORKS CLASS - SAME TIME

                                 HARPER
                        What the shit?

           Jay suddenly comes banging through the door.

           He dusts himself off and sees the whole class staring at him.

                                 JAY
                        Hi. 

           He spots Harper.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Harper! (to Instructor, who is 
                        staring daggers) I’m really sorry 
                        to interrupt the class here. 
                        Judging by how fit you are, and by 
                        the strength of the woman at the 
                        desk, this stuff really works. I 
                        should probably try it sometime. 
                        But right now I’m hoping you guys 
                        can help me out a bit. 

           He gets his stuff together.
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Harper - Dickie and Wes helped me 
                        get a bunch of stuff to impress you 
                        so that you’d come back to me. We 
                        got you chocolates and some other 
                        stuff I think you’re really going 
                        to like. But before that, I need to 
                        show you something you’ll be less 
                        enthused about. 

           That’s when we see that Jay has brought the Kill Count and 
           Extra Board. He sets it up in front of the class. He looks to 
           Harper.

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        This is the kill count and extras 
                        board from my room. 

                                 RANDOM WOMAN FROM CLASS #1
                        Hey, back up a second slick, you 
                        lost the rest of us at ‘Dickie and 
                        Wes’. 

                                 RANDOM WOMAN #2
                        If you’re going to interrupt our 
                        class the least you could do is 
                        catch us up here. 

                                 HARPER
                        Jay, just leave, please...

                                 JAY
                        Just give me two minutes. Ok, 
                        so...everybody...I’m Jay. 
                        Basically, it’s like this: I got my 
                        heart broken by an evil bitch about 
                        10 months back. When that happened, 
                        I really didn’t know what I was 
                        doing. I didn’t know how to talk to 
                        girls or, really, even know how to 
                        leave the house. So, my best 
                        friends decided to intervene and 
                        teach me how to pick up chicks, 
                        which is documented here. 

           We see Harper looking at the boards, along with the rest of 
           the class. Her look is impenetrable. 

                                 RANDOM #3
                        What are these four groups - 
                        Interpersonal Skills, Technology, 
                        The Long Con, and Winning Time?
                                 JAY
                        I’m glad you asked - these are the 
                        four areas for a guy to work on to 
                        impress girls. 

                                 HARPER
                        Look, you really don’t need to do 
                        this - 

                                 JAY
                        These were the disciplines which I 
                        learned to become proficient in -- 
                        interpersonal skills are just like, 
                        picking up chicks. On the street, 
                        at bars; just knowing how to talk 
                        to ‘em. (charming smile) You guys 
                        can be pretty intimidating, after 
                        all. 

           Some of the group chuckles. Harper looks around, seeing the 
           class warming to him. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        Technology was used to impress 
                        girls after the initial pick-up. As 
                        I’m sure everyone in this class has 
                        done, you meet someone but before 
                        you fully commit to a date or to 
                        anything further, you try to check 
                        them out online. See if they’re a 
                        psycho, a loser, a pervert. Make 
                        sure they look at least a little 
                        normal, that they bathe regularly. 
                        See if any interests line up, like 
                        if they’re huge “Game of Thrones” 
                        fans and which character they like 
                        best.

                        The Direwolves!

           The class looks at them as they blush at each other. Love 
           connection right here in yoga? 

                                 JAY
                        There you go! So this area of study 
                        is basically, how to put your best 
                        foot forward online. Since you know 
                        the opposite sex is going to check 
                        your facebook page and instagram 
                        and all that, give them the best of 
                        you, digitally. For Harper --
           Crowd looks at her. She gives an awkward wave. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        I knew I needed to have a blue-chip 
                        web presence. She loves Venice and 
                        swears it’s the best neighborhood 
                        on earth. I also knew from the 
                        first time we met that she went to 
                        Yale and was for sure a lot smarter 
                        than me. So I made my banner pic a 
                        picture of the Venice Canals around 
                        Christmas time and posted some 
                        David Foster Wallace quote that 
                        made me sound a little more 
                        intelligent.

                        And you didn’t have a problem being 
                        completely dishonest about who you 
                        were?

                        I’m a complete bozo, but we all 
                        hide a few things from people until 
                        we know them better. Like, you 
                        (points to woman who spoke 
                        earlier), anything you don’t want 
                        people to know right away when you 
                        meet them?

                        wanted to show my better qualities. 
                        Now the 4th area is Winning Time, 
                        which is just knowing how to close 
                        the night. Whether it’s the right 
                        time to say, “want to get out of 
                        here?”, or knowing how to take the 
                        party to a more private part of the 
                        bar , it’s just sealing the deal. 

           A pause as the class takes this in.

                        Yes - you see that girl fourth from 
                        bottom on the kill count board?

                                 JAY
                        Yeah?

                        Um. That’s me. 

           Jay looks at her blankly. 

                                 JAY
                        Are you sure?

                        I mean, it’s a picture of me. So, 
                        yes? I’m Sarah - we met at 
                        Shellback’s?

           Jay looks to Harper, who just shakes her head.

                                 JAY
                        Oh, ok. Hi Sarah.

                                 SARAH
                        We hooked up like four months ago. 
                        You thought I dropped $5 on the 
                        ground?

                                 HARPER
                        Jesus Christ. 

                                 JAY
                        Right, of course. Sarah, sorry I 
                        didn’t call you back. Turns out a 
                        little later I met this girl here 
                        who is the love of my life.
                                 SARAH
                        It’s ok. 

                                 JAY
                        Ok. You look great, by the way. Any 
                        other questions?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes. How about the Long Con?

                                 RANDOM #3
                        That sounds bad. 

                                 JAY
                        It may sound bad, but it’s the best 
                        compliment a girl can get. The Long 
                        Con is a strategy for keeping tabs 
                        on a girl that is going to take a 
                        while to win over. Harper was my 
                        first long con. I knew I couldn’t 
                        take her home in one night - she’s 
                        better looking than me, has a lot 
                        of self-respect, and is just...kind 
                        of literally perfect. In order to 
                        hook up with her I needed time and 
                        I couldn’t afford to make mistakes. 

                                 HARPER
                        A mistake like fucking someone else 
                        after me?

                                 CLASS (IN UNISON)
                        DAMN.

                                 JAY
                        Yes, a mistake like that. That’s 
                        all it was. Harper - I knew from 
                        the first time we met; well, maybe 
                        second time we met, that you were 
                        special. You are pretty much 
                        everything I want in another 
                        person, and it scared me that I 
                        found you so soon after breaking up 
                        with a horrible bitch.

           The music starts to swell as the class is getting moved by 
           the speech, hoping for a triumphant reconciliation. 

                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        It made me doubt myself for a 
                        second and I screwed up. But, when 
                        I slept with that other girl; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JAY (CONT’D)
                        yes, it was awful and yes I 
                        regretted it instantaneously; but 
                        at that point I didn’t know you and 
                        I were serious. I didn’t know I had 
                        a chance at something real with 
                        you. All I knew at that point was 
                        hooking up with a girl and not 
                        talking to her afterward. It 
                        freaked me out I did’t want to 
                        leave right away. I thought I was 
                        moving on to the next one. But I 
                        couldn’t move on. I just wanted to 
                        be with you. And I still only want 
                        you. If you give me another chance 
                        I’ll show you I’m yours, 
                        faithfully, forever. 

           He looks to her. She looks at him. The class looks to both of 
           them. The Game of Thrones fans look at each other. Sarah 
           scrutinizes the picture of herself on the board. Tension 
           builds as it looks like Harper is about to say something. 
           Jay’s eyes get big in anticipation. And we --

           CUT TO BLACK

           SUPER: ONE MONTH LATER

           INT. MAGGIE AND DAVE’S NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

           We’re in the kitchen with Maggie and Jay. Maggie is making a 
           salad and Jay is just lingering with a glass of wine. 

                                 JAY
                        I’ve gotta say, I’m really 
                        impressed with this place. You guys 
                        did well.

                                 MAGGIE
                        Thank you, thank you. 

                                 JAY
                        Really, I don’t know how you 
                        managed to get Dave to throw out 
                        all his shit.

           On cue, Dave enters and grabs a bunch of plates. 

                                 DAVE
                        What about me?
                                 MAGGIE
                        He was just complimenting your 
                        lovely girlfriend on her ability to 
                        override your decor choices.

                                 DAVE
                        Whoa whoa whoa. Girlfriend? I 
                        thought the deal was that if I move 
                        in with you, we’re just roommates 
                        and I can start hooking up with 
                        other chicks? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh yeah? If that’s the case you 
                        ain’t eating any of this Chicken 
                        Pomadoro ‘cause I don’t cook for 
                        platonic roommates, pal.

                                 DAVE
                        Dammit, you got me. 

           They kiss. It’s adorable. Jay looks on wistfully. Is it 
           wistful? What happened with Harper?

                                 JAY
                        You guys are too much. All growns 
                        up, hosting dinner parties and 
                        shit. Serious question: do we have 
                        to listen to classical music while 
                        we eat? Do we have to let the wine 
                        breathe for an hour for the 
                        tannins? 

                                 MAGGIE
                        Oh fuck off and grab some 
                        silverware. Help Dave set the 
                        table. 

           Dave and Jay exit the kitchen and head into the dining room / 
           foyer. Just then, the door opens. In walks Harper, Wes, and 
           Dickie. 

                                 DAVE
                        Hey hey, there she is!

                                 DICKIE
                        What am I, chopped liver? 

                                 JAY
                        Hey beautiful.

                                 HARPER
                        Hey, sorry we’re a bit late.
           They Kiss. 

                                 JAY
                        No worries. Gave me more time to 
                        admire their new digs.

                                 MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        Is that Harper? Harper come in the 
                        kitchen I have gossip! 

                                 HARPER
                        I’ll be back in a sec, anyone want 
                        a drink?

                                 DICKIE
                        Wait - there are 8 seats set. 
                        Either I’m retarded or did you guys 
                        invite two more people to this 
                        thing? What’s going on?

           Harper and Jay share a look. 

                                 HARPER
                        Relax. I invited two friends over. 
                        You and Wes are gonna love em.

                                 WES
                        Hot?

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah. Hopefully your “interpersonal 
                        skills” are sharp.

           She rolls her eyes and heads to the kitchen. The door bell 
           rings almost instantly. Dave opens to two girls.

                                 DAVE
                        Hey, Harper’s friends? Amanda and 
                        Claire?

                                 AMANDA & CLAIRE
                        Hi.

           INT. MAGGIE AND DAVE’S NEW HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

           Everyone is now sitting at the table, drinking and eating 
           dinner. 

                                 AMANDA
                        So, Dickie huh? That’s clever.

                                 DICKIE
                        What do you mean by clever?
                                 AMANDA
                        That’s your real name? Like on your 
                        birth certificate?

                                 DICKIE
                        Yep.

                                 AMANDA
                        Lemme see your I.D.

                                 DICKIE
                        Ok fine, my real name is Dean, but 
                        I hate it and never tell anyone 
                        that. So, don’t blow my cover.

                                 AMANDA
                        Dean’s kinda cute. I’m not calling 
                        you Dickie. Only Dean.

           They smile at each other.

                                 CLAIRE
                        (to Wes) You look like someone. Do 
                        you ever get that? Amanda, doesn’t 
                        he look like someone? It’s been 
                        bothering me.  Wait a minute. I got 
                        it.  Perfect Strangers. What was 
                        the foreign guy’s name? Amanda, 
                        what was the goofy foreign guy’s 
                        name from Perfect Strangers?

                                 AMANDA
                        Balky!

                                 CLAIRE
                        (to Wes) Yep! You look EXACTLY like 
                        Balky!

           Dickie and Wes look at each other. 

                                 DICKIE
                        Harper told you to say that.

                                 AMANDA
                        Say what?

                                 DICKIE
                        Harper! Did you tell them to say 
                        Wes looked like Balky? You did.

                                 HARPER
                        Huh? Who’s Balky?
                                 DICKIE
                        I know for a fact you’re lying.

           DING DING DING. Maggie is tapping her fork against her glass.

                                 MAGGIE
                        I’ve always wanted to interrupt a 
                        dinner by ding’ing my wine glass. 
                        But I actually do want to thank 
                        everyone for coming to the first of 
                        MANY grown up dinner parties at our 
                        new casa. I wouldn’t trade this for 
                        the world. So everyone please raise 
                        their glasses. Here’s to THIS.

                                 EVERYONE
                        To this!

           We FREEZE FRAME on the group mid toast, and that photo is 
           then uploaded to Instagram with the caption “first adult 
           dinner party at our new place.” We admire the group for a sec 
           when a second comment is posted from @daveylegend: “adult-
           themed? I didn’t get the memo it was XXX.” From @wesleypipes: 
           “key party!!!”.

           THE END

           As the END CREDITS ROLL, we see real life Instagram pictures 
           of the cast and crew out on the town, getting bombed, 
           laughing behind the scenes, etc.
