           MISTY HILLSIDE - A WILD BOAR

           Tough.  Shoving dirt with his horned snout.  

           Not far away, a MAN (35) and a BOY (10) crouch among shrubs,
           stalking it.  Both have spears.  The man's hair is long,
           tied back.  They are both shirtless, with woolen kilts and
           leather boots tied with straps.  

           The man moves in silently, skilled hunter.  The boy starts
           crawling... his hand SNAPS a twig.

           THE BOAR 

           Hears the sound, runs uphill and into some bushes.  Gone.

           The boy looks to his father, embarrassed.  The man rubs some
           mud off the boy's face.  No judgment.  He gestures up.

           They follow the boar's path uphill.

                                  Scotland, 1285

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. RUGGED COASTLINE & BAY - AERIAL - DAY

           A breathtaking coastal range, misty green mountains, cliffs
           dropping to the sea.  

           Camera descends to find...

           THE MAN AND BOY

           They cross a ridge of green grass and coastal shrubs.  Beyond
           them we see a slope down to the sea.

           The man stops to drink from a water skin, he offers some to
           the boy, then notices him looking down toward the shore at...

           A LARGE BLACK MASS on the rocky beach.  Like a large flat
           rock.  Except it's moving.

           EXT. ROCKY SHORE - DAY

           The man and boy crouch, still as statues.  Their spears up,
           the ocean washing against their legs, their eyes fixed on...

           A WHALE

           Beached and stranded.  About 25 feet long, a bowhead.  Still
           alive, barely.
           The man gestures for the boy to stay put as he cautiously
           steps around the beast, giving it a wide circle, like facing
           an alien.

                            (Scottish accent)
                        "Such a monster as they found that
                        day would have scared off most men."

           They are startled as the whale lets out a great, final breath
           from its blowhole.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "But the McColough knew the face of
                        destiny when they saw it.

           WILLIAM McCOULOUGH, the man, watches warily as his son, RONAN,
           approaches the whale, looking into the great beast's eye.  

           The strange EYE looks back at young Ronan as the whale goes
           lifeless.  

           LATER

           Ronan is trying to climb on top of the dead whale, not having
           an easy time of it.  Finally he gets on the beast's back,
           and stands.

           Below him, William takes his spear point and makes a small
           cut in the whale's side.  He struggles, unsuccessfully, to
           slice open the whale with the spear.  

                                 YOUNG RONAN
                        Pa!

           The boy points up the coast.  His father looks off.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "Heaven knows why God chose this
                        spot to drop whales on the land like
                        ripe fruit from a tree."

           ...There's another enormous black mound a hundred yards away. 
           Another whale, and another beyond that.  

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "But from the seeds of that fruit a
                        new world was born."

           EXT. ROCKY SHORE - A DAY LATER

           A BALD MAN with missing teeth hands William a long sword. 
           William uses it to SLICE the whale flesh much more easily.  
                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "Anyone willing to work was welcomed,
                        and McCoulough shared freely with
                        them.

           THREE MEN use spears to awkwardly lift the wedge of flesh
           off the whale.  They are not used to the smell.

           SOME TIME LATER 

           William, Ronan and the three men pull on ropes, trying to
           get a dead whale up onto the shore.  Getting nowhere.  

           Young Ronan looks up the hill, seeing two men on horseback
           who've stopped to watch. 

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "William's good leadership brought
                        out the good in others.   

           LATER STILL

           The two new men are now pulling too, even their horses have
           joined the rope.  The whale carcass finally MOVES.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OCEAN/BAY - DAY

           William is in a small fishing boat a hundred yards offshore,
           with Young Ronan and two others rowing hard.  

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "And when the whales stopped swimming
                        up to his knife...

           They are approaching a live WHALE, swimming slowly ahead.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "William brought his knife to them."

           William throws a large clumsy hook on a rope at the side of
           the whale... the hook CUTS INTO the whale, which THRASHES
           its tail, nearly capsizing the boat, the line yanks free and
           the whale SWIMS OFF.

           A FAST SEQUENCE 

           Music takes us through William & Young Ronan's early attempts
           at whale hunting, each shot shows William a bit older, his
           son getting bigger and stronger.

           - William throws a common spear tied to a rope, it just
           bounces off the whale's tough hide.  
           - Next try, William throws a heavier spear tied to a line,
           it SINKS into the flesh, and pulls tight... then YANKS OUT
           and flies back at him...

           - New try, better harpoon design, with BARB.  He sinks it
           deep in a whale, and it holds!  The whale THRASHES and TAKES
           OFF, pulling the line with such force it RIPS the front of
           the boat off.

           - Next time it's a bigger boat, and a bigger harpoon, too
           heavy to throw.  So William LEAPS on the whale, getting a
           wild watery rodeo ride, he goes under as the whale DIVES...  

           ON YOUNG RONAN & CREW

           Fearing him lost, scanning the water.  Finally William
           surfaces, coughing.  His son, now 15, laughs with relief.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "William won his share of the hunt,
                        but it was his son Ronan who made an
                        art of it.

           - TEEN RONAN, more man than boy now, shows his father a new
           harpoon he's made, sleek and light with a newly barbed tip. 
           The father approves.

           - Ronan hooks a whale on a single throw.  William manages
           the rope as the whale YANKS them into a crazy wet ride, they
           hold on for their lives. 

           - Ronan, stronger and more confident, makes a longer throw
           at a bigger whale.  William cheers.  Then...

           - In HEAVY SEAS, Ronan THROWS the harpoon from a skillful
           low crouch on the bow, William holding on for dear life...

           EXT. BEACH AND SHORE - DAY

           William and Ronan pull their boat onto the beach, a whale in
           tow.  

                                 OLDER SCOT  (V.O.)
                        "The greater Ronan's harvest, the
                        more hands it employed, and more
                        mouths it fed.  

           There are now several permanent huts built on shore, a
           blacksmith mans the fires for tool making.  

           We pull back to...
           EXT. WIDE SHOT OF TILL - TIME PASSING

           TIME LAPSE shows the village TRIPLING in size.  The buildings
           become larger, better crafted.  More boats in the harbor. 
           Clothes become higher quality as well.  

                                 OLDER SCOT  (V.O.)
                        "There was rope to make from entrails,
                        meat to salt and trade.  Traders
                        brought gold, and gold brought the
                        best builders and artisans from Islay
                        to Aberdeen.

           CLOSE ON

           A large KETTLE, a blazing fire under it, bubbling WHALE OIL
           in it.  Chunks of whale meat are dropped in to be rendered. 
           This is a "try pot".

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "But it was the fine lamp oil rendered
                        from the whale's flesh that brought
                        the English.

           Casks of oil are loaded on a galley, rowed by forty men under
           an English flag and protected by English soldiers.

                        biggest source of oil on the Isles,
                        and the Royal Court of London became
                        their sole customers.

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           A big bowhead THRASHES, the harpoon in its side wagging
           furiously around, the boat LURCHING, Ronan, William and the
           crew holding on.  

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "They had no stomach for it when the
                        whales fought back."

           A second whale RAMS THEIR BOAT.  The bow lifts out of the
           water entirely, the men falling out...
           William falls into a loop of rope, which snags around his
           neck, a sickening SNAP... 

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. ROCKY SHORE - DAY

           William's corpse, wrapped in linen and wool, lies in a shallow
           grave.  Ronan leads the village in solemnly covering his
           father with a mound of carefully piled stones.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "Young as he was, it was decided by
                        all that Ronan would take his father's
                        place as headman. 

           TIME LAPSE.  Many days turn to night and back as we see the
           mound of stone grow into a great forty foot TOWER. 

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "In the years to come the village
                        would grow even more prosperous, a
                        fountain of goodwill and abundance
                        for its neighbors."  

           Night falls, the sound of the SEA overtakes us as we...

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ROCKY SHORE OF TILL - DAWN

           The dawn paints a sharp orange arc across the ocean's horizon.

                                 OLDER SCOT  (V.O.)
                        "It's what came next that's worthy
                        of passing on.  Not because every
                        rise must be followed by a fall... 

           Reveal the face of the adult RONAN McCOLOUGH, staring ahead.

                        can tell the story of us all."

           Pulling back we now see Ronan is standing on top of... 

           EXT. STONE TOWER - DAWN

           Ronan, now 40 years old, stands atop the tower searching the
           horizon.  He wears a goatskin cloak, his body strong, face
           rugged, his eyes sharp but wise.  

           Suddenly he sees it.  A plume of pale mist a mile out or
           more in the ocean, lit against the dawn.
                                 RONAN
                        SPRAY!   

           Ronan BANGS the iron bell, people come out of their huts
           below.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. GREAT BAY/OCEAN - MORNING

           Two whale boats pound against the waves.  They are 25 foot
           SAILBOATS, single mast, five men each.  A harpooner at the
           bow.

           The boats lean under sail, closing in FAST on a pod of three
           bowhead WHALES.  Ronan is lead harpooner, takes a sheepskin
           sheath off the point of a HARPOON.  

           Ronan makes hand signals to the harpooner on the other boat,
           ONCHU LACHLAN (35) an orange haired, bearded, bear shaped
           man.  Onchu's boat tacks to the whale's flank, picking up
           wind and speed.

           Ronan rears back and THROWS, but it's not his harpoon.  A
           heavy ROCK hits near the beasts' eye.

           The whale turns away from Ronan, toward the flanking boat. 
           Onchu lets fly his harpoon.  It hits the whale under the
           water line AS...

           In a flash the men on Onchu's boat scurry to take down the
           sail as Onchu pulls the line around the mast and wraps his
           arm in a GOAT SKIN just in time as...

           The LINE pulls TIGHT, Onchu sets his position, all hands
           jump to the stern as the boat LURCHES forward...

           ON THE WHALE

           Enraged, moving fast.  The harpoon strains, the whale thrashes
           forward and the harpoon PULLS OUT.  Onchu's boat is let go.

           RONAN

           Sees this, calls back to his crew.

                                 RONAN
                        SET THE COIL! 

           Ronan grabs up his harpoon.  His men look out at the
           impossible throw Ronan's about to attempt.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        SET THE COIL!!
           They hop to.  Ronan mounts the bow, sighting the whale,
           pulling rope to his feet.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        READY!

           With monumental strength and skill, he HEAVES the heavy
           harpoon into the air... 

           ONCHU 

           From his boat, Onchu sees Ronan's harpoon fly far up, arc
           down toward its mark...

                                 ONCHU
                        Mother of Christ...

           And STAB deep into the whale's back.

           RONAN'S CREW

           Stunned at this amazing throw even as the line starts to
           pull tight.

                                 RONAN
                        MAST!

           They jump, pull down sail, like a well rehearsed dance, Ronan
           wraps his arm in sheepskin as he pulls the line around the
           mast, just as the line pulls taught and...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        She GOES...

           THE BOAT TAKES OFF.  

           Towed by the terrified whale, smashing against the waves. 

           ONCHU'S BOAT

           He sees Ronan's boat being dragged out to open sea by ten
           tons of muscle running for its life.

                                 ONCHU
                        To OARS!  

           He moves to take the tiller as his men pull oars from under
           benches...

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        James, go up!

           JAMES, a strong, wiry boy of 12 with bright red hair, expertly
           climbs atop the mast where he sits on a crossbar as lookout.
           MOVING WITH RONAN'S BOAT

           RONAN lets out line from the coil, it spins around the mast...
           now do we see why there are charred burn marks on it...

           AERIAL SHOTS/UNDERWATER - the whale pulling the boat fast
           through choppy seas, the boat bouncing like a skipping stone,
           the men exhilarated, terrified, HOLDING ON.

           THE BOW of the boat has a BOW GUIDE, a notch holding the
           line that extends to the whale.  Now the line starts pulling
           DOWN on the bow, the whale diving...

           Without being commanded the crew all lean out over the stern
           as far as possible to counter.

           TANNER (45) is a tall thin crewman with one eye missing.

                                 TANNER
                        She's pulling us under...!

           Ronan grabs a hand ax, ready to cut the line to save the
           boat, but STOPS as he sees the line rise, and RISE...

           And up ahead we see the whale BREECH.

           SLOW MOTION

           Ronan watches the whale launch her body out of the water. 
           The whale splashes down, the line goes TIGHT again, the boat
           LURCHES...

           Tanner falls backward over the stern, grabbed just in time
           by GLEN DOUGLAS (37, hunchback).  Tanner is dragging in the
           water, screaming.  Glen Douglas heaves him back in. 

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Learn to swim, will you?

           ONCHU'S BOAT

           Four OARSMEN row hard, land barely visible behind them. 
           Onchu at the tiller, he strains to see ahead.

                                 ONCHU
                        See them James? 

                                 JAMES
                            (Pointing)
                        Aye!

                                 ONCHU
                        Put down a spark, Eachan!
           EACHAN (pronounced "Ae-kun") is 25, small and quick.  He
           ships his oar, pulls a partially hollowed out wooden block
           tied to a weighted line from beneath his bench.  

           He LIGHTS the oil soaked wick inside, dark smoke rises.  He
           places the buoy in the water as a marker.  

           RONAN'S BOAT

           Ronan feels the taught line, sensing the whale's mass through
           it.

                                 RONAN
                        He's got twenty barrels in him if
                        he's got one.
                            (to all)
                        Let's take him. 

           The men set position and with bare hands on the rope start
           REELING IN THE LINE, moving the boat closer to the whale
           with each pull.  Ronan starts the song (on every "roe" the
           men SHOUT and pull on the rope)...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (starts singing)
                        Oh, roe, soon I see them, oh     
                        Hee-roe, see them oh see them.  Oh,
                        roe, soon I see them, oh      the
                        mist covered mountains of home...

           Tanner picks up the next verse.

           AERIAL SHOT 

           The men pull their way, yard by yard, closer to their prey.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

           The whale is large, ten feet longer than the boat alongside
           it.  It breathes hard through it's blowhole, exhausted.  

           Ronan takes a long SPEAR, he mounts the bow, looks at the
           whale with respect, offers a quiet prayer.

                                 RONAN
                        Thank you Lord, Blessed is this blood.
                            (then to the whale)
                        Beannachd Dia dhuit.
                            (Celtic for "blessings
                             of God be with you.")

           He aims with care, and THRUSTS deep.  The whale's next breath
           blows out dark RED MIST.
           LATER

           Both boats, Onchu's and Ronan's, tow the dead whale toward
           the smoking buoy marking the way home.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TOP OF STONE TOWER - DAY

           A young boy (EWAN, 12) stands atop the tower.  He sees the
           WHALEBOATS in the distance.  We will soon find out this is
           Ronan's youngest son.

           Ewan then notices another boat, coming from a different
           direction.  A much larger merchant ship, under sail.

           Ewan moves to the edge and starts down the rope.

           EXT. BASE OF TOWER - DAY

           Ewan descends to the ground, surprised to find his mother
           (MARGARET, 35) looking at him sternly.  She has a noble
           bearing, long hair and warm, knowing eyes.  She wears a long
           woolen skirt.

                                 EWAN
                        Father lets me!

                                 MARGARET
                        Don't compound your wrongs by fibbing.

           She can see excitement on his face.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        They got one?

                                 EWAN
                        Twenty five barrels, I'll guess. 
                        The Peabody's coming in too.

           Margaret turns to look to sea, spotting the sails of the big
           ship.

           EXT. THE PEABODY MERCHANT SHIP - DAY

           An medieval merchant ship, 60 feet long, one mast with a
           large square sail.  A single figure stands on the bow.

           COMMANDER GARRET (50).  Long hair, salty beard, broad frame. 
           He looks to land, to Till.  One of his crew approaches with
           the commander's shore bag.

                                 GARRET
                            (English accent)
                        Good to be home.
                                 CREWMAN
                        Home?  But you're English sir.

                                 GARRET
                        Only on my parents' side.

           EXT. TILL SHORELINE - BOATLAUNCH - DAY

           Garret and two other men row toward shore in a small boat. 
           The launch is a primitive but well engineered pier that
           extends from the rocky shore.  

           ON SHORE

           Ronan hands off the whale rope.  All available villagers
           come to help.  Old & young, men and women, THIRTY VILLAGERS
           in all, pull on the ropes.  Hoisting the whale onto LOG
           ROLLERS on the shore.  Getting ready for the blades.

           ALBAN TAVISH (40) and Onchu approach Ronan.  These are Ronan's
           right and left hands.  Alban - thin, tall and scholarly -
           seems the opposite of the wide Onchu.  

                                 ALBAN
                        This throw of yours, is it true?

                                 RONAN
                        He embellishes it. 

           Alban hands Ronan the end of a long coiled twine.  

           Ronan walks as Alban uncoils the twine, they're measuring
           the length of the whale.  Ronan reaches one end, Alban the
           other.  Ronan looks at the mark, walks back.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (quietly)
                        Eight lengths.

                                 ONCHU
                        Smaller every year.

                                 ALBAN
                        To say nothing of fewer.

           ON GARRET'S BOAT

           Arriving at the launch.  Ronan steps out to greet him.  Alban
           and Onchu follow.

                                 RONAN
                        My friend!

                                 GARRET
                        Ronan!
           Garret and Ronan shake hands, then hug.  

                                 ALBAN
                            (greeting Garret)
                        I see you've escaped God's judgment
                        once again.

                                 GARRET
                        He'll catch up to me soon enough.

                                 RONAN
                        Tell us, did your silk sell in Lisbon?

           Garret shrugs off the loss.

                                 GARRET
                        Ah!  Portugese aren't quite ready
                        for silk, it appears.  They took
                        well to Onchu's spirits though. 
                        Drank a dangerous lot of it, actually.

                                 ONCHU
                        What'd you tell 'em it was?

                                 GARRET
                        Well, they call this the 'Land of
                        the Scots', so I called it "Scotch
                        Spirits".

                                 ONCHU
                        "Scotch".  

           The men all look at each other, trying out the name.  Then
           shaking their heads in disapproval.

                                 GARRET
                        Well we can think of a better name
                        later.

           They step off the boat launch.

                                 ONCHU
                        You'll sell more if you call it
                        something medicinal.

                                 GARRET
                        They didn't seem to need much
                        convincing.

           The friends head up the sloping shore, which is criss crossed
           with well crafted boardwalk paths.  

           BEHIND THEM
           The whale is hoisted up onto a flat rock stand.  A man slices
           it open with a blubber blade, long sharp knife on a pole. 
           Two more men use hooks to peel the blubber back in a long
           strip and lay it on the stone, where it's cut up by women...

           The whole village cooperates seamlessly, each to a job. 
           This is what they do best.

           EXT. APPROACHING RONAN'S HOME - AFTERNOON

           Ronan and Garret come up the slope, ANNA (5), Ronan's adorable
           youngest daughter, runs downhill to meet them.

                                 ANNA
                        Poppa!  

                                 RONAN
                            (fake approbation)
                        Anna your manners!  Greet our guest
                        properly.

           She makes an ornate courtesy-like gesture to Garret, then
           starts to climb Ronan's leg.  With one hand he lifts her
           onto his back.  They walk toward Ronan's house, which is
           actually two houses joined.  For its time, large and lovely.

           Margaret is outside on a stool, expertly shearing a RAM with
           a sharp blade.  Eldest daughter ELIZABETH (11) holds the
           animal.  Margaret stands and bows.

                                 MARGARET
                        Hello Sir Garret.

                                 GARRET
                        Margaret, even at work you're a queen.

                                 MARGARET
                        Knowing how you feel about royalty I
                        should be insulted.

           He laughs good naturedly.  Touche.  Margaret gestures to
           Elizabeth, she leads the ram off.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                            (to Anna)
                        Anna, did you fetch the water?

           Anna goes, pulling Garret along with her.  

                                 ANNA
                        Come ON!

           They exit.  Ronan approaches his wife, they face each other. 
           She gives his chest a touch with her hand, but it's the
           deepest kind of contact.  
           She's glad he's home, glad he's safe. 

           Margaret motions with her eyes.  Ewan is sitting on a wood
           stool, slowly cutting potatoes.  Total dejection.

                                 RONAN
                        He was on the tower?

                                 MARGARET
                        That's why he's punished, not why
                        he's sad.  The boys called him small
                        again.

                                 RONAN
                        He is small.  Nothing wrong with
                        that.  I was small too at his age.

                                 MARGARET
                        Talk to him.

           He nods.

                                 RONAN
                        When his liver cools.
                            (looking around)
                        Where's Duncan?

           Margaret motions.  Ronan turns and sees DUNCAN - his 17 year
           old son - riding down from the trees.  Duncan is strong,
           passionate, quick witted and quick tempered.  

           Riding on a second horse is EMMA, the fiery, beautiful tomboy
           Duncan plans to marry.  

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Did you give permission for this?

                                 MARGARET
                        No harm in a ride, is there?

                                 RONAN
                        Depends how far.

           Duncan and Emma ride up, flush from the wind.  

                                 EMMA
                        Good hunting, Master McColough.

                                 DUNCAN
                        We heard you brought one in.  How
                        many lengths?

                                 RONAN
                        Eight.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Emma... please stay for supper. 
                        Duncan, we have a house guest.  You'll
                        bed with Ewan.   

           Duncan looks off seeing...

           Garret, who's carrying water toward the house with Anna. 
           Duncan doesn't like Garret.  Or any other Englishman.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Duncan, did you hear me?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yes father.

                                 RONAN
                        Good, go now.  Care for the horses.  

           Duncan and Emma ride off.  Ronan and Margaret are alone.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        First catch.  And the season's half
                        over.  

                                 MARGARET
                        The whales don't belong to us Ronan. 
                        They are a gift.  Their spirits have
                        their own purpose.  We have good
                        fields and sheep.  We will thrive.

           Ronan is nourished by her words.  He touches her face gently.

                                 RONAN
                        No talk of 'spirits' around Alban. 
                        He'll baptize all of us again.

           A shared smile, and back to tasks. 

           INT. RONAN'S HOUSE - TABLE

           A crowded table, two guests squeezed in with the family. 
           Garret, a familiar guest at the table, is telling stories of
           far away, the audience rapt.  

           Emma seems especially enthralled, which annoys Duncan.

                                 GARRET
                        ...Now there is only one place in
                        the Magreb of Tangiers you can get
                        this particular snake gland, and
                        when I arrived there I found it was
                        run by the very same vulture I had
                        just escaped!
           Oohs and laughter from Emma and Elizabeth.  Duncan rolls his
           eyes, makes no secret of his distaste.

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan, do you have something to
                        say?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Why is he here?  We are at war with
                        England father!

                                 RONAN
                        That war hasn't reached us, we should
                        pray it never does.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Our countrymen are dying!  He should
                        stay with our so-called "Governor",
                        the Captain.  
                            (to Garret)
                        Isn't he family to you?  

                                 RONAN
                        Respect our guest.

                                 DUNCAN
                        He doesn't want respect, he wants
                        our oil! 

           Ronan stands.

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan!

           Garret intervenes.

                                 GARRET
                        Please... There's no need.  
                            (to Duncan, warm &
                             respectful)
                        Duncan, in your place, I might share
                        your patriotism.  I don't love
                        everything my King does, but I will
                        always love everyone in this room.

           Duncan is disarmed by Garret's gentle tone.

           The moment is broken by the sound of horses outside.  Ronan
           turns to the door. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE RONAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Three men arrive on horseback, English soldiers.  The leader
           is LIEUTENANT PIKE.  A strong willed enforcer, and a man
           ambitious for promotion.  
                                 RONAN
                        Lieutenant Pike.  What brings you
                        out so late?

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Evening McColough.  I carry a message
                        from the Captain Governor to Sir
                        Garret.

           Garret comes out.  Lt. Pike gives him a sealed envelope.

                                 GARRET
                        Thank you.

           Garret breaks the wax seal and reads.  

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Good catch on the whale McColough. 
                        I hear it almost slipped away.  We'll
                        be watching it closely, to see none
                        is wasted.

                                 RONAN
                        You can see that when we count casks.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        I've been ordered to take residence
                        at bayside.  To assist with the
                        processing.

                                 RONAN
                        No assistance is needed.  

                                 LT. PIKE
                        I'm not asking permission.  I'm doing
                        you the courtesy of informing you.

           Cold looks between them.

                                 GARRET
                            (to Ronan)
                        He wants you to come.  He has a guest
                        from London.  From the Royal Court.

           Ronan doesn't look too enthusiastic about this.  Lt. Pike
           notices.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Not just a guest.  He is the Viceroy,
                        Earl of Covington.  To meet a man of
                        his stature is quite an honor for a
                        fisherman, McColough.
                                 GARRET
                            (sharply at Pike)
                        A fisherman?  Lieutenant...

           Ronan motions Garret to let it go.

                                 RONAN
                            (to Pike)
                        Is there anything else?

           Lt. Pike doesn't like to be dismissed by a man he considers
           his inferior.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Good night Sir Garret, McColough.

           Lt. Pike and his men ride down the hill toward the village. 
           Ronan and Garret turn toward the house.

                                 GARRET
                        He should show respect.

                                 RONAN
                        Pick your battles, not mine.

           EXT. TILL TRY WORKS - MORNING

           On the wood boardwalk, casks full of whale oil are nailed
           shut by Glen Douglas, the village blacksmith.  

           Two of the casks are loaded onto a horse drawn cart by a
           group of teen boys.  James, the young lookout, ties them
           down expertly.  Glen Douglas, James' father, checks the knot. 
           So does Garret.

                                 GARRET
                        Good tight knot. 
                            (to Glen Douglas)
                        Your son has learned well.

           James smiles to his father, who nods proudly.

           Garret gets into the cart's front.  Ronan already has the
           reins.  He slaps the horse, the cart moves.

           EXT. ROAD TO THE CASTLE - DAY

           The cart passes under a canopy of trees.  They've been riding
           and talking for hours.

                                 RONAN
                        ...But what of your wife, doesn't
                        she want you home in London?
                                 GARRET
                        God no!  We have an unspoken
                        understanding.  She gets to be rich,
                        I get to be free.  

           Garret hands Ronan water, Ronan gives Garret the reins and 
           drinks.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        You are luckier than you realize my
                        friend.  Civilization has a long way
                        to go before it's civilized.  Your
                        village is a rare exception.

           Ronan falls into thought.  

                                 RONAN
                        All I've ever wanted was to continue
                        what my father started.

                                 GARRET
                        You've done a lot more than that.

           Ronan stares ahead, troubled. 

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        You know the whales will come back
                        in time Ronan.  You just got too
                        good at hunting them.

           Ronan looks to Garret, claps him on the shoulder with
           appreciation.

           EXT. APPROACH TO DUNNOTAR CASTLE - HOURS LATER

           DUNNOTAR CASTLE is built on a rocky peninsula jutting into
           the sea and is only approachable by a thin land bridge, steep
           jagged slopes on both sides. 

           Garret and Ronan ride past a guard, and onto the narrow
           approach to the castle.  Ronan looks toward a NOISE...

           In the QUAD, a group of twenty screaming SOLDIERS form a
           ring around two fighting bulldogs tearing into each other.

           INT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE - CAPTAIN'S MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Large stone room.  Heavy curtains, high ceilings, cavernous.

           Ronan and Garret are escorted in by a soldier.

           At the far end, the VICEROY sits at a broad table, dressed
           in a heavy purple robe, reading over a parchment.  A PAGE
           stands next to him, holding more tied scrolls.
           Ronan and Garret are led off to join two men waiting at a
           window, away from the busy Royal representative.

           At the window Garret and Ronan bow to...

           CAPTAIN ALEXANDER BARRON (36).  He is dressed in the uniform
           of King Edward's army, speaks with the accent of the educated
           English.  

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        Cousin!  You look well fed as always. 
                        Your travels have been safe and
                        profitable?

                                 GARRET
                        Well... Your shares have done
                        handsomely.  Mine on the other hand...

           He gestures empty hands.

                                 RONAN
                        The Portugese didn't think much of
                        the silk.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        My regrets Garrett.  So McColough. 
                        You finally had a catch?

                                 RONAN
                        Yes.  And you are all expected at
                        First Feast to celebrate.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        The men are looking forward to it.

           The Page hits his staff on the floor, the Viceroy's ready to
           receive a new audience.

           Captain Barron leads the way toward the Royal table.  The
           Captain bows.

                                 CAPT. BARRON (CONT'D)
                        Your Excellency, in honor of your
                        most welcome visit to our county,
                        may I now present Sir Garret Laws,
                        Vice Earl of Sheffield, owner and
                        commander of the merchant ship
                        Peabody.

           Garret bows, the Viceroy acknowledges.

                                 CAPT. BARRON (CONT'D)
                        May I also present Ronan McColough,
                        headman of the village of Till.
                                 VICEROY
                        Ah, the great fisherman.

           Ronan bows.

                                 GARRET
                        He's a whaleman, Excellency.

           The Viceroy pauses, not appreciating being corrected.  Ronan
           throws Garret a look, 'back off'.

                                 VICEROY
                        Again, Commander?

                                 GARRET
                        Nothing Excellency.  Forgive me.

           INT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE - DINING ROOM

           They sit around a large table, being served by a wait staff.  

                                 VICEROY
                            (to Ronan)
                        When the Crown first came to these
                        lands, the Highland elders wore only
                        skins.  Commoners wore barely anything
                        at all.  See them now?  

           He points a painted portrait on the wall, a Scottish noble
           in a fine clan kilt and wools.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        Wherever England plants a flag, the
                        light of civilization spreads.

           The Viceroy stands, walks to a table and picks up an OIL
           LAMP.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        Light is what makes us civilized. 
                        Day only allows time for the basics
                        of survival.  If we want culture,
                        law, education... we must extend
                        that light.

           He turns up the oil lamp, it burns bright.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        To read and study, to invent, to
                        discuss.  To see what was once in
                        shadow.  Civilization is light,
                        gentlemen.  If the fuel of that light
                        dwindles, civilization itself is
                        weakened.  
           Ronan looks to Garret, wondering what's being said here. 
           Capt. Barron clarifies.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        His Excellency has been sent here by
                        the King himself.  It is a growing
                        concern at the Royal Court that every
                        year less oil ships to London. 

                                 RONAN
                        There's no mystery to it.  The whales
                        have become scarce.  

                                 VICEROY
                        Robert Bruce used incendiary catapult
                        to take Elkhardt Castle, he seems to
                        be getting oil somewhere.  It would
                        be natural for a proud man to have
                        sympathies for Scottish independence,
                        wouldn't you say?

           Garret tries to intervene for his friend.

                                 GARRET
                        Your Excellency, Ronan is not
                        political...

           With a gesture, the Viceroy silences Garret, waits for Ronan.

                                 RONAN
                        You English have always treated my
                        village fairly.  

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        Excellency, for what it's worth,
                        I've known this man since my posting,
                        and I trust his word.

                                 VICEROY
                        Yes, we know how cordial you've been. 
                            (to Ronan)
                        Leniency causes simple people to
                        take Royal favor for granted.

                                 RONAN
                        Leniency sir?

           Ronan's back is going up.  The Viceroy approaches Ronan and
           leans close.  

                                 VICEROY
                        It is of vital importance that more
                        oil flow to London.
                                 RONAN
                        But if there are no whales...

                                 VICEROY
                        Of course there are whales.  One
                        simply has to find them.

           Ronan's anger showing.

                                 RONAN
                        By my word, Sir, we harvest all that
                        the sea offers!

           The Viceroy looks at Ronan a beat, steps back to his place.

                                 VICEROY
                        And where would the Empire be if we
                        only took what was offered?  

           The Viceroy turns and leaves.  The men at the table all stand. 
           Ronan and Garret share a glance, "what just happened?"

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           Onchu marches purposefully down the green misty hillside,
           carrying a wooden CASK on this thick shoulder.  He enters a
           rock walled, thatched roof BARN.

           INT. ONCHU'S DISTILLERY - DAY

           Onchu lowers the keg onto a wood table.  Seated at the table
           are three of the crew.  Tanner and Glen Douglas we've met,
           there's also JOHN KEY.  Cantankerous, missing teeth and two
           fingers. 

           Onchu HAMMERS a spout into the keg, pours a little into a
           cup.  He smells it, then offers it to Tanner.  Tanner refuses.

           Ronan and Alban enter from outside.  The men greet each other.

                                 ONCHU
                        Ronan, what's your opinion?

           He offers Ronan the cup.  Ronan takes a small sip, almost
           gags.

                                 RONAN
                        God in heaven...

                                 ALBAN
                        Ronan, the Lord's name...
                                 ONCHU
                        Bad?

                                 RONAN
                        Like Satan's flaming piss.

           Onchu tries a taste.  He winces too.

                                 ONCHU
                        Few years to go on that.

                                 RONAN
                        Onchu, something drinkable.  

                                 JOHN KEY
                        Drinkable he saving for hi'self.

           Onchu - busted - goes searching for another cask.

                                 RONAN
                        Your best Onchu!  Sir Garret's to do
                        the opening toast.  Anyone seen him?

           They all shake their heads no.

           Ronan's son Ewan enters with his best friend ALEC, Onchu's
           son, a 10 year old with shaggy long hair.

                                 ALEC
                        Father!  Can I go down with Ewan?

           Onchu comes out, nods to his son.  He hoists a new cask over
           his shoulder.

                                 ONCHU
                        Hate partin' with this.  

                                 TANNER
                        That's a good sign.

           EXT. VILLAGE/SHORE - AFTERNOON

           A great SPIT over which cooks pig and sheep.  Nearby a
           storyteller spins an epic yarn to some entranced listeners. 
           Beyond him, a juggler...

           All of Till is out, covering the beach and beyond.  People
           from neighboring villages travel miles to be here.

           Ronan, a local legend, welcomes some visitors.  A stranger
           approaches and greets Ronan with great respect, Ronan politely
           gets rid of him, then helps Margaret turn the spit.
                                 RONAN
                            (to Margaret)
                        Have you seen sir Garret?

           Margaret hasn't.  CHEERS erupt as behind her we see young
           boys racing up ropes to the top of the tower, a contest...

           A SERIES OF SHORT SCENES...

           Four men play lively music from pipes, drone organ, and drum. 
           Tanner is showing off his STEP DANCE skills, in a competition
           with Eachan on a boardwalk. 

           Tanner, slightly hammered, loses his balance.  Eachan comes
           out and WOWS the crowd doing Riverdance like moves.  

           An OLD MAN shows little Anna how to carve whalebone.

           Onchu passes a mug of scotch to Glen Douglas, whose wife
           ILAAN, big boned and jolly, unexpectedly takes it and drinks
           it all down.  

           The men freeze and watch how she'll react.  After a moment
           of suspense, she coughs, laughs, and pounds Onchu on the
           shoulder.  Onchu and Glen Douglas laugh with relief.

           Duncan is sword fighting with a friend, wood swords only. 
           Although this is play, it's vigorous.  Duncan is quite
           skilled, and bests his opponent with a "fatal" strike.

           The surrounding crowd applauds.  Duncan has a drink.

                                 DUNCAN
                        A red hen to anyone who can take me.

           The crowd "oohs", Duncan turns to see Emma taking up the big
           wood sword.  

                                 EMMA
                        Looks like it's up to me.

           She swings for practice, the big sword is obviously too heavy
           for her.  People laugh.  She puts it down.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Surrendering?

                                 EMMA
                            (seductive)
                        I'm not that easy.

           She approaches an older man in the crowd, who hands her two
           smaller wood swords.
                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        Thank you father.

           Emma takes a wide stance, one sword in each hand.  Duncan
           readies.  He attacks and she parries expertly.  He attacks
           again, and she sneaks in a strike on his leg.  She's a
           whirlwind, fast and light.  

           The crowd loves it.  So does Duncan.

           Elsewhere, Margaret directs the serving of the feast.  An
           enormous amount of food...

           An older man stands on a rock, delivering a diatribe for
           Scottish independence.  This is MACKAY.  (60).

                                 MACKAY
                        ...Forced conscription has begun in
                        Grandee and Edinburgh!  Are you now
                        to send your sons to fight for the
                        usurper, Edward of England against
                        the true king of Scotland, Robert
                        Bruce...!?  

           Ronan passes MacKay, stopping a fight between two little
           boys.   

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. VILLAGE/SHORE - NIGHT

           It's many hours later.  The food is eaten, things are quiet. 
           A group sits around the fire, boys with girls mostly, the
           SINGER singing a ballad of romance, heroism, and death.

           Emma and Duncan are listening, her head on his arm.  In her
           hand she holds a FLOWER carved of whale bone, white as ivory. 
           She gives it to Duncan.

           From far off, Ronan watches them for a beat, his son becoming
           a man.  Ronan turns and steps away.  

           Emma pulls Duncan, they stand and walk up into the darkness.  

           WITH DUNCAN AND EMMA

           As they move up the boardwalk.  They find a secluded place
           near some trees, dimly lit.

           Duncan's eyes feast on his beloved, she has never looked
           more beautiful.  He touches her face gently. 

           She takes his hand, kisses it.  Then she moves it...
           haltingly... down her face and neck to her breast.  
           This is all new to them, and much anticipated.  Their eyes
           are locked.  Breath heavy.  Her eyes close, feeling his hands
           on her.

           He moves in, his mouth hovering over hers.

           They kiss.  As pure and full as a flower that blooms once in
           its life.

           Duncan takes her hand.  His eyes ask, "are you sure?" 

           She pulls him up into the trees...

           And a few feet from where they just were, we now see...

           SOLDIERS.  Several of them, hidden all along the ridge. 
           Camera travels up, revealing DOZENS of them.

           ROUNDHATS all over the woods.  And leading them is Lieutenant
           Pike.  Looking down on the village, waiting.

           EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - HOURS LATER

           The village sleeps.  The feast fires are down to coals.  

           There is a glow over the village, but it's not the dawn.

           INT. RONAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ronan sleeps next to Margaret.  The distant glow throwing a
           dim light in the room, Ronan's eyes open.  He sits up. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE RONAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ronan comes out.  He can't see it well, but something is on
           fire.

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan!

                                 MARGARET
                        Duncan's not in his bed!

                                 RONAN
                        Where's Ewan?

                                 MARGARET
                        He stayed in the village.

           Ronan pulls on his cloak, grabs a bucket.

                                 RONAN
                        Ride to Alban, tell him to get the
                        men and meet me at Mackay's.
           Ronan runs down the hill.

           EXT. MACKAY HOUSE - FIRE - NIGHT

           Ronan arrives.  Onchu has already organized a bucket relay,
           running water up from the bay.

           The main house is totally ablaze, the barn is afire on one
           side.

                                 RONAN
                        Onchu, wet the barn!  

                                 MACKAY
                        NO!  NO!

                                 RONAN
                        The house is gone MacKay!  
                            (to Onchu)
                        Save the barn!

           Onchu nods, redirects the relay to the barn.  Ronan adds his
           bucket into the relay, joins the line.  Other men arrive as
           well, pulling together.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. HILLSIDE ROW - NIGHT

           Four simple thatch roof huts built in a group.  Two WIVES
           stand on the hillside watching the burning house which is
           distantly visible below.

           Behind them, SOLDIERS spreading out.  A SCREAM of a child,
           the women turn and run toward the houses, the soldiers make
           off with two screaming BOYS.

           INT. ANOTHER HOUSE - NIGHT

           A DARK HAIRED BOY of 15 is suddenly YANKED from his bed.  He
           CALLS OUT.

           His FATHER jumps up, runs out and is SLAMMED with the butt
           of a sword, he collapses as his wife comes out and sees their
           son being carried down the hill by soldiers.

           A FLASH OF SHOTS show us the SOLDIERS taking the sons of the
           village, every male in his teens they can find.  

           One BLONDE BOY of 7 climbs up a tree, a soldier in pursuit
           reaches up, GRABBING his foot... he loses his grip... falling
           head first toward a sharp ROCK...
           EXT. MACKAY HOUSE - FIRE

           Ronan grabs a bucket, runs it to the barn, THROWING it on.

           Duncan runs down from the hill, Emma following.  Ronan sees
           the two of them.  

                                 RONAN
                        Where were you?

           Duncan hesitates, looks to Emma, the blush of shame...

           We hear SCREAMS, someone approaching on the path from the
           village.  A young girl, running with everything she's got to
           Ronan...

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        SOLDIERS!  SOLDIERS!

           EXT. ROAD - RAIL WAGON - DAWN

           A soldier ties a rope around the wrist of a new captured
           boy, it's ALEC.  Another soldier drags Ewan toward the wagon
           and ties his wrists to it.  

                                 LT. PIKE
                        That's it, let's go.

           The wagon now starts moving.  Twelve village boys aged 11 to
           16 lashed to it, Alec and Ewan among them.

           Ronan, Duncan, Onchu, Alban and several other men run up the
           road.  A few have staffs, but they are mostly unarmed.  

           RONAN sees his son and CALLS OUT.  

                                 RONAN
                        EWAN!!

           Ronan runs after him.  

                                 LT. PIKE
                        LINE!

           Archers with CROSSBOWS take formation, aiming at Ronan and
           the other approaching men.

                        STOP OR WE WILL FIRE.

           Ronan runs forward with Onchu and other fathers.

                                 LT. PIKE (CONT'D)
                        FIRE.
           The archers let loose, arrows fly, hitting all around them,
           DUNCAN SCREAMS, hit in the leg, he falls.

           Ronan goes to Duncan, Alban catches up, getting in front of
           them to stop them.

                                 ALBAN
                        HOLD BACK!  Ronan, for the sake of
                        God...!

           ON RONAN

           Raging, holding his injured son, looking to Pike.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        SECOND LINE!

           A new line of archers steps up while the first reload.

           Onchu BARKS defiantly at the English, starts toward them,
           others follow. 

                                 ALBAN
                        Ronan get hold!  They will cut us
                        down!

           Ronan grabs Onchu.

                                 RONAN
                        Onchu stop -- 

                                 DUNCAN
                        No...!

                                 ONCHU
                        They must bleed for this!

                                 RONAN
                        Not now.   

           The archers still have their weapons up, behind them the
           wagon and the children roll up the road and away.

           ON EWAN AND ALEC

           Wide eyes, staring back toward their fathers.

           ON RONAN AND ONCHU

           Sick with anguish, they helplessly watch their sons go out
           of sight.

           Lt. Pike rides his horse in front of the archers, faces Ronan.  
                                 LT. PIKE
                        Your sons will be the Captain's guests
                        until such time as your village brings
                        the whale harvest to its previous
                        abundance.  You are all suspected of
                        treachery.  Any misdemeanor will
                        carry disproportionate cost.

           The Lieutenant turns his horse away.

                                 RONAN
                        Lieutenant!

           Lt. Pike turns back.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (with gravity)
                        What you are breaking here can never
                        be repaired.

           Lt. Pike looks down at Ronan without sympathy, heads back to
           his men.  

           The archers turn and march up the road behind the Lieutenant,
           their backs to Ronan in the ultimate act of disregard.

                                 ONCHU
                        We can get ahead of them, we can
                        attack...

                                 DUNCAN & OTHERS
                        YES!  Death to them...!  

                                 ALBAN
                        They'll kill you all.

                                 RONAN
                        He's right, there are too many of
                        them.

                                 ONCHU
                        They have MY SON!

                                 RONAN
                        THEY HAVE MINE TOO!  
                            (Beat)
                        They are fifty Onchu.  Fifty armed
                        and trained.

           Onchu turns away, venting his fury with a SCREAM.  Ronan
           bends and pulls the arrow out of Duncan's calf.

                                 DUNCAN
                        What father can stand idle and watch
                        his son be taken?
           Duncan's contempt stings.  Ronan stands, watching as the
           last of the English soldiers cross over the peak.  

           INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - DAY

           A RED HOT IRON is lifted from the fire.  Ronan holds down
           Duncan as Glen Douglas SEARS his wound, Duncan SCREAMS, but
           it's quickly over.  Ilaan applies a balm.

           We're in Glen Douglas' blacksmith shop, open on all sides,
           large table in the middle, central fire pit. 

           Nearly the whole village has converged outside the shop,
           angry voices, vengeance in the air.  "Treacherous bastards!" 
           "How many boys?"  The mood grows more violent...

                                 VOICES
                        Show them our steel... No, get a
                        message to the Bruce... attack!
                            (cacophony rises)
                        DRIVE THEM OUT...!

                                 RONAN
                        They have HOSTAGES...!

           Ronan's booming voice silences all.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        We will consider this calmly.  Who
                        speaks first?

           Ronan points to an OLD MAN with a MISSING LEG.

                                 MISSING LEG
                        They have 200 soldiers garrisoned at
                        Dunnotar.  How do we attack that?

           Murmurs of agreement.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        With an alliance.  If The Bruce hears
                        of this, he will come with his army.

                                 ALBAN
                        His army is engaged south of Leeds. 
                        It could be months.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Then we attack the castle ourselves!

                                 VOICES
                        He's right... God is with us!  No...

           Commotion takes over, many want vengeance.  Ronan raises a
           hand.
                                 RONAN
                        HOLD!
                            (the room quiets)
                        Alban... 

                                 ALBAN
                        The castle's seaside face is
                        undefended.  An attack is possible.  

           People voice approval, Alban stands.

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                        But the costs would be high, there
                        would be deaths among us, and likely
                        among the boys.  And even if we manage
                        to get our sons out, we can never
                        come back here.  The English will
                        follow, they'll burn us to ashes.  

           This has a deeply sobering effect on the group.

                                 MISSING LEG
                        Well what of the ransom then?  There
                        must be whales out there somewhere.

           All eyes turn to Ronan.  Ronan takes a breath, stands.

                                 RONAN
                        We have watched from the tower, we
                        have watched from boats out as far
                        as eyes see.  The whales come no
                        longer to the bay.  

           He steps to a hand drawn map on the table, representing the
           village, the Great Bay, and some of the ocean beyond.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Vananberg, the Old Norseman, tells
                        of whales in the White Sea.  North... 

           He points a direction, far off the map.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        The whaleboats are too small for
                        such a journey.  

                                 EACHAN
                        What about MacClede's boats? 

           Ronan turns to a man in the group, MacClede, who nods.  He's
           clapped on the shoulder, voices are raised in support of the
           plan.  Commotion grows again...

           Ronan raises his hand for quiet, people settle down.
                                 RONAN
                        No Scott has ever ventured half that
                        distance.  No one here has ever gone
                        even a short sail from the sight of
                        land.  We would be many days beyond
                        that.  Out there, navigation is life
                        and death, and none of us is a
                        wayfinder.

                                 GARRET (O.S.)
                        I am.

           People turn, Garret stands at an entrance.  People's hostility
           is immediately voiced...

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Keep out of here, English bastard.

           Glen Douglas picks up a blacksmith hammer and steps toward
           Garret.  

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                        Where were you last night?  

                                 RONAN
                        Why weren't you at the feast?

                                 GARRET
                        Do you want your sons back, or don't
                        you?

           Glen Douglas looks to Ronan for a cue, Ronan signals to let
           Garret in, regarding Garret with suspicion.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        Nobody knows these seas like I do. 
                        And the White Sea is more that even
                        I have dared.  Without me, you've
                        not a hope.

           Ronan looks to Onchu and Alban.  Then to Garret.

                                 RONAN
                        Why would you risk this?

                                 GARRET
                        I've made the offer.  Have you a
                        better one?

           EXT. VILLAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS

           A SERIES OF SHOTS as the larger boats are prepared...

           Old fishing equipment is stripped off, oar supports are added
           to the gunwales, sails re-stitched.  
           Harpoon tips forged and sharpened, fresh water poured into
           skins and casks, struan wrapped in cloth, dried meat packed...

           INT. RONAN'S HOME - EVENING

           Ronan eats with his family.  Margaret and Duncan and the two
           girls, with a place set for Ewan.  Duncan silent, angry.

           The mood is solemn.  Anna doesn't really get what's going
           on, glancing to all the faces.

           LATER

           Ronan is outside, coiling a rope.  It's near dark, the sky a
           pale orange.

           Margaret approaches him.

                                 MARGARET
                        Is there no other way?

           He coils rope silently.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Offer another ransom, sheep, or
                        gold...

                                 RONAN
                        They have all that.  

           She touches his arm, he stops.  Fear in her voice.

                                 MARGARET
                        There's a spirit in the whale Ronan. 
                        It must be given to us.  To reach
                        out and take it, such a kill is not
                        sacred.

           She is genuinely afraid.  He holds her tightly.  

           EXT. VILLAGE SHORE - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

           Most of the village has come out to see the men off.

           The two re-fitted boats are at the dock's far end, getting
           loaded up and ready.  They are sturdy, considerably longer
           than the whaleboats but still narrow.  They can move by oar
           or by sail.  

           Onchu approaches Ronan, who directs the loading.

                                 ONCHU
                        Aye, a word.

           Onchu points to Glen Douglas and son James, standing nearby.
                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Glen Douglas thinks the boy shouldn't
                        come.

                                 RONAN
                        I bloody well agree with him.

                                 ONCHU
                        The boy doesn't.  He's kicking mad. 
                        And we could sure use him atop that
                        mast.  If you're askin' me.

           Ronan thinks about this.  He steps to Glen Douglas.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        He's my only son, Ronan.  I can't.

           Ronan nods.

                                 JAMES
                        Leave me behind, I'll run away, I
                        swear it.  I'll join the Bruce.  

                                 RONAN
                        This isn't your fight, James.

                                 JAMES
                        Who's is it then?  I should be in
                        the castle dungeon too!  
                            (to his father)
                        I'll run away father, I swear to
                        Christ and back.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Your mouth son...

                                 JAMES
                        Hog shite my mouth...
                            (to Ronan)
                        I'm your eyes!  You need me and you
                        know it!  I'm a whaleman as much as
                        any of you.

           Ronan claps Glen Douglas on the shoulder.

                                 RONAN
                        It's your decision.  Make it fast.

           Ronan steps away, pointing Eachan (who carries a crate) to
           one of the boats.

           Alban approaches, carrying rolled parchments.  Several of
           them.
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        What's all this?

           Alban gestures back.  Garret follows, carrying still more
           charts, and a bulky ASTROLABE.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        So many charts for just one sea?

                                 GARRET
                        They are not charts of the sea, they
                        are charts of the sky.  

           Alban and Garret continue toward the boats.  Then Ronan spots
           Duncan, limping toward the boats with some gear.

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan...

                                 DUNCAN
                        I'm going with you.

                                 RONAN
                        You're needed here, you're staying.

           Duncan flares with rage.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Don't command me!  You brought us to
                        this!  Collaborating with the enemy!  

                                 RONAN
                        You are not on this hunt!  You will
                        stay with your mother, and you will
                        obey her. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        Do not treat me like a CHILD!

                                 RONAN
                        Do not ACT like one!  

           Duncan seethes, red hot.  Ronan stands unwavering.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (gently)
                        Your mother needs you.  Do this for
                        me, and on my return, you can do as
                        you like.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        And if you don't return?

           Cold as ice, as if wishing it so.  Ronan is not provoked.
                                 RONAN
                        Your anger is your weakness.  Be
                        careful with the English.  

           Ronan turns away.  Duncan looking after him.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. SHORE/DOCKSIDE - MORNING

           Alban stands on the dock, before a motionless crowd.  During
           his prayer, we take in the faces of the villagers.  Rugged,
           frightened, determined...

                                 ALBAN
                        Heavenly Father, who commands over
                        all...  Permit us who fear you to
                        pass safely through your untamed
                        reach.  

           A series of shots -- Onchu silently takes his wife's hand. 
           Margaret wipes a tear from Anna's cheek.  Glen Douglas' wife
           Ilaan puts a necklace on her husband for luck, a Scottish
           Cross made of hardwood.  Then she kneels and hugs little
           James.

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                        Forgive our sins, and protect from
                        harm all who bow to your dominion.    

           We finally take in the whole group of whalemen, standing
           together at the base of the dock, holding their oars, tools
           and harpoons.

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                        We beseech you, grant success to
                        this hunt, oh Lord, that we may serve
                        you in peace forever.  In the name
                        of The Father...

                                 ALL
                        AMEN.

           Alban turns, walks the length of the dock, and gets in one
           of the boats.

           Ronan climbs onto the dock, carrying a harpoon.  He turns to
           the crowd, surveying them for a long moment.

                                 RONAN
                        It's in God's power alone to grant
                        us success.  But it's in ours alone
                        to deserve it.   
           He looks among the faces.  Then he raises the harpoon over
           his head.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        For our SONS!

           The crowd lets out a triumphant YELL.  Ronan turns and strides
           to his boat.  The whalemen climb the dock, board their boats. 
           Eight men in each.  

           The ropes are thrown, the last jump in.  They push away, and
           the boats are off.  Rowing, twelve oars in the water.  Onchu
           sings a rhythm...

                                 ONCHU
                        PULL your tug along......           
                        HEAVE OFF your sorrows.......... 
                        You were BORN to the salt sea...    
                        You'll be DYIN' the 'morrow.

           ON THE OARSMEN

           Pulling, watching their loved ones growing distant.

                                 TANNER
                            (to Eachan)
                        They don't want whales, I say.  They
                        want the men gone, to have away with
                        the women.

                                 EACHAN
                        Your wife will scare them off, Tanner. 

           ON GARRET

           Garret looks to the sun, then to the horizon.

                                 GARRET
                        We won't reach the White Sea.  Not
                        if four days' drinking water is our
                        limit.

                                 RONAN
                        No one knows his limit until he's
                        well beyond it.

           INT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE - THE HOLD - DAY

           The boys from the village sit and lie on the floor of a large
           stone room.  At one end is straw for them to sleep on, at
           the other are crude wood pots for shitting.  

           Ewan and Alec are next to each other.  Alec is panting with
           fear, Ewan concerned for him.
           The heavy wood door opens, admitting two soldiers and a FRIAR
           in a hooded robe, carrying a switch stick.  The Friar steps
           among the boys, looking them over.

                                 FRIAR
                        You will call me "Master".  You will
                        stand when I enter, and do as I say.

           Alec looks to the open door, his panic RISING.  Ewan, next
           to him, hears him hyperventilating.

                                 EWAN
                            (whispering)
                        Alec...

           Alec BOLTS for the door.  

           The Friar grabs him, HEAVES him to the floor and WHIPS him
           with the switch.  Ewan leaps to his defense, a soldier throws
           him into the wall.

           The whipping finally stops, Alec is whimpering.  The Friar
           turns to the boys, giving them all a fearsome look.

           He leaves, followed by the soldiers.  Ewan goes to Alec. 
           The bolt on the door SLAMS home, locking them in.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           Ronan stands looking ahead, hand on the mast.  Sail up and
           full.  

           Garret lines up the astrolabe, which is a metal plate marked
           with lines and zodiac symbols, arc segments and degree
           numbers.  In its center is a rotating sighting tube, through
           which you site an object - the sun, a star - to measure its
           angle from the horizon.

           Garret then unwinds a needle at the end of a thin string and
           carefully guards it from wind as it acts as a crude COMPASS.

           Alban observes this, face troubled.  Approaches Ronan.

                                 ALBAN
                        Are we to be guided by black magic?

           Ronan sees the crew, staring with suspicion.  He goes to
           Garret.

                                 GARRET
                        Point the bow against the current
                        thus.  
           He points a direction.  

                                 RONAN
                        Keep that out of sight.

           Garret doesn't understand, then notices the crew looking at
           him and his compass.  He puts it away, stepping aft. 

           COOK (35) an oarsman with a scar over one eye and a crazy
           stare, speaks in a whisper.

                                 COOK
                            (to Tanner)
                        Witchcraft.  Satan's workings.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - SUNSET - HIGH AERIAL

           A great red sunset, a pallet of flat clouds, and the two
           boats far below us, plowing through water under a good wind.

           EXT. OCEAN - ON RONAN'S BOAT - SUNSET

           DEAF WILLY, a crewman with a strangely shaped head and no
           hair, is fishing over the stern.  Garret steps back toward
           him, loading his pipe.

                                 GARRET
                        You don't want to create drag, it'll
                        separate us from the other boat.

           Deaf Willy ignores him.  Garret taps his shoulder.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        You're slowing the boat, man.

           Glen Douglas has the tiller, sees all this.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        He can't speak.  

                                 GARRET
                        Tell him he's slowing us down.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        He can't hear either.

           Garret picks up the obvious hostility.  

           Willy's line JERKS.  He YANKS it, the line PULLS TIGHT.  

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                        GOT ONE!  
           Men rush to help as Willy fights against the mighty pull. 
           Garret is pushed, nearly toppling out of the boat.

           Ronan grabs him, pulling him back in.  

                                 GARRET
                        Thank you.

           No sign of friendliness from Ronan.

           Behind the boat we see a 20 pound SEA BASS leap from the
           water, trying to shake out the hook.  The men YELL excitedly
           as they pull in the line, hand over hand.  

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

           A distant shot shows the two boats, still under sail but
           close to each other, one with a small fire aboard, pillar of
           smoke rising.  Songs being sung...

           ON RONAN'S BOAT

           There's a small stone fire basin where a section of the fish
           is cooking.

           Garret is holding the astrolabe, sighting it to a star. 
           Ronan joins him. 

                                 GARRET
                        We'll turn due north at dawn, the
                        wind will be against us.  Oars only.

                                 RONAN
                        Must we tire the men?

                                 GARRET
                        We must follow the meridian, or I
                        have no reference.

           He puts the astrolabe into its box, takes up his navigation
           log.

                                 RONAN
                        Why did you come with us?

                                 GARRET
                            (sarcastic)
                        For King and Glory.

           Ronan stares, not accepting that answer.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        Because without me, you had little
                        hope of success.  And knowing that,
                        you would have attacked the castle.
                                 RONAN
                        So you risk your life?

                                 GARRET
                        As I would for anyone in my family.

           Garret sits, looks out to sea.  Ronan joins him.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        It sickens me what we've done to
                        you, but it shouldn't have surprised
                        me.  You and I both have prospered
                        by feeding the empire.  And feeding
                        it just makes it hungrier.  

           Ronan takes this in.  On the distant horizon we see a dim
           FLASH of lightning.

           Garret stares out at it.

                                 RONAN
                        Will that storm reach us?

           Garret stands, looks down at the water, and up at the stars.

                                 GARRET
                        Lash everything down.  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - ONCHU'S BOAT - HEAVY WINDS - NIGHT

           The winds have turned to GALES, Onchu's men take down and
           lash the sails.  The boat heaves up on a swell.  Onchu calls
           to his oarsmen...

                                 ONCHU
                        Get fore with it...

           The OARSMEN pull hard, fighting the swells as Onchu tries to
           pull close to Ronan's stern.

           ON RONAN'S BOAT

           Ronan comes astern as Onchu's boat gets within ten yards. 
           Just as Ronan sees...

           POV - AN ENORMOUS SWELL approaching.

                                 RONAN
                        ABOUT!  PULL A-LEE...

           The oarsmen on both boats turn furiously.  The boats now
           SEPARATING in the dark heaving seas, the giant wave rolling
           toward them...
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Throw the line!

           Onchu THROWS a coiled rope... Ronan LEAPS to catch it, landing
           half out the boat, Alban grabbing him by his rope belt.

           Ronan gets his footing and TIES DOWN the line just as...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        PULL!  GET US OVER!

           The BOW points up, the OARSMEN pull... and RONAN'S boat gets
           over the great hump of water.  Ronan looks back for Onchu...

           POV - Rolling seas, no sign of Onchu's boat.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        The line!  BRING IN THE LINE!

           Men start pulling in the tow line, but it's slack.  Ronan
           searches, 

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        ONCHU!!

           Finally seeing...

           A TORCH waving... fifty yards off.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        HARD OVER!  

           Turning the boat against a wave, almost SURFING it toward
           the dim fire... we see Onchu's boat disappear behind a swell,
           stay invisible for an interminable beat... then reappear
           closer...

           Ronan gets close enough to throw a line, the boats are
           connected again...

           AERIAL SHOT

           The two boats pull together... tossed in the high seas like
           leaves in a raging river.  

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - MORNING - AERIAL

           The two boats push on.  The seas now calm, the sky clear.

           EXT. WHALEBOATS - MORNING

           Men at oars.  Wet and worn, but able.  Ronan on the foredeck,
           harpoon in hand, watching the seas.  
           Onchu on his boat's deck, also searching.

           Atop the mast of Ronan's boat is young James scanning the
           horizon for spray.

           Alban passes around a goatskin of water.  We see, under the
           oarsmen's benches, eight such skins...

           TIME DISSOLVES

           To the same shot, with only 5 skins left full.

           EXT. WHALEBOATS - AFTERNOON

           The oarsmen pull, more slowly.  Worn by work.  Garret throws
           a float tethered to a measured line into the water to check
           speed. 

           And Ronan stands where we left him, eyes scanning the sea
           like an owl over a field.

           THE SUN

           Descends toward the horizon.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - THE WHALEBOATS - NIGHT

           It's frigid cold.  Only four men at oars on each boat, the
           rowing happening in shifts for rest.

           Food is passed, dried meat.  Glen Douglas takes a slab bites.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        It's bloody frozen.

           He takes a skin of water, Alban stops him.

                                 ALBAN
                        Aye, it's not time.

           Glen Douglas drinks anyway.  Other men protest.

                                 EACHAN
                        My tongue's flat dry too, eh?  

           Alban relents, passes around the skin.  Finally bringing it
           to Ronan, who turns it down.

                                 ALBAN
                            (privately)
                        We only have enough water left to
                        get home.  
                                 RONAN
                        We cannot turn around.  Make the
                        water stretch.

           Glen Douglas approaches Ronan.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Ronan, my boy won't drink until you
                        do.

           Ronan turns to see James, small and stubborn, wrapped in a
           skin against the cold.  

           Ronan takes the skin, takes a small sip, hands it to James.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS (CONT'D)
                            (privately to Ronan)
                        This is no place for him.  We should
                        turn back while...

                                 RONAN
                            (interrupting)
                        This journey is to save all our sons,
                        not just one.  

           Glen Douglas, rebuffed, sits back at the bench next to Cook.

           Ronan and Garret stand together to hide that they are
           consulting the compass again.  But Cook can see everything.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - FOG - MORNING

           Fog.  The boats are motionless, no oars or sail moving them
           forward.  Just bobbing in the water, roped together. 
           Visibility next to none.

           Garret throws out a line to check the boat's drift.  Glen
           Douglas and Cook watch him, suspicion in their eyes.

           ONCHU

           Crosses from the other boat onto Ronan's, steps up to meet
           Ronan on the foredeck.

                                 ONCHU
                        My men think fog a bad omen.

                                 RONAN
                        Omens are for children.

           Onchu pulls a small corked bottle from his cloak.  He offers
           it to Ronan.
                                 ONCHU
                        Fortifies against the cold.

           Ronan takes it, and throws it into the sea.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Don't..!

                                 RONAN
                        We need our wits about us.  

                                 ONCHU
                        All of them?

           There is a sudden commotion behind them.  Ronan heads astern,
           finding Deaf Willy on top of Tanner with a knife to Tanner's
           throat.

           Ronan pulls Willy off, throws him down.  Tanner is enraged,
           wants to leap on Willy but is held back.

                                 RONAN
                        What happened?

                                 TANNER
                        He's gone mad!  

                                 ALBAN
                        Tanner jumped him, Willy got the
                        better...

                                 RONAN
                            (to Tanner)
                        You will go astern.  NOW.

                                 TANNER
                        Turn us around, there's nothing but
                        death out here...

                                 RONAN
                        Tanner!

                                 TANNER
                        We're already LOST!  You know we
                        are, we're LOST...

           Ronan takes the knife and puts it to Tanner's throat.  Tanner
           freezes.

                                 RONAN
                        Mind your place!  Now go astern.

           Tanner goes astern.  Ronan looks among the crew.  The faces
           look thirsty, tired, fearful.  
           And suddenly, a SOUND no one has ever heard before echoes up
           from the boats' hull.  A deep CLICKING, like the sound of a
           creaking door amplified a thousand times, vibrates the boats
           from under their feet.  (Whale echolocation.)

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Mother of God!

           Commotion from all the men.

                                 OTHERS
                        What in hell?  Ghosts...!  

                                 RONAN
                        SET TO PLACES!

           The men  get up and move to their stations.  Ronan steps
           back to Garret.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        What was that?

           Garret shakes his head.  Doesn't know.  Then the sound bounces
           off the hull again, deep CLICKING vibrations...

                                 COOK
                        It's the Devil rising up... 

                                 RONAN
                        QUIET!

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Turn us back!  

           Calls of agreement from the men.

                                 RONAN
                        If we move in this fog, we are lost!

                                 TANNER
                        I know our course!  
                            (pointing backwards)
                        That's the way.  The way we came! 
                        Turn around to...!

           Ronan STRIKES him, Tanner falls.

                                 RONAN
                        Have you forgotten why we're here? 
                            (shouting to ALL)
                        Have we forgotten our SONS?

           Ronan looks around at the other men, who stare back with
           hollow eyes.
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Let the demons in you run and we
                        will never see home again.  

           From the other boat, Onchu calls over.

                                 ONCHU
                        Ronan!  

           Ronan turns to him, Onchu gestures ahead.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Listen.

           In the distance, muffled by the thick fog but clearly audible,
           we hear a GREAT SPLASHING sound.

           And then... a sudden RELEASE OF AIR, but bigger than any
           whale's breath.  At least any whale they know of.

           Ronan jumps on the bow, Garret joins him.

                                 GARRET
                        It came from there.

           Garret points, off to port.  They look, but in the fog can
           only see a few yards.

                                 RONAN
                            (privately)
                        If we move now, that direction, will
                        we lose our mark?

                                 GARRET
                        Lose it?  It's a miracle if I've
                        still got it.

           Ronan looks back at his ragged crew.

                                 RONAN
                        To OARS men!

           At first, the men don't move.  Even Alban is frozen in place. 
           Onchu shoves his men to their benches.

                                 ONCHU
                        Are you ASLEEP!?  OARS!!

           Ronan's men raise oars.  They start to pull, fear and doubt
           on every face.

           EXT. OCEAN - FOG - DAY

           A blanket of gray.  The PROW of a boat penetrates the fog
           toward us...
           RONAN emerges from the fog, standing alone on the foredeck. 
           Harpoon in hand, still as a statue.

           CLOSE ON RONAN

           He takes in sound like a dog taking in smell.  He closes his
           eyes...

           And he hears... distantly... the splashing of water.  He
           turns his ear to the sound... and hears - faintly - the great
           release of air.

                                 RONAN
                        Garret!

           Garret arrives, Ronan points toward the sound.  Garret looks
           out, then notices...

                                 GARRET
                        Look, the fog...

           The fog seems to be clearing.  Garret casts his eyes down at
           the water.  He suddenly steps down, addressing one of his
           charts.  Ronan sees this.

                                 RONAN
                        What is it?

                                 GARRET
                        The sea changed.  We're in the White
                        Sea now.

           Ronan looks at the water.

                                 RONAN
                        It's darker.

                                 GARRET
                        That's not why they call it white.

           EXT. OCEAN - OUT OF FOG - DAY

           The two boats exit the curtain of fog into clear air.  Ronan
           gets back up on the foredeck, looks out to sea.

                                 RONAN
                        Put James up top!

           James stands, climbs the mast.  Glen Douglas watches him,
           full of dread.

                                 TANNER
                        Have we lost our mark?
                                 RONAN
                        QUIET!  James, over there!

           Points where the sounds came from.  James scans ahead.

           JAMES' POV

           Enormous, frigid, heaving sea.  No sign of whale.

           Garret steps back toward the stern, when Cook suddenly jumps
           up with a knife...

                                 COOK
                        WITCH!  

           He SLASHES at Garret, who falls back.  

                                 COOK (CONT'D)
                        It's him who leads us to hell!

           Cook LUNGES, knife coming down at Garret's heart...

           CAUGHT at the last second by Ronan, who punches Cook...

           Glen Douglas grabs Ronan, pulling him back...

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        Let him kill the English...!

           James, from above, calls down.

                                 JAMES
                        No Papa!

           Alban smashes Glen Douglas in the face.  Chaos erupting as
           Tanner jumps Alban...

           Cook grabs a HARPOON and again lunges at Garret, Ronan
           grabbing him...

           Glen Douglas SMASHES Alban's head into the mast, attacks
           Ronan...

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        He'll KILL US ALL!  He...

           Suddenly Glen Douglas is HIT in the head with a mallet -
           thrown by Onchu from the other boat.  

           Ronan holding back Cook's harpoon, McAdam bashes Cook in the
           head, Cook falls.  Suddenly--

                                 JAMES
                        Spray!!
           They all look up, James points from the top of the mast.  

           Ronan hands off Glen Douglas, leaps up to the foredeck,
           straining to see.

                                 RONAN
                        How far?

                                 JAMES
                        A league, nearly...

           Ronan looks, seeing... in the far distance, the plume of
           mist.

                                 RONAN
                        Aye...

                                 ONCHU
                            (Calling)
                        RONAN!

           Ronan sees Onchu pointing, Cook is in the water, floating
           away face down.  Ronan, caught between pursuit and rescue,
           makes his call.

                                 RONAN
                        ABOUT..!

           Men jump to their benches, turning the boat around and pulling
           up alongside the motionless man.  Ronan reaches overboard,
           lifts Cook aboard with one arm.

           Ronan turns him over, Cook's eyes are lifeless.  Ronan slaps
           him, beats his chest, rubs warmth into him...

           But Cook is dead, face blue.  Ronan stands, looks toward the
           whale.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (to James)
                        Do you still see him?

                                 JAMES
                        No!

           Ronan calls to Onchu.

                                 RONAN
                        ALL SPEED!

           Ronan points the direction.  

                                                                 CUT TO:
           EXT. OCEAN - WHALEMEN AT OARS - DAY

           All the whalemen now pull oars, even Ronan.  Garret is at
           the tiller, calling the charge.

                                 GARRET
                        PULL!  We're on him, I see him now..! 
                        PULL MEN!  You're going to have to
                        make speed, PULL now... reach that
                        wood over!  PULL!! ...

           CAMERA flies up/over to take in...

           Onchu, calling his men from his tiller, his boat slamming
           against a swell and pushing forward on the thrust of sixteen
           arms as...

           CAMERA LIFTS HIGHER

           High over boats, we hear the men's calls as it's overtaken
           by the cold arctic wind.  Empty sea all around.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - RONAN'S WHALEBOAT - AFTERNOON

           The men have stopped rowing, James up the mast, searching
           the sea and horizon.  Ronan searching from the foredeck. 

           They have lost the whale.

                                 JAMES
                        I need to come down.

           Ronan waves the ok.  James descends from his perch, looks at
           his mutinous father with disappointment as he takes a tiny
           sip of water.

           ON FOREDECK

           Garret steps to Ronan, who searches ahead.

                                 GARRET
                        We have to turn back.  

           Ronan finally, reluctantly, nods.  Accepting defeat.  

           AND THE CAMERA sinks underwater

           Down... down... darker... hundreds of feet... thousands...

           We hear a series of otherworldly sounds... the CLICKING
           again... we see a dot, pale gray... growing bigger
           Emerging from the black, a WHALE swims up toward us... rising
           from the deep, something unearthly in his toothed jaws.  As
           he WHOOSHES past us...

           CUT TO RONAN

           Sensing something.  Turning...

                                 RONAN
                        Oh God... 

           SLOW MOTION from Ronan's POV...

           THE WHALE BREECHES - launching most of his 90 FOOT LENGTH
           into the air... in his jaws writhes a GIANT SQUID... 

           RONAN transfixed, everyone staring in awe... Each man...
           mouth open... the whale's enormous form nearly blotting out
           the sun, then tipping and SLAMMING down on the water with
           incredible force, killing the squid like a bug.

           The SPLASHDOWN creates a huge wave, Ronan breaks the trance
           just in time...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        HOLD FAST!

           Everyone grabs hold of something as the WAVE nearly swamps
           both boats.

           For a moment after the boats settle, there is stunned silence.

                                 JOHN KEY
                        Sweet MARY... He's a mountain!  

                                 TANNER
                        He's fifteen lengths!  

                                 OTHERS
                        More than that!  It's a demon!  We're
                        to kill that?  That's no whale...

           Commotion grows...

                                 RONAN
                            (booming voice)
                        It IS a whale.   

           The rabble goes quiet.  Both boats are together, both crews 
           equally shocked.

           Ronan looks after the whale.  It swims away slowly, a jet of
           SPRAY blows from his head.
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Look at the spray, it's forward. 
                        And the size of his head... that's a
                        Bull whale.  

           It is what we call a SPERM WHALE, it has an enormous block
           of a head, like a great fist, fully one third of his massive
           body.  He measures almost 90 feet.  Well over twice the length
           of the boats.  The flukes of the great tail are nearly twenty
           feet tip to tip.

           He blows another spray and disappears under the wash.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Empty sea we've had, days of it. 
                        And now we find a beast large enough
                        to satisfy - at one stroke - even
                        the King's lust.  
                            (pointing toward the
                             whale)
                        Two hundred casks of oil is swimming
                        away from us.   

           There are murmurs and looks among the men, the most they
           have ever gotten from one whale is 40.  

                                 ONCHU
                        How do we kill something like that?

           Ronan pauses a beat.

                                 RONAN
                        Both boats have to spear him at once
                        and hold fast.  We cannot be
                        separated.  This whale may swim half
                        a day before he tires.  But he will
                        tire.  And then we take him. 

           Ronan steps among the men, looking at each of their strained
           faces.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Maybe no man has seen a beast this
                        big, nor ever hunted one.  But if
                        there are men on this Earth who can
                        subdue him, they are here, on these
                        boats.  

           There is doubt all around him, even on the faces of Onchu
           and Alban.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        If we turn away now and make a run
                        to safety, then the English own us 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        all.  But if together, we give our
                        full strength to this hunt, we win
                        our sons back, and our honor.  And
                        no one will ever forget the whalemen
                        of Till.

           The men are stirred and moved.  

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        I cannot command this.  If there is
                        doubt in any of you, it will too
                        easily kill us all.  We must advance
                        together, or retreat.

           There's a moment of silence.  

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Onchu?  What say?

                                 ONCHU
                        What about drinking water?  

                                 RONAN
                        Once we have him, we have his blood. 
                        We can live on that for days.

           Onchu nods, convinced.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        What about you Key?

                                 JOHN KEY
                        I'm not turning tail on a fish, no
                        matter how big.  

           Ronan looks to Garret, who nods.

                                 RONAN
                        Eachan?

                                 EACHAN
                        Agh.  I can't go home empty handed. 
                        I'll never hear the end of it.

           Each man in turn says Aye, all the way down to Glen Douglas
           and Tanner.  Ronan looks at them.

                                 RONAN
                        It's to you.  

           Tanner and Glen Douglas look at each other.
                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        If we say Aye, will you forget what
                        we did?

                                 RONAN
                        No, I won't.  But I'll leave the
                        matter to God's judgment.

           Glen Douglas and Tanner look at each other.  Then they nod.

           Ronan nods to them.  He stands on the foredeck.  He looks at
           them with his burning eyes for a beat, then...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Onchu, take up your rope.  Pike,
                        RAISE SAILS!

           SERIES OF SHOTS as the two boats separate and get under sail.

           AERIAL SHOT

           The boats run parallel, mist blowing off choppy seas.  Ronan
           steps back to man the tiller.

           CAMERA RISES UP - MOVES FORWARD TOWARD WHALE

           The whale is majestic, enormous.  Pushing slowly and evenly
           ahead, ignorant of his pursuers... or indifferent.  

           The whale's FLUKES are wide, dark and beautifully symmetrical. 
           Waving up and down like a hand held fan.  

           FLYING CLOSE - OVER AND AROUND WHALE

           His dark gray skin pocked, lined and scarred like ancient
           rock, his blowhole, two feet long and shaped like an "S"
           jets forth a great plume of ice crystals into the frigid
           air.  His small eye, like a tiny window in the stone face of
           a great castle.  His midsection the texture of a redwood
           tree's bark.  

           It is as if this being is as ancient and timeless as the
           earth.  Not just a thing of nature, but holy nature herself.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN - RONAN'S BOAT

           Eachan finishes a prayer in a melodic Scottish dialect.

           ON COOK'S BODY

           Wrapped and weighted, it is dropped overboard and sinks. 
           The men watch it disappear.  
           Ronan steps past the crewmen who each lash down loose items
           and secure things in place, readying for the battle to come.

           EXT. OCEAN - AERIAL

           The boats TURNING into the wind, tacking toward the whale...
           The wind fills their sails again, they pick up speed, pounding
           against the North Sea's waves, bearing down on the prey.

           IN THE BOATS

           Men move fast, each to a task... ship oars, lash down
           supplies, coil the rope, move it to the foredeck... the
           harpoons come out... the leather caps come off...

           RONAN 

           On the deck, eyes on his massive prey...  The WHALE blowing
           spray, now only 25 yards or so off.

           ONCHU'S BOAT

           Now CUTTING across the whale's wake behind its great tail
           and...

                                 ONCHU
                        ABOUT!

           Turning up into the wind to parallel with him... 

                                 RONAN
                        ABOUT!  To OARS!

           Ronan's boat also turns into the wind, parallel to the whale. 
           The men pull oars out swiftly, and PULL toward the whale at
           good speed. 

           ONCHU

           Has his harpoon ready, his boat moving past the whale's great
           fearsome tail.  

           RONAN

           On the other side of the whale, pulling up to the midsection
           of the enormous beast, it's form rising for breath.

           ONCHU THROWS, it HITS FLESH and sinks in.  

                                 ONCHU
                        AWAY!

           Onchu's boat veers away as... 

           RONAN throws, also a deep hit, his boat veers away...
           THE WHALE THRASHES... both crews let out line...

                                 RONAN
                        UNCOIL...!

           Line spins around the mast of Ronan's boat, waves crash into
           the hull... the boats dropping back, giving distance...

           The whale picks up speed, the boats reach their rope's limit
           and are YANKED forward, dangerously close to the mighty tail
           as the whale corkscrews and tangles line...

                                 ONCHU
                        RONAN!

           Ronan sees Onchu pointing... Onchu's rope has snagged around
           the whale's tail, and when the great fluke pushes under, the
           boat is pulled down dangerously near the waterline...

           RONAN shouts back to his crew...

                                 RONAN
                        Set COIL, we're going to DART HIM
                        AGAIN!

           A flurry of activity on Ronan's boat as...

           ONCHU tries to free his line, which now SNAGS on the bow
           guide... and the thick wooden guide BREAKS from the whale's
           pull, freeing the rope...

           Which DRAGS down the gunwale PULLING the boat off angle...
           Deaf Willy dives under it just in time, but it hits Eachan
           and knocks him down as...

           The boat is turning sideways, it will capsize and swamp if
           it goes broadside...

                                 ONCHU
                            (to Deaf Willy, re:
                             the bow guide)
                        Hammer that back!

           Onchu dashes aft to the tiller, pulling it with all his might
           against the pull of the whale...

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        TAKE IT... TAKE THE STICK!

           Eachan takes it, pulling... Onchu grabs a hatchet and gets
           ready to cut the line... 
           ON RONAN

           Standing on his bow, his men PULLING IN the line to get closer
           to the whale... 

           THE WHALE is double the length of the boat, and Ronan is
           awed as its HUGE form rises out of the water, and keeps rising
           and rising, throwing a SHADOW over Ronan...

                                 RONAN
                        God help me...

           Ronan THROWING the harpoon, sinking it in the whale's side...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        AWAY!!

           Alban pulls the tiller, veering off

           THE WHALE'S TAIL thrashes down...  the whale corkscrews
           again... throwing a mad turbulent wake off... RONAN drops to
           the deck to avoid getting thrown over by the force of the
           wave...  THE WHALE DIVING back under...

                                 ONCHU
                        RONAN!!

           Onchu's boat TIPS... The tangled tail pulling it down... in
           one second his boat and men are lost.

                                 RONAN
                        CUT IT!!  CUT THE LINE!!

           Onchu fights forward and CUTS the line.  His boat rights
           back up, falling behind FAST as the whale and Ronan pull
           away...

           ON RONAN

           Raising another harpoon... this will be the throw to end all
           throws.  He HEAVES THE HARPOON with a great SCREAM...

           The flying harpoon's line is connected to the harpoon Ronan
           just sank in the whale.  It sails through the air...

           And STICKS IN ONCHU'S MAST!  ONCHU cuts the line from it,
           pulls in the slack and coils it around the mast as fast as
           he can...

                                 ONCHU
                        LINE THE GUIDE!  

           Deaf Willy is just finishing hammering the bow guide back
           together, runs the line through at the last second as it
           starts to pull TIGHT, praying it holds...
                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        HOLD FAST!

           The line pulls tight, and the boat is YANKED into motion...
           THE BOW GUIDE HOLDS --- Blind Willy lets out a shout... 

           EXCEPT Onchu's veering toward Ronan's boat and about to RAM...

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        TATUM!

           Tatum pulls on the tiller, men leap to, using oars to keep
           the HULLS from ramming into each other... Tatum gets control
           of his tiller back..

           And the crazy ride is on - 30 knots in high sub-arctic seas
           pulled by a 60 ton giant.  Smashing on waves... 

           Ronan looks around...

                                 RONAN
                        We have everyone?

           Alban nods.  Ronan moves to Garret, not easy with the boat
           crashing along... Garret grips his bench tight, having never
           been on one of these rides.  Ronan LAUGHS, Garret smiles
           with it, then his face goes dark...

                                 GARRET
                        Look!

           RONAN'S POV

           The whale is pulling us toward an enormous pair of ICEBERGS. 
           Ronan hoists himself to the foredeck for a better look, Alban
           and Garret joining him.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        That's why they call it the White
                        Sea.

           HIS POV - THE ICEBERGS

           Two mountains of ice, burning red in the low sun.  Multiple
           smaller ice SHARDS poke up from the water between the two
           main peaks.  Like he's being dragged into a jaw of monstrous
           JAGGED teeth, already spattered with blood.

           No question, the whale is heading right toward it.

           EXT. AERIAL SHOT - BOATS, WHALE, ICEBERGS

           High over the boats and whale we FLY FORWARD to study the
           icebergs... DROPPING between the peaks, getting a good look
           at how treacherous this gauntlet is, we DIVE...
           UNDERWATER

           To see the vast mountain of ice beneath, and the shards
           pushing up, leaving only one path with no room for error.

           BACK ON RONAN

           Already making preparations... tying a rope around his waist,
           the other end to the mast, a lifeline to hold him to the
           boat...

           ON ONCHU'S BOAT

           Onchu also tethering himself, Tatum as spotter moving onto
           the foredeck, Onchu and Deaf Willy with oars behind him to
           fend off ice shards... and the other boat.

           ON RONAN

           Stepping on the foredeck, when young James approaches.

                                 JAMES
                        Let me.

                                 RONAN
                        No, sit with your father.

                                 JAMES
                        No one has a better eye, or quicker
                        call.  You're needed at the side.

           Ronan looks to Glen Douglas, so does James.

           Glen Douglas nods.

           Ronan puts a line around James' waist and helps him to the
           foredeck, ready to be the spotter.

           Ronan grabs an oar,the whale pulls them toward the ice, closer
           and closer the jaws of fate close.  The sun dipping under
           the horizon, sky darkening quickly.

           Glen Douglas watching the looming towers of ice approach. 
           Tanner mumbling prayers, a genuflection.  On the other boat,
           Onchu sets himself, pulls from his belt the STRAW MAN his
           wife gave him as keepsake and kisses it, puts it away.

           TATUM CALLS OUT, POINTING

                                 TATUM
                        LEEWARD!  

           Onchu jams the oar down, pushing off the tongue of ice hiding
           just under the water...
           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           Both spotters calling out, Ronan pushing off the passing
           walls of ice, Alban at the helm suddenly steering us off as
           James calls a hazard dead ahead.

           The WHALE looming up high out of the water, then diving back
           under in a seeming attempt to create turbulence... the boats
           bashing into each other, men belaying off to avoid cracking
           the hulls...

                                 JAMES
                        THERE!  THERE!

           Ronan's boat scrapes over an ice peak underwater, a CRACK in
           the hull, water sprays in, the boat JERKING to one side,
           JAMES TUMBLING OVERBOARD, his lifeline pulls tight...

           Ronan sees James go over, drops his oar and leaps to grab
           James' line as...

                                 RONAN
                        God NO...!

           The boat mercilessly SLAMS ice on James' side, a sickening
           crunch... James wedged... a weak scream snuffs quickly. 

           The ice passes, Ronan pulls James up, limp and crushed.

           ON GLEN DOUGLAS

           Seeing his son's body crushed lifeless... he SCREAMS in agony
           and rushes to him.

           Ronan looks ahead, another jagged ice ledge about to hit, he
           grabs an oar...

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        GET THEM AFT... 

           Ronan leaps to the foredeck, no lifeline, spotting and fending
           off ice in the spray...

           AERIAL SHOT

           The whale pulls all the way through the gauntlet, leaving
           the ice behind.  Soon the boats are also clear, but still
           crashing against waves at high speed.

           Ronan jumps to the deck, looks at the water leaking from the
           crack in the hull. 

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (shouting to Alban)
                        Do we have any pitch?
                                 ALBAN
                        We can't heat it.  Not moving like
                        this.

           Ronan looks to Onchu's boat.  They are battered, but still
           in one piece.

           Then he looks down at James, dead on the deck in a pool of
           bloody water.  Glen Douglas stares down at his son.

                                 GARRET
                        He's turning!

           RONAN looks, the whale is swimming a leeward arc.  Sperm
           whales don't turn sharply when swimming flat out, but it's
           soon clear...

                                 RONAN
                        He's taking us back through the ice.

                                 GARRET
                        One more hit, we're done.

           Ronan looks to the hand ax... considering the unthinkable.

           ON GLEN DOUGLAS

           He looks toward the whale, face white.  Removing his Scottish
           cross necklace, placing it in his son's dead hands.

           ON AX

           Ronan removes the ax, approaches the mast where the whale
           line is tied down  All eyes on him.  About to cut...

                                 TANNER
                        Douglas!!

           Tanner points to the bow where GLEN DOUGLAS has climbed onto
           the rope and is pulling himself toward the whale.

           ON GLEN DOUGLAS

           As he's dunked under the frigid water, holding on to the
           rope.  He emerges, SCREAMING out his breath, and pulls another
           few feet before being dunked again.

                                 TANNER (CONT'D)
                            (calling)
                        Come back man, you're just killing
                        yourself.

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        My boy's blood -- on ME!  His BLOOD!!
           Foot after tortured foot he pulls, powered by rage and revenge
           and guilt.  Rising full out of the water, pulling hand over
           hand even as his hands become too numb to use... 

           He passes the great tail, thrice his size, which nearly hits
           him as it pushes water and they all GO UNDER...

           ON RONAN and all hands... both boats watching in horror as
           this vengeful father summons strength no man could possibly
           muster unless blinded by primal rage...

           Glen Douglas reaches the harpoon's end, pulls a knife from
           his belt and STABS into the whale's back, SCREAMING...

           RONAN AND GARRET

           Watching from the pitching deck as Glen Douglas and the whale
           go under water again...

                                 GARRET
                        God help him...

           But the whale surfaces, and Glen Douglas still clings to his
           back, using a knife in each hand to climb his side like a
           mountaineer with two ice axes.  

           He reaches the abandoned harpoon... the one with the line
           Onchu had to cut.  Glen Douglas kneels and grips it as the
           whale starts to go under again, he pushes with all his
           might... screaming... crying... 

                                 GLEN DOUGLAS
                        DEATH TAKE US BOTH!

           And PLUNGES the harpoon deep into the whale's body as the
           WATER hits him and he FLAILS backward down the whale's back...

           The whale DIVES, his huge tail flipping out of the water and 
           FLINGING Glen Douglas in the air like a doll...

           He FLIES BACKWARD with enormous force... TOWARD THE BOAT..

           And CRASHES INTO Garret, SLAMMING him into the gunwale and
           pitching him overboard as Glen Douglas's cracks his head on
           the mast and spins and splatters overboard himself.

           Ronan GRABS THE lifeline and LEAPS into the water, GRABBING 
           Garret by his collar.

                                 RONAN
                        Pull!  PULL!

           The men pull him in, lifting him and Garret into the boat...
           Garret SCREAMING... his leg covered in blood... a JAGGED
           BONE sticking out of the skin of his thigh.
           Ronan gets to his feet, freezing... 

           Glen Douglas's body face down in the water, Tanner arrives
           at the stern with a lifeline and inflated sheep bladder float,
           throws it out to him.

           ON GLEN DOUGLAS

           The rope falls across his arm, the bladder just after.  But
           he's motionless.

                                 TANNER
                        TAKE IT!!  TAKE IT MAN!!

           As the whaleboat is still being pulled away, the rope pulls
           off Glen Douglas's arm, the bladder float passes over him. 
           Glen Douglas is dead.

           ON TANNER

           Watching the body disappear in the dark.  

           ON GARRET

           On the deck, unconscious.  Losing blood in gushes.  Alban
           tying a tourniquet. 

           Ronan looks at the bone, his left femur is punched through
           the skin, like a broken pencil.

                                 RONAN
                        Can you set that?

           Alban shakes his head.

                                 ALBAN
                        It's tied off.  That will hold it.

           They hear a shout from Onchu's boat...

                                 ONCHU
                        He SLOWS...

           Ronan looks ahead.  In all the commotion he hadn't noticed
           that the whale has slowed, nearly to a stop.  Rivers of blood
           bubble down his back.

           Ronan, still out of breath and shivering.

                                 RONAN
                        Let's take him.
           EXT. OCEAN ALONGSIDE WHALE - DUSK

           The whale is now nearly motionless.  His own great breath
           fast, shallow, labored...

           Ronan pulls his boat up alongside him.

           The sea is lit by a nearly full moon, the icebergs reflect
           light like an unearthly Everest, the sky spread with stars
           by the thousands, the horizon a Northern glow.

           ON WHALE

           As Ronan pulls up.  Still cautious.

           Alban approaches, hands Ronan a lance... different than a
           harpoon, it's tip is small and sharp, to go deep.

           ON WHALE EYE

           Near the waterline, Ronan sees the whale's eye, which looks
           back at him.  They seem to regard each other for a long
           moment.

           Ronan looks into the whale's eye.  Getting lost in it.

                                 ALBAN
                        Why do you wait?

           Ronan comes out of his trance.  

                                 RONAN
                        Ready... 

           Simultaneously they THRUST their lances...

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           CLOSE ON - LUMINOUS WHITE ICE - CRACKED BY AN AX

           EXT. ICEBERG - NIGHT

           Onchu and Tatum are on one of the icebergs, using the ax to
           chip off big chunks of ice.

           BEHIND THEM

           Ronan's boat has a fire going, pitch boiling in a bucket,
           the crack in the hull being repaired.  

           ON THE ICEBERG

           Another fire.  Tanner melting ice down into water, Deaf Willy
           re-filling their skins.
           Everyone works in silence.  Whether it's the cold, their
           exhaustion, or the shock of their ordeal, no one speaks.

           ON THE WHALE

           Its small side flippers hooked with metal hoops, lashed with
           rope, the other end tied to the boats.

           LIGHT

           Starts to flicker across the whole scene, colors of orange
           and blue... reflecting especially off the white ice.

           Ronan stands in the boat, notices light all round...

           POV - AURORA BOREALIS

           The sky is alive with spectrographic color.  Flaring out
           like a cosmic wildfire over the horizon.

           ON THE WHALEMEN

           Staring, transfixed.  Awe-struck.  Tanner drops to his knees.  

                                 TANNER
                        It's the Lord Host himself!

                                 ONCHU
                        We've gone far, but we haven't gone
                        that far.

                                 RONAN
                        It's his spirit.  Entering heaven.

                                 ONCHU
                        Whose?

           Ronan gestures to the whale.  

                                 ALBAN
                            (Righteous)
                        Only Man has a soul.

                                 RONAN
                        So he likes to believe.  

                                 GARRET (O.S.)
                            (weakly)
                        Ronan...

           EXT. ICEBERG FLAT - ON GARRET

           Garret is lying on a flat area of ice, a roll under his head,
           his broken leg exposed.
           Ronan kneels, lifts his head holding a steaming cup of hot
           water.

                                 RONAN
                        Here, drink.

           Garret drinks, obviously in great pain.

                                 GARRET
                        We must take a bearing.

           Garret swallows more water, wincing as he sits up and looks
           around.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        The point star, in the constellation
                        of the bear... the brightest one.  

                                 RONAN
                        I see it, yes.

           Ronan and Onchu look, spot it.

                                 GARRET
                        Keep it over your back thus.

           He uses his hand the show the angle.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        Where the sun rises should be lee
                        and rear.  When the sea changes,
                        you'll need me again.

           Ronan nods to Garret.

                                 RONAN
                        Good.  Now rest.

           But Garret looks down at his leg.

                                 GARRET
                        The ax... you have to use it.

           It takes a beat for Ronan to understand.

                                 RONAN
                        I can't... 

                                 GARRET
                        A clean cut, through the bone.  Then
                        tie it off.

                                 RONAN
                        NO!
                                 GARRET
                        I'll die if you don't!

           Ronan looks to his men, they look to him.

           EXT. ICEBERG - NIGHT

           Out of the fire comes the red hot AX.  Tatum carries it over,
           hands it to Ronan.

                                 RONAN
                        Put the block under.

           Onchu places a plank under Garret's leg.  Garret SCREAMS as
           it's moved.  Onchu gives Garret a stick to bite.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Ready?  

           Garret nods.  The men hold down Garret's arms and shoulders
           and legs.  Ronan preys, raises the hatchet... 

           And chops down hard... Garret SCREAMS, biting down on the
           stick.  We hear THREE CHOPS of the hatchet... Garret's screams
           swallowed by the cold wind.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. OUTDOOR OVEN OUTSIDE ALBAN'S HOUSE - DAWN

           Margaret and Emma are removing "struan" from a free standing
           brick oven behind Alban's house.  Struan is a Scottish bread,
           dense and made to be a full meal.  

           Margaret places three loaves in a woven basket, covers them
           with cloth.  Emma picks it up and heads off.

           EXT. HILLSIDE APPROACHING RONAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Emma is walking up the hill, she doesn't notice a soldier by
           the tree line, watching her.  This is SGT. QUINN, a bull of
           a man.  He follows.

           EXT. BEHIND RONAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Emma reaches the kitchen area, puts down the basket.  Only
           now does she notice Quinn, blocking her exit.  

                                 EMMA
                        Food will come presently.

                                 QUINN
                        Not hungry.  
           Emma tries to slip past him, he blocks her way.  He tries to
           grab her, she ducks it and SLAMS his face with her elbow,
           Quinn staggers back a step but GRABS again.  She lets out a
           scream, he stifles it with his thick hand.

           Quinn is suddenly STRUCK FROM BEHIND.  

           It's Duncan, stick in hand.  Emma slips out of Quinn's grip,
           she SCREAMS -- 

           EXT. OUTDOOR OVEN OUTSIDE ALBAN'S HOUSE - MORNING

           Margaret hears the scream, starts running up the hill.

           BACK TO SCENE 

           Quinn draws his broadsword, advancing on the two of them
           fast.  

           Duncan and Emma run around to the front of the house, Duncan
           still limping, FALLS.

           Quinn steps closer, getting ready to strike.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Sergeant!

           Sgt. Quinn stops, seeing Lt. Pike arrive on horseback,
           dismounting.

                                 QUINN
                        He attacked me sir!

                                 DUNCAN
                        Your pig hands were all over her!

           Duncan swings the short staff at Quinn.  

           IN A FLASH Lt. Pike draws his sword, blocks Duncan's attack.

                                 LT. PIKE
                            (To Duncan)
                        You forget your place!

                                 DUNCAN
                        It's you that's out of place English!

           Margaret jumps between them.

                                 MARGARET
                        Duncan, drop your staff!

                                 DUNCAN
                        I will NOT! 
           She turns on him with a fury we haven't seen from her.

                                 MARGARET
                        YOU WILL BEG HIS FORGIVENESS! 

           Duncan shocked by her anger.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        You have not born suffering enough
                        to risk your life for anything as
                        petty as your pride!

           She stares at him, the love behind her rage clear to him. 
           Duncan hears his father's last words .

           Duncan drops his stick.  Bows his head.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        I must ask for mercy.  I came upon
                        him taking...

           Lt. Pike hushes him.  Then slowly sheathes his sword.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        For striking a soldier, ten lashes.

                                 QUINN
                            (protest)
                        With respect, sir!  Execution is...

                                 LT. PIKE
                            (to Quinn)
                        Touch the girl again, you'll get the
                        whip too.  Follow me.

           Lt. Pike gives Margaret an admiring look as he leaves.  Quinn
           follows, staring death at Duncan. 

           EXT. OUTSIDE BLACKSMITH - LATER

           Duncan grimaces as the LASH hits his shirtless back.

           Three soldiers administer the punishment, villagers watching. 
           Margaret wincing with the next CRACK.

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           AERIAL shot shows the two boats, sails up, oars rowing, towing
           the huge whale behind them.  

           ON RONAN
           Looking ahead, the vast featureless ocean and horizon staring
           at him.

           Then behind, at his men rowing, his friend Garret propped up
           against a bench, and the great whale in tow behind.

           Garret stirs, Ronan goes to him, offering water from one of
           the full skins.

                                 RONAN
                        Drink...

           Garret sips, his eyes focus on Ronan.

                                 GARRET
                        How long?

                                 RONAN
                        Half the daylight.

           Garret is gaunt.  He coughs, changes his position, a painful
           process.  Then he looks to the sky.

                                 GARRET
                        Bring the sun to descend along this
                        aspect.  

           Points an arc from the sun, downward to a spot on the horizon
           off the port bow.  Ronan offers another drink, he refuses.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        You know why I hate them calling you
                        'fisherman'?

                                 RONAN
                        Why?

                                 GARRET
                        Because fish is this...
                            (he gestures putting
                             food in his mouth)
                        Whale is this...
                            (he points to his
                             heart)

           He coughs, the cough sounds bad.

                                 RONAN
                        Rest now.

           EXT. OCEAN - AFTERNOON

           The boats pull, sails now down.  A cold RAIN falling.
           Ronan is now on one of the oars, soaked to the skin through
           his cloak.  Pulling... pulling...

           Alban at the tiller, facing a gray featureless horizon. 

                                 ALBAN
                        Ronan!

           Ronan passes the oar to John Key, who had been resting.  

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                        I can't see the sun.  

           Ronan looks out.  Everything is uniform, monochromatic.  

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                        Should we stop?

                                 RONAN
                        We can't stop.

           MUSIC UP -- A SEQUENCE OF SCENES

           Takes us through the night and following day.  

           NIGHT -- Garret in a delirious half consciousness, Ronan
           giving him water, looking up...  The great dome of STARS
           overhead turn in time lapse, dizzying.  DAWN coming...

           EXT. OCEAN - DAWN - MUSIC SEQUENCE

           Deaf Willy throws his fishing hook off the side, as - on the
           other boat - A fatigued Ronan wakes and takes the oars.

           Tanner looking at his hands, seeing bloody blisters.  He
           wraps them in cloth, keeps rowing.  

           Onchu breaking up a fight between exhausted McAdam and Tatum.  

           Deaf Willy hooks a big fish in Onchu's boat... which the
           crews have to eat raw, having burned all the wood & oil. 

           The ICY blood on their mouths and beards make them look like
           stone age savages.  Like animals.

           MUSIC ENDS.

           EXT. OCEAN - DUSK

           Sun low.  The men rowing.  Even with sails full it's slow.  

           At the tiller, Ronan notices it first... the CLICKING.

           He looks to the whale, making sure it has not magically come
           to life.
           The CLICKING comes again.  Same clicking we've heard before,
           only more of it.

           Alban and the men have stopped rowing and are watching him.

                                 RONAN
                        Keep rowing.

           Ronan moves forward, spotting...

           The SPRAY of a whale, twenty yards off.  Then another... and
           another.

           It's a pod of sperm whales, five or so.  Considerably smaller
           than our catch, but still massive.

           The CLICKING echoes from below.  The men are spooked.

           RONAN

           Scanning with a wary eye.  They may be smaller, but they 
           could easily destroy these boats if they chose to.  

           Ronan takes up his harpoon, holding it ready in case of
           attack.  Onchu doing the same on his boat...

           RONAN'S POV

           The whales seem to be curious, gliding parallel with the
           boats, observing.

           On all sides now, a shot of spray is joined by two, three,
           four more.  There are ten whales, then twenty, all around
           the two boats.  The CLICKING resonating through the whole
           ocean. 

           The men feel surrounded.  Ronan readies his weapon as a pair
           of whales comes closer.  A JET of spray close by startles
           the men and they cling to the gunwales preparing to be rammed.

           One comes near.  Ronan and the whale make EYE CONTACT.

           THE WHALE'S EYE

           Ancient, other worldly, calm, curious.  Not threatening.

           RONAN

           In his wet cloak and bloody, partially frozen beard, gripping
           his barbed weapon.  

           The whale swims slowly off.  Ronan lowers the harpoon.

           He looks back at his frightened, exhausted men.  Wild-eyed
           and ragged.  
           He stares at them for a beat, their humanity stripped away.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Keep rowing.

           The men pick up their oars, pulling against the sea. 

           Ronan returns to the tiller, sitting next to Alban.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Look what's been taken from us. 
                        Look what we've become.

           Alban and Ronan look out to the pod of whales.

           The pod drifts alongside, graceful, calm.  Simply witnessing.

           A fire outside Ronan's home, Duncan sharpens a sword.  A
           real one this time.

           Margaret and Emma approach from down the hill, carrying
           baskets of wool.  Duncan barely notices them.  He stares
           into the fire, his mind in a dark place.

           Margaret goes inside.

           He looks up, but doesn't speak to her.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        This is consuming you.

           Margaret comes back out, puts her hand on Emma, bidding her
           to leave.  Emma slowly moves off, looking back at her beloved.

           Margaret sits by the fire.  Duncan sharpens the blade.

                                 MARGARET
                        At the new moon, if your father is
                        not back, I will not hold you.

                                 DUNCAN
                        He is dead.  I know it.

                                 MARGARET
                        You fear it.  And your fear is
                        becoming anger and hurt pride is now
                        vengeance.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        And vengeance will next become war,
                        and then more fear and more vengeance
                        and on and on. 

           He stops sharpening.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Your fathers built a place outside
                        all that.  It's in you too, somewhere.

           She puts something on the ground in front of Duncan.  The
           COAT OF ARMS mold.

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        It was to be the McColough coat of
                        arms.  Your grandfather passed it to
                        Ronan before the sea took him.  Now,
                        it goes to you. 

           Duncan looks up at her, tears running down her face.  

                                 MARGARET (CONT'D)
                        Be worthy of it.

           She slowly stands and exits, leaving him with the Coat of
           Arms, its shapes seeming alive in the flickering light.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OCEAN -- RAIN - NIGHT

           A cold heavy rain, seas are turbulent.  It's not a violent
           storm, just your average bitch of a squall.  But to them,
           it's a curse.  The sails are down, and the men fight at the
           oars.

           Ronan is on the tiller.  LIGHTNING flashes, a sharp clap of
           THUNDER.

           Tanner's blisters are so bad he now has both hands wrapped
           in bloody cloth.  We see most others have this too.

                                 RONAN
                        Alban!

           Alban puts down the oar, climbs over benches to reach Ronan.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Take a man, bail the boat.  

           Alban nods, grabs Key, handing him a bucket.  

           Alban bails water next to Garret, who lies propped against
           the hull.  Alban lifts his hand, looks at it.
           It's bloody.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

           Ronan has a TORCH in his hand, hissing with the rain.  He
           looks at the severed leg, wrapped and tied, but bleeding
           out.  Garret is white as a ghost, unconscious.

           Ronan ties a leather cord around the low thigh and ties a
           stick through the knot, twisting it to choke off the blood. 
           He ties down the stick.

                                 ALBAN
                        If he dies, do we have any chance of
                        finding our way?

           Ronan doesn't answer, he looks to the sky, the sea.

           EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT/ PREDAWN

           The squall has passed, though the clouds are still thick. 
           The glow of dawn just visible over the bow.

           Thin crew rowing, four per boat.  The rest of the men asleep. 
           Including Ronan.  He is shaken awake.

                                 JOHN KEY
                        Ay Ronan.   

           Ronan sits up, Key points.  Ronan looks to the glow of the
           horizon.  We don't know what he sees, but it's bad.  

           Ronan shakes Alban, who wakes up.

                                 RONAN
                        Up man.  The storm turned us around.

           Alban stands, looks to sky and sea.

                                 ALBAN
                        That's not all.

           He points at the ocean itself, which is now green instead of
           black as it has been since before they hooked the whale.  

                                 ALBAN (CONT'D)
                            (re: Garret)
                        It's time.

           Ronan and Alban kneel to Garret.  Ronan puts water on his
           hand, wipes it on Garret's lips.  No response.
                                 RONAN
                        Garret...

           He wipes his whole face with water, gives him a drink.  Garret
           opens his eyes, says something in a parched mumble.

           Ronan gives him another drink.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        What did you say man?

                                 GARRET
                        I've been watching... 

           Ronan and Alban look at each other.

                                 RONAN
                        Garret, the sea.  It's changed.

           Garret motions to have a look.  Ronan and Alban each take a
           shoulder, lift him to sit on the foredeck.

           Garret sees the sun starting to peak up over the horizon.

                                 GARRET
                        How long have we been going this
                        way?

                                 RONAN
                        I don't know, less than a half night.

           He looks at the sky.  He can see the dim quarter moon, a few
           stars.

                                 GARRET
                            (gathering strength)
                        Get me my charts.

           Garret seems to come back to life, a SERIES OF SHOTS show
           the crew looking on as Garret sights with the astrolabe,
           looks through charts, has Alban check the depth of the water
           with a sink line...  

                                                                 CUT TO:

           FULL SHOT -- ANCIENT SEA CHART - DAY

           Latin script, zodiac symbols.  Curved lines for currents and
           winds, presumed mythic beasts, star positions and moon phases.  

           Garret's finger points.

                                 GARRET
                        We are there.  By best reckonings. 
                        This is our course.
           He brings the finger up off the map and points off the stern.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        We come about.  The sun travels in
                        this arc, keep it to lee, let it set
                        there, thirty degrees off lee.  That's
                        how you run her days.  Nights are
                        easier if it's clear.  I'll show
                        you...

           He now gestures to be put back down on the deck, to rest. 
           Ronan gives him a drink of water.  The effort is draining.

                                 RONAN
                        You rest...

                                 GARRET
                        I'm alright, 
                            (private)
                        Ronan, we are far from land.  Still
                        three days.

                                 RONAN
                        Three days?

                                 GARRET
                        Maybe four.

                                 ALBAN
                        We have water for one!  

                                 GARRET
                        And you could make it in one - if
                        you cut free the whale.

           ON TANNER & KEY

           On the other boat, Tanner looks toward the whale.

                                 TANNER
                        See that?

                                 JOHN KEY
                        Oy?

           Tanner points.  The whale's back end is getting pushed over
           to one side.  Key's too exhausted to care.

           Then Tanner sees the fins.

           SHARK FINS.  Four of them, swimming around the whale's rear
           half.  Tanner stands.

                                 TANNER
                        Shark!
           Onchu comes to Tanner, who points.  

                                 TATUM
                        See there!  We are cursed...

           Onchu pushes him to the bench.

                                 ONCHU
                        Shut your hole and row.

           Onchu calls to Ronan, pointing

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Ronan!  

           RONAN

           Sees the back of the whale pushed askew, then sees a shark
           swimming toward the whale from behind, and behind him...

           A dozen more FINS

           A school of TIGER SHARKS, drawn by the scent, coming at the
           whale from behind.  A total of fifteen or so.

           The sharks swirl and circle, attacking the carcass, tearing
           into it viciously, then swimming off with flesh waving from
           their jaws like gift ribbon.  

           One swims off, another attacks.  Primitive, efficient, an
           assembly line of teeth, slowly picking apart the prize.

           ON RONAN

           He's joined by Alban.

                                 ALBAN
                        More will come.  They'll pick us
                        clean.

           Ronan sees the men have stopped rowing to look, helpless to
           stop the decimation.

           ON GARRET

           Pulling himself up onto the foredeck to look over the stern.

                                 RONAN
                        We have to drive them off.
                            (to the other boat)
                        Onchu!  Take our rope.

           Ronan pulls the tether line, drawing the two boats together,
           he unhooks the whale line from the mast and passes it to
           Onchu, freeing his boat.
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Right, ABOUT!

           They turn their boat around and head to the whale's back
           half.

           As they approach the sharks, Alban and Ronan thrust harpoons
           at them.

           The sharks evade easily, swimming to another part of the
           whale, and going to work on that.

           RONAN shouts orders, the boat maneuvers toward them, the
           sharks just disperse, staying out of reach.

           ON GARRET

           He sees the sharks evade Ronan, watches Ronan try to drive
           them away, to no avail.  The sharks are winning.

           Garret removes a necklace from his neck, a ring from his
           finger, placing them carefully down on the foredeck.  He
           picks up the hand ax.  

           He takes a deep breath.  Looking at the sky, the sun, as if
           for the last time.  Then Garret falls out of frame.

           ON RONAN

           Still trying to drive off sharks, the futility of his effort
           clear to all, even to him...

                                 TANNER
                        Ay!  The wayfinder!

           Ronan looks back... Garret has gone over the side.  

                                 RONAN
                        The sheet, give the sheet!

           Ronan rushes over, grabs the line and JUMPS IN THE WATER. 
           He swims toward Garret.  

                                 GARRET
                        Stay away...

           Garret pushes him off.

                                 RONAN
                        What are you doing?

           Ronan tries to grab him, Garret SWINGS the ax at him.
                                 GARRET
                        Keep your bow pointed into the paw
                        of the Great Bear at night.  

           Ronan tosses the line to him.

                                 RONAN
                        Take the rope!

                                 GARRET
                        Dawn is as it was this morning, you
                        remember?

                                 RONAN
                        Grab the rope!

                                 GARRET
                        DO YOU REMEMBER?

                                 RONAN
                        YES!

           A shark passes just a few yards away.

                                 GARRET
                        Don't waste this chance, my friend. 
                        I'm dead anyway.  

           Garret starts to swim off.  Now Ronan realizes what Garret
           has in mind.

                                 RONAN
                        Don't man!  God don't.  Please...

           Ronan tries to grab him, but Garret wheels the ax, keeping
           Ronan off.

                                 GARRET
                        Save your sons.  Redeem this sin, or
                        my soul will never rest.  Say you
                        understand.

           Ronan can't say it.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        My cross goes to Duncan.  

           And Garret swims off.

                                 RONAN
                        Garret!  

           Garret keeps swimming, mind made up.
                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        GARRET!!

           Ronan SCREAMS AT THE SKY, then turns back to the boat.

           Ronan is pulled back aboard, looking at...

           THE SHARKS pulling chunks out of the whale, oblivious to
           Garret for now.

           Ronan faces a dilemma like none he has ever faced.  Shivering,
           he gives the hardest order of his life.

                                 GARRET
                        To the front.

           The rowers, their own faces haunted, turn the boat, rowing
           along the whale, back alongside Onchu's boat.

           ONCHU

           Hands Ronan his tow line. 

           Ronan looks to Garret visible forty yards off.  Garret turns
           to us, waves the hatchet in the air.

                                 RONAN
                        AHEAD ALL OARS.

           He points the direction.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. IN OCEAN - WITH GARRET

           Garret looks to the sharks.

           UNDERWATER SHOT

           As he LOOSENS THE tourniquet.  His blood flowing into the
           water.

           EXT. OCEAN - WHALEBOATS

           The boats pull against the mass of the whale, slowly getting
           him moving... the sharks still feeding on his back half.

           Then one shark separates from the pack, swimming in a circle.

           RONAN

           Sees the lone shark.  It swims slowly toward Garret.

           ON GARRET
           As he watches the shark approach.  Far from fear, he watches
           like a cat.  As the shark comes in to investigate, Garret
           holds still...

                                 GARRET
                        Smell good eh?

           The shark circles again, closer.  When he gets a clear, close
           shot, Garret SLASHES the shark's gills with the hatchet...
           more blood leaks into the water.

           ON RONAN

           The whale barely moving forward, he urges the men on, grabbing
           an oar, looking off to Garret.  Seeing a new pair of sharks
           approaching him.

           ON GARRET

           As more sharks approach Garret's getting weaker with the
           loss of blood.  The first shark is swimming in confused
           circles, the other sharks circle Garret...

           And behind them more sharks are turning off from the whale.

                                 GARRET (CONT'D)
                        Don't keep me waiting...

           Another attack, Garret slashes again, hitting the shark. 
           But another shark comes at him, his jaws GRABBING...

           ON RONAN

           As he hears Garret SCREAM, Ronan PULLS fiercely on the oar
           SCREAMING along with his friend.

           ON GARRET

           Pulled down, then coming up for air, SLASHING at an attacking
           shark with the hatchet, he's got many around him now... 

           One shark, bleeding from the gills, is ATTACKED by another
           shark, the blood making them indiscriminate...

           Garret's attacked and GRABBED, he SLASHES down again...

           A full FEEDING FRENZY begins... the sharks attacking each
           other as much as Garret...

           The ocean BUBBLES RED around thrashing fins.  Garret barely
           able to fight any more... a tiger shark zeroes in on him,
           open jaws...

           ON RONAN
           As he hears the awful screams.  They go on for a seemingly
           endless time, Garret's final moments unimaginable.

           Ronan pulls his oars, staring blankly ahead in agony, tears
           running down his face.  As tortured as his friend.

           Finally, mercifully, the screams STOP.

           Alban looks back, seeing the raging waters where the frenzy
           continues, looking to see if the sharks - after finishing
           Garret - come back for the whale.

           ON THE SHARKS

           The water boils with bloody fury, the sharks now crazed,
           attacking blindly, feeding on each other. 

           ON THE BOATS

           As they pull slowly away with the whale, the sharks not
           following.

           ON RONAN

           Staring... rowing... eyes fixed on an unknowable spot... 

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. VILLAGE/SHORE - DAY

           The Lieutenant walks down the boardwalk with one of his men. 
           In contrast to the village we left, there is no bustle.  A
           cloud hangs over all the villagers.

           The Lieutenant looks up at the tower, making sure one of his
           men is up there on lookout.

           EXT. TOP OF STONE TOWER - DAY

           HARRIS, an English corporal, is the top of the tower, the
           wind up, the chill deep.  He rubs his hands, turning his
           back to the gust coming from the sea.

           Camera arcs so that we see... behind him, a shape coming
           into sight on the horizon...

           EXT. RONAN'S BOAT - DAY

           The crew, rowing.  Alban on the foredeck.

           Ronan steps up, sees his village, the surrounding mountains,
           as if for the first time.

           They stand together, taking it in.  Alban then hands the
           scottish cross necklace of Glen Douglas to Ronan.  
           Alban looks back toward shore, toward home.

                                 ALBAN
                        You should lead the men in prayer of
                        thanks.  God has blessed us. 

           But Ronan still looks at the cross in his hand.

                                 RONAN
                        If that was God's blessing, I would
                        hate to know His punishment.

           EXT. STONE TOWER - DAY

           Harris, shivering, rubbing his hands, stomping his feet,
           glancing at the sea...

           And he double takes.  He strains to see clearly... HE SPOTS
           THEM...

           EXT. VILLAGE SHORE - DOCKSIDE

           The BELL at the tower RINGS.  Villagers come down to the
           shore.  Already several are launching boats to row out to
           meet the men and marvel at their catch.

           EXT. RONAN'S HOME - DAY

           Margaret is replacing thatching on the roof when she hears
           the BELL.  

           Elizabeth and Anna run out of the house, look at her... do
           they dare hope?

           EXT. HILLSIDE/VILLAGE - DAY

           Margaret and the girls come down the hill.  Margaret stops,
           looking in amazement at...

           POV - The two boats pulling the massive whale into the harbor. 
           And on the bow of one boat, she sees the figure that can
           only be her husband.

           ON MARGARET

           Filling with emotion, her hands go to her mouth, she drops
           to her knees, weeping.  The girls PULL with excitement to go
           down.

                                 MARGARET
                        Go... go...

           The girls run ahead, Margaret can't help herself.  She cries,
           releasing all her fear and anguish in a flood.
           HER POV - ON THE BOATS

           Village boats have gone out to meet them, taking over towing
           the whale as Ronan's boats release it and come toward shore.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. VILLAGE SHORE - DOCKSIDE

           Ronan's men debark onto the dock, stepping on solid land for
           the first time in eleven days.

           John Key is met by his wife, holding their baby.

           Tanner's five year old son runs to him, he picks him up,
           hugging him for life itself.

           Tatum is met by his brothers and mother, he kneels and kisses
           the ground.

           Onchu... McAdam... Deaf Willy all reunited with joy, cheers
           and tears with their families.

           Ronan steps off last.  Over the crowd, he sees Margaret
           looking at him.  He looks back at her.  The silent love
           between them louder than all the noise.

           Then he turns toward a lone woman who scans the boats, scans
           the group.  It's Glen Douglas' wife, and James' mother, Ilaan.  

           Ronan goes to her first.

           MARGARET'S POV

           Ronan speaks privately to Ilaan, handing her the wooden cross
           that she gave her husband.  She breaks down, crying
           inconsolably.  

           She becomes hysterical, shouting denials, running off from
           Ronan, shouting at the sky before collapsing on the boardwalk
           and sobbing.

           ON RONAN

           Watching as the village women take over care for Ilaan.  

           Ronan's two daughters pull at his cloak.  He looks down. 
           Their perfect young faces in contrast to his savage
           appearance.  He kneels down, and gives them a great, thankful
           hug.

           He picks them both up, kissing them as he walks toward his
           wife.
           He comes to Margaret, puts down the two girls.  Margaret
           looks at him, touching his chest in her powerful, gentle
           way.

           She wraps her arms around him and holds him as tight as life
           itself.  No words necessary here.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Father...

           Ronan turns, seeing his eldest son, Emma at his side, tears
           in her eyes.  Duncan and Ronan embrace, all anger forgotten.

           Duncan points to the whale.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        Couldn't you find a bigger one?

           The joke is appreciated.  

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        Where's Sir Garret?

           Ronan's smile dies on his face.  He slowly reaches into his
           cloak, removing Garret's cross.  He hands it to Duncan.

                                 DUNCAN (CONT'D)
                        He's lost?

                                 RONAN
                        Him.  Cook.  Glen Douglas.  And the
                        boy James.  

           They react to the shocking news.  Duncan looks down to Ilaan
           with pity.  Her family gone.

                                 MARGARET
                        What of you?

                                 RONAN
                        We need a fire, and food.  

           INT. BLACKSMITH'S SHOP - DAY

           The fire in the pit warms the whole shop.  Food has been
           laid out on the table, cooked lamb, struan, apples...

           Ronan, Onchu, Alban, are washed and in fresh clothes.  Tanner,
           Deaf Willy, and all the remaining crew sit around the large
           table, eating hungrily.  Villagers come through, offering
           welcomes, congratulations, gifts of food and drink.  

           Margaret ushers the villagers out, leaving the men in peace.  
           Onchu and Ronan look at each other.  Their chewing slowly
           stops.  Alban too.

           Slowly, silently, all the whalemen at the table are brought
           into the same realization as they look at themselves at each
           other.

           It's over.  They survived.  They're home.

           And it's overwhelming.  McAdam's eyes fill with tears, Onchu's
           too.  Tanner starts to LAUGH, the laughter spreads to others,
           and then transforms into SOBS of joy and pain and deliverance.

           Ronan stands and raises his cup.  The men all stand, sobs
           subsiding.  They grow quiet.

           They all raise their goblets.  Ronan doesn't need to say who
           they are honoring... their fallen brothers.

           The moment of reverence is interrupted when Ronan's youngest
           daughter runs in...

                                 ANNA
                        English!

           EXT. HILLSIDE/VILLAGE

           Lt. Pike and his eight soldiers, all armed, on horseback and
           in formation, trot down the hill toward the shore.  A showy
           entrance, meant to impress.

           Ronan, Onchu and the crew come out from the blacksmith shop. 
           Villagers gather on the shore, Margaret and Duncan among
           them.

           All watch this show of hubris from the English with hostility.

           Ronan sees this, realizes it's a bad mix.

                                 RONAN
                            (to Onchu and Alban)
                        Have the men unload our boats.

           Onchu and Alban nod and are off.  Ronan steps to Margaret.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Get the people to tasks.

           She agrees.  Ronan steps forward to meet the English.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        McColough!  You look uninjured.

                                 RONAN
                        I was more fortunate than some. 
                                 LT. PIKE
                            (pointing to the whale)
                        Good hunting I see.  

           The English dismount.  The Lieutenant stands with Ronan,
           admiring the whale.

           THEIR POV

           Fishing boats have pulled the whale as close to shore as its
           great size will allow, tying it down.

                                 LT. PIKE (CONT'D)
                        He's missing a flank.

                                 RONAN
                        He will give up much oil,
                        nevertheless.  Now, Lieutenant, to
                        our sons.  We would like them released
                        and returned.

           Without even looking at him.

                                 LT. PIKE
                            (dismissive)
                        For one whale?  

           Shock enters Ronan, Duncan and others in earshot.

                                 DUNCAN
                            (loud and angry)
                        That one whale is the size of four!

           Ronan's crew heard this, a crowd is forming.

           The Lieutenant walks to his horse, removes a scroll from a
           saddlebag.  He walks it to Ronan.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        The order states your sons' return
                        is conditioned on oil production
                        reaching it's previous level.  Four
                        hundred casks.

                                 RONAN
                        We haven't had a year like that in
                        five!

                                 LT. PIKE
                        That's what the Captain has promised
                        the Viceroy himself.

           Calls of outrage from the gathering crowd, Duncan especially. 
           Pike shouts over them all.
                                 LT. PIKE (CONT'D)
                        Sergeant Quinn!  Take two men and
                        guard the catch, see that no oil
                        goes missing during the boil.

           Sgt. Quinn salutes the Lieutenant.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You've no right...

                                 LT. PIKE
                        As of now, it is the King's property.

           Shouts of protest from the crowd.  Duncan leading it...

                                 DUNCAN
                        You PIGS will be driven from Scotland,
                        I swear!

           Lt. Pike now turns on Duncan.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        You don't learn.
                            (to a soldier)
                        Corporal Harris, arrest this boy. 
                        For this treason he will join the
                        other hostages.

           ON RONAN

           His last son, about to be taken. 

                                 RONAN
                        NO!

           All goes silent.  The Lieutenant turns to Ronan.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        I will take him with me to see the
                        Captain.  We will appeal for the
                        release of our sons.

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Do you really think the Captain
                        Governor is going to break a promise
                        to the Royal Court in London... at
                        the request of a fisherman?

           A beat.  Ronan stares, eyes of steel.

                                 RONAN
                        We're not fishermen.  We're whalemen.

           Ronan is flanked by Onchu and Alban and the rest of his crew
           carrying implements from the boats.  A battle tested unit.  
           But Lt. Pike doesn't back down. 

                                 LT. PIKE
                            (ordering)
                        Take the boy.

           Harris approaches Duncan, grabs his arm.

           IN SLOW MOTION

           Ronan wheels around, grabbing the blubber blade from Tanner's
           hands, swings it over everyone's heads, bringing it across...

           AND SLICES HARRIS IN HALF AT THE WAIST...

           ...Missing his own son by inches.  Harris drops to the ground.  

           The Lieutenant looks from the corpse to Ronan, who has murder
           in his eyes.

                                 RONAN
                            (to his men)
                        To HELL with them!

           THE WHALEMEN ATTACK.  

           Unleashing all their fury.  Onchu breaks an oar across a
           soldier's back, John Key leaps on a soldier and stabs a fish
           blade deep in his neck... 

           The Lieutenant pulls his sword and lunges at Duncan, Ronan
           blocks it, Pike then lunges at Ronan...

           Emma runs down the hill with two short swords, leaping up,
           blocking an attack and running a soldier through.  

           Tatum comes at Sgt. Quinn with a sword, Quinn parries and
           KILLS Tatum, running him through.  

           Deaf Willy throws a rock the size of a cannonball at a soldier
           KNOCKING him to the ground.  Villagers descend on him...

           Duncan grabs a sword from a dead soldier and runs at the
           retreating Sgt. Quinn.  Quinn turns on him, a CLANG of
           swords...

           Ronan sees Duncan, runs to help.  The Lieutenant sees his
           men are overwhelmed... he RUNS FOR HIS HORSE...

           Quinn knocks Duncan's sword away, about to kill him --  then
           sees Ronan coming and RUNS OFF...

           Ronan suddenly has to duck the swipe of a sword from a
           soldier... Duncan jumps up and tackles the soldier, grabbing
           up a rock and smashing it down on him.
           Ronan looks around, all the soldiers are down... then he
           sees...

           UP THE HILL

           The Lieutenant mounts his horse, riding away.  Ronan on
           fire...

           Onchu appears at Ronan's side, with Ronan's harpoon.

                                 ONCHU
                        Long shot.

           Ronan takes the harpoon, sights the target, and puts every
           pound of his rage into this throw...

           THE HARPOON

           Sails through the air, high up...

           HARPOON'S POV

           As it arcs down toward a lone tree stump, heading directly
           for it... and a fraction of a second before it hits the
           stump...

           The Lieutenant rides into its path --  

           WIDE SHOT

           The Lieutenant is knocked off the horse like he was hit by
           lightning.

           ON RONAN 

           Motionless as his men run toward the Lieutenant.  

           He walks uphill slowly.

           NEAR TREE STUMP

           Ronan approaches, his men standing around the body...  

                                 TANNER
                            (from ahead)
                        He breathes!

           Ronan steps closer...  

           ON LT. PIKE

           The harpoon entered his left side, went clean through him. 
           He's pinned to the tree stump.  Blood soaks the ground.
           Ronan kneels down.  The Lieutenant shifts his stare to Ronan. 
           They look at each other. 

           With his last breath...

                                 LT. PIKE
                        Nothing will remain.

           Ronan watches as Lieutenant Pike's breathing halts, and he
           dies.  

                                 ONCHU
                        Ronan!

           Onchu points urgently...

           ON TRAIL

           Sgt. Quinn, the last surviving soldier, has come out of a
           hiding place and taken hold of the Lieutenant's riderless
           horse.  He mounts and rides off.

           Ronan jumps up.

                                 RONAN
                        A horse!  Bring a HORSE!

           Suddenly DUNCAN comes riding up the hill on horseback, not
           to his father, Duncan's heading after the soldier.

           Ronan runs into his path, waving.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Get out of the way!

                                 RONAN
                        No!  Duncan!

           Duncan rears back, stopping the horse.   

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Get off, I go.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I can catch him!  You can't, you
                        know it.

                                 RONAN
                            (fearing for his son)
                        He is their strongest sword!

                                 DUNCAN
                        If he reaches the castle, our boys
                        are finished.  
           Ronan torn.  Emma runs up, with her two short swords in their
           scabbards, throws them to Duncan.

                                 EMMA
                        Speed against strength.  Remember?

           Duncan nods to her, looks to Ronan... who lets go the horse.

                                 RONAN
                        Go!

           YA!  Duncan kicks, the horse is off at a gallop.  Ronan
           watches his son ride away.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        A HORSE!  Damn it A HORSE!!

           Ronan runs off to find one.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAIL - DAY

           Duncan rides full out, slipping his arms through the straps
           of Emma's scabbard.  Then crouching like a jockey and slapping
           the horse, fire in his eye.

           ON QUINN

           Far ahead, riding fast, armor rattling.  Looking behind to
           see...

           DUNCAN

           Coming into view, racing for him...

           QUINN

           Kicking his horse, trying to out run him.

           The race is on, both riders going all out.  Horses kicking
           dirt, splashing through a stream, hopping a fallen log...

           DUNCAN

           Comes over a rise, scans ahead as the path forks... which
           road did Quinn go on?  He looks ahead, both paths are empty.

           Duncan stops the horse, looking for tracks on the ground. 
           Then from out of nowhere...

           QUINN ATTACKS

           He comes out swinging his sword right for Duncan, Duncan has
           to lean all back, the horse REARS and Duncan FALLS...
           Quinn tries to trample him, Duncan rolls out of the way. 
           Quinn CHARGES on the horse, Duncan dashes into the trees.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           In here, Quinn's horse is no advantage.  He has to pull up
           short, move slow.  He maneuvers clumsily, no visibility,  
           looking... listening... 

           Duncan leaps out, takes a swing with a short sword, but Quinn
           is fast and his sword is longer.  Duncan disappears in shrubs.

           Quinn dismounts, steps away from the horse.  He sees Duncan,
           standing tall, swords in hand.  Waiting.

           Quinn attacks, powerful and heavy swings of his long sword. 
           Duncan deflecting, evading, ducking his deadly swings.

                                 QUINN
                        Coward, attack me!

           Duncan's fiery eyes just stare, a smile forms on his lips. 
           Quinn attacks again, a fierce lunge, a deadly swing.  Duncan
           light, wheeling away, blocking the sword in the crook of his
           two...

           But he misjudges... on Quinn's attack Duncan loses one of
           his swords.  Quinn presses his advantage. 

           Duncan's in trouble, stumbling, he gets SLASHED.  Duncan's
           one sword no match for Quinn's broadsword.

           Quinn attacks and attacks, Duncan barely evading, stumbling
           again... Now Quinn's over him, about to deal a death blow to
           Duncan crawling feebly on the ground... down comes Quinn's
           sword...

           CLANG.  Duncan turns and catches it in the crook of his two
           swords.  He found his second.  And he SWINGS it...

           Quinn jumps away.  He is on the defensive now, Duncan wheels,
           Quinn is tired, spent from his attack, Duncan light, fast,
           he blocks a lunge and SLASHES Quinn's leg... just like Emma
           showed him.

           Quinn swings in a rage, Duncan ducks under and LUNGES...
           Stabbing fast but deep into Quinn's stomach.  Quinn wavers,
           tries to walk... CRUMBLES.

           Duncan steps forward, stands over Quinn, looking down.  

                                 QUINN (CONT'D)
                        Mercy...

           Duncan SCREAMS as he buries both his swords in Quinn's chest.
           EXT. FOREST TRAILS  - DAY

           Hearing Duncan's SCREAM, Ronan and Emma ride up to the fork. 
           Stopping when they see the riderless horse.

                                 RONAN
                            (calling)
                        Duncan!

           Duncan emerges from the woods, dragging Quinn's enormous
           sword.  Emma hops off her horse runs to him.

           Ronan and his son look at each other, a new respect.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE - EVENING

           Night falling on the great castle near the sea.

           INT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE - THE HOLD

           One of the boys comes back from the shit pales.  Ewan is
           disgusted.

                                 EWAN
                        That stench...

           But Alec doesn't respond, he's lying down, eyes open, fetal
           position, traumatized.

           Suddenly NOISES out the door.  The great latch is thrown,
           door opens.

           The Friar enters with a soldier.  He looks down at Alec.

                                 FRIAR
                        This one.

           The soldier takes Alec's arm.

                                 EWAN
                        Where are you taking him?

           The Friar turns his dark eye at Ewan.

                                 FRIAR
                        Prayer and instruction, of course.

           INT. CASTLE STAIRS - EVENING

           The Friar leads Alec down the stairs, soldier behind him.
           INT. CASTLE HALLWAY/STAIRS - EVENING

           They approach a chamber doorway... inside sits the Viceroy,
           his cloak off.  He looks up at Alec, looking him up and down.

                                 VICEROY
                        Don't be afraid, my son.  Sit by the
                        fire.
                            (to the Friar)
                        That's all.

           The Friar and soldier exit.  

           EXT. CASTLE GATEHOUSE - NIGHT

           The gatehouse stands over the thin landbridge connecting the
           castle peninsula to the mainland.  A TOWER GUARD watches
           from the top.  A ROAD GUARD below.

           It's quiet, only the sound of the surf and wind.  Although
           standing, the Tower Guard has dozed off.

           Below him, the Road Guard patrols the gate entrance.  He
           steps out onto the land bridge, turns around...

           And sees Emma climbing up from the rocks on the side.

                                 EMMA
                        Help me, I fell...

           The guard comes, sees she's dressed like a boy, with two
           swords in her harness.  Something's not right, he lowers his
           spear at her as...

           Tanner leaps on him from behind, knife into the neck...

           IN TOWER

           A sound wakes the Tower Guard, he looks around.  Eyes drawn
           to...

           At the far end of the land bridge, someone is waving a TORCH,
           like a signal.

           The guard leans over the edge of the guard tower, looking
           out to sea... where he sees a light waving offshore as well.

           EXT. OFFSHORE FROM CASTLE - NIGHT

           Two whaleboats are bobbing in the sea off shore, in the first
           are Onchu, his men at the oars.  In Alban's boat, Tatum has
           an oil lamp on the end of a pole, waving it side to side.
           EXT. BACK TO GUARD

           He calls down to the Ground Guard.  

                                 TOWER GUARD
                        Aye, look...

           No reply.  The guard looks down for him, finding RONAN, he
           THROWS A HARPOON upward...

           Running the guard through the chest.  Ronan PULLS on the
           harpoon's line, YANKING the guard out of the tower.

           INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

           Dozens of soldiers sleep on straw and wool mats in a long
           barracks that opens onto the castle courtyard, lit by two
           fires outside.  Snores and surf are the only sounds.

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Ronan, Duncan, Emma, Tanner, Eachan sneak into the castle
           courtyard, hugging the shadows.  Eachan and Duncan both have
           large coils of rope slung over one shoulder.  Ronan now
           carries the guards' sword.

           At the far side of the courtyard, the two basket fires burn,
           a soldier walks past, toward the latrine.  He's the only one
           in sight.

           They wait for him to pass.  Then crouch and run across the 
           courtyard.  

           Suddenly Ronan motions them to hide as...

           The Friar and his soldier exit the castle Forebuilding,
           heading across the courtyard.

           ON RONAN & OTHERS

           Hiding as the Friar passes.  Ronan noticing they're right in
           front of...

           OFFICERS QUARTERS

           Four sleeping officers, close enough to spit on.  

           Tanner holds up his blade, motioning "should we kill them?" 
           Ronan shakes his head 'no'.  

           They move forward, slipping into the Forebuilding entrance.
           INT. FOREBUILDING STAIRS - NIGHT

           Utterly dark.  The window openings, few and small, offering
           the only light.  They climb the stairs.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. OFFSHORE FROM CASTLE - NIGHT

           Onchu and his men row quietly toward the castle's sea side
           face.

           The rocks at the castle base are treacherous, the seas choppy. 
           Two men on each boat use poles to fend off rocks.

           EXT. WALKWAY TO CASTLE KEEP - NIGHT

           A long stone walkway connects the forebuilding and the keep,
           guard armed with a long lance, at the far end. 

           Ronan and the team are on the forebuilding side, they need
           to cross the long open walkway without alerting soldiers.  

           Eachan motions for them to wait.  He drops his coil of rope,
           runs back down the stairs...

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Eachan checks around, coast is clear.  He runs out, selects
           two baseball sized rocks from the ground, runs back in.

           EXT./INT. FOREBUILDING & WALKWAY - NIGHT

           Eachan rejoins his comrades.  He motions for them to give
           him room.  He picks his moment, and heaves one of the rocks,
           ducking back into hiding.

           ON GUARD

           The rock lands on the other side from him, he turns toward
           the sound, giving Eachan his chance.

           Eachan RUNS full out toward the Guard, closing on him fast.

           THE GUARD

           Hears the steps, turns.  Sees Eachan running at him full
           steam.  He readies his lance to meet him...

           At full run, Eachan winds up like a cricket pitcher and THROWS
           the rock, hitting the guard square in the face.

           ON RONAN & OTHERS
           Crossing the walkway, entering the tower.  This is the heart
           of the castle, the KEEP.

           INT. CASTLE TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT

           Ronan, Eachan and Tanner lead the way up the steep stairs
           with swords drawn.

           They pass a window opening, facing the ocean, Ronan looks
           out, sees...

           EXT. OCEAN/ROCKS AT CASTLE BASE - NIGHT

           Onchu trying not to get smashed on the rocks as he lands the
           boats below.

           INT. DUNNOTAR CASTLE TOWER - OUTSIDE THE HOLD

           Ronan and Tanner arrive at the landing, they crawl silently
           on the stone approach leading to the HOLD.  

           THEIR POV - GUARDS

           Two guards are posted, an oil lamp is the only light.  One
           guard stands with a spear, the other dozes on a stool, between
           them is an iron door, leading to the hold (and the hostages).  

           ON STANDING GUARD

           As he hears whispers coming from the stairs.  A woman's
           whispers.  A flirtatious giggle, quickly hushed. 

           He approaches the stairs, stepping out to find...

           Emma - who STABS through his neck with her sword.

           The other guard jumps up.  Ronan THROWS the spear, hitting
           through his chest.

           INT. HOLD - NIGHT

           Ewan hears the commotion, comes to the door.  He sees a face
           in the door's opening.  

           It's his father.

                                 EWAN
                        Pa!

                                 RONAN
                        Quietly... quietly...

           Ronan gestures for him to wake the others.  Ewan steps among
           the boys, shaking them awake, motioning them to be quiet.
           INT. OUTSIDE THE HOLD - NIGHT

           Eachan finds the keys.  They open the heavy door.

           The boys have to be hushed, confused and excited.  Tanner
           and Eachan lead them out, hurry them UPSTAIRS.

           Ronan hugs Ewan in relief. 

                                 EWAN
                        Alec!  

           Ronan looks for Alec, then back to Ewan.

                                 EWAN (CONT'D)
                        They took him.

                                 RONAN
                        Where?

                                 EWAN
                        The Friar.  

           Ronan and Duncan look at each other.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I'll find him.

                                 RONAN
                        We both go.

           Ronan slings the coil of rope off his shoulder, gives it to
           Emma.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (to Emma)
                        Get them out.  

           Emma nods.  She moves with the last of the boys up the stairs,
           a last look to Duncan.

           Ronan and Duncan head back down the stairs.

           EXT. TOWER ROOF - NIGHT

           Eachan secures one end of his rope, and throws the coil of
           rope over the side.

           The rope falls toward...

           EXT. BASE OF CASTLE WALL - NIGHT

           ONCHU stands on the rocks below, looking up as the rope coil
           comes down at him...
           And stops, fully extended, about ten feet over his head.

                                 ONCHU
                        Hell's dogs...

           EXT. TOWER ROOF - NIGHT

           Tanner helps the first boy over the side.

                                 TANNER
                        Hold tight, now go.

           The boy goes over, the next one gets ready...

           INT. TOWER STAIRS - NIGHT

           Ronan and Duncan descend the dark stairs, passing a landing
           and continuing down toward the courtyard.

           EXT. BASE OF CASTLE WALL - NIGHT

           Onchu watches the first boy descend, reaching the end of the
           rope.

                                 ONCHU
                        Let go!  I've got you.

           The boy SCREAMS as he leaps, Onchu catches him, points him
           to Alban and the boats.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Go now, and be quiet about it.

           Onchu looks up, two more boys are on their way down the rope.

           EXT. TOWER ROOF - NIGHT

           Eachan has secured the second rope, throws the coil over the
           side.

           EXT. BASE OF CASTLE WALL - NIGHT

           This rope makes it all the way to the ground.

                                 ONCHU
                        Thank you Jesus.

           INT. / EXT. WALKWAY & BASE OF TOWER - NIGHT

           Ronan and Duncan make it back to the walkway, suddenly
           stopping as they see...

           At the far end of the walkway, talking to an officer, is
           Captain Barron.
           And on Ronan's side, only barely out of the Captain's view,
           is the body of the guard they killed.

           ON CAPTAIN BARRON

           The Captain and soldier talk briefly, then head back into
           the Forebuilding and away.

           ON DUNCAN AND RONAN

           Waiting a beat before moving, about to cross when they hear
           behind them...

           The distant echo of Alec's voice.  Ronan and Duncan both
           recognize it.

           INT. VICEROY'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The Viceroy, now on his knees in front of Alec, offering him
           a goblet to drink.  Alec, seated on a chair, shirt off, is
           refusing.

                                 ALEC
                        No!  Please...

           The Viceroy drinks it himself.  

                                 VICEROY
                        See?  You can trust me.  I'm trying
                        to help you.

           He stands, and drains the goblet.  He's growing frustrated
           with the boy.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        Stand up boy.  

                                 RONAN (O.S.)
                        Alec...

           RONAN stands near the entrance, Duncan behind him, both with
           swords.  Alec jumps up, the Viceroy grabs the boy, and
           produces a dagger...

           Duncan, seeing the shirtless boy, becomes enraged beyond
           reason, charges the Viceroy.

                                 DUNCAN
                        That dagger won't SAVE YOU!

           The Viceroy jumps to get his sword, letting go of Alec... 

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan stop!
           Duncan and the Viceroy face each other, their swords touching.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        DUNCAN!  Take Alec up.  Now.

           Duncan, with difficulty, backs off.  He lifts Alec into his
           arms, heads out.

           Ronan stands with his sword up.  The Viceroy and Ronan
           maneuver for position, preparing to fight.

                                 VICEROY
                        So very foolish.

           The Viceroy FEINTS a lunge, Ronan ready.  

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        Why would you destroy your whole
                        world?

                                 RONAN
                        You've already done that.

           The Viceroy suddenly SHOUTS OUT a window opening...

                                 VICEROY
                        GUARDS...  INTRUDERS!  

           Ronan LUNGES at him, the Viceroy parries, swords CLANG...

           EXT. COURTYARD - ON GUARDS

           Two GUARDS suddenly alerted, raising the alarm...

           EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT

           Captain Barron hears the cry, rushes into the stairs...

           INT. VICEROY'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

           The Viceroy swings his sword catching Ronan on the arm, but
           Ronan punches him with his free hand, the Viceroy tumbles
           backward.

           Ronan could deal the death blow but...

           Voices are coming upstairs, the clatter of soldiers.  Ronan
           grabs the TORCH off the wall and runs out.

           EXT. TOWER ROOF - NIGHT

           Tatum and Eachan, hoisting something up from below, hear
           behind them...

           Duncan and Alec come out from the stairs onto the roof.
                                 EMMA
                        Where's your father?

                                 DUNCAN
                        He'll be here.

           Emma helps the next child over the side as...

           Tanner and Eachan pull up a CASK from below, unlashing it
           from the rope, throwing the rope back over.

           BEHIND THEM

           Ronan arrives on the roof, out of breath, handing the torch
           to Tanner.

           Ewan throws himself into Ronan's arms first.

                                 RONAN
                            (to Emma)
                        They're coming.  Get over the side.

           Emma nods.  

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                            (to Ewan)
                        Go now, go.

           Emma helps him onto the rope.  Ronan looks over the side,
           whistles to Onchu. 

           ON ONCHU

           He has a harpoon, and HEAVES it STRAIGHT UP.  It flies like
           a rocket...

           Ronan CATCHES IT perfectly.  Tosses it to Duncan at the
           stairs, he hears the soldiers coming.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Hurry...

           Ronan rolls the CASK to Duncan, who uses the harpoon to CRACK
           the cask open.  They TIP IT OVER...

           WHALE OIL flows down the stairs.  STRAW is also in the cask,
           drenched with oil.  They pull that out and throw it into the
           stairs too.

           INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT

           Captain Barron reaches the Viceroy, who's putting on more
           clothes.
           Captain Barron sees Alec's shirt on the floor near the fire,
           he turns to the Viceroy, who looks back, guilt in his eye.

           Armed Guards arrive.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        The TOWER!  GO!

           EXT. ROOF - NIGHT

           Tanner goes over the side.  Eachan whistles to Duncan, throws
           him the TORCH.  

                                 EACHAN
                        See you at home.

           Eachan goes over.  ON THE OTHER ROPE Alec is helped over by
           Emma.  Last of the boys over, Emma goes to the other rope
           and gives Duncan a last look. 

                                 EMMA
                        Don't wait too long.

           Duncan nods, she goes over.  

                                 RONAN
                        Here they come.

           Duncan looks down toward...

           INT. STAIRWAY/ROOF - NIGHT

           Soldiers rush up the narrow stairs, look up and see Ronan
           and Duncan standing at the opening, torch in hand...

           Soldiers rush up, before noticing the oil and straw under
           their feet... 

                                 SOLDIERS
                        BACK!  BACK!!!

           Ronan tosses the torch...

           The stairway catches fire, the fire grows quickly...

           INT. STAIRWAY - BELOW

           FIRE spreads down, soldiers stomp furiously, trying to put
           it out, slipping and falling into it...

           Ronan holds them back with the harpoon.

                                 RONAN
                            (to Duncan)
                        Go!
                                 DUNCAN
                        I won't leave you.

           EXT. WIDE AERIAL OF CASTLE & TOWER

           Flames erupt from the stairs as the boys climb down the sheer
           wall to the awaiting boats...

           INSIDE CASTLE STAIRS - 

           The oil fire burns down.

                                 VICEROY
                        UP, NOW!

           RONAN AND DUNCAN

           Jab and slash with their weapons, holding the soldiers in
           the stairs while their people climb down.  

           ON THE ROPES

           Emma descends quickly, still a long way to go.  She passes
           Alec on the other rope, going slow.

           EXT. ROOF/STAIRWAY - NIGHT

           Soldiers thrust spears, Ronan and Duncan try to hold the
           line but finally...

           The soldiers break from the stairs.  Ronan and Duncan are
           driven back.  Duncan heads for the ropes, but Ronan grabs
           him.

                                 RONAN
                        This way.

           They run for the far edge as soldiers pour out of the stairs
           and chase them.

           An OFFICER sees the ropes, steps over and looks over the
           side, seeing Alec looking up.  He takes out his sword, hacks
           at the rope...

           ON THE ROPES

           Emma is across from Alec as his rope starts to shake.

                                 EMMA
                        Hurry Alec, go!

           But Alec is frozen with fear.  Emma climbs up her rope to
           his level, starts SWINGING over to him

           BELOW HER the rope moves, Onchu looks up.
                                 ONCHU
                        Alec!

           Emma's swinging almost reaches Alec.

                                 EMMA
                        You have to grab hold!

                                 ALEC
                        I can't!

                                 EMMA
                        You can, grab 'round my neck!

           She reaches him.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        NOW!

           Alec lets go the rope and grabs Emma, who swings back along
           the wall as...

           The Officer HACKS the rope and CUTS it.  Alec's rope falls
           away.

           TOWER ROOF

           The Officer now hacks at the other rope.

           ON EMMA

           Feeling the blow on the rope, still far to go.  Burning her
           hands as she lets the rope slip.

           THE OFFICER

           Hits the rope, deep cut...

           EMMA

           Looking down.

                                 EMMA (CONT'D)
                        You have to jump.
                            (shouting)
                        Onchu!

           Onchu moves under.

                                 ONCHU
                        I've got him.

           Alec lets go.  Falling to his father...
           The force knocks Onchu down.  Both of them hit the ground,
           but Alec is OK,  Onchu points him to the boats.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Quickly...

           Alec runs off, Onchu gets up, seeing.

           THE ROPE CUT

           Emma falls...

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Give me STRENGTH--

           Onchu gets under her, she hits him like a ton of rock, they
           both land in heaps.

           But Emma, panting, seems unhurt.  She crawls to him...

                                 EMMA
                        Onchu!  God, I've killed him!

           Onchu groans.

                                 ONCHU
                            (coughing)
                        I'm still here... Go!  

           Emma kisses his cheek, gets up, runs to the boats.  

           ON RONAN

           He and Duncan run for the far edge, an open cannon port where
           the wall is low.  Ronan looks over.  It's a long drop, and
           they have to clear a lot of jagged rock.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Can we clear those rocks?

                                 RONAN
                        We have to.

           The English closing in on them.  It's now or never.

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        Keep your legs under you...

           They take a few steps back, run for the ledge, and they LEAP
           OFF...

           EXT. SHORE UNDER CASTLE - NIGHT

           As Ewan notices his father's voice SCREAM, looking up...
                                 EWAN
                        THERE!

           Everyone watches as Duncan and Ronan fall flailing into the
           rolling sea.

                                 ONCHU
                        OARS!

           The oars come out, Onchu runs into his boat and pushes off.

           EXT. CASTLE ROOF - NIGHT

           Soldiers come to the edge, looking over.  

                                 VICEROY
                        ARCHERS...

           A row of longbowmen approach the ledge as...

           IN THE SEA

           Ronan's head splashes out.  He looks around.

                                 RONAN
                        Duncan!

           No sign of him.  Duncan is still under.  

                                 RONAN (CONT'D)
                        DUNCAN!!

           Duncan surfaces, gasping.

           CASTLE ROOF

           The archers have formed a line, aiming.

                                 VICEROY
                        Fire.

           Arrows fly.

           ON RONAN AND DUNCAN

           Arrows hit the water near them.

           EXT.  WITH THE BOATS - ON ONCHU

           Both boats pull toward Ronan, and toward the line of fire. 
           Onchu calls to Alban in the other boat.

                                 ONCHU
                        Take on my boys!
           The boats pull together, the boys cross to Alban's boat.

           ON RONAN and DUNCAN

           Swimming together, the seas rough...

           ABOVE - ON ROOF

           The archers ready.

                                 VICEROY
                        Fire.

           Another rain of arrows, Duncan HIT in the shoulder, he goes
           UNDER.

           Ronan swims over, pulls him up, Duncan gasps for air in the
           heaving water, he PULLS OUT THE ARROW.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I'm all right... Go!

           They swim on.

           ON ONCHU

           The last of the boys gets off his boat.

                                 ONCHU
                        Row!  Come ON!

           The oarsmen pull for Ronan.

           ABOVE - ON ROOF

           Viceroy and Captain Barron look down.  

                                 VICEROY
                        Quickly quickly, FIRE.

           ON RONAN

           Another rain of arrows.  Onchu almost there...

           Emma in the bow reaches an oar out, Ronan grabs it, pulling
           in, climbing aboard.  Duncan swimming up behind him...

           ABOVE - ON VICEROY

           The Viceroy grabs a longbow from one of the archers.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        Are your men trying to miss?

           ON RONAN
           Taking his son's hands, pulling him out of the water as...

           THE VICEROY aims and FIRES...

           THE ARROW flies straight... sinking deep into DUNCAN'S BACK.  

           Duncan SCREAMS.  Emma screams as she sees it.  Ronan pulls
           Duncan the rest of the way into the boat.

                                 ONCHU
                        AWAY!

           The oarsmen push.  The boat moves.

           Ronan pulls Duncan onto flat deck.  He grips the arrow to
           pull it out.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        No!!  No wait... 

           Onchu checks the arrow.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                            (to Ronan)
                        It's too deep.  

                                 RONAN
                        We can't pull it out?

                                 ONCHU
                            (gravely)
                        He'll last longer if you don't.

           Ronan's realization dawns, his son is mortally wounded.

           Emma takes Duncan's head in her hands, kisses him, crying.

           Ronan looks up at the Viceroy, rage building...

                                 RONAN
                        Harpoon!

           A harpoon is passed to Ronan.  He plants his feet and sights,
           all his focus on the Viceroy.

           And with a cry of primal rage he HEAVES the great spear.  It
           arcs a high arc.  The men all look on in awe.

           ON VICEROY

           Who's smug grin falls into FEAR as he sees the harpoon
           defiantly rise, and rise toward him.

           But as incredible as the throw is, it is short.  It slams
           harmlessly into the castle wall below the Viceroy.
           ON RONAN

           Seething as their boat pulls away.  He turns back to his
           son.

           ON VICEROY AND CAPT. BARRON

                                 VICEROY
                        What a fool.  

           Capt. Barron looks at the Viceroy, despising him but hiding
           it.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        He's many things, but no fool.

           He turns to an officer.

                                 CAPT. BARRON (CONT'D)
                        Sergeant, mounted pursuit.  Thirty
                        horses.

                                 SERGEANT
                        Yes Captain.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                            (to Viceroy)
                        With luck we will be in their village
                        before they are.

           EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

           Ronan lifts Duncan's head.  Duncan looks at him.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Forgive me.  I did not understand...

                                 RONAN
                        No... no.  It is I who did not
                        understand.

           Duncan holds up his hand to him.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You're a great father.

           Ronan grips it.

                                 RONAN
                        And you are a great man.

           Ronan hugs his son.  The oarsmen look on with deep sadness,
           rowing the boat off into the darkness.
           EXT. CASTLE GATEHOUSE - LATER

           Led by a SERGEANT on horseback, two columns of mounted
           soldiers pass onto the narrow land bridge out of the castle.

           On the other side, a woman with a torch emerges from the
           woods.

           It's Glen Douglas' wife, Ilaan. 

           The SERGEANT sees her, it worries him.  He looks around,
           finally noticing, hidden in the bushes...

           CASKS.  And STRAW...

           He kicks his horse, drawing his sword.  Bearing down on Ilaan.

           ON ILAAN

           She throws the torch forward, it lands in a bush... the bush
           ERUPTS in flames... 

           The flames GROW and spread quickly.

           The Sergeant STOPS.  The flames moving toward him.

           The Sergeant tries to turn, but the horse REARS, throwing
           him...

           He tumbles down the side of the hill, which is covered in
           WHALE OIL.  His fall is stopped by a CASK.  He gets up, sees
           a wall of fire racing toward his men, toward him...

           He fights his way up the hill, uselessly against the slippery
           oil, shouting commands as...

           The flames reach them.  Men and horses scream... PANIC...

           ON ILAAN

           STARING AT THE MAYHEM, a revenge trance.  Other village women
           run to her and pull her away from the flames to a waiting
           wagon.

           ON LAND BRIDGE

           Flames licking high, soldiers on fire.  Other soldiers arrive
           to help.

           ON CAPTAIN BARRON

           On his horse.  Seeing the hillside in flames, his men burned.  

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. VILLAGE / SHORE - NIGHT

           Flickering lights move in the dark.  The villagers of Till,
           heading out with everything they can carry.  An evacuation.

           Margaret carries a torch, directing people, hurrying them
           along.  Suddenly she hears the voices of children...

           IN THE BAY

           The BOATS approach, carrying the sons of the village, who
           call out with excitement.

           The villagers erupt in CHEERS as the boats pull to the dock. 
           The boys dash off the boats and toward the shore.  

           Parents come forward, relief and joy everywhere as one by
           one the boys are re-united with loved ones.

           The crews come off the boats too, receiving congratulations.

           Margaret is guiding a young boy to his mother when suddenly
           the jubilant crowd goes QUIET.  Margaret looks up to see...

           RONAN 

           Standing on the dock, the body of Duncan in his arms.  Emma
           next to him with a torch.  Ewan holding her hand.  

           MARGARET 

           Goes dead still. 

           Ronan steps along the dock, Emma following.  The silent crowd
           makes room for them as he steps off the rock and approaches
           his wife.

           She hasn't moved.  He kneels before her, gently laying the
           limp body of Duncan at her feet.

           Margaret kneels over her son.  Crying silently.  Ewan, Anna,
           and Elizabeth all go to their mother, joining with her.  

           Emma, standing over them with the torch, is joined by her
           father.  He leads her away.

           And the crowd silently moves away with utmost respect, leaving
           Ronan and his family to its grief.  The only sound the sea.

                                                        SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

           SOUNDS of the sea, FADE UP as the horizon glows, the sunrise
           burns its first blister of orange...
           EXT. VILLAGE SHORE - DAWN

           Ronan stands alone in the dim glow, a lit torch in one hand. 
           He stares out to sea, and at the great whale in the harbor.

           We see the village behind, totally deserted.  Alban and Onchu
           approach slowly on horses, leading one for Ronan.  They stop.

           Ronan doesn't say anything, just stares.  Onchu gets off his
           horse, puts the rein in Ronan's hand.

                                 ONCHU
                        Your family is on the north road to
                        Dundee.  I'm to Aberdeen for the
                        Winter, my cousin there has land
                        bought with our gold.  Maybe in the
                        Spring, you can come.  We can put a
                        whale crew together, and hunt again.

           After a beat, Ronan slowly shakes his head 'no'.  

                                 RONAN
                        They've given us enough.

                                 ONCHU
                        Who?

           Ronan nods to the great beast, lying in the bay like a statue.

           Onchu thinks a beat.

                                 ONCHU (CONT'D)
                        Aye.  I suppose they have.

           He returns to his horse, remounts.  

                                 ALBAN
                        It's time, Ronan.

           Ronan looks at them, nods.  Looks back to sea.  

                                 RONAN
                        I have loved this.  All of this. 
                        Even our sins.

                                 ONCHU
                        Especially our sins.

           Alban gives Onchu a disapproving look.  Ronan turns to them. 
           Nods warmly.

                                 RONAN
                        We will find each other in the Spring.  
           The men nod, an unbreakable, unspoken connection between
           them.  

           And that's where they leave it.

           Alban kicks, his horse goes.  Onchu lingers for a last look
           at Ronan, then rides off too.

           Ronan watches them disappear.

           INT. RONAN'S HOME - LATER

           A candle flame is one of many surrounding the body of Duncan.

           He lies on the family table, covered in cloth up to his chest.

           Under the table is a pile of dry wood.  Ronan pours oil from
           a wood pitcher, then tosses in the pitcher.

           He stands back from his son's funeral pyre, looks at the
           body, the face, of his oldest son.

           EXT. RONAN'S HOME - DAY

           Ronan steps out of his house, behind him we see it's on FIRE.

           ON RONAN

           He turns and watches his house go up in flames.

           CAMERA LIFTS

           And beyond we see the whole village is burning.

                                                             DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. HILLSIDE FOREST TRAIL - DAY

           Horses step through the woods.  Lots of horses.

           We focus on a horse's eye, which bears a striking resemblance
           to a whale's eye.  The great nostrils flare and blow mist.

           And on top is a soldier, heavy with armor and weapons.  

           Next to him is Captain Barron and the Viceroy.  Captain Barron
           smells something in the air.  Everyone does.

           EXT. HILLSIDE OVERLOOKING VILLAGE - DAY

           They come out of the forest onto a treeless hillside with a
           view of the village of Till, which is in the final stages of
           burning to the ground.

           They kick horses and hurry.
           EXT. VILLAGE - DAY

           The ruins of the blacksmith house, where the village would
           gather.

           The try pots have been knocked down to rubble, destroyed.  

           Every structure is a ruin.  Even the boardwalk has been
           methodically torn up and used for kindling to burn houses.

           Only the STONE TOWER remains.

           ON CAPTAIN BARRON

           Looking up at it.  Then around at the village.  Can't hide
           the feeling.  What a damned stupid waste.

           The Captain gets off his horse and walks around.  Viceroy
           stays on his.

                                 VICEROY
                        Can your men get the oil out?

           Captain Barron doesn't know what he means at first, until
           the Viceroy points...

           In the bay lies the great dead whale, all that oil ready to
           be harvested.  No one to get it out.

           The Captain looks at the Viceroy unblinking, not answering
           him.  It makes the Viceroy uncomfortable.

                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        We will send a squad on the east
                        road, another the south road.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        No.

                                 VICEROY
                        We must pursue!  

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        We will pursue in the Spring.  If we
                        can.

                                 VICEROY
                            (indignant)
                        The Spring?

           The Viceroy stares at him, firm.
                                 VICEROY (CONT'D)
                        You allow this terror to go
                        unpunished, I will see the King hears
                        of it.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        Then he will hear everything.  

           They look at each other, the Viceroy pondering what the
           Captain is threatening.

                                 CAPT. BARRON (CONT'D)
                        We drove them to this.  For what? 
                        For that?

           He points to the dead whale.  The Viceroy stares at him.

           They are interrupted, a SOLDIER approaches in a hurry from
           up the hill.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Captain... Excellency... the Bruce
                        approaches, leading 500.  They crossed
                        Tally river at the moon.

           Captain Barron heads to his horse.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                        When will they reach the castle?

                                 SOLDIER
                        Tonight sir.

           Tonight!  He barely has time to get back.  And with his forces
           weakened, this is bad, very bad.  He mounts his horse.

                                 CAPT. BARRON
                            (to the soldier)
                        Back to Dunnotar, tell the Sergeant.

           He gives the Viceroy a hateful look, and gallops up the hill
           without him.  The Viceroy tries to follow, but pushes the
           horse too hard and it rebels, rearing up.  He FALLS OFF.

           He climbs back to his feet, his horse trotting off.  He calls
           for a soldier's help, but they're all riding up the hill.

           He runs uphill after his horse, calling for help.

           sad ruins Till, over the TOWER, and away...

                        "The time of Till will never come
                        again.  But there is always another
                        village, another empire, another

           EXT. FOREST TRAILS ALONG RIVER - EVENING

           The sound of rushing water, the call of birds.  A wagon drawn
           by a horse, the horse led by Ewan.  We take in the family
           one by one.

           In the wagon, Anna and Elizabeth sit among their worldly
           goods.  Margaret walks in the rear with the dogs.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "Fortune will smile again somewhere,
                        then awaken greed and turn on us. 
                        An ancient play, acted out on ever
                        greater stages.

           Margaret hears something and turns.  Wide eyes as she sees...

           Ronan on a horse.  Alive and well.  Waving.

           Margaret smiles, waves back.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        "And even as Mankind's mischief grows
                        faster than his wisdom, even though
                        we are probably destined - with our
                        own hands - to set the fire that
                        burns all we know to ash...

           WIDE SHOT - DAY

           As the girls leap off their perch, Ewan drops the lead and
           runs to his father.  Margaret runs, even the dogs run back
           to Ronan.

                                 OLDER SCOT (V.O.)
                        "It is when we are most broken that
                        God's light can find a way in."

           Ronan drops from the horse and embraces his family.  

           They are wounded, they are wiser.  Most important, they are
           together.  

           And it's good.  

           CAMERA LIFTS
           Leaving them below, lifting above the trees.

           The great green Scottish landscape drifts away below us.

           We fly over a dramatic rocky cliff, and high over the mighty
           North Sea, with all its life surging from within.

           And far below us we see a small pod of whales swimming toward
           the sun.
