                                                              Marlon Brando
           INT. THEATER - STAGE - 1947 - PRESENT DAY

           A YOUNG MAN (24), average height, but boyishly, nearly 
           poetically handsome, sits on an ornate couch. Wears a shabby 
           suit. Looks disheveled. And almost weary from boredom.

           This is MARLON BRANDO.

           Marlon is on a theatre stage. Acting in a 1947 production of 
           Jean Cocteau’s THE EAGLE HAS TWO HEADS. Playing the part of 
           the assassin.

           A FEMALE VOICE drones on in the background.

           Marlon yawns. Picks his nose. Looks at the booger. Flicks it.

           LAUGHTER.

           Marlon farts.

           UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. Broken by...

                                 FEMALE VOICE
                        How dare you!

           TALLULAH BANKHEAD (mids 40s) comes toward Marlon. Eyes full 
           of hate and rage.

           Tallulah grabs Marlon’s chin. Marlon slaps Tallulah’s hand 
           away. She grabs his chin again. He slaps it away. All this 
           nice slapstick to the audience’s delight.

           Tallulah grabs Marlon’s hand. Puts it around her waist. 
           Brings herself close. Kisses him. Passionately. In spite of 
           Marlon’s dead fish response.

                                 MARLON
                        The Queen’s been drinking.

           The audience bursts into HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER.

           Tallulah looks toward the audience. Back to Marlon. Takes a 
           deep breath. And, over the laughter, returns to her 
           monologue.

           INT. THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Marlon enters an extremely dirty, cluttered dressing room. 
           Starts to change out of his costume. When...

           Tallulah enters. Her anger stopped as she sees a half naked 
           Marlon.
                                 TALLULAH
                        I will give you one last chance.

           Tallulah grabs Marlon by the waist. Brings him close.

                                 TALLULAH (CONT’D)
                        Fuck me. And you keep your job.

           Tallulah kisses Marlon. While her hand goes to his crotch. 

           Marlon pulls free. Sits down on a nearby chair in front of a 
           desk with a mirror and a bottle of mouthwash.

                                 TALLULAH (CONT’D)
                        Explain yourself.

           Marlon opens the desk drawer. He pulls out a faded letter. It 
           reads: “SOBER UP OR LEAVE. MARLON SENIOR.”

                                 MARLON
                        Sad drunk women turn me off.

                                 TALLULAH
                        You insolent little shit.

           Tallulah storms out of the room. Leaving Marlon to himself 
           and the letter he’s pulled out of the desk.

           Marlon opens the bottle of mouthwash. Takes a swig. Starts to 
           gargle. Looks at himself in the mirror as his eyes tear up.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (slurred sing-song)
                        Beat the drum slowly. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S CHILDHOOD HOME - BATHROOM - NIGHT - 1932

           Marlon (8) looks at himself in the mirror. Cheeks puffed out 
           with mouthwash. Swishing it. Eyes tearing up from the 
           alcoholic burn. As...

           DOROTHY BRANDO (33) sits on the bathroom floor next to the 
           toilet. Her face a mask of inebriated weariness. Vomit on her 
           blouse. She continues drunkenly singing.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Play the --
                             (hiccup)
                        -- fife low--
                             (hiccup)
                        -- lowly.
           Marlon spits out the mouthwash.

                                 MARLON
                        Just like that.

           Marlon pours a little mouthwash in a glass. Extends it toward 
           Dorothy.

                                 DOROTHY
                        All I wanted was to act. And his 
                        love. And --

                                 MARLON
                             (imitating a doctor’s 
                              tone)
                        Open up, Mrs. Brando. Let Doctor 
                        Brando’s medicine help you feel 
                        better.

                                 DOROTHY
                             (ignores Marlon)
                        And all I get are the bruises and 
                        the pain and him out with whores. 
                        Oh, Bud. All I ever wanted was the 
                        magic. Is this it? Is this love? Is 
                        it --

           Dorothy hiccups. She catches herself from vomiting. She looks 
           toward Marlon, who continues to hold the cup of mouthwash. He 
           looks confused and innocent. She obligingly grabs the cup.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        You gotta believe in the magic. No 
                        matter what. Believe in the magic 
                        at all costs.

           Dorothy takes the mouthwash and swishes it in her mouth.

                                 MARLON
                             (still in doctor’s voice)
                        Very good. Mrs. Brando. Now if 
                        you’re good, you get some --

           Dorothy suddenly spits the mouthwash out onto Marlon’s face. 
           He stares back as the mouthwash drip down his face.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m sorry. I’m...I’m...

           Dorothy sticks her head into the toilet and vomits.

           After some retching, Dorothy leans back against the wall. She 
           pats the ground next to her.
           Marlon sits next to Dorothy and curls up into her. She passes 
           out next to him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY - PRESENT DAY

           Marlon walks onto the streets. It’s 1947 Boston. Men in 
           business attire bustle about the street. 

           Marlon couldn’t look more different. Now wearing a Woolworth 
           jacket, raggedy jeans, dirty white tee shirt. The garb of a 
           poor, out-of-work actor.

           Marlon enters a Western Union office across the street.

           INT. WESTERN UNION - DAY

           Marlon goes to the Clerk at the counter.

                                 MARLON
                        I got a message to send to the 
                        residence of Marlon Brando Senior. 
                        Libertyville, Illinois.

                                 CLERK
                        Message?

                                 MARLON
                        Mom. Tallulah Bankhead’s a lousy 
                        piece of untalented shit. Hope the 
                        worst for her. More when I return 
                        to New York. Love, Bud.

           EXT. BOSTON - DAY

           Marlon exits the Western Union.

           Marlon grabs a NEW YORK TIMES from a newsstand. Goes to a 
           nearby phone booth.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

           Marlon is on the phone. 

                                 MARLON
                        I’m on my way back. Get Russell 
                        cleaned up. Let’s have a party.
           Marlon opens up the paper to an article with a headline: 
           “HOLLYWOOD ON BROADWAY: Irene Selznick Promises Big Star for 
           Tennessee Williams’ Streetcar”. The byline reads, “Harold 
           Clurman”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS - IRENE SELZNICK’S HOME - BACKYARD - DAY

           ELIA KAZAN reclines in a pool chair next to a pool. Wears 
           only a swimsuit. Revealing his tan, lean body. 

           The pool is on Irene Selznick’s Beverly Hills palatial 
           property.

           Elia stares intently at the NEW YORK TIMES. Open to the same 
           article Marlon was reading.

           The giddy squeal of children playing causes Elia to look 
           toward the pool. He sees...

           His wife, MOLLY KAZAN, (40) plays with their older children, 
           CHRIS (8) and JUDY (11). She senses she’s being watched. 
           Looks toward Elia. Smiles. 

           Elia smiles back. Then returns to the TIMES. 

           Elia’s POV reveals a letter hidden by the newspaper. There’s 
           a lipstick kiss near the name, CONSTANCE. It reads: “I’M 
           WAITING FOR YOU IN NEW YORK. LOVE, CONSTANCE.”

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Everyone’s waiting in the screening 
                        room.

           Elia looks up to see...IRENE SELZNICK, (40), pretty, petite, 
           dressed in casual clothing rich as her surroundings.

                                 IRENE
                        But I would like to have a chat 
                        first.

           Elia gives her a vague smile. Waits for her to speak.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                             (to Molly)
                        Why does Elia smile like that?

                                 MOLLY
                        They all smile like that.

                                 IRENE
                        Who’s they?
                                 MOLLY
                        Anatolian Greeks. He’s got an 
                        Anatolian smile. Like his father.

           Elia cocks his head at Molly’s comment. Looks toward her. 

                                 IRENE
                             (to Molly)
                        Tell your Anatolian he’d better 
                        come inside quick if he wants to 
                        keep his job.

           Irene walks back toward the house. Leaving Elia looking at 
           Molly. But before he speaks...

                                 CHRIS
                        Monster attack!

           Chris shoots up from below the water. Onto Molly’s back. 
           Pulls her down. Under the water.

           Elia laughs. Stands. Walks to the house.

           INT. SELZNICK’S HOUSE - PARLOR ROOM - DAY

           Irene and Elia sit opposite each other in an elegantly 
           decorated parlor room. Complete with portraits of Irene’s 
           father and ex-husband, respectively: LOUIS B. MAYER and DAVID 
           O. SELZNICK.

                                 IRENE
                        My father says I’ve already given 
                        up too much to Tennessee’s wishes. 
                        And that --

                                 ELIA
                        Your father works in Holly--

                                 IRENE
                        Created. My father created this 
                        town.

                                 ELIA
                             (obligingly)
                        Your father, Mr. Mayer, created 
                        Hollywood. Not Broadway.

                                 IRENE
                        Your point?

                                 ELIA
                        Broadway does things differently. 
                        It respects the writer.
                                 IRENE
                        To the point that the writer’s 
                        chosen director should get twenty 
                        percent returns and top billing?

           Elia smiles. Giving his answer with silence.

                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        You act as if you’re unconcerned 
                        with the money.

                                 ELIA
                        Money isn’t why Tennessee fought 
                        for me.

                                 IRENE
                        Then for what purpose?

                                 ELIA
                        I believe Tennessee’s work is a 
                        masterpiece. That it represents a 
                        revolution in American theater. 
                        That we must be honest to its 
                        truth.

                                 IRENE
                        A cute artistic sentiment.

                                 ELIA
                        It’s not a sentiment.

                                 IRENE
                        When I called David about this 
                        matter. He told me producing Gone 
                        With the Wind taught him one thing.
                             (beat)
                        Truth. Money. Truth is money. Money 
                        is truth.

                                 ELIA
                        Christ.

                                 IRENE
                             (ignores Elia)
                        Money must be made. That is the 
                        bottom line. And, as I see it, 
                        which is how you will see it, 
                        casting an established star like 
                        John Garfield as Stanley Kowalski 
                        will ensure the bottom line and 
                        healthy returns. Or else I will 
                        make certain that you never work in 
                        this town again.
           Irene gives Elia a cold stare.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SELZNICK’S HOUSE - SCREENING ROOM - LATER

           Everyone sits in Irene’s comfortable, smoke filled screening 
           room. Three couches face an ad hoc stage. 

           Irene sits on a couch by herself. 

           Elia sits next to HUME CRONYN.

           On the couch next to Elia and Hume sits TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, 
           in a suit and with his signature mustache, smoking a 
           cigarette. His handsome Mexican boyfriend, PANCHO, (early 
           20s), who stares intently at...

           JOHN GARFIELD. Playing Stanley in a scene with Blanche, 
           played by Hume’s wife, JESSICA TANDY. They stand in front of 
           a projection screen.

           John’s “Stanley” is perfectly acceptable. But, as he acts, 
           Elia seems to be elsewhere.

                                 HUME
                             (whispers)
                        What do you think?

           Elia looks toward Tennessee. Whose head falls back. Only to 
           snap to a moment later.

                                 ELIA
                        That Tennessee doesn’t think much 
                        of John.

           Tennessee whispers to Pancho. Pancho shouts in Spanish. 
           Storms out of the room. Interrupting the rehearsal.

           Tennessee pauses a moment. Finishes his cigarette.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Apologies. Continue.

           John and Jessica continue. Elia leans back in the couch. 

           EXT. SELZNICK’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER

           Elia finds Tennessee putting Pancho into an awaiting car.

                                 ELIA
                        Tennessee.
           Tennessee closes the door. Turns to Elia.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Is everything all right?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What do you mean?

           Elia nods toward Pancho.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        My little Don Juan got jealous.

                                 ELIA
                        Of what?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I told him that John probably had 
                        one of those wonderful equestrian 
                        dongs.
                             (laughs)
                        To think that would make a man --

                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        Gentlemen! We’ve John’s contract to 
                        discuss.

           Elia and Tennessee look back to see Irene standing in the 
           front doorway. Tennessee waves to Irene.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Irene said the cutest thing while 
                        we were waiting for you.

                                 ELIA
                        I can’t imagine.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        She said that if I didn’t follow 
                        her on this matter of casting. 
                        She’d ruin you. And she’d make sure 
                        this play never saw an opening 
                        curtain.

                                 PANCHO
                             (from inside; in Spanish)
                        Come, my little butterfly.

           Tennessee opens the door.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Pancho and I are going to 
                        Provincetown. I’ll let you handle 
                        Irene.
           Tennessee gets in the car.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        All I ask. Is that you find me 
                        someone that understands Stanley. 
                        That doesn’t think him a black-dyed 
                        villain.

           Tennessee gives a wave as it drives away.

                                 IRENE
                        Chop chop, Elia. We must talk 
                        contracts before you leave.

           Elia turns. Walks somberly back to Irene.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRAIN - ELIA’S CABIN - NIGHT

           Molly and Elia sit across from each other in a small train 
           cabin. Molly has the NEW YORK TIMES open. Elia holds their 
           recently born daughter, KATHERINE, while he reads what appear 
           to be legal documents.

                                 MOLLY
                        How was John?

                                 ELIA
                             (without looking up)
                        Good. But his contract’s going to 
                        make it impossible.

           Molly looks toward Elia. Notes his brooding look.

                                 MOLLY
                        Is something troubling you?

           Elia looks up to Molly with a smile.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Is it what I said about your smile? 
                        I was joking when I said that. You 
                        know I didn’t --

                                 ELIA
                        No. No. It’s not that.

           Molly raises an eyebrow to say, “Then what?”
                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m just deeply troubled by how 
                        happy I am. Being here with the 
                        kids. And you.

           After a pause, Molly laughs. Elia, too.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh, shut up. And tell me what’s 
                        troubling you.

                                 ELIA
                        Irene wants a star. I don’t. And 
                        she told Tennessee if he doesn’t 
                        fire me, she’d make sure the play 
                        was never produced.

                                 MOLLY
                        What did Tennessee say?

                                 ELIA
                        Find him Stanley. Someone that 
                        doesn’t think him to be a black-
                        dyed villain. Whatever that means.

                                 MOLLY
                        You know what he means.

                                 ELIA
                        Do I?

           Molly looks directly at Elia, who has returned to the 
           contract.

                                 MOLLY
                        He means the kind of man that 
                        destroys you. But you keep loving. 
                        In spite of the cruelty. Bruises. 
                        Torment. He gives you a burning, 
                        naked desire for agony.

           Elia looks up at Molly. Their eyes lock.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Surely you must know someone.
                             (off Elia’s silence)
                        Or perhaps Harold and Stella have 
                        some ideas.

           Molly returns to the paper.
                                 ELIA
                        You read what he wrote in the 
                        paper. Harold thinks I’ve sold out. 
                        I hardly think he’ll want to help.

                                 MOLLY
                        He’s blowing hot steam.
                             (off Elia’s silence)
                        Just go speak with them. They must 
                        know someone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - STELLA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Marlon looks up the side of a quiet, dark apartment building. 
           An Indian motorcycle parked behind him.

           Marlon cups his mouth with his hands.

                                 MARLON
                        Stella! Hey, Stella!
                             (beat)
                        Stella!

           Finally. A light comes on in an apartment. The window opens. 
           STELLA ADLER (40s) pokes her head out.

                                 STELLA
                        Why aren’t you in Boston?

                                 MARLON
                        Tallulah Bankhead tried to fuck me. 
                        So I quit.

                                 STELLA
                        Quit or fired?

                                 MARLON
                        What’s it matter? I’m here now. Is 
                        Ellen up there?

                                 STELLA
                        She’s asleep.

           Marlon looks to the next window. A light quickly goes on and 
           off. 

                                 MARLON
                        I’ll come by tomorrow.

           Stella’s already closed the window before Marlon’s finished. 
           The lights are again out. Only now...
           ELLEN ADLER (21) stands in the front entrance doorway. She 
           has a subtle beauty. More je ne se quais than obvious beauty.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Hello there, beautiful.

           Stella’s light comes back on. Marlon runs to the front door. 
           Just out of Stella’s view.

                                 STELLA
                        Marlon. Are you out there? I heard 
                        your voice. Are you there?

                                 MARLON
                             (mock old man’s voice)
                        Go to bed, you damned old hag!

                                 STELLA
                        Who said that? Who said --

                                 MARLON
                             (same voice)
                        To bed. Or I’ll call the cops on 
                        you.

           Stella slams the window. Marlon and Ellen run to his 
           motorcycle.

           Marlon cautiously pulls out into traffic heading downtown. 

           EXT. MANHATTAN - AMSTERDAM AVENUE - NIGHT

           Marlon drives with Ellen wrapped around his waist. His 
           driving is careful if not overly so. Taxis and other cars 
           drive much faster. One taxi honks as it nearly clips them.

           Marlon gives the cab the finger as Ellen’s hand goes down to 
           Marlon’s crotch.

           Marlon swerves. Nearly smashing into another passing taxicab.

           Marlon rebalances the motorcycle.

                                 MARLON
                        Are you crazy?

                                 ELLEN
                        Just excited.

                                 MARLON
                        For what?
           Ellen whispers into Marlon’s ear. He pulls off onto a side 
           street. And...

           EXT. MANHATTAN - ALLEY - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen are having at it. Against a building wall. 
           Behind a dumpster.

           Just as Ellen pulls Marlon’s hair. And opens her mouth...

                                 MALE VOICE (V.O.)
                             (stern, gruff voice)
                        You dumb son of a bitch!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen stop as they enter his apartment to the 
           crowd’s delight. It’s a small, dirty flea stricken New York 
           apartment. (As one might guess from Marlon’s clothing.)

           The apartment’s packed with friends. Most of the friends are 
           of the bohemian sort. Poor, struggling thespians. 

           Then, from the midst of the festive crowd...

                                 MALE VOICE
                             (stern, gruff voice)
                        Let me get a look at you.

           Marlon’s smile instantly slackens. But the smile returns just 
           as instantly. As Marlon sees his roommate...

           WALLY COX (24), tall and bespectacled but with an athletic 
           build, emerges with a drink in hand. Their pet raccoon, 
           RUSSELL, on his shoulder. 

                                 MARLON
                        I hate it when you imitate my 
                        father.

           Russell jumps off Wally’s shoulder. Runs to Marlon. Who 
           happily kisses him. 

           Wally finishes his drink. Throws the glass down. Hugs Marlon 
           then holds him at arms length.

                                 WALLY
                             (again in stern voice; 
                              loudly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALLY (CONT'D)
                        Everyone quiet. The asshole’s going 
                        to tell us how he got fired?

           Marlon whispers into Wally’s ear. Wally begins to laugh. The 
           crowd leaning in. Eager to hear.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        He wouldn’t fuck Tallulah Bankhead.

           Everyone laughs.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        And why wouldn’t you?

                                 MARLON
                        Cause I got my everything, 
                        anything, and only thing right 
                        here.

           Marlon brings Ellen close to him. Kisses her. Roaring cheers. 
           The party resumes. 

           Wally wanders off back into the crowd. Russell on his 
           shoulder.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                             (to Ellen)
                        Dance?

                                 ELLEN
                        You know I don’t know --

           Marlon disappears before Ellen can finish. The jazz suddenly 
           cuts off. A Tito Puente mambo song starts. 

           The crowd begins to part. Revealing...

           Marlon moves to the rhythm. Eyes closed. Hands clapping to 
           the beat. Obvious sensuality. Not only to Ellen. But to every 
           man and woman in the room. All eyes are on him.

           Marlon opens his eyes. Looks directly at Ellen. Comes in 
           close to her. Draws her tight. Guides her to the rhythm. 

           Ellen’s a bit clumsy at first. But starts to move fluidly. 
           Submitting to Marlon’s lead.

           Ellen closes her eyes. This is the closest thing to Heaven. 
           And Marlon is delighted until he meets eyes with a pretty, 
           dark haired collegiate girl, BECKY (19).

           Becky lustfully stares at Marlon. Hips swaying. To his 
           rhythm. Her stare and body language telegraphing her desire.
           Marlon and Ellen finish their dance. With Ellen opening her 
           eyes to see Marlon looking past her.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           Marlon doesn’t respond. Continues to look toward Becky.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Did you hear me?

           Marlon smiles at Ellen. Gives her a long kiss.

                                 MARLON
                        I’ll be right back.

           Ellen watches Marlon disappear into the crowd. Greeting both 
           men and women along the way toward Becky.

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        What’s this pretty little girl so 
                        worried about?

           Ellen turns to Wally and Russell looking at her. Upon seeing 
           his big, drunk smile, she laughs. But her face still a bit 
           troubled.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

           Elia’s in the bathroom. Looking at himself in the mirror. As 
           he also looks at...a picture that hangs on the wall reflected 
           in the mirror.

           The framed picture is a kind of thespian class photo of what 
           is now the famed GROUP THEATER. 

           Younger faces of the likes...JOHN GARFIELD, STELLA ADLER, 
           HAROLD CLURMAN, CLIFFORD ODETS...

           But Elia focuses in on one young man...YOUNG ELIA...a face 
           far less sculpted by years of stress.

           Elia hears a knock at the door.

                                 ELIA
                        One moment.

           Elia runs the water for a second. Dries his hands.
           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

           Elia walks out of the bathroom. To see...Ellen. Her eyes red 
           from tears.

                                 ELIA
                        What’s the matter?

           Ellen quickly enters the bathroom. Closes the door. Leaving 
           Elia a bit mystified. As he walks toward the sound of an 
           argument...

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Stella and Stella’s husband and NEW YORK TIMES theater 
           critic, HAROLD CLURMAN, (early 50s), sit at the dining room 
           table. In the middle of an argument.

                                 HAROLD
                        -- and I wrote the article because 
                        I firmly believe Broadway and 
                        Hollywood shouldn’t mix.

                                 STELLA
                        Oh, shut up. And stop acting like a 
                        pompous asshole. Elia’s success is 
                        success for the Group and --

                                 HAROLD
                        He whored himself for a buck. To --

           Elia quietly enters. He sits at the table. He nods for them 
           to continue, obviously having heard what Harold’s said.

                                 STELLA
                             (to Elia)
                        I’m sorry for our bickering. We’re 
                        supportive no matter what you’re 
                        doing in Hollywood. Or what Harold 
                        says. We all want the same thing. 
                        Don’t we?

           Elia nods.

                                 HAROLD
                        I will say this much, Elia. Should 
                        you mess this production up. Should 
                        you bring in a star. To make a 
                        mockery of Broadway because of some 
                        Hollywood producer. I will make it 
                        my life’s obsession to see to it 
                        that you never work on Broadway 
                        again.
           Elia smiles diplomatically. Tactfully changes the subject.

                                 ELIA
                        Ellen’s crying.

                                 STELLA
                             (disdainful)
                        She’s had her heart broken again. 
                        By her boyfriend.

                                 HAROLD
                             (spiteful)
                        Marlon Brando.

                                 ELIA
                        Marlon Brando? Why does that name 
                        sound familiar?

                                 STELLA
                        He’s one of my pupils. An 
                        incredibly talented young actor.

                                 HAROLD
                        If by talent you mean an 
                        unprincipled shit. Then, yes, he’s -
                        -

                                 STELLA
                        Sensitive.

                                 HAROLD
                        You say that even after the 
                        bastard’s again destroyed your 
                        daughter.

                                 ELIA
                        What happened?

                                 HAROLD
                        He came by the other night 
                        hollering for Stella. Stole Ellen 
                        away only to return her after 
                        turning on an emotional spigot that 
                        hasn’t turned off for three days. 
                        And that doesn’t even begin to 
                        address the stage antics. He 
                        doesn’t follow directions and won’t 
                        say a line without mumbling. He’s a 
                        brute. An insensitive brute that 
                        makes a girl want him by tearing 
                        her apart. The nerve --

                                 ELIA
                        Where can I find him?
           Harold gives Elia a look that says, “You can’t be serious.” 

           Elia stares back at him. Serious as can be.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BECKY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Marlon sleeps fitfully. In the middle of a large bed. Set in 
           an ornate bed frame. In a handsomely furnished bedroom.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S CHILDHOOD HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - 1936

           An empty, middle class living room. Decorated with furniture 
           that would denote a middle class lifestyle in the 1930s.
           Then, in from the front door, comes...

           Marlon (now 13) dragging an inebriated Dorothy (now 38) into 
           the living room. Puts her onto the couch.

           Marlon stands across from her. Starts to imitate a cow. Then 
           a chicken.

           Dorothy laughs. But her smile quickly fades.

                                 MARLON
                             (John Waynesque voice)
                        How ‘bout a cowboy song there, 
                        Pretty Little Miss?

                                 DOROTHY
                             (charmed)
                        Oh my. A handsome cowboy. How ‘bout 
                        “Streets of Laredo”?

           Marlon starts to sing “Streets of Laredo”. Still in a John 
           Waynesque voice. Which Dorothy hums along, too. Her eyelids 
           slowly drooping. Her voice trailing off. As Marlon, caught up 
           in the act, continues to sing, only stopping as...

           MARLON SENIOR (42), stern, military looking man, enters. 
           Stands. Sways. A bit drunk himself. Looks at Marlon. Then at 
           Dorothy.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t stop, mister cowboy. Don’t 
                        stop. I almost forgot that mean old 
                        bastard I got for a husband.
           Marlon looks to Marlon Senior. Who shakes his head. Mumbling, 
           “Worthless faggot,” to himself, as he leaves the living room.

           Marlon starts to sing again. Shakily. As he watches Marlon 
           Senior leave the room. Then turns back to Dorothy to see...

           Dorothy’s passed out. The scotch spilled next to her. Over 
           her dress and the couch.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BECKY’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

           Becky enters. A tray of food in hand. Sets the tray down on 
           the bed. Gently wakes Marlon. Who opens his eyes. Jumps with 
           surprise.

                                 BECKY
                        Sounded like you were having a 
                        nightmare.

           Draws the black-out shades to reveal...a spectacular view 
           from an Upper East Side Central Park adjacent penthouse.

                                 MARLON
                        I was.

           Marlon’s succinctness cuts Becky short.

                                 BECKY
                        Have some --

           Becky stops as she sees...Marlon has already started to 
           devour the breakfast.

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        -- food. Enjoying it?

           Marlon looks up to Becky. Mouth full. Oranje juice in one 
           hand. Coffee in the other.

                                 MARLON
                             (with mouth full)
                        The best.

                        How’s a guy like me land a bird 
                        like you?

                                 BECKY
                        I was fucking Wally to get to you.
                             (off Marlon’s silence)

                        You don’t tell a girl that you live 
                        with a star and not expect her to 
                        do something like this.

                                 MARLON
                        I’m not a star. Just an out of work 
                        actor. That hates acting.

                                 BECKY
                        Why would you hate it?

                                 MARLON
                        Same reason my dad hates it. It’s a 
                        foolish thing for a man to be 
                        doing. Playing around all day. Damn 
                        right foolish. And I mumble. On 
                        stage. Not sure why I do it. But I 
                        do. Soon as the lights hit me. 
                        Mumble. Mumble. Mumble. Mumble.

                                 BECKY
                        It doesn’t sound like it’s acting 
                        you hate.

           Becky picks up Marlon’s clothes. Throws them onto the bed.

                                 MARLON
                        What’re these for?

                                 BECKY
                        Getting you back to that girl of 
                        yours.

           As Marlon starts to dress, Becky stares.

                                 BECKY (CONT’D)
                        Mm. Mm. Mm. What a lucky girl.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - GREENWICH VILLAGE - MARLON’S APARTMENT 
           BUILDING - DAY

           Elia walks up to Marlon’s apartment building. A large, manila 
           envelope in hand. Searches for a buzzer.

           Elia takes a step back out. Notes the address again. Tries 
           the building entrance. It’s open.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Elia knocks on Marlon’s apartment door. 
           THUDS and EXPLETIVES can be heard through the door. Only to 
           be followed by a...THUD against the door.

           Elia jumps back a moment. As the door opens to reveal...

           Russell staring up at him. And also...

           Wally in his underwear. Taller and more athletic than Elia... 

           Elia, Russell, and Wally look at each other strangely. Wally 
           squints because...

           Wally’s POV: Kazan is a myopic blur.

                        Is this Marlon Brando’s apartment?

                        Whatever he’s done. I’ve got 
                        nothing to do with it.

                                 ELIA
                        I’m just --

                                 WALLY
                        And I haven’t seen him for three 
                        days. I haven’t the foggiest idea 
                        where he is.

           Elia sighs. In disbelief at the situation.

                                 ELIA
                        Please give this to him.

           Elia hands Wally the manila envelope. Walks away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY

           Harold writes at a desk in a tastefully but simply decorated 
           study. Then...

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Ellen!

           Harold ignores Marlon. Continues writing.
                                 MARLON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (muffled)
                        Ellen!

           Harold stops writing. Rubs his temples. Evidently, this isn’t 
           the first time with Marlon. He rises.

           EXT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Marlon is about to yell again. When...Harold opens the 
           window.’

                                 MARLON
                        Harold. Let me --

                                 HAROLD
                        Stop screaming like a lunatic. And 
                        leave us alone.

                                 MARLON
                        But I need to see Ellen.

           Marlon looks toward Ellen’s window. Sees she’s looking down 
           at him.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Ellen. Come on. Will you let me up?

           Ellen closes her blind. Marlon returns to Harold. But doesn’t 
           say anything. Because...

           Harold has closed the window. 

           Marlon kicks the ground. Starts downtown.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - OFFICE - DAY

           Elia sits at a desk in a sparsely furnished office. A piece 
           of paper in his hand. Across from Elia is his set designer, 
           JO MIELZINER (47). Who points at sketches of what will become 
           the STREETCAR stage set.

           Elia listens to Mielziner. While his finger seems to trace 
           something on the piece of paper.

                                 MIELZINER
                        I thought we’d keep it simple. 
                        Small, cramped. Something that --

           The phone rings. Elia ignores it. Nods for Mielziner to go 
           on.
                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        Yes. As I was saying, something 
                        that --

           The phone rings. This time Mielziner answers it.

                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        Hello...who is it...Irene 
                        Selznick...do I accept?
                             (off Elia’s head shake)
                        Yes. I accept.

           Elia buries his head in his hands.

                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        Hello Irene...no...it’s Jo 
                        Mielziner...yes...very good...set 
                        is coming along 
                        splendidly...Elia...no...he’s out 
                        right now...yes...fine...will send 
                        along the message.

           Mielziner hangs up the phone.

                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        Garfield’s out --

                                 ELIA
                        Excellent.

                                 MIELZINER
                        -- and she’ll be in town tomorrow. 
                        For an audition with Burt 
                        Lancaster.

           Elia sighs.

                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        What? Lancaster’s good.

           Elia checks the clock on the wall.

                                 ELIA
                        I should get home to Molly and the 
                        kids.

           Elia puts down the piece of paper. We see now it’s the letter 
           from Constance. Mielziner also sees the letter. And before 
           Elia leaves...

                                 MIELZINER
                        You forgot something.
           Mielziner nods to Constance’s letter on the desk. Elia grabs 
           it.

                                 MIELZINER (CONT’D)
                        Send Molly my regards.

           Elia nods. Leaves. Mielziner returns to the sketches and 
           blueprints.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Marlon enters the apartment to find...Wally asleep on the 
           cot. The STREETCAR manuscript splayed out on his chest.

           Russell runs up to Marlon. Jumps on his shoulder.

                                 MARLON
                        Hey ya, pal. What do you say we get 
                        some food?

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon goes to the refrigerator. Opens it...

           The refrigerator is empty. Except for a loaf of bread and 
           peanut butter.

           Marlon grabs the peanut butter. And the bread. Starts to 
           withdraw them. When...

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                             (Marlon Senior’s voice)
                        You’re an awfully lucky son of a 
                        bitch, Bud.

           Marlon jumps. And drops the peanut butter. Shattering the 
           jar. Spreading peanut butter everywhere.

                                 MARLON
                        God damnit. Now I got nothing to 
                        eat.

           Wally holds up the STREETCAR manuscript. Is about to speak. 
           But Marlon gets in first.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        A play? That’s what I was just 
                        saying today. It isn’t respectable. 
                        The lifestyle we got. Acting. 
                        Just...just --

           Marlon opens the refrigerator. To emphasize the point.
                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        -- we got no food. We got no jobs. 
                        I fucked up with Ellen. Again. I 
                        mean. Look at us. In squalor. In 
                        hunger. The other day I looked at a 
                        shoe. And wondered how it would 
                        taste. Jesus, Wally. A man 
                        shouldn’t wonder how a shoe tastes. 
                        But here I am. Wondering. Thinking 
                        if I don’t get something soon, I’ll 
                        be eating shoes. Or, worse. Wearing 
                        a suit in an office. Wally. I can’t 
                        eat leather. And I hate suits. If 
                        we don’t --

           Wally shakes the STREETCAR manuscript.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Damnit, Wally! Put that down. Can’t 
                        you see I’m having a nervous 
                        breakdown?

                                 WALLY
                             (reads Elia’s note)
                        Marlon. Stella Adler gave me your 
                        address. I would like for you to 
                        read Tennessee’s new play. For the 
                        part of Stanley. And get back to me 
                        at the Barrymore Theater in two 
                        days. Sincerely, Elia Kazan.
                             (off Marlon’s non-
                              reaction)
                        This is biggest meal ticket two 
                        schmucks like us could ever hope 
                        for.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           Elia stands outside a brownstone. Buzzes an apartment. The 
           door buzzes. He enters.

           INT. CONSTANCE’S BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Elia stands in front of an apartment door. He pauses before 
           knocking. Instead, reaches up to a spot just above the door.

           A moment later, Elia finds a key. He unlocks the door. Enters 
           the apartment.
           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elia enters the apartment to find...the lights dimmed. A 
           sensual jazz record playing.

           Elia pauses for a moment. Taking in the apartment.

                                 CONSTANCE (O.S.)
                        I’m in the bedroom.

                                 ELIA
                        I’ll be right in.

           Elia picks up a nearby phone.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Molly Kazan, please...Molly...I’ll 
                        be home soon. Just tying up some 
                        loose ends.

           Elia hangs up. Walks toward the voice and...

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Elia enters the bedroom to find, CONSTANCE, (mid-20s) tall, 
           blond, and stunningly beautiful in a Japanese silk print 
           robe. She runs to Elia. Hugs and kisses him.

                                 CONSTANCE
                        My baby. I’ve been thinking about 
                        you. Constantly. Missing you. Since 
                        I read about you in the trades. 
                        About your film with Zanuck.
                        And...dear me. I’m nervous. I’m 
                        just rambling. Not having seen you 
                        in so long. And...and...

           Constance trails off. Noting Elia’s stare.

                                 CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
                        Is something the matter?

                                 ELIA
                        I just phoned Molly. To tell her 
                        that I’ll be home soon.

           Elia turns to leave. But stops at the sound of Constance’s 
           robe hitting the floor. Turns to see...a spectacle of perfect 
           female form.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Constance.
           Elia leaves. Constance stands. Not certain what to do.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia sits at the table with Chris, Judy, and Molly. There’s a 
           bit of a scowl on Elia’s face.

                                 CHRIS
                        What’s the matter, Daddy?

           Elia looks at Chris. Who smiles. Imitating Elia’s vague 
           smile. Judy starts to laugh.

                                 ELIA
                             (to Judy)
                        What’s so funny?

           Chris imitates Elia’s smile. It’s dead on.

                                 JUDY
                        Do the scowl.

           Chris’ face goes from vague smile to scowl.

                                 ELIA
                             (to Molly)
                        Is that really how I look?

           Molly, who’s been trying to contain her laughter, finally 
           breaks. Nods.

           Elia looks back to Chris. Who’s now back to his smile 
           imitation.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        What do you think of this, tough 
                        guy?

           Elia points a mock gun at Chris. At this, Chris puts his 
           hands up.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Now listen up or I’ll plug you. Got 
                        me?
                             (to Judy)
                        You, too, Missy.

           Judy plays along. Familiar with the game.
                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Now both of you go get cleaned up 
                        for bed. And don’t give this Dame 
                        or I any fuss. Got it?

           Chris and Judy nod. Start to get up.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        And give me a kiss.

           Chris and Judy oblige. Give Elia a good night hug and kiss.

           Molly watches all of this with a grin. Loving it. Very much a 
           happy woman. And Elia, smiling toward Molly, looking very 
           much the pleased husband and father.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elia lays in bed. STREETCAR manuscript and pen in hand. 
           Scribbling notes onto it. Looks up as...

           Molly enters. In contrast to Constance, she looks quite 
           plain. She wears a matronly robe and no makeup. She gets into 
           bed.

                                 MOLLY
                        Harold and Stella give you any 
                        ideas?

                                 MOLLY
                        Who?

                                 ELIA
                        Exactly why Irene will hate it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Have you got anyone else?

                                 ELIA
                        Irene wants Burt Lancaster.

           Molly begins to laugh. Elia does, too. After a moment, the 
           laughter fades. 

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Irene’s calling for my head. 
                        Harold’s trying to shut me out on 
                        Broadway.

                        And I don’t know if Tennessee will 
                        really support me if I stand up to 
                        Irene.

                                 MOLLY
                        Let me take your mind off of it.

           Molly kisses Elia. Unties her robe. Revealing a post-natal 
           body. Still with pregnancy weight.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                             (jokingly)
                        How do I compare to your mistress?

           Elia looks Molly over. Grabs her face. Brings her close.

                                 ELIA
                        She doesn’t begin to compare to 
                        you.

           Elia kisses Molly. She straddles him.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        But I’m tired. If we could --

                                 MOLLY
                        Yes. Yes.

           Molly gives Elia a kiss. Falls onto the bed next to Elia. Who 
           quickly falls asleep.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Stella sits across from Marlon. The manuscript is between 
           them.

                                 MARLON
                        I thought that you could read it. 
                        Help me with the audition. And --

           Stella raises an eyebrow.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 STELLA
                        You presume I haven’t?
                             (off Marlon’s quizzical 
                              look)
                        I am Stella Adler. Harold Clurman 
                        is my husband.

                        Authors don’t write a new play 
                        until we’ve read it first. Do you 
                        understand?

           Before Marlon answers, the sound of the front door opening is 
           heard.

                                 ELLEN
                        Hello.

                                 STELLA
                             (sly smile)
                        In the dining room, honey.

           Ellen walks into the room a moment later. She’s dolled up. 
           Confident and happy. But all that fades very quickly as she 
           sees Marlon.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Marlon just came by to apologize.

           Ellen doesn’t answer. Instead turns. Goes back out the front 
           door.

           Marlon stands. Shoots Stella a hard glance. Then chases after 
           Ellen. Out onto...

           EXT. MANHATTAN - STELLA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Marlon bursts out onto the street. Looks around.

           Ellen walks briskly in the direction of Central Park.

           Marlon runs after her. 

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - COLUMBUS CIRCLE - NIGHT

           Marlon chases after Ellen.

                                 MARLON
                        Ellen!

           Ellen goes into Central Park. Marlon follows after...

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SHEEP’S MEADOW - NIGHT

           Ellen continues to walk ahead of Marlon.
                                 MARLON
                        I don’t mean to do these things. 
                        It’s only human. To follow my whims 
                        and do things that aren’t the --

           Ellen stops.

                                 ELLEN
                        You got some way of apologizing.

           Marlon looks surprised.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 MARLON
                        You stopped. I didn’t think you 
                        would. I was chasing you so long. I 
                        didn’t think that --

           Ellen raises an eyebrow. Giving Marlon his opportunity.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I just...I...I just...I hate that I 
                        hurt you.

           Marlon stares at Ellen. The look breaking Ellen down moment 
           by moment. 

                                 ELLEN
                        I want to slap you.

                                 MARLON
                        You know you don’t want to do that.

           Marlon gives Ellen the opportunity to prove him otherwise. 
           She doesn’t move. He puts his hand to her face. She nuzzles 
           up to it.

                                 ELLEN
                        Why do you do this to me?

           Marlon takes Ellen’s hand. Leads her out of the park.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen go into a bar.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           Marlon takes Ellen to a booth.
           Marlon goes to the bar. Orders. Comes back to the booth. Sets 
           down two drinks.

           One of the drinks is a quarter pint of whiskey. The other is 
           a quarter pint of vodka.

                                 MARLON
                        My mother drank whiskey. My father 
                        drank vodka.

           Marlon drinks the whiskey in one long gulp. He reaches for 
           the vodka. Ellen reaches out to stop him. Marlon shakes off 
           her hand.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        And they showed me as a kid what 
                        happens when you mix liquors. How 
                        they always fight. No matter who’s 
                        around. And how that fight doesn’t 
                        leave you.

           Marlon takes back the half pint of vodka. Looks at Ellen. His 
           eyes already set with a drunken gaze.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I wrote my mother. Every week when 
                        I came out here. Begging her to get 
                        away. From the booze. From the 
                        fighting. To the son that loved 
                        her. That we could be together. I 
                        wanted it so bad. Through so many 
                        unanswered letters.

           Ellen draws Marlon down into the booth with her hand. She 
           holds him.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        You got a lovesick mutt. With a 
                        heart that drives him mad. And the 
                        pedigree of two drunks. Is that 
                        what you want?

           Ellen covers Marlon with kisses.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - 1941

           Marlon (18) sits across from Marlon Senior and Dorothy.

           Marlon Senior cuts hard into his steak. Stabs it with a fork. 
           Brings it to his mouth. Masticates. Mouth open. While he 
           scans a piece of paper on the table. 
                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Flat foot. I should’ve figured. Not 
                        fit for service. Big surprise.

           Marlon says nothing. A bit disgusted by Marlon Senior’s table 
           manners, who’s returned to eating.

           Marlon looks to Dorothy. Who says nothing. But drinks from a 
           coffee cup.

                                 MARLON SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        You’ll come in tomorrow. I’ll 
                        introduce you around. And see if I 
                        can --

                                 MARLON
                        I’m going to New York.

           Marlon Senior chews his steak. Doesn’t say anything. 
           Continues to chew.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I said that I’m going to --

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        We’ll find you work at the company. 
                        You’ll start on the sales end. 
                        Traveling. Eventually. Some day. 
                        You’ll move to executive with me 
                        and --

                                 MARLON
                        I don’t want to work at the 
                        company.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        -- and maybe by that time I’ll have 
                        gotten enough funding to start my 
                        own --

                                 MARLON
                        I’m moving to New York.

           Marlon Senior sets down his silverware.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        What do you intend to do there? 
                        Waste your time acting like your 
                        sister?

                                 MARLON
                        I don’t know. I just --
                                 MARLON SENIOR
                             (ignores Marlon)
                        You’re my son, God damnit! I won’t 
                        have my son prancing around like 
                        one of those fags at the local 
                        theater. Making a fool of yourself. 
                        Throwing your life away like your 
                        mother and --

                                 DOROTHY
                        Stop.

           Marlon Senior looks toward Dorothy. With burning rage. Picks 
           up her cup of coffee. Takes a sip.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Thought you’d have to be drunk to 
                        interrupt me when --

                                 DOROTHY
                        I didn’t mean --

           Marlon Senior suddenly slaps Dorothy. Who abides the slap 
           with hardly a tear.

           Marlon Senior goes to slap her again. But before he 
           can...Marlon grabs his hand.

           Marlon Senior stares at his now fully grown son. They stand 
           nearly eye-to-eye.

           Marlon makes to give Marlon Senior a haymaker. Marlon Senior 
           blocks it. And...

           Slaps Marlon. Who falls to the ground. 

           Marlon Senior slaps Marlon again. And again. Until...

           Dorothy finally intervenes. Pulling Marlon Senior away...

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

           Marlon Senior slaps Dorothy again. Storms out of the room. 

           Dorothy rushes out after him.

                                 STELLA (V.O.)
                        Wake up. Marlon.
           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - ELLEN’S ROOM - MORNING

           Marlon sleeps in Ellen’s bed. The STREETCAR manuscript is 
           open on his face. Next to Ellen. Who’s wrapped up close to 
           him. 

           Stella’s at the foot of the bed.

                                 STELLA
                        Time to get up. We’ve got work to 
                        do.

           Marlon and Ellen continue to sleep.

           Stella slaps the soles of Marlon’s feet. Marlon finally 
           wakes.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        It seems your apology went well.

           Marlon sits upright.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Get dressed.

           Stella leaves. Marlon stumbles from the bed. Dresses. Kisses 
           Ellen goodbye.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - MORNING

           Stella and Marlon walk through Central Park. 

           The contrast is stark between them. Stella dressed sharply as 
           a Hollywood icon out for a stroll. Marlon still in the dirty 
           rags he wore home from Boston.

                                 STELLA
                        What do you think of Blanche?

                                 MARLON
                        I love her.

                                 STELLA
                        And Stanley?

                                 MARLON
                        He’s a vile brute.

                                 STELLA
                        Vile? Brute?
                                 MARLON
                        What else is he?

                                 STELLA
                        Just a man. Like your father.

           Marlon shoots Stella a sharp look.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Would he stand for a woman like 
                        Blanche?
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        Well?

           Stella and Marlon arrive outside the Metropolitan Museum of 
           Art. Marlon looks around. Instead of answering the 
           question...

                                 MARLON
                        What’re we doing here?

                                 STELLA
                        I’m going to show you Stanley.

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

           Marlon and Stella sit in front of Vincent van Gogh’s A Pair 
               of Shoes. It is a simple painting of a pair of beat up work 
           boots on the floor.

                                 STELLA
                        That’s Stanley.

           Marlon looks at Stella. Then back at the painting. Clearly 
           confused.

                                 MARLON
                        All I see are shoes.

                                 STELLA
                        Van Gogh’s shoes express the 
                        totality of a man. Of a peasant. 
                        Worn down by life’s toil. By 
                        practicality. By work.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHICAGO - TRAIN STATION - DAY - 1941

           Marlon Senior stands on a train platform. He wears a business 
           suit and looks at his watch. 
                                 STELLA (V.O.)
                        A man to whom art and dreams are 
                        worthless.

           Marlon Senior pulls out a flask. Takes a swig. Then looks 
           toward Marlon and Dorothy hugging. 

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        I’ve got to get to work.

           Dorothy gives Marlon a kiss. Walks back to Marlon Senior. 
           Tears in her eyes.

           Marlon Senior takes Dorothy’s arm. Walks away without 
           acknowledging Marlon.

           Marlon is left alone on the train platform. Wiping away his 
           own tears.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

           Marlon now stares deeply at the painting. A Guard comes over 
           to him.

                                 GUARD
                        I look at those shoes. Everyday. 
                        Don’t see nothing but shoes. And 
                        occasionally I see a person like 
                        you. Gawking at the thing like it 
                        was Jesus Christ himself on the 
                        Cross.

           Marlon turns to the Guard. Doesn’t say anything. Just stares 
           until...

                                 GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t mean any offense. You just 
                        been looking all day. I figure you 
                        must see something.

           Marlon returns to the painting.

                                 MARLON
                        I see a man trying to stay in 
                        control. A man named Stanley 
                        Kowalski.

                                 GUARD
                        That somebody I should know?
                                 MARLON
                        No. Just somebody I hate.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Marlon stands across from Wally and Ellen. Who respectively 
           play Blanche and Stella.

                                 WALLY
                             (as Blanche)
                        You must be Stanley.

           Marlon looks at the STREETCAR script. Uncertain. Mumbling. He 
           looks anything but the part.

                                 ELLEN
                        Start again. Stop mumbling. I can’t 
                        understand you.

           Marlon shoots Ellen a look. Which quickly shuts her up.

                                 WALLY
                             (to Ellen; still as 
                              Blanche)
                        How could you let yourself marry 
                        this...this...swine?

           Marlon violently smacks Wally. Across the face. Then, for the 
           first time, we hear Stanley’s unmistakably nasally voice.

                                 MARLON
                             (fuming)
                        I don’t aim to being insulted by 
                        the likes of you. In my own house. 
                        You understand that?

           Ellen and Wally look at each other. Not sure what to make of 
           the scene. Finally...

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        How was that?

                                 WALLY
                        So good it hurt.

           EXT. BARRYMORE THEATER - DAY

           Marlon walks into the entrance of the Barrymore Theater. The 
           marquee above it reads: “IRENE SELZNICK PRESENTS ELIA KAZAN’S 
           PRODUCTION OF STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE: OPENS DECEMBER 2”.
           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - LOBBY - DAY

           Marlon paces about the lobby. Manuscript in hand. But looks 
           rather like a vagrant. With the same dingy clothes he was 
           wearing in Boston.

           A handsome, blond THEATER ASSISTANT comes up to Marlon.

                                 THEATER ASSISTANT
                        The homeless shelters are two 
                        avenues from here.

           Marlon looks at the Theater Assistant. Their eyes settle into 
           each other. An obviously intense connection that causes the 
           Theater Assistant to stammer.

                                 THEATER ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        This is the Barrymore Theater --

                                 MARLON
                        I know what it is.

                                 THEATER ASSISTANT
                        Yes. Yes. But the shelters are --

                                 MARLON
                        Mr. Kazan told me to come by.

           Marlon holds up his copy of STREETCAR.

                                 THEATER ASSISTANT
                        Ms. Selznick gave explicit 
                        instruction not to be disturbed 
                        while they are in the auditorium.

           Marlon eyes a JANITOR entering the men’s bathroom.

                                 MARLON
                        Mind if I use the john before I go?

                                 THEATER ASSISTANT
                        Just right over there.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Elia stands on stage. Across from a shirtless BURT LANCASTER. 
           Powerful, strapping, exactly the Hollywood icon that Irene 
           wants.

                                 ELIA
                        Must you have your shirt off?
                                 BURT
                        It’s absolutely essential. Isn’t 
                        it, Irene?

           Elia looks toward Irene in the seats. Next to her is Burt’s 
           agent, BEN HECHT.

                                 IRENE
                             (salivating)
                        Absolutely essential.

           Irene’s eyes are eating Burt up.

           Elia looks to Ben. Who gives a genteel smile. As if to say to 
           Elia, “I feel for you.”

           Elia returns to Burt.

                                 ELIA
                        I’ll play Blanche and Stella. From 
                        the top.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - LOBBY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Marlon comes out of the bathroom in the JANITOR’S OUTFIT. 
           Holds a broom as he pushes a trash can. Toward the auditorium 
           entrance. Looks about. Enters.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon enters the auditorium to see Elia on stage with a 
           shirtless Burt.

                                 ELIA
                             (as Blanche)
                        You must be Stanley.

           Burt stands up to Elia. Dwarfing him. In both height and body 
           size.

           Marlon drops the broom. In disbelief at what he’s seeing.

           Elia, Burt, Irene, and Ben all look back toward Marlon. Who 
           quickly obscures his face by picking up the broom.

                                 MARLON
                        Sorry.

           Elia looks a bit harder toward Marlon. But Burt has started 
           in again.
           Marlon takes the opportunity to quietly exit the auditorium 
           disappointed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia enters to find the dining room empty.

                                 ELIA
                        Hello.

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        I’m putting Katherine to bed.

           Elia goes to Katherine’s room.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - KATHERINE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Molly sits in a rocking chair. Katherine in her arms. The 
               STREETCAR manuscript open next to her.

           Elia sits down on the floor. Next to Molly. Rests his head 
           against her. Sighs heavily.

                                 MOLLY
                        Was Lancaster any better than John?

                                 ELIA
                        His body was.

                                 MOLLY
                        Irene must’ve enjoyed it.

                                 ELIA
                        She thinks he’s a genius.

           Molly stands. Hands Katherine to Elia.

                                 MOLLY
                        Put her to bed.

                                 ELIA
                        Where are you going?

           Molly gives a wink. Leaves Elia with Katherine. 

           Elia sits in the rocking chair. Holds Katherine before him. 
           They stare at each other for a moment.

           Elia smiles. Genuinely content. Katherine smiles back at him.
           Elia starts to rock Katherine again. Back to sleep. Sees the 
               STREETCAR manuscript.

           Elia puts Katherine into her crib. But, as he does so, 
           Constance’s letter slips from his jacket.

           Elia, oblivious to the letter falling out, sits back down in 
           the rocking chair. Starts to read Molly’s notes.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ELIA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elia enters to find...Molly laying in bed. Beneath the 
           covers.

           Elia starts to change into his night clothes.

                                 MOLLY
                        That took you awhile.

                                 ELIA
                        I was reading the notes you made. 
                        They were good.

                                 MOLLY
                        Are you surprised you married a 
                        woman with a mind for the theater?

           Elia gets into bed.

                                 ELIA
                        I’m happy I did.

           Elia kisses Molly. Quite passionately. Despite the passion, 
           it’s rather awkward. As Molly reaches to Elia’s groin.

           The phone rings.

           Elia goes to answer it.

                                 MOLLY
                        Ignore it.

           Molly pulls Elia back to her. The phone rings and rings.

           Molly gets up from the bed. Goes to the phone. Pulls the 
           chord from the wall. 

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        What manners.

           Molly crawls back into bed with Elia. They start to kiss 
           again. She again grabs his groin. After a beat... 
                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 ELIA
                        Nothing. Why?

           Molly’s too demure to pursue the point.

                                 MOLLY
                        Nothing.

           Elia pulls away.

                                 ELIA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MOLLY
                        Don’t be. You’ve got the weight of 
                        the theater world on you. I 
                        understand. Just promise I’ll get 
                        my lover back someday soon.

           Elia kisses Molly.

                                 ELIA
                        Someday soon. You have my word.

           Elia curls up into Molly. Falls asleep as she holds him.

           Molly lays awake. Comforting Elia. Staring out. Obviously 
           disappointed.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT

           Marlon is in a phone booth. Looks at the phone. Hangs up. 
           Exits the phone booth.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Marlon enters the apartment. To find Ellen and Wally waiting, 
           expectant looks on their faces.

                                 WALLY
                        What’s the word?

                                 MARLON
                        Burt Lancaster.

                                 ELLEN
                        Burt Lancaster?
                                 MARLON
                        Burt Lancaster’s playing Stanley 
                        Kowalski. I saw him on stage with 
                        Kazan.
                             (to Ellen)
                        Let me take you home.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen ride his motorcycle through late night 
           Manhattan traffic.

           Marlon still drives slowly. Conservatively. Until...

           EXT. MANHATTAN - STELLA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Marlon stops in front of Stella’s building. Ellen finally 
           releases Marlon.

                                 ELLEN
                        You going to be okay?

           Marlon leans over. Kisses Ellen. A long, meaningful kiss.

                                 MARLON
                        All better now.

           Ellen smiles. Goes inside. Marlon drives away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL - DAY - 1944

           Dorothy stands in a crowded Grand Central Station. Holds a 
           suitcase and a cage. In the cage is Russell. She looks 
           around. Until...

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                             (as John Wayne)
                        Well, hey there, little lady.

           Dorothy turns to see Marlon. Who has a gleeful smile at the 
           sight of his mother.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I brought us a pet. His name’s 
                        Russell.

           Marlon sees a young raccoon. It’s Russell but in a much 
           smaller state.
                                 MARLON
                        A raccoon?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Something unique. Something just 
                        for us to share. Now that I’m here 
                        with you. Ready for a new life. 
                        With you and only you.

           Marlon hugs Dorothy. A deep, very tender hug.

           Marlon helps Dorothy with the luggage. Moves her through 
           Grand Central.

                                 MARLON
                        I want to show you our place.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY - 1944

           Marlon leads Dorothy into a simple but nice looking apartment 
           building.

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - DAY - 1944

           Marlon and Dorothy enter an unfurnished apartment.

           Marlon sets down the luggage. Lets out Russell. Who runs 
           around. Amused by his new urban setting.

           Marlon and Dorothy watch Russell roll over on the floor. They 
           start to laugh. But Dorothy’s laughter turns to tears.

                                 MARLON
                        What’s the matter?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Happy, Bud. Happy. Happy. Happy.

           Marlon embraces Dorothy. Happy to have her all to himself.

           A phone RINGS. And...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Marlon shoots awake. Lets go of Russell. Stumbles out of bed. 
           Trips over Wally.
           Marlon blearily fumbles about the dirty apartment. Following 
           the sound of the ringing.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon enters the kitchen. Goes to the cabinet beneath the 
           sink.

           Marlon puts his ear to it. Hears the phone ring.

           Marlon opens the cabinet. Grabs the phone.

                                 MARLON
                        Yeah.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Elia sits in his office. Mielziner across from him. More 
           sketches on the wall.

                                 ELIA
                        Hello. Yes. Is Marlon Brando there?

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 ELIA
                             (a bit miffed)
                        Well. Can I speak with him?

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        Yeah.

                                 ELIA
                             (exasperated)
                        Can you get him?

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        It’s Marlon.

                                 ELIA
                        Why didn’t you just...nevermind.
                        It’s Elia Kazan. Can you come to 
                        the Barrymore?

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon sits with a dumbfounded look on his face.
                                 MARLON
                        Yeah.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Elia hangs up the phone. Sees Mielziner looking at him.

                                 MIELZINER
                        What about Lancaster?

                                 ELIA
                        I need to see this kid first. Let’s 
                        look at the set.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Elia stands on the stage. With Mielziner. They look at the 
           empty stage. Milziener holds up various set sketches.

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        Mr. Kazan.

           Elia and Mielziner turn to see Marlon standing in the seats. 
           Same dirty shirt and dirty jeans from Boston.

                                 MIELZINER
                        I’ll give you a moment.

           Mielziner leaves.

                                 ELIA
                        Come up here.

           Marlon comes onto the stage. Elia assess him in silence. He 
           starts to walk around him, holding his stare.

                                 MARLON
                        Do you want me --

           Elia pushes Marlon. Marlon, despite being much larger, gives 
           way to Elia’s push.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        -- to read?

           Elia again pushes Marlon. Marlon again gives way.

                                 ELIA
                        Didn’t your father teach you to 
                        stand your ground?
                                 MARLON
                        My father never taught me much. And 
                        what he did. I never liked.

           Elia gives Marlon another long look. Marlon’s face now 
           seeming more boyish. Quite the opposite of his masculine 
           body.

                                 ELIA
                        Let’s go to the movies.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOVIE THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Elia and Marlon sit in a dark movie theater. Watching Burt 
           Lancaster in THE KILLERS.

           Lancaster looks very much the part of the Hollywood idea of 
           masculinity.

           Elia looks to Marlon. Who, by comparison to Lancaster, is a 
           pretty boy, almost effeminate.

           Elia returns to the screen. Lancaster has just moved to hold 
           Ava Gardner in his arms. There’s something melodramatic and 
           artificial to it all.

                                 ELIA
                             (nudging Marlon)
                        You hungry?

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Elia and Marlon sit across from each other in a diner booth.

           Elia watches Marlon hungrily eat a burger. An older WAITRESS 
           walks by...

                                 MARLON
                             (to Waitress)
                        Miss. More coffee. And an apple 
                        pie.
                             (to Elia)
                        Is it okay if I have apple pie?

           Elia nods. The Waitress hustles off.
                                 ELIA
                        What do you think makes Stanley the 
                        villain?

                                 MARLON
                             (with a full mouth)
                        He ain’t a villain.

                                 ELIA
                        He beats Stella. He rapes Blanche. 
                        What is he then?

                                 MARLON
                        There ain’t a name. It’s just that 
                        good girls like Stella. They don’t 
                        go for evil. Bad. Yeah. Certainly. 
                        But not evil. That’s something else 
                        --

           Marlon stops as the Waitress sets down a coffee and a slice 
           of apple pie.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I said an apple pie. Not a slice.

           The Waitress stares at Marlon in disbelief. Then at Elia.

                                 ELIA
                        Bring him the pie.

           The Waitress scurries off. Shakes her head in annoyance.

                                 MARLON
                             (calling out)
                        And make it to go.

                                 ELIA
                        You were saying?

                                 MARLON
                        It’s just a misunderstanding. All 
                        of it. Stanley just doesn’t listen 
                        to what Blanche really needs.

                                 ELIA
                        What does she need?

                                 MARLON
                        A rock to hold on to. When all the 
                        magic’s gone.

           Elia stare at Marlon for a long beat. He then takes out a 
           twenty dollar bill, slides it to Marlon.
                                 ELIA
                        Go straight to Provincetown. I will 
                        phone Tennessee to tell him you’re 
                        coming to audition for him.

           Marlon stands. Starts to leave.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        One last thing, Marlon.

           Marlon stops.

                                 MARLON
                        Call me Bud. It’s what my family 
                        calls me.

                                 ELIA
                        What’s with the raccoon, Bud?

                                 MARLON
                        Russell?
                             (off Elia’s nod)
                        He’s all I got left of my Mom.

           Marlon leaves Elia to himself. Who now sits. Looking at the 
           boxed apple pie. 

           Marlon comes back a moment later.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Almost forgot the pie.

           Marlon grabs the apple pie. Leaves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

           Marlon is at the register. A middle-aged CHECKOUT WOMAN rings 
           up his items. Peanut butter and white bread.

                                 WOMAN (0.S.)
                        You got a strange appetite.

           Marlon turns to see Becky. Stares at her for a beat. A faint 
           glimmer of recognition.

                                 BECKY
                        It’s Becky.

                                 MARLON
                        Oh, yeah.
                                 BECKY
                             (whispers)
                        You’ve been in my dreams every 
                        night.

                                 MARLON
                        What’ve I been doing in --

                                 CHECKOUT WOMAN
                        Hey, Burt Lancaster. That’ll be 
                        nineteen dollars.

           Marlon hands the checkout woman Elia’s twenty dollar bill. 
           Realizing that he’s spent all his travel money.

           After a moment, Marlon turns to Becky. All the intensity that 
           he can summon.

                                 MARLON
                        You wouldn’t by chance be able to 
                        assist me in getting to 
                        Provincetown. Would you?

                                 BECKY
                        I was looking for a pretty excuse 
                        to get out of town. My place. Six 
                        o’clock.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Wally is passed out on the cot. Snores loudly. Naked from the 
           waist upward. 

           Russell is curled up next to him. But wakes as...

           Marlon enters. Grocery bag in one arm. Boxed apple pie in the 
           other. Walks to the kitchen. Russell follows him.

           Marlon returns a moment later. Peanut butter jar and knife in 
           hand. Russell continues to follow closely behind.

           Marlon goes to Wally. Starts to put peanut butter on Wally’s 
           nipples. Then nods to Russell.

           Russell jumps onto the cot. Starts to nibble and paw at 
           Wally’s peanut butter covered nipple.

           Marlon tries to contain his laughter.

           Wally grabs for Russell. Who scurries just out of his reach. 
           Causing Wally to feel the peanut butter.
                                 WALLY
                        Russell. That better not be what I 
                        think it is.

           Wally puts his finger in his mouth.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        That’s delicious. What’ve you been 
                        eating --

           Marlon starts to laugh. Wally shoots up. Sees Marlon 
           laughing. Looks down at his nipple. Sees the peanut butter.

                                 MARLON
                        Check out the kitchen.

           Wally goes into the kitchen. Then...

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        Where the Hell did you get the 
                        apple pie?

                                 MARLON
                        Elia Kazan.

           Wally comes back into the living room.

                                 WALLY
                        Why would Kazan buy you an apple 
                        pie?
                             (off Marlon’s smile)
                        You dirty son of a bitch. We’re 
                        rich. Peanut butter. Apple pies. 
                        We’re kings of New York.

           Wally jumps up. Hugs Marlon. Marlon pulls away. Chest smeared 
           with peanut butter.

                                 MARLON
                        I’ve got to tell Ellen.

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - ELLEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen are loudly having at it. Enjoying each other 
           with what seems a fresh, unfettered passion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Stella and Harold eat soup at the dinner table. Both are 
           clearly trying to ignore the obvious...
                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Fuck me, Stanley. Fuck me you Polak
                        fuck.

           Harold tries to take a spoonful of soup. But the vibrations 
           from Marlon and Ellen cause the soup to splash from his 
           spoon.

                                 HAROLD
                        Sounds like he got the part.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - ELLEN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Ellen lays in bed. Looking a bit love drunk. As Marlon 
           dresses. Back into the same dirty, ripped jeans.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’ll come with you.

           Marlon comes back to Ellen. Looks at her.

                                 MARLON
                        You’re naked. And I’m running late.

           Marlon kisses Ellen. Ellen holds onto Marlon’s neck.

                                 ELLEN
                        I was thinking. When you get back. 
                        Maybe we can try something new.

                                 MARLON
                        New sounds good.

           Marlon breaks free. Leaves Ellen with a wink.

           EXT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

           Elia walks up to the front door of his brownstone.

           Elia looks inside the front window. Into the living room. To 
           see...

           Molly sits in her rocking chair. Katherine in her arms. Chris 
           and Judy running about the living room.
           Elia smiles at this sight. But instead of entering. He turns. 
           Walks away from his brownstone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           Marlon waits outside of Becky’s apartment building. He looks 
           quite out-of-place for the neighborhood.

           The building’s uniformed ELDERLY DOORMAN comes outside.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Move along. Or I’ll call the 
                        police.

           Marlon ignores the Doorman.

           A honk interrupts the Doorman. Marlon and the Doorman look 
           toward...

           Becky sitting in her father’s beautiful ‘45 Aston Martin 
           coupe.

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Good evening, little miss Becky. 
                        Can I help you?

                                 BECKY
                        Don’t tell my father that I 
                        borrowed his car.

           The Doorman looks at Marlon. Who breaks a smile. Before 
           jumping into the coupe.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Elia enters Constance’s building.

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia enters Constance’s apartment. Sits down on the couch.

           Constance comes into the room a moment later. Stops. 
           Surprised to see Elia.
           Elia grabs Constance. Brings her down on the couch. Kisses 
           her. With deep passion. She pulls free.

                                 CONSTANCE
                        You naughty little man.

           Constance rises. Leads Elia to her bedroom.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - NIGHT

           Becky’s car pulls into a roadside motel.

           Becky gets out. Goes into the motel office. Comes out a 
           moment later.

           Marlon follows her into a room.

           INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           Becky and Marlon enter the room.

                                 MARLON
                        I should keep going.

           Becky kisses Marlon. Quite deeply. Passionately. Grabs his 
           crotch.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I suppose a nap wouldn’t hurt.

           Becky pulls Marlon onto the bed. Covers them with the 
           blanket. A moment of calm is soon broken by the movement of 
           the sheets. The movement grows until...

           Marlon and Becky fall from the bed. Onto the floor. Where the 
           passionate embrace continues. Until...

                                 MARLON (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Everything was great. She was free. 
                        And --

           INT. MOTEL - LATER

           Marlon and Becky lay in bed. A post-coital moment. Becky 
           kisses Marlon’s neck. As her hand runs across Marlon’s bare 
           chest. Down toward his crotch.

                                 MARLON
                        My mother. I’m telling you about my 
                        mother.

                                 BECKY
                        Why?

                                 MARLON
                        Cause you weren’t saying anything. 
                        And I felt like talking. You want 
                        me to stop?

                                 BECKY
                        No.

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - DAY - 1944

           Marlon stands in a cleared out space of the now fully 
           furnished apartment. A lovely, tidy arrangement. Seemingly 
           quite permanent.

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        She was finally all mine.

           Marlon waves to...Dorothy, who stands amidst Marlon’s 
           friends.

           Marlon couldn’t be happier. A big smile on his face. As he 
           now nods to...Wally. Who cues an Afro-Cuban record.

           Marlon starts to dance. Ala Katherine Dunham/Haitin style 
           dance technique.

           Marlon’s quickly lost in the music. His body taken with the 
           rhythm.

           Dorothy watches on in wonder.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Where’d my little Bud learn to 
                        dance like that?

                                 MARLON
                        I go dancing up in Harlem. Come on. 
                        I’ll show you how.
           Marlon grabs Dorothy’s wrist.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I couldn’t. I don’t move that --

           Marlon pulls Dorothy onto the ad hoc dance floor. Teaching 
           her to dance. Much the amusement of his friends, Dorothy 
           plays along. She eventually starts to dance on her own.

           Marlon and his friends watch. They clap as Dorothy finishes. 
           She mocks a humble response.

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        But then I found something I didn’t 
                        want to believe.

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY - 1944

           Marlon chases Russell around the apartment.

           Russell runs into the kitchen. Jumps on top of a tall 
           cabinet.

           Marlon comes into the kitchen. Sees Russell poking his head 
           out from atop the cabinet.

           Marlon starts toward him. Russell runs. But in doing so sends 
           an envelope to the ground.

           Marlon opens the envelope. Smile fades as he reads.

           Angle on letter: “SOBER UP OR LEAVE.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

           Marlon looks at the piece of paper. The same faded, yellow 
           piece of paper that he was looking at in Boston.

                                 MARLON
                        This letter from my father. I 
                        didn’t want to believe it. I wanted 
                        the magic so badly. To believe that 
                        she was there to love me. And --

           Becky snores. Her head resting against Marlon’s chest.
           Marlon folds up the letter. Takes the opportunity to dress. 
           Slip out of the room. Into the night.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Elia lays in bed. Phone to his ear. Constance still asleep 
           next to him.

                                 ELIA
                        Provincetown. Massachusetts. Yes. 
                        Tennessee Williams.

           INT. TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - EARLY MORNING

           Tennessee sits at a desk. Writing. Pancho is asleep on a bunk 
           bed behind him.

           The phone rings.

           Tennessee doesn’t look up. The phone rings again.

           Pancho gets up. Answers the phone.

                                 PANCHO
                        Phone.

           Tennessee still doesn’t look up. Continues writing. Pancho 
           plops the phone down in front of Tennessee.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What was that?

           Pancho nods toward the phone. Tennessee picks it up. Watches 
           Pancho open a suitcase and fill it with clothing.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Hello...Kazan...no...he hasn’t 
                        shown up...yes...of course...will 
                        phone first thing when he comes.
                             (hangs up; to Pancho)
                        Where are you going?

                                 PANCHO
                        To a hotel. You were supposed to 
                        call to get the toilet and 
                        electricity fixed.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I did. But the repairman hasn’t 
                        come yet.
                                 PANCHO
                        Come with me. Show me that I don’t 
                        follow you around so I can be 
                        lonely while you stare at a page.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I’ve got to finish rewriting and --

                                 PANCHO
                        Don’t lie to me.

           Tennessee goes to Pancho. Attempting to soothe him.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I wouldn’t lie to you. I just can’t 
                        come with you.

                                 PANCHO
                        Why?
                             (off Tennessee’s silence)
                        Don’t tell me it’s the writing.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Kazan’s sending me a boy.

           Pancho slams his suitcase shut.

                                 PANCHO
                             (in Spanish)
                        You slut.

           Pancho leaves with an angry lover’s flourish. Tennessee 
           watches him stomp out. Then returns to his writing table.

           A few moments later...there’s a knock at the door.

           Tennessee doesn’t at first answer. That’s Pancho’s job. But 
           now that Pancho’s gone. The knocks continue.

           Tennessee finally rises. Goes to the door to see two Texan 
           blonde, female friends, JO and MARY JO, (late 30s).

                                 JO
                        You two get in a fight?

           Tennessee nods. Ushers Jo and Mary Jo in.

                                 MARY JO
                        About what?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I’m not really sure.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia is at the dinner table with Molly, Chris, and Judy.

           Chris and Judy are fighting. Because Chris keeps stabbing 
           Judy’s food with his knife.

           Molly barely pays Judy attention. Elia takes note of this.

                                 ELIA
                        Chris. Go to your room. Judy. You 
                        go to yours.

           Elia stares at them until Chris and Judy begrudgingly accept. 
           Leaving Elia and Molly alone.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        What’s the matter?

                                 MOLLY
                        Where were you last night?

                                 ELIA
                        Where do you think I was?

           Molly doesn’t answer. Elia comes next to her.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve told you. I’m extremely happy 
                        with you. With the kids. With 
                        everything. There’s nothing going 
                        on.

           Molly and Elia kiss. Then...

                                 CHRIS (O.S.)
                        Dad! Hurry. There’s a monster under 
                        my bed.

                                 ELIA
                        Can I go deal with the monster?

           Molly nods. Lets Elia go.

           EXT. PROVINCETOWN - BEACH - NIGHT

           A truck stops on a beach road. Marlon jumps out a moment 
           later. Waves goodbye.
           EXT. PROVINCETOWN - TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Marlon is at the front door of Tennessee’s beach cottage. 
           Takes a deep breath. Knocks. Then...from inside...

                                 TENNESSEE (O.S.)
                        Coming!

           Tennessee comes to the door a moment later. Opens it. Stares 
           at Marlon for a long beat.

                                 MARLON
                        What’s the matter?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You were...well...I mean...I called 
                        hours ago for you. Your boss said 
                        you’d be right over.

                                 MARLON
                             (confused)
                        Sorry for that.

           Tennessee ushers Marlon inside.

           INT. TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon stands in the middle of the room. A bit disheveled and 
           dirty from the travel. But still a sight for the admiring 
           gazes of Tennessee, Mary Jo, and Jo.

                                 MARLON
                        Where do you want me to start?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        In the bathroom.

           Marlon scratches his head. Not sure what to make of 
           Tennessee’s response.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Then the electrical outlets need 
                        fixing.

           Marlon’s now completely confused. Mumbles to himself. But 
           goes off to the bathroom.

           Tennessee, Mary Jo, and Jo tiptoe to the bathroom door. Stare 
           at Marlon bent over the toilet.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I’d fuck him til it falls right 
                        off.
                                 MARY JO
                        I’d suck him til he’s dry.

           Tennessee, Jo, and Mary Jo snicker. Causing Marlon to turn. 
           Face a mess of sweat, grime, and a white smile.

                                 MARLON
                        You all shit a lot for being dainty 
                        birds.

           Marlon turns back to the clogged toilet. Plunges his hand in.

           INT. TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - LATER

           Marlon enters the living room. With Tennessee again at his 
           writing desk. Jo and Mary Jo lounge on a nearby sofa.

                                 MARLON
                        All finished.

           Tennessee grabs a checkbook from the desk drawer.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What’s your name?

                                 MARLON
                        Didn’t Mr. Kazan tell you it?

           Tennessee pauses. His turn at being confused.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You’re Marlon Brando?

           Marlon nods. Tennessee pauses, still stunned with confusion.

                                 MARY JO
                        Why don’t we do a scene?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Yes. Yes. How about --

                                 JO
                             (quickly)
                        The scene where Stanley rapes 
                        Blanche?

           Tennessee shoots Jo a look. She returns a devilish smile.

                                 MARLON
                        Works for me.
                                 TENNESSEE
                        I’ll play Blanche. You come in on 
                        my cue.

           Marlon nods. Walks into the kitchen. Tennessee closes his 
           eyes. Takes a deep breath.

                                 MARY JO
                        You lucky bastard.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Quiet. I’m trying to get --

                                 MARLON
                             (from doorway)
                        Who you gabbing to?

           Tennessee looks to Marlon. Who leans against the kitchen door 
           frame. Beer bottle in hand.

           Marlon now looks all the bit of Stanley Kowalski as we have 
           come to know him. Dirty. Vulgar. Animalistic. Sensual. 

           And, as we now hear, complete with Marlon’s characteristic 
           mumbling whine. Distinct from Garfield’s and Lancaster’s 
           Stanleys.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Well?

           Tennessee is flustered. Stammers. Looks down toward the page. 
           Marlon saunters toward him as he does.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        What’re you looking at there, 
                        Blanche? Trying to ruin my good 
                        mood? Baby’s due tomorrow. And I 
                        figured I’d spend the night 
                        celebrating.

           Marlon opens the beer bottle on the side of Tennessee’s 
           writing desk. Pours the foam over his head. Some of which 
           splashes onto Tennessee’s face.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Stanley. I...well...you came to me -
                        -

           Marlon runs his finger along Tennessee’s shirt. Tennessee 
           fumbles for a word. He’s completely mesmerized by Marlon. As 
           Marlon undoes one of his buttons.
                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t intend to throw my pearls 
                        before swine.

           Tennessee tries to push Marlon away. 

           Marlon grabs his hand. Tennessee looks up at Marlon. Eyes 
           full of vulnerability at Marlon’s sudden display of strength.

                                 MARLON
                        You don’t have to do any throwing.

           Marlon stands Tennessee. Rips off Tennessee’s shirt. 

           Tennessee resists. But not all that hard. 

           Marlon pulls down Tennessee’s pants. Leaving him in his 
           underwear.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        What’re you --

           Marlon turns Tennessee around. Throws him over the desk. 
           Assumes a dominant position behind him.

                                 MARLON
                        Come on, Blanche. We’ve had this 
                        date from the beginning.

           Close on Tennessee’s face: a wickedly pleasant smile; as 
           Marlon holds him firmly from behind, panting heavily like an 
           animal.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Well?

                                 MARLON
                        Well what?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Aren’t you going to rape me?

                                 MARLON
                        It happens off stage.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        No. No it doesn’t. It’s in there. 
                        It’s...

           Tennessee looks down at his script. Notes that the scene ends 
           with the rape happening off stage.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Damnit!
           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ELIA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Elia sleeps in his bed. Next to Molly.

           The phone rings. And rings. Until he finally picks up...

                                 ELIA
                             (wearily)
                        Yes...Tennessee?

           INT. TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Tennessee has the phone to his ear. Looks out the window to 
           see...

           Marlon playfully wrestles with Jo and Mary Jo.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        He’s a genius.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ELIA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 ELIA
                        Who?

           INT. TENNESSEE’S BEACH COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Marlon Brando. Tell Irene that he’s 
                        the boy I want.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ELIA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Elia hangs up the phone. Molly stirring next to him.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who was that?

                                 ELIA
                        We’ve got him.

                                 MOLLY
                        Who?

                                 ELIA
                        Stanley Kowalski. He’s on his way 
                        back.
                             (picks up phone)
                        Yes. Irene Selznick, please.

                                 ELIA (CONT'D)
                        We’ve got him...Stanley 
                        Kowalski...no...not Lancaster...his 
                        name is Marlon Brando.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PROVINCETOWN - TENNESSEE’S COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Tennessee walks outside to find Marlon wrestling with Mary Jo 
           and Jo. He watches for a moment. 

           Marlon turns to Tennessee.

                                 MARLON
                        Want to join?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        We need to get you back to New 
                        York. But first I’d like to speak 
                        with you. Alone.

           Mary Jo and Jo give a collective sigh.

           Marlon stands. Follows Tennessee to the beach.

           EXT. PROVINCETOWN - BEACH - DAY

           Tennessee and Marlon sit next to each other. On the shore.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You’re a Mama’s boy. Like me.

                                 MARLON
                        Were or are?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Suppose it’s always so.

           Tennessee and Marlon are silent. Looking at the peaceful 
           Atlantic.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I gave my mother my love. She paid 
                        me back with pain.

                                 MARLON
                        Do you resent her for it?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        No. Do you?
                                 MARLON
                        What do you mean?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You played Stanley too well to not 
                        know what I meant.
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        They always desired a cruelty we 
                        couldn’t give them.

           Tennessee puts his hand on Marlon’s hand. Marlon looks to 
           Tennessee.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re not. I see that. But 
                        I need you to be cruel. With the 
                        cruelty you and I know so well. Can 
                        you do that?

           Marlon nods. Then returns to silently looking at the 
           Atlantic. Still hand-in-hand with Tennessee.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT - 1944

           Marlon bursts into the apartment. Greeted by Russell. They go 
           into the living room. To find...

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - 1944

           Dorothy asleep on the couch. Fully clothed.

           Marlon kisses Dorothy’s forehead. Takes her shoes off. Covers 
           her with a blanket.

           Marlon then walks to the bathroom.

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS - 1944

           Marlon urinates. Tries to flush when he’s finished. But the 
           toilet won’t flush.

           Marlon lifts the lid. Looks in to see...a bottle of whiskey 
           floating.

           Marlon closes the lid. Goes back into the living room.
           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - 1944

           Marlon stands at the foot of the couch. Watches Dorothy 
           sleep. Tears in his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ellen enters. Directing Marlon. Who has one hand covering his 
           eyes. So he cannot see that the apartment is spick-and-span. 

                                 ELLEN
                        Open.

           Marlon opens his eyes to see the apartment.

                                 MARLON
                        Where is everything?

                                 ELLEN
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARLON
                        Everything on the floor. It’s gone.

                                 ELLEN
                        The trash?
                             (off Marlon’s nod)
                        I had it cleaned up. I wasn’t going 
                        to live in that filth.
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        I said we should try something new.

                                 MARLON
                        That’s what you meant by new?

                                 ELLEN
                        You don’t want me here?

                                 MARLON
                        Of course I do. It’s just that. I 
                        got a real full house. And it 
                        wouldn’t be fair to Wally and 
                        Russell if --

           Wally enters the living room. With a peanut butter sandwich.

                                 WALLY
                        Wouldn’t mind a little feminine 
                        touch around here.

           Wally gives a big, peanut butter smeared smile.
           Marlon looks back to Ellen.

                                 MARLON
                        Looks like we finally got a woman 
                        of the house.

           Ellen delightedly hugs Marlon. Who reciprocates with a less 
           than enthusiastic hug.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Elia stands in front of the assembled cast. Jessica Tandy. 
           Kim Hunter. Karl Malden. Everyone except Marlon. Irene and 
           Tennessee sit in the audience.

           Elia holds onto Molly’s copy of STREETCAR.

                                 ELIA
                        Our sympathy is meant for Blanche. 
                        But this drama occurs on Stanley's 
                        domain. It is a struggle for 
                        dominance. Between Blanche and 
                        Stanley. And, thus, as all such 
                        wars are, it will be performed with 
                        the utmost abandon and cruelty.

                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                             (from the audience)
                        And where might this Stanley --

           Irene stops herself. As Marlon walks onto stage. Escorted by 
           the same handsome Theater Assistant that had before tried to 
           throw him out.

           Marlon is laughing. And takes no note of everyone until...

                                 ELIA
                        This is Stanley Kowalski.

           And in his characteristic nasally voice...

                                 MARLON
                        Hi ya everyone.

           Irene and Jessica look positively shocked by what stands 
           before them.

                                 JESSICA
                        Are you in the business of 
                        introducing stage hands?
                                 IRENE
                        Good question, Jess--

                                 ELIA
                             (sharply to Irene)
                        Quiet.
                             (back to cast)
                        This is Marlon Brando. He will be 
                        playing Stanley Kowalski. Now. If 
                        you please. Jessica and Kim. Let’s 
                        begin a read through.

           Elia settles into a chair on stage to watch...

           Kim and Jessica begin. Reading with a stiffness that lessens. 
           Until Marlon’s entrance into the scene.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Marlon. Enter.

           Marlon doesn’t say anything. Simply walks around Jessica. 
           Quite silent. Staring at her. Taking stock of her prim and 
           proper posture.

           Jessica’s not certain what to make of Marlon. Filthy clothes. 
           A hunched back. A shuffling walk.

                                 MARLON
                        What’s your problem?

                                 JESSICA
                        I smell a piece of shit.

           Marlon begins to laugh.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 MARLON
                        I didn’t think you were the type to 
                        improvise.

                                 JESSICA
                        I wasn’t improvising.

                                 MARLON
                        What’s that supposed to --

                                 ELIA
                        Enough. Enough. Start from the top.

           Jessica and Kim begin the scene again. Which transitions into 
           a montage...
           Of scenes from the play. Interspersed with Elia yelling, 
           “Stop,” and, “Begin”. And, nearly every time that Marlon 
           comes onto the scene, “Meaner, Marlon”.

           Until...

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - OFFICE - LATER

           Elia sits at his desk. Across from Tennessee and Mielziner.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        I rather like how much Jessica 
                        hates Marlon.

                                 ELIA
                        Irene seemed none too pleased.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Irene’s the least of our worries.

                                 MIELZINER
                        What do you mean?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Thorton Wilder read the play.

           Tennessee pauses. Elia and Mielziner wait for him to 
           continue. Instead, Tennessee only begins to laugh. Quite 
           hard.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        He hated it. Said it would be a 
                        failure.

                                 ELIA
                        How’s that funny?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        He said the premise was all wrong. 
                        That Stella would never go for an 
                        animal like Stanley.
                             (after a moment)
                        It’s obvious that queen’s never had 
                        a good fuck in his life.

           Tennessee bursts out laughing. Along with Elia and Mielziner.

                                 IRENE (O.S.)
                        Is there something comical to which 
                        I should be alerted?

           Everyone looks toward Irene...
                                 IRENE (CONT’D)
                        What I saw out there was disaster. 
                        A box office disaster. Nothing more 
                        than filth. With that trashy little 
                        boy mumbling and bumbling about the 
                        stage.

                                 ELIA
                        All he needs is an audience.

                                 IRENE
                        He won’t get an audience. And 
                        neither will you. For as far as I’m 
                        concerned, your services will no 
                        longer be --

                                 TENNESSEE
                        That’s quite enough.

                                 IRENE
                        He’s ruining your play.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        He’s doing rather the opposite. I 
                        should say. And I think I’m the 
                        authority on this matter.

                                 IRENE
                        But a man-child is hardly what you 
                        ask for in Stanley.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Marlon is all that I want. Just as 
                        Elia’s vision is all that I want 
                        for my play. If you’d like any 
                        further discussion on the matter, 
                        I’ll have my lawyers recite to you 
                        the original terms of the contract.

           Tennessee walks out. Leaving Irene to look at Elia. Who gives 
           his vague, diplomatic smile.

           Irene turns a moment later.

                                 IRENE
                        Tennessee! Hold on a minute.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Elia enters Marlon’s dressing room. Sees no one is around.
           Elia sets down the contract. Then starts to pilfer through 
           Marlon’s belongings.

           Elia finds Marlon Senior’s letter. Reads it quickly. But 
           before he can place it back...

           Marlon enters. With the Theater Assistant. Both giggling.

           Elia quickly pockets the letter. Just before...

                                 MARLON
                        Mr. Kazan.

                                 ELIA
                        Bud. I was just delivering your 
                        contract.

           Elia surveys the Theater Assistant.

                                 MARLON
                        Thanks.
                             (notes Elia looking at the 
                              Theater Assistant)
                        Oh. Mr. Kazan. This is Jack.

           Elia surveys Jack with a stare that looks right through him. 
           Off that...

                                 JACK
                        I’ll let you two alone.

                                 MARLON
                        Hold on.

           Marlon scribbles a note. Attaches it to the contract.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Send a copy of the contract to my 
                        parents.

           Jack nods and leaves. Letting Marlon alone with Elia. Who 
           stares at Marlon with a penetrating gaze. After a long, 
           awkward moment...

                                 ELIA
                        Would you like to come over for 
                        dinner?

                                 MARLON
                        That’d be splendid.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Elia goes inside the apartment building.

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        Gee. Mrs. Kazan. I hope that I’m 
                        not too early. 

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Constance opens the door to Elia. Who immediately comes at 
           her.

                                 MARLON (V.O.)
                        Mr. Kazan told me to come. So, I’m 
                        here.

           Elia and Constance have at it. In the living room. Very 
           passionate. Very opposite the way he is with Molly.

                                 MOLLY (V.O.)
                        Oh, no. It’s fine. Come in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Molly leads Marlon into the dining room.

                                 MOLLY
                        Elia hasn’t gotten home yet. But 
                        come in.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Molly and Marlon enter the dining room. Chris and Judy are at 
           the dining room table.

                                 MOLLY
                        Judy. Chris. Come introduce 
                        yourselves to Mr. Brando.

           Chris and Judy dutifully stand. Come over to Marlon.

                                 CHRIS
                        Nice to meet you, Mr. Brando.

                        Call me Bud.

           Marlon looks at Judy. Who stares at him.
                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        You want to ask Bud a question?

                                 JUDY
                        Why do you smell so bad?

                                 MOLLY
                        Judy. That was --

           Marlon starts to laugh hard. Just as Elia enters. Chris and 
           Judy run to him. Each hugging a different leg.

           Elia hugs and kisses both Chris and Judy. Walks with them 
           clung to his leg to Molly. Kisses her. Nods to Marlon.

                                 ELIA
                        Should we start eating?

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Marlon grips his silver ware. Face bent toward his food. 
           Focused on eating.

                                 MARLON
                             (with food in mouth)
                        Damned good. Real damned good, Mrs. 
                        Kazan. Real good.

                                 JUDY
                        We’re his friends, Daddy.
                             (to Marlon)
                        Aren’t we?

                                 MARLON
                             (with mouth full)
                        Of course. You’re all real tops. 
                        Say. You know how to dance? I feel 
                        like dancing. With a pretty little 
                        girl.

           Judy looks to Molly. Who nods.

                                 CHRIS
                        Can I come?

                                 MARLON
                        The more the merrier.

           Marlon bundles Chris and Judy under his arms. Carries them to 
           the living room. 
           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - DINING ROOM - LATER

           Elia and Molly watch Marlon teach Chris and Judy to dance the 
           mambo. Molly holds onto a sleeping Katherine.

                                 MOLLY
                        Seems too gentle to be Stanley.

                                 ELIA
                        The brute’s in there somewhere.

           Marlon mocks falling during the mambo. Chris and Judy fall, 
           too.

           Marlon starts to laugh. As Chris and Judy start to wrestle 
           with him. All three enjoying themselves immensely.

                                 MOLLY
                        You just need to provoke it.

           Molly enters the living room.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Time to let Bud go home.

           After Marlon has said his good nights, Elia enters.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Good night, Bud. It was --

           Katherine starts to cry.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        -- Katherine is saying good night, 
                        too.
                             (kisses Elia)
                        Now don’t let this man walk all 
                        over you during rehearsal.

                                 MARLON
                        I’ll fight him tooth and nail.

           Marlon and Molly exchange a cordial good night kiss.

                                 ELIA
                        Let me walk you to the train.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - KATHERINE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Molly enters Katherine’s room. Goes to comfort Katherine. As 
           she picks her up, she notices something beneath the crib.

           Molly bends down. Grabs the piece of paper.
           Molly starts to tear up as she reads.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           Elia and Marlon walk along the sidewalk. Toward a subway 
           station in the near distance.

                                 ELIA
                        You think I got a funny smile?

                                 MARLON
                        I haven’t noticed. Why?

                                 ELIA
                        The kids make fun of it.

                                 MARLON
                        Let me see.

           Elia smiles for Marlon.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. It’s funny. You don’t like 
                        it?

                                 ELIA
                        Molly said it looks like my 
                        father’s smile.

           Elia and Marlon are silent for a moment.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Whenever I saw it, I knew it meant 
                        that he was unhappy. And sometimes 
                        I worry that I smile when I’m 
                        angry. When I’m unhappy.

           Elia and Marlon stop at the subway entrance. 

                                 MARLON
                        You got a great family. A great 
                        life. You got every reason to be 
                        happy.

           Elia looks at Marlon. And seeing his sincere face.

                                 ELIA
                        You’re a good boy, Bud. See you 
                        tomorrow.

           Elia walks back toward his brownstone.
           INT./EXT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Elia enters. Closes the door. Turns on a light. Takes note of 
           a packed weekend bag.

           Elia hangs up his coat. Walks into...

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Elia enters the living room. To find Molly sitting in the 
           rocking chair. Her face tired. Bags beneath her red eyes. A 
           piece of paper in her lap.

                                 MOLLY
                        Is this why you’ve been too tired.

                                 ELIA
                        It’s not --

                                 MOLLY
                        You said it was over with her.

           Elia stares straight back at Molly. Only managing a vague 
           smile on his face.

                                 MOLLY (CONT’D)
                        I deserve more than that smile.
                             (off Elia’s silence)
                        You said you were happy.

                                 ELIA
                        I am.

           Chris and Judy start to call out, “Mom!”

                                 MOLLY
                        Then why?

                                 ELIA
                        Sometimes happiness isn’t enough.

           Molly pauses. Taking in Katherine’s crying and the voices of 
           Chris and Judy repeating, “Mom!”

           Elia walks out of the living room and into...

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia enters Constance’s apartment. Weekend bag in hand.
           Constance is present to greet him. She hugs him. They go to 
           the bedroom.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marlon and Ellen lay together. Her hand runs over his crotch.

                                 MARLON
                        Just hold me.

           Ellen squeezes.

                                 ELLEN
                        I am holding you.

           Marlon pushes Ellen’s hand off his crotch.

                                 MARLON
                        Not like that.

           Marlon turns over. His back to Ellen. Who stares out. 
           Confused at Marlon’s request. 

           Ellen puts her arms over Marlon. More motherly than amorous.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT - 1944

           Dorothy stands at the head of a large dining table. Lined 
           with Marlon and his friends.

                                 DOROTHY
                             (drunkenly)
                        Lil’ Bud. Used to do the loveliest 
                        little impressions.

           Marlon’s friends are smitten with Dorothy. Finding her 
           inebriation cheerful and charming.

           Marlon gets up from the table. Passes Dorothy. Goes to the 
           window, opens it.

           Marlon looks out to see the ten story drop. Then looks back 
           to see Dorothy on all fours imitating a cow.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Moo. Moooo. Moooo.
           Marlon’s friends are in stitches. Taking no notice 
           as...Marlon climbs out the window. So that only his hands are 
           visible.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        All day long. Moo. Mooo. Moo--

           A primordial scream interrupts Dorothy. Marlon’s friends stop 
           laughing.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                             (ignores the scream)
                        Mooing and...
                             (imitates a chicken)
                        Cluck. Cluck. Clucking. Like a 
                        chick looking for its mom and --

           Another scream. Impossibly louder. Impossibly longer. Stops 
           the laughter. Continues until Dorothy grabs a plate from the 
           table. Smashes it.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Stop that at once. And come back in 
                        here.

           Marlon climbs in from the window.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        What do you think you’re --

                                 MARLON
                        Getting you to stop making a 
                        drunken ass of yourself.

           Dorothy stares at Marlon not sure of what to say.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        That’s right. I know you’ve been 
                        boozing. And I know where you been 
                        hiding it. Come on. Tell everyone.

           Dorothy gives Marlon a long stare.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        In the toilet. She pulls her booze 
                        from the toilet.

                                 DOROTHY
                        You’re acting --

           Dorothy hiccups. Causing her an embarrassed silence. That 
           only furthers the uncomfortable silence that has fallen on 
           Marlon’s friends.
                                 MARLON
                        Tell them. How you been using your 
                        son. Cause the bastard kicked you 
                        out for not cleaning up.
                             (off Dorothy’s silence)
                        I want to hear you say it!

           Dorothy maintains her composure. Turns to Marlon’s friends.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Marlon’s obviously not feeling 
                        well. He needs to rest. I 
                        apologize. I’m going to have to ask 
                        you to leave.

           Dorothy ushers Marlon’s friends out. She shuts the door. 
           Turns back to see...Marlon slumped in a chair at the dining 
           table. 

           Marlon looks up at Dorothy. Both are wounded. On the verge of 
           tears.

           Dorothy is about speak. But hiccups. She leaves the room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - DAY

           Marlon sits at a table. Across from Kim and Jessica. They’re 
           at the beginning of the famous dish breaking scene.

           There’s a dead silence because...Marlon sits at the table. 
           Staring down at his plate. Not talking.

                                 KIM
                        Perhaps Stanley just doesn’t want 
                        to talk tonight.

           Marlon looks up at Kim.

                                 JESSICA
                        Perhaps he doesn’t know how to 
                        talk.

           Marlon mumbles.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        But he certainly knows how to 
                        mumble.

           Marlon looks straight at Jessica. Everyone watching. 
           Expectantly.
           Marlon looks around. Then back down at his plate.

                                 ELIA
                        Jessica. A moment.

           Marlon watches Jessica go to Elia. Who puts his arm around 
           her. Starts to whisper to her.

           Marlon looks to Kim. Who shrugs her shoulders.

           Elia lets Jessica go. She comes back to the stage.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        From the beginning.

           Kim and Jessica take their places. Begin their opening lines. 
           As Marlon begins to eat.

                                 JESSICA
                        Doesn’t talk does he, Stella?

                                 KIM
                        He enjoys masticating.

                                 JESSICA
                        You know what he looks like to me?

                                 MARLON
                             (still staring down)
                        What?

                                 JESSICA
                        A child that never knew what it was 
                        like to be loved.

           Marlon takes a bite. Chews it slowly. Before he smashes his 
           plate. Causing Kim and Jessica to jump back.

           Marlon starts to smash the glasses on the table. Before 
           moving back to the plates. And, standing, napkin tucked into 
           his shirt collar...

           Marlon flips the table. Sending Kim and Jessica falling back 
           onto the floor. 

           Marlon stands. Unmoving. Panting. Looking about the stage. 
           Sweating. Animalistic fury in his eye.

           Marlon finally fixes his eyes on Jessica. Wipes his mouth. 
           Moves toward Jessica. Grabs her ankle.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Stop. What’re you --
           Marlon suddenly stops as...

                                                         FLASH BACK TO:

           INT. MARLON’S HOME - 1932 - NIGHT

           Marlon (8) sits in a dark hallway. Outside a door. With a 
           light on inside the room. 

                                 DOROTHY (O.S.)
                        -- doing.

           Muffled sounds can be heard. Along with the sound of 
           punching. Marlon pushes open the door to see. 

           Marlon Senior holds Dorothy by the foot. Drags her away from 
           the door.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I love you. I love you.

           Marlon shuts the door.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon looks at Jessica. Vulnerable. Terrified. Her ankles 
           red from the pressure of his grip.

           Marlon releases Jessica. Stops heaving.

                                 ELIA
                        Everyone out. Except you Bud.

           Everyone filters out.

           Elia approaches Marlon. Walks about him. Much like their 
           first meeting.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Why did you stop?

                                 MARLON
                        I didn’t want to hurt her.

           Elia looks a bit more sharply at Marlon.

                                 ELIA
                        Who do you mean by her?
                             (after a long beat)
                        Say it.
           Marlon doesn’t answer. Elia walks away. Leaving Marlon to his 
           thoughts.

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - DAY - 1944

           The living room is empty. Save for Russell. Who sleeps on the 
           couch.

           Marlon comes into the living room. Gives Russell a goodbye 
           kiss. Makes to leave when the phone rings.

           Marlon answers the phone. Accepts the charges. Drops the 
           phone a moment later. Rushing out of the apartment.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT - 1944

           Marlon walks into a Manhattan police station.

           INT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS - 1944

           Marlon talks with a POLICE CLERK. The Clerk watches Marlon 
           fill out some paper work.

                                 CLERK
                        You fill out that form pretty fast.

                                 MARLON
                        I’ve had some practice.

                                 CLERK
                        Sorry to hear that kid.

           Marlon doesn’t respond as he hands back the paper work.

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                             (loudly; toward the back)
                        Bring her out.

           A moment later, Dorothy emerges. Escorted by a police 
           officer.

                                 DOROTHY
                             (drunkenly)
                        Bud! You’ve come to save me. Now. 
                        Do your Mother a favor --

                                 MARLON
                        Quiet, Ma.
                                 DOROTHY
                             (ignoring Marlon)
                        Sing your mama a little of that 
                        song. “Streets of Laredo”. Just be 
                        a sport and --

                                 MARLON
                        I said quiet.

           Marlon leaves the police station with Dorothy leaning against 
           him. She lets out a peal of drunken laughter.

                                 DOROTHY
                             (sing-song)
                        On the Streets of Laredo...

           Over this a knock can be heard. Followed shortly by another 
           knock.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marlon lays in his dressing room. Staring at the ceiling. 
           Stirring only as he finally hears another knock.

                                 MARLON
                        Come in.

           Jack enters. Holds a dry cleaning bag.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        What do you got there?

                                 JACK
                        Your costume. Mr. Kazan wanted you 
                        to try it on.

           Jack watches as Marlon gets up. Takes off his shirt and 
           pants. Walks past him in his underwear.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        You were magnificent.

           Marlon starts to put on the jeans. They’re incredibly tight. 
           He struggles to pull them up.

           Jack gets to his knees. Holds on to the waist line of the 
           pants.

                                 JACK (CONT’D)
                        Just jump into them.
           Marlon bounces up and down right in front of Jack’s eye line. 
           Jack’s eyes, for that matter, don’t move from Marlon’s 
           crotch.

           Marlon finally manages to get into the jeans. Notices that 
           Jack is still on his knees. Looking admiringly at him. Then, 
           a soft knock.

           Marlon looks to the door to see...Elia is at the door. 
           Basketball in hand.

                                 MARLON
                        What do you think?

           Elia stares for a moment. Throws Marlon the ball.

                                 ELIA
                        Let’s play basketball.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - PARK - DUSK

           Elia dribbles a basketball at the top of the key. A light 
           sweat on his brow.

           Marlon’s in front of him. Stripped to the waist. Sweat 
           pouring off his face.

           Marlon pushes into Elia. Elia responds by jabbing his elbow 
           into Marlon’s stomach. Which backs Marlon off.

                                 MARLON
                        Foul.

           Elia drives past Marlon. Takes the ball to the hoop. Scores.

                                 ELIA
                        Twenty-to-twenty.

                                 MARLON
                        That was a foul.

           Elia shrugs. Starts to dribble again.

           Marlon doesn’t wait. Smacks Elia’s hand. Knocks the ball 
           loose. Takes the ball. Draws up to shoot.

           Elia jumps up from behind. Smacks the ball loose. But he and 
           Marlon fall over.

           They scramble and fight to get to the ball.

           Elia throws an elbow into Marlon’s nose.
           Elia scrambles loose. Gets the ball. Starts to get to his 
           feet. When...

           Marlon grabs Elia’s ankle. Causing Elia to fall and lose the 
           ball. Elia can only watch as...

           A blood speckled Marlon grabs the ball. Runs to the basket. 
           Shoots a lay up.

           Marlon turns back. Sees Elia also has blood on his face. They 
           begin to laugh.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - GREENWICH VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Elia and Marlon walk.

                                 ELIA
                        When I look at you. I still don’t 
                        see Stanley.

                                 MARLON
                        Who do you see?

                                 ELIA
                        Mitch.

                                 MARLON
                        Why’s that?

                                 ELIA
                        When Blanche asks him if he loves 
                        his mother. Don’t you think he 
                        wants to say no? That he, in fact, 
                        hates her.

           Elia and Marlon stop outside of Marlon’s apartment building.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        Do you love your mother?

                                 MARLON
                        Of course I love my mother.

           Elia pulls out the letter he pilfered from Marlon’s desk. 
           Hands it back to Marlon.

           Marlon is suddenly aware that Elia knows far more about him 
           than he has so far led on.

                                 ELIA
                        Do you hate her?
                             (off Marlon’s nod)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELIA (CONT'D)
                        I need you to say it through 
                        Stanley. Through how he dominates 
                        Blanche. Thwarts her attempts to 
                        bring disorder to his life.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Marlon enters to find Wally on the couch with Russell.

           Marlon grabs a bag. Walks into the...

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon goes to the cupboard. Puts a peanut butter jar into 
           the bag. Goes to the fridge. Grabs a loaf of bread.

           Marlon goes back into the...

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon reenters the living room. Grabs Russell. Puts him in 
           the bag. As Wally wakes up.

                                 WALLY
                        What’re you doing?

                                 MARLON
                        I’m taking Russell for a ride.

           Marlon leaves before Wally can say a word.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT

           Marlon rides his motorcycle uptown. Bag between his legs. 
           With Russell’s head popped out. Looking at the city fly by 
           as...

           Marlon opens up the throttle. The Indian picks up speed. 
           Passing taxis. As Marlon weaves in and out. No longer riding 
           conservatively.

           Marlon stops at Columbus Circle. Gets off his motorcycle.

           Marlon sits on a park bench. The bag containing Russell next 
           to him. He opens it. Pulls out a peanut butter jar.

           Russell pokes his head out. Gets out. Starts to dig into the 
           peanut butter.

           Marlon watches Russell dirty his face with peanut butter.
                                 MARLON
                        That good?

           Russell climbs up Marlon. Puts his peanut butter laden foot 
           into Marlon’s mouth. Marlon laughs. Takes Russell’s foot out. 
           Puts Russell back down with the peanut butter jar.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got to do this. Even if we 
                        love each other. That’s just that. 
                        My love can’t change you. I’ve got 
                        to accept it. You’ll always be your 
                        way. And we just don’t fit 
                        together. So I’ve got to let you 
                        go. I can’t keep trying to pretend 
                        you’re mine. I got 
                        to...to...goodbye Russell.

           Marlon walks away. 

           Russell looks up from the peanut butter jar. Stares 
           quizzically as Marlon drives away. Heading uptown. After a 
           moment, he returns to the peanut butter.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Elia is in the bathtub. With Constance behind him. Soaping 
           his back.

                                 CONSTANCE
                        Variety says you’re going to be a 
                        big hit at the Oscars. That you’re 
                        going to --

                                 ELIA
                        I don’t care about that.

                                 CONSTANCE
                             (ignores Elia)
                        -- be really big. I was thinking. 
                        That after the awards. That you 
                        could introduce me to Daryl. And 
                        some agents. And, as for the 
                        Oscars, I can wear something from 
                        Paris. Dior. Or Lanvin. Or --

                                 ELIA
                        I’ve got problems.

                                 CONSTANCE
                        What’s wrong?
                                 ELIA
                        I need Marlon to own the stage. To 
                        get violent. But, then, I worry it 
                        might be too much. That perhaps it 
                        would take away from Blanche. Who 
                        is supposed to have the audience’s 
                        sympathy. I’m worried everything’s 
                        falling apart. That I’m coming 
                        apart. I worry that Molly’s really 
                        serious about this. And our kids. 
                        I’m terrible and bad for doing 
                        this.

                                 CONSTANCE
                        Why’d you come to me then?

           After a long pause, Elia turns to look at Constance.

                                 CONSTANCE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t I make you happy?

           Elia kisses Constance.

                                 ELIA
                        Yes. Of course.

           Elia stands. Steps out of the bathtub. Starts to dress.

           Elia looks at Constance one last time. Leaves the bathroom.

           INT. CONSTANCE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elia packs up his weekend bag. Puts on his coat. Leaves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - HARLEM - NIGHT

           Marlon drives his motorcycle through Harlem.

           Marlon crosses an intersection. He slows as he sees a pretty, 
           young black WOMAN (early 20s) waiting to cross the street. 
           Their eyes meet for a brief moment.

           Marlon continues driving. But he can’t help himself. He turns 
           around. To see that the young woman has already crossed the 
           street.

           Marlon follows her at a comfortable distance. He watches her 
           go inside of a club. 

           Marlon parks his motorcycle. He enters the club.
           INT. HARLEM CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon enters the club to find a black band playing Afro-
           Cuban music to a packed house of black patrons. Judging by 
           the looks he’s getting from them, it’s obvious that white 
           boys don’t come here. Ever.

           Marlon stands against a wall. Away from the crowd. Watches 
           the band. Appreciatively taps his foot to the drummer’s beat. 
           As...

           The young woman enters from a back room. Dancing. A very 
           intense, almost tribal dance. Something incredibly more 
           erotic and sensual and animalistic than the mambo.

           Their eyes lock as the drummer takes control. His beat gets 
           more intense. More percussive.

           Marlon’s hips start to move as he and the young woman lock 
           eyes in an intense stare.

           Marlon gives way to the beat. Body in full motion. It’s quite 
           extraordinary. Where before his dance was playful, there’s 
           something so reckless, animalistic, and rhythmically erotic 
           that...

           Everyone watches Marlon. Enraptured as he moves toward the 
           young woman. He grabs her. She seems to try to pull away. He 
           brings her close. She submits to his strength. They start to 
           move together. Their motion is full of an explosive eroticism 
           that...

           The music has stopped. And...

           The drummer pulls Marlon away from the young woman. Marlon 
           turns to judge the incredibly large man confronting him.

                                 DRUMMER
                        What’s the dig?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Let him alone. Kid don’t know figs 
                        from shit. 
                             (to Marlon)
                        Isn’t that right?

           Marlon nods. The drummer turns back to the stage. He suddenly 
           turns back around. Punches Marlon in the stomach. Marlon 
           punches right back. Runs for the door.

           The drummer runs after Marlon.
           EXT. MANHATTAN - HARLEM - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon runs to his motorcycle. He starts it just as the 
           drummer bursts from the club. Runs at him.

           Marlon hits the throttle just in time to avoid the drummer’s 
           grasp.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RITZ-CARLTON - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Elia stands across from a Hotel Desk Clerk. He starts to sign 
           a check when...

                                 TENNESSEE (O.S.)
                        You old cad.

           Elia turns to see...Tennessee behind him.

                                 ELIA
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Irene put me up here. Not shabby, 
                        eh?

                                 ELIA
                        Not at all. I’ve been having a 
                        problem. With the play that I --

           Tennessee looks down at Elia’s weekend bag.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Trouble at home?

           Elia smiles. Tennessee’s suddenly bashful. Having hit the 
           mark.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                             (to Hotel Desk Clerk)
                        Make sure he’s in the room across 
                        from me.
                             (to Elia)
                        Stop by for a drink?

                                 ELIA
                        Another night. Have to make a call.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Marlon enters the apartment to find Ellen sitting on the cot. 
           She looks at him. In his ripped white tee shirt. A tired 
           face. Haggard.

                                 ELLEN
                        Is everything all right?

           Marlon stares at Ellen for a long moment. Off his prolonged 
           silence...

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Wally told me you left with Russell 
                        for a ride. And look at you. What 
                        happened? Where’s Russell? What --

           Marlon starts to collect some clothes.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing?

                                 MARLON
                        I can’t do this. I can’t. It’s too 
                        much.

                                 ELLEN
                        Do what? What’s too much?

           Marlon doesn’t respond. Ellen hits the clothes out of 
           Marlon’s hands.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Marlon. Stop. And tell me what’s 
                        going on.

           Marlon starts to collect the clothes again.

                                 MARLON
                        I can’t stay here with you and --

           Ellen knocks the clothes down again. Grabs Marlon’s hands. 
           Puts them around her. As she comes into his chest.

                                 ELLEN
                        Let me in. Whatever’s wrong. I’ll 
                        make it better.

                                 MARLON
                        You can’t do anything for me.

           Ellen pulls away. Looks at Marlon.
                                 ELLEN
                        How can you be so cruel?

           Marlon grabs his clothes. Leaves. With Ellen on the floor. 
           Confused. Crying.

           INT. RITZ-CARLTON - ELIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia lays in bed. Phone to his ear.

                                 ELIA
                        It’s over. I’m staying at the Ritz. 
                        But I couldn’t sleep. I could only 
                        think about you. And the kids. And 
                        what I’ve done to...hello? Molly. I 
                        love you. I love --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Molly sits in the living room. The phone to her ear.

                                 ELIA (O.S.)
                        -- you. Are you there? I love --

           Molly hangs up the phone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RITZ-CARLTON - ELIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia listens to the click of the receiver. He hangs up a 
           moment later.

           Elia lays back into the bed. Puts a pillow over his face. 
           Screams into it. Beats at it with his fist.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACK ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Marlon pounds at the backstage entrance. A bag of clothes 
           next to him. His motorcycle parked behind him in the alley.

                                 MARLON
                        Hello!

           Marlon pounds again. And again. And again. Until he finally 
           gives up. Turns. Walks toward his motorcycle.
                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Did you need to get in?

           Marlon turns back to see Jack standing in the doorway. They 
           share a long stare.

                                 MARLON
                        What’re you doing here?

           Jack shrugs. Walks toward Marlon.

                                 JACK
                        What’re you doing here?

           Marlon watches Jack approach. Transfixed. Until he stands 
           next to Marlon.

                                 MARLON
                        Getting away.

                                 JACK
                        From what?

                                 MARLON
                        Does it matter to you?

                                 JACK
                        Just being polite, Mr. Brando.
                             (noting Marlon’s clothes)
                        Can I help you with your clothes?

           Marlon looks down to see...Jack’s hand lightly stroking his 
           own hand. 

                                 MARLON
                        Call me Marlon.

                                 SANDY
                        Well, Marlon?

           Marlon nods. Jack grabs the bag from Marlon’s hand.

                                 MARLON
                        Show me to my dressing room?

                                 JACK
                        Certainly.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACK STAGE - MORNING

           Wally stands at the door to Marlon’s dressing room. His ear 
           pressed to the door listening to the muffled sound of bodies 
           wrestling.

                                 WALLY
                             (in Marlon Senior’s voice)
                        Bud! Quit wrestling. And answer the 
                        door.

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                             (from inside)
                        Christ, Wally!

           The noise from within the room stops. After a long beat, 
           Marlon answers the door. Closes it quickly.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        How did you know I was here?

                                 WALLY
                        Where the Hell else would you be?

                                 MARLON
                        Ellen’s place.

                                 WALLY
                        After what you did to her?
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        I’m just delivering a telegram that 
                        came for you this morning.

           Wally takes a telegram from his pocket. He hands Marlon the 
           telegram, who begins to read it.

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                             (flirtatious)
                        Oh, Stanley.

           Wally’s ears perk up at the sound of a male voice.

                                 MARLON
                        What?

                                 WALLY
                        I didn’t say anything.

           Marlon folds up the telegram, pockets it.

                                 MARLON
                        Go for a walk?
           EXT. MANHATTAN - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY - DAY

           Marlon and Wally stand at the edge of Hudson River.

                                 MARLON
                        Ellen okay?

                                 WALLY
                        Oh, yeah.
                             (off Marlon’s surprised 
                              look)
                        No. You idiot. You destroyed her. 
                        And I’ve got no idea why. Cause 
                        she’s the best thing you got. 
                        Besides me, of course.

           Marlon smiles. He takes out the telegram and hands it to 
           Wally. He begins to read it.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                             (in Marlon Senior’s voice)
                        “Bud. You’re mother and I will be 
                        coming for opening night. Since --

                                 MARLON
                        Damnit, Wally. Be serious. Ask me 
                        if I’m worried. Ask me --

                                 WALLY
                        Serious? Where do you want me to 
                        begin? About Ellen? How you seem to 
                        take pleasure in destroying that 
                        girl. By fucking everything that 
                        moves. That girl Becky. That guy in 
                        your dressing room. 

           Marlon starts to walk away.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        You can’t run from the facts.

           Marlon waves his hand to dismiss Wally. Wally follows.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t give me that. I haven’t been 
                        living with a guy who kept a 
                        raccoon in his apartment. And who 
                        got rid of it for some reason I 
                        can’t figure out. Had a nervous 
                        breakdown when his girlfriend said 
                        she loved him. To get that kind of 
                        treatment.
           Wally grabs Marlon’s shoulder. Turns him back toward him. 
           Sees his eyes with a film of tears.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        If I didn’t get you, if I didn’t 
                        care for you, if I didn’t love you, 
                        would I be here now? Telling you 
                        this in spite of what you do. In 
                        spite...

           Wally trails off as he sees Marlon’s tears turn to laughter.

                                 MARLON
                        I mean...Jesus Wally...I had no 
                        idea you loved me.

           Wally looks at Marlon for a moment. Then jumps on him. They 
           wrestle. Until Wally gets the advantage. Putting Marlon in a 
           choke hold.

                                 WALLY
                        You’re a God damned asshole, Bud. 
                        But I love you. And so does 
                        everyone else.

                                 MARLON
                             (through coughs)
                        Let me go.

                                 WALLY
                        Not until you tell me you love me.

                                 MARLON
                        I love --
                             (cough)
                        -- you.

           Wally lets Marlon free. Marlon watches him walk away.

                                 WALLY
                             (to himself)
                        A fucking asshole. That Bud is. 
                        Fuck, Wally. You got a knack for 
                        choosing friends.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDITORIUM - DAY

           Elia sits next to Mielziner. Looking over some notes. As 
           Mielziner talks to Irene. Who sits behind them. Looking 
           toward the now completed stage set.

                                 IRENE
                        Something’s just not right.

                        Elia wanted a cramped feel to the

                        Just a little bit off. So dreary. 
                        Claustrophobic. Perhaps it’s the 
                        color of the kitchen. Yes. Perhaps 
                        that’s it. Perhaps it’s a color --

                                 TENNESSEE (O.S.)
                        What a stage! Mielziner. It’s 
                        genius.

           Elia, Mielziner, and Irene turn to see Tennessee, his face 
           lit up with a big smile, as he looks admiringly toward the 
           completed stage.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Just as I wanted.

           Tennessee sits next to Irene.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Irene. You look ravishing.

           Elia and Mielziner share a smile as they look toward Irene, 
           now silent with a disgust deepened by Tennessee’s enthusiasm.

                                 IRENE
                        Am I to be kept here all day for 
                        this run through?

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

           Marlon sits in his dressing room. Looking over the Western 
           Union telegram. And Marlon Senior’s letter to Dorothy.

           A knock at the door.

                                 MARLON
                        I’m indisposed.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Do you want me to tell that to Mr. 
                        Kazan?
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        You’re needed on stage.

           Marlon looks down at Marlon Senior’s letter to Dorothy. Folds 
           it up. Puts it away.

           Marlon walks out of his dressing room.
           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - DAY

           Marlon walks onto the stage. In full costume. Pants as tight 
           as can be.

           Marlon ignores Jessica. Now dressed as Blanche. Who also 
           stands on stage. She grows increasingly agitated as he 
           ignores her.

           Marlon instead picks up objects. Looks at them. Sets them 
           down. 

                                 JESSICA
                        Nice of you to show.

           Marlon mumbles in response. Jessica throws up her hands.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        Mumble. When you’re not mumbling, 
                        you’re acting like a psychopath. A

           Marlon grabs Jessica. She struggles to free herself. His grip 
           tightens.

                                 JESSICA (CONT’D)
                        What’re you plannin--

           Marlon slaps Jessica. To the floor. 

           Karl Malden steps forward. 

           Marlon turns to Karl. Panting. Violent. Animalistic.

                                 MARLON
                        What’re you doing here, Mitch?

           Karl looks to Elia. Silently asking if he should intervene. 
           Elia shakes his head.

           Marlon stares at Jessica. A hungry look in his eye. His body 
           heaves as he advances toward her.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I come home. Happy as a clam that 
                        my woman’s had a healthy boy. And 
                        all you got for me is lip. Lipping 
                        about this. Lipping about that. 
                        Lipping. Lipp --

                                 JESSICA
                        Marlon. This isn’t in the script --
                                 MARLON
                        You’re mad. Calling me Marlon.

           Jessica starts to move away as Marlon advances. He grabs her 
           by the ankle. She flips onto her stomach. Tries to claw into 
           the floorboards. Without success.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Blanche du Bois. We’ve had this 
                        date from the beginning.

           Marlon flips her over. Jumps on top of her. Starts to tear 
           away her costume.

                                 JESSICA
                        Marlon! Marlon! Marlon!

                                 MARLON
                        Don’t say that name. It’s Stanley. 
                        Redneck dirt and all. And you like 
                        it. Just like your sister. You like 
                        the --

           Jessica manages to bite Marlon. Which stops him. 

           Marlon stands. Pants. Looks at Jessica on the floor...a 
           sobbing heap of fine dress that’s been torn apart.

           Claps can be heard amidst the sobs. Marlon looks out toward 
           the audience to see...Tennessee with a big smile on his face.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Fidelity! Fidelity! Such fidelity. 
                        I love it.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Marlon sits in his dressing room. Staring vacantly. Oblivious 
           as...

           Elia enters the room. Walks across the room. Sits on a chair 
           near Marlon.

                                 MARLON
                        When my Pop used to cheat on my 
                        Mom. And there was nothing I could 
                        do to help her. He was the only one 
                        that could dull her pain. Make her 
                        feel good again.

           Marlon starts to cry. Elia brings him close. Comforts him as 
           a father would a son.
                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t understand.

                                 ELIA
                        Love is strange, Bud. Love is 
                        strange.

           Elia stands after Marlon’s crying abates.

                                 ELIA (CONT’D)
                        I’m proud of you.

           Elia stands. Leaves. To go to...

           INT./EXT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Elia stands at the front door. Rings the doorbell.

           Elia turns to leave after a long moment. But stops as the 
           door opens.

           Elia turns back to see Molly in the doorway. Neither says 
           anything. Then, from behind Molly...

                                 JUDY (O.S.)
                        Mom?

                                 MOLLY
                        Go to bed.

           Molly turns back to Elia. Assesses him. Broken down. Tired. 
           Unkempt.

           Molly shuts the door.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Molly leans against the door for a moment.

           Molly turns away from the door. Walks into...

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Molly walks through the living room.

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Molly walks into the kitchen. Pours a glass of water. Takes a 
           sip. 
           Then, after a long beat, she throws the glass against the 
           wall. She pulls the dishes from the cabinet. Starts to break 
           them one by one.

           Molly stops only as she hears Katherine’s cry. She walks 
           to...

           INT. ELIA’S BROWNSTONE - KATHERINE’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Molly enters and rushes to Katherine. Picks her up.

                                 MOLLY
                             (through tears)
                        Quiet. Honey. Everything’s fine. 
                        Mommy’s okay. Quiet. Quiet.

           Katherine buries her face into Molly’s neck. Quieting 
           herself. Molly sits in the rocking chair. Katherine and 
           herself once again quiet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RITZ-CARLTON - ELIA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia lays in bed. Asleep. Until a thunderous crash wakes him.

           Elia looks about the room. Begins to doze off again when 
           another crash is followed by screams.

           Elia gets out of bed. He puts his eye to the peephole...

           Peephole POV: Tennessee stands at the door to his room. 
           Shouts...

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Come, Pancho. I was only kidding.

           More muffled Spanish...then...Tennessee opens the door only 
           to duck just in time to avoid...

           A lamp that flies toward the peephole and crashes against 
           Elia’s door.

           Tennessee closes the door. Tears off a piece of his ripped 
           shirt. Ties it to the door handles. To keep the door shut.

           Tennessee rushes to Elia’s door. Looks into the peephole. His 
           face distorted as if seen in a convex mirror. The moisture of 
           his breath fogging the peephole view.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Open up. I know you’re watching.
           Tennessee looks back toward the door. To see...the door knobs 
           move.

                                 ELIA
                        How do you know?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Cause you just answered me.

           Tennessee’s room door is now being violently pounded. Elia 
           finally opens the door.

           Tennessee rushes in. Slams Elia’s door shut. Dead bolts it. 
           Then. Slides down to the floor. 

           Tennessee’s terror slips into a smile. And laughter. As...

           Pancho slams himself against Elia’s door. Shouting Spanish 
           expletives. 

           Tennessee’s now silent. Transfixed by Pancho’s tirade. And as 
           it begins to subside...

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        Mind if I clean up?

           Elia shows Tennessee to the bathroom. Who enters. Begins to 
           clean and tend the minor cuts.

                                 ELIA
                        Is everything okay?

                                 TENNESSEE
                        Yes. Pancho just got a little 
                        heated. I told him Marlon probably 
                        has the dick of Adonis.

                                 ELIA
                        Perhaps you shouldn’t mention those 
                        observations to him anymore.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        You saw Marlon in those pants. It 
                        was impossible to avoid it.

           Tennessee finishes cleaning up.

                                 TENNESSEE (CONT’D)
                        I should get back to the room.

                                 ELIA
                        Are you sure that’s safe?
                                 TENNESSEE
                        Safe? Hasn’t Blanche taught you 
                        anything?
                             (beat)
                        We desire what destroys us.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOROTHY’S APARTMENT - DOROTHY’S BEDROOM - MORNING - 1944

           Marlon enters to find a sickly Dorothy propped up against 
           some pillows.

                                 MARLON
                        How’re you feeling?

           Dorothy looks at Marlon. Who immediately notes her sickly 
           look.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get you some aspirin and 
                        water.

           But before Marlon can leave...

                                 DOROTHY
                        Come here.

           Dorothy pats the bed. Marlon obediently comes next to her. 
           Sits.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it here. I need to go 
                        back to Chicago. To get better.
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        Did you hear --

                                 MARLON
                        He was never there for you. I was. 
                        I was always there. Trying to help 
                        you. To get you better to --

                                 DOROTHY
                             (sharply)
                        There’s nothing you can do.

           Marlon stands. Paces the room.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        Stop fretting. I’m trying --
                                 MARLON
                             (loudly)
                        Why won’t you let me love you?

                                 DOROTHY
                        My head. You --

                                 MARLON
                             (still yelling)
                        Why don’t you want my love?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Quiet. You’ve got --

                                 MARLON
                        Answer me!

                                 DOROTHY
                        It’s his love I need. It’s his love 
                        that I want.

           Marlon looks at Dorothy. A sickly white visage of alcoholism 
           dressed up in a nightgown.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to --

           Marlon leaves. Slamming of the door. Letting Dorothy to melt 
           back into the pillows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

           Marlon dressed nicely. Cleaned up. Stands across from Marlon 
           Senior and Dorothy. His parents looking much older.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        You’re looking better than I 
                        expected. Now. Let’s get some food.

           Marlon looks to Dorothy. Who looks back at Marlon, a soft 
           smile on her face.

                                 DOROTHY
                        We’re so happy to see --

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Are you listening?

                                 MARLON
                        Mom’s just trying to say he--
                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        I’ve had a pit in my stomach since 
                        Pittsburgh. I want food. Not words.

           Marlon looks to Dorothy. Who puts her arm through Marlon 
           Senior’s arm. As Marlon Senior looks around.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Why don’t we get some food?

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Marlon sits rather rigidly. Watching Marlon Senior eat. 
           Hardly any more genteel than how Marlon portrayed Stanley 
           eating.

           Meanwhile, Dorothy tries to get Marlon’s attention...

                                 DOROTHY
                        Your father and I want to say that 
                        we’re sorry. For anything that we’d 
                        done in the past to hurt you. And 
                        if you could find it in yourself to 
                        listen to this and possibly forgive 
                        us, we’d be --

                                 MARLON
                        Forgive you for what?

                                 DOROTHY
                        You can say what’s in your --

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                             (to Dorothy)
                        You heard him. Everything’s fine.
                             (to Marlon)
                        Isn’t it?

                                 MARLON
                        Yeah. Sure.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Very good. Now. Your old man has 
                        taken it upon himself to offer you 
                        his services.

                                 MARLON
                        For what?

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Managing your finances. That’s why 
                        you sent me your contract. Isn’t 
                        it?
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARLON SENIOR (CONT'D)
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        If this thing’s a hit. You’ll be 
                        getting a healthy paycheck for 
                        awhile. But you’ll need to stay 
                        focused. So what of it? Old Bud 
                        Senior and Junior in business 
                        together. An unstoppable father son 
                        combination.

                                 MARLON
                             (in disbelief)
                        Work for me?

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        With you. Not for you. With you.

           Marlon looks to Dorothy. Who nods in affirmation of Marlon 
           Senior’s statement.

           Marlon returns to his food without answering.

                                 MARLON SENIOR (CONT’D)
                        All right. Yes. No need to answer 
                        now. 

           They continue to eat in silence.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - HOTEL - NIGHT

           Marlon stands outside a hotel entrance with Dorothy. Marlon 
           Senior can be seen in the background, checking in with a 
           hotel clerk.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I’m sorry if he was a bit gruff. At 
                        dinner.

           Marlon mumbles. Dorothy raises his chin to her.

                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MARLON
                        Nothing.

                                 DOROTHY
                        A mother can always tell when 
                        something’s wrong.

           Marlon looks at Dorothy for a moment. But before he says 
           anything...Marlon Senior comes outside.
                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        We’re all checked in.

           Dorothy nods to Marlon Senior.

                                 MARLON
                        Night Pop.

           Marlon Senior nods. Walks back inside the hotel. Dorothy 
           returns to Marlon.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Now tell your mother what’s the 
                        matter before she says good night.

                                 MARLON
                        Nervous for the opening. That’s 
                        all. Any advice?

                                 DOROTHY
                        Just don’t make an ass of yourself.

           Dorothy kisses Marlon good night. Goes inside. Leaving Marlon 
           to himself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STELLA’S APARTMENT - ELLEN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Stella lays with Ellen. Who sleeps soundly. Curled up next to 
           her mother.

                                 MARLON (O.S.)
                        Ellen!

           Ellen doesn’t wake. 

                                 MARLON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        If you’re up there. Turn your light 
                        on.

           Stella carefully extricates herself from Ellen. Covers her 
           with the blankets.

           EXT. MANHATTAN - STELLA’S APARTMENT BUILDING - SIMULTANEOUS

           Marlon stands outside the building.

                                 MARLON
                        Turn on the --
           Ellen’s light comes on. A silhouette takes place in the 
           window frame.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        You’re the only one that 
                        understands me. That puts up with 
                        me. And all this. It isn’t me. How 
                        I’ve been with you. How I’ve been 
                        on stage. It’s made me cruel. I 
                        want to get away. From my parents. 
                        From acting. From everything but 
                        you. Let’s skip out on tomorrow.

           The silhouette goes away from the window.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           Marlon sees the light turn off. He deflates. Walks away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - LATER

           Marlon lays in his dirty dressing room. Doesn’t stir at the 
           sound of a knock.

           Another knock. Marlon rises. Goes to the door.

           The opened door reveals Stella, a bag in hand.

                                 STELLA
                        I thought you’d never answer.

           Stella enters, sits at the desk, and sets her bag down. Pulls 
           out a black turtle neck and black slacks from the bag.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Put these on.

           Stella takes her gloves off while watching Marlon put on the 
           black turtle neck and slacks.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        Much better.

                                 MARLON
                        You didn’t just come by to give me 
                        new clothes.

                                 STELLA
                        Ellen told me about what you said 
                        to her. Through hours of tears. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STELLA (CONT'D)
                        I’d just sedated her when you came 
                        along and --

                                 MARLON
                        It was you in the window. Listening 
                        to me. What a dirty trick you --

                                 STELLA
                        Marlon Brando!

           Stella stands. She moves toward Marlon. He falls back into a 
           chair.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t suffered you this long to 
                        let you throw everything --

                                 MARLON
                        I don’t give a shit!

           Stella stares at Marlon for a moment. Slaps him. Marlon looks 
           up at her with incredibly wounded eyes.

                                 STELLA
                        Have I not given you what your 
                        mother denied you? Have I not given 
                        you the love that you crave? And in 
                        giving you this love, what have I 
                        asked? All I have ever tried to do 
                        is to show you that you are not a 
                        coward, that you have the strength 
                        to confront, to feel, to use your 
                        pain.
                             (off Marlon’s silence)
                        Myself, Tennessee, Harold, Elia, 
                        have sacrificed so much of our 
                        lives to theater. Working for this 
                        moment. A moment that cannot and 
                        will not be denied. Do you 
                        understand?
                             (off Marlon’s nod)
                        Now hand me my gloves.

           Marlon hands Stella her gloves. She slides her fingers into 
           them.

                                 STELLA (CONT’D)
                        I will tell Ellen what you said.

           Stella gives Marlon a kiss on the forehead, leaves.
           Marlon sits alone. The sound of camera flashbulbs going off 
           leads to...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - BARRYMORE THEATER - DAY

           An extravagant red carpet scene. Star cluttered. Clark Gable, 
           Cary Grant, Humphrey Bogart. And in the middle of this scene 
           is Irene. With her father, Louis B. Mayer next to her.

           Irene poses for the cameras.

           Next comes Harold and Stella. Dressed to the nines. Only to 
           be followed by...

           Ellen escorted by Wally. Wally hamming it up for the cameras.

           The glamorous mob scene is in stark contrast to...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

           Elia moves about the busy, crammed control room. Talking to a 
           stage engineer.

                                 ELIA
                        Make sure the first cue on Stanley 
                        happens a moment before he comes on 
                        to the stage and...and...

           Elia looks toward the stage. In doing so, he sees...Molly.

                        Let backstage know. We’re on in 
                        five.

           The Production Assistant scampers off.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Stage Manager moves through the backstage.
                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        On in five. On in five.

           Stage Manager goes to Marlon’s dressing room.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marlon sits in his dressing room. Looking at Marlon Senior’s 
           letter to Dorothy.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        On in five, Mr. Brando.

                                 MARLON
                        Yeah. Yeah.

           Marlon folds up the note. Puts it into his pocket. He quickly 
           runs to...

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Marlon enters the bathroom. Looks at himself in the mirror. 
           Ghost white face. Tinge of sickly green.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Brando! You’re on in three.

           Marlon pauses at this information. Vomits into a nearby trash 
           can. Washes off his face. Wets his hair. Walks out. Still 
           looking sickly.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon walks to the edge of the stage, stops next to the 
           Stage Manager.

           Marlon looks out to see Kim and Jessica performing the 
           opening of the play.

           Marlon’s eyes drift toward the audience. He finds Dorothy and 
           Marlon Senior. 

           Marlon stares at his parents watching the play, absorbed to 
           the point that he does not see Kim pass him as she exits the 
           stage.

           The Stage Manager shakes Marlon’s shoulder.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        You’re on.
           Marlon gives the Stage Manager a confused look. The Stage 
           Manager nods toward the stage, where Jessica moves about 
           awaiting Marlon’s entrance.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        You’re on.

           Marlon’s moment has arrived. He walks onto the stage.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon walks across the stage toward Jessica. He bumps into 
           stage props as he contends with the blinding lights.

           Marlon looks forward to see...Jessica staring at his 
           bewildered movements.

                                 JESSICA
                        Y-y--y-you must be Stanley. I’m 
                        Blanche.

           Marlon looks at Jessica for another moment. She looks scared 
           stiff. Not stage fright. But, rather, a real, terrible fear 
           for what Marlon might do to her.

           Marlon stares at Jessica for a moment. Seeming to search for 
           something. As his hand goes to his pocket. He touches the 
           note.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Dorothy is on the couch. Tired. Drunk. On the verge of tears.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Oh, Bud. The magic. Make me 
                        believe. In the magic. Take me 
                        away.

           Close in on young Marlon’s pupils. And...

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT 

           Marlon with his gaze still on Jessica. Still in dead silence.
           Marlon picks a prop from the table on stage. Quiet as can be. 
           Looks at it. Slowly circling Jessica at the same time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - AUDIENCE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Irene sits next to Louis B. Mayer. She closes her eyes. 
           Unable to bear Marlon’s pause.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Tennessee sits just behind Irene and Louis B. Mayer. Next to 
           Poncho. Squeezing his hand until its nearly white from 
           pressure.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Elia sits in the midst of the rest of the control room peons. 
           All awaiting breathlessly for Marlon to respond.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           Marlon finally looks back toward Jessica.

                                 MARLON
                        Stella’s sister?

           Jessica’s so surprised she can’t respond. Marlon does it for 
           her. Supplying her line.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                        Yes?

           Jessica simply nods. And off that...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mielziner, now in the control room, pats Elia on the back. 
           Elia turns to Mielziner. Gives a relieved nod.

                                 ELIA
                        Let’s hope Jessica can keep it 
                        together.

           Off that...

                                 JESSICA (V.O.)
                             (terrified)
                        I warn you, don’t. I’m in danger.
                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           Jessica squares off against Marlon, a glass bottle in her 
           hand. The fear in her eyes is not acting.

           Marlon smiles wryly, takes a step toward Jessica. She smashes 
           the bottle on the prop table, holding the broken end toward 
           him.

                                 MARLON
                        What did you do that for?

                                 JESSICA
                        So I could twist the broken end in 
                        your face!

                                 MARLON
                        Oh! So you want some rough house! 
                        All right, let’s have some rough 
                        house.

           Marlon leaps toward Jessica. She raises her arm to strike him 
           with the broken end of the bottle. He catches her wrist.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                             (screaming)
                        Drop the bottle top! Drop it! We’ve 
                        had this date with each other from 
                        the beginning!

           Jessica stares into Marlon’s crazed eyes. Trumpets and drums 
           fill the silence. She drops the broken bottle.

           Jessica falls to the ground before Marlon’s feet. He picks 
           her up, carries her to the bedroom on stage. The lights dim 
           as the drums beat harder. As the stage goes dark...

           Marlon looks down to see Jessica staring up at him, truly 
           terrified. He pulls off of her, exits the stage.

           The Stage Manager intercepts Marlon.

                                 STAGE MANAGER
                        Mr. Kazan wants you to be soaking 
                        for the last scene.

           Marlon looks at the Stage Manager in quiet disbelief.
                                 STAGE MANAGER (CONT’D)
                        Just relaying the message.

           The Stage Manager nods toward an ad hoc shower.

           Marlon goes to the shower, stands beneath it. He is soon 
           soaked, as Alex North’s jazzy STREETCAR theme song starts to 
           play.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - STAGE - NIGHT

           Marlon walks out to the gasp of the crowd. Excited seeing him 
           soaked through. The clothes clinging snugly to his body. 
           Making him look all the animal that Stanley is.

           Marlon goes to the foot of the staircase. And...

                                 MARLON
                        Stella. Hey, Stella!

           Kim descends the staircase. Toward Marlon. They embrace. As 
           North’s jazz score crescendoes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - ELIA’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Elia enters his office. Sits down. Listens to applause. 

           Elia turns his chair toward the wall. Stares ahead.

           The door opens. Clearly, now, the calls of, “Bravo”.

           Elia turns to see Molly. Neither says anything.

                                 MOLLY
                        I hate that I love you.

           Elia stands. Goes to Molly. He embraces her. Her defiance 
           gives way. As the applause grows to more deafening volumes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           Tennessee is on the stage. Taking the bow with the rest of

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - MARLON’S DRESSING ROOM - 
           SIMULTANEOUS

           Marlon sits alone in his dressing room. Doesn’t move as Ellen 
           enters. Briefly letting in the applause.

           Ellen stands behind Marlon. Her hands are balled in a fist.

           Marlon turns to look at her.

                                 MARLON
                        You want to hit me?

           Marlon and Ellen hold each other’s stare. After a moment, she 
           grabs his hair, brings his face against her stomach.

           Marlon wraps his arms around Ellen’s waist, burying his face 
           into her stomach. She runs her hands through his hair.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                             (into her stomach)
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m --

           A knock interrupts.

                                 STAGE MANAGER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Williams has requested your 
                        presence at the curtain.

           Marlon doesn’t move away from Ellen. Another knock.

                                 ELLEN
                        Go. I’ll be waiting for you at 
                        home.

           Marlon nods. Leaves the dressing room.

           INT. BARRYMORE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon walks along. Oblivious to the congratulatory applause 
           from the stage hands that he passes.

           The Stage Manager turns to Marlon. Indicates for him to wait 
           a moment. As they stop just off stage right. So that Marlon 
           can see Tennessee bow. And bow.

           Tennessee comes to Marlon. Hugs him tightly.

                                 TENNESSEE
                        My boy. My boy. Go. Let the world 
                        applaud your genius. For tomorrow 
                        you shall play the great Dane!
           Marlon walks out onto the stage. The applause somehow 
           inestimably louder than it was for Tennessee.

           Marlon stands in the spotlight. Flowers piling up around him.

           Marlon squints to see...Marlon Senior cheering Marlon. Eyes 
           glimmering at thought of the money to come.

           Marlon and Dorothy finally meet eyes. She cries. At the sound 
           and sight of her lauded son.

           Marlon looks away. Back to the rest of the audience. Staring 
           out. Blinded by the spotlight that doesn’t move. The applause 
           growing louder. The flower pile growing at his feet.

           The applause fades as...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MANHATTAN - GREENWICH VILLAGE - MARLON’S APARTMENT 
           BUILDING - LATER

           Marlon and Dorothy stand outside his apartment building. 
           Marlon now in the black turtle neck and slacks.

           Marlon Senior waits in an idling taxicab.

                                 MARLON
                        Did I make an ass of myself?

           Dorothy looks at Marlon. She shakes her head. She hugs him, 
           seemingly for the first time feeling the fullness of her 
           love.

                                 DOROTHY
                        Promise you won’t get mad at what 
                        I’m about to say?

                                 MARLON
                        I promise.

                                 DOROTHY
                        I was trying to tell you last 
                        night. That your father was fired. 
                        He needs to work for you. Oh, Bud. 
                        It’s terrible. I’m afraid he might 
                        relapse if you say no. 

           Marlon continues to hug Dorothy. He looks towards Marlon 
           Senior sitting in the taxi cab.
                                 DOROTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid that the darkness will 
                        start all over again...

           Dorothy tapers off into tears. Marlon looks at her a moment. 
           Starts to wipe away her tears.

                                 MARLON
                        Of course Pop can work for me. All 
                        that darkness is behind us.

           Marlon hugs Dorothy until a honk from the taxi interrupts.

                                 MARLON SENIOR
                        Let’s get a move on.

           Dorothy kisses Marlon good night, gets into the cab.

           Marlon watches the taxi drive away. His face is a piece of 
           placid work, completely silent and still. Stoic as he 
           appears, he is dying inside.

           Marlon waits until the taxi is out of sight. He walks inside.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon enters the apartment. Finds Ellen and Wally looking at 
           an early edition of the NEW YORK TIMES.

                                 MARLON
                        What’s it say?

           Marlon goes to the kitchen.

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon pulls out a loaf of bread and a peanut butter jar. 
           Makes a sandwich.

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        You’re the sexiest thing to hit 
                        Broadway. Ever.

           Marlon walks back into...

           INT. MARLON’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marlon goes to the window. He opens it, sits on the sill, and 
           looks out toward the city.
                                 MARLON
                        Everything’s changed. But nothing’s 
                        different.

           Marlon takes a bite of his peanut butter sandwich.

                                 MARLON (CONT’D)
                             (to Wally)
                        You know Streets of Laredo?

           Wally starts singing, “Streets of Laredo,” in a John 
           Waynesque fashion. 

           Marlon takes out the faded yellow note. Looks at it for a 
           moment. Tears it up. Lets the pieces fly out the window.

           Marlon listens to Wally. Continues eating his peanut butter 
           sandwich. Stares out at the city.

           POSTSCRIPT:

               STREETCAR became a Broadway, and later, a Hollywood hit. It 
           is now considered a classic work in American literature, 
           theater and cinema and is credited with establishing Brando
           as one of the greatest actors of his generation and the 
           twentieth century. 

           Marlon's mother Dorothy remained with Marlon Sr all their 
           lives, but true to his word he employed his father until his 
           death in 1965.

           Marlon's fame never stopped his longing to be loved. His life 
           was filled with public, tumultuous love affairs, with both 
           men and women, resulting in him fathering 15 children.
