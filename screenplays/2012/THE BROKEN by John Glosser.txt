                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           It’s 1967. Oklahoma.

           A hand. Black and blue. Dirt under the nails. An arm.

           Freshly tilled soil props up the whole arm as if it were 
           reaching towards the heavens in plea.

           His body. The BOY’S (20ish) body grotesque. Blood like 
           hardened magma. Twisted in horror and wounded in unspeakable 
           ways.

           An old tractor’s front wheel all but touches the boy’s torso.

           Sheriff ROBERT CLEMENS (55), bloated, pale, and disinterested 
           towers over the corpse with clinical eyes and an earnest 
           tongue.

                                 CLEMENS
                        He sure is dead.

           The Deputy, FRANK BASTOGNE (38), kneels next to the Dead... 
           taking a little soil between the fingers...

                                 BASTOGNE
                        He sure is. Do you think it was an 
                        accident?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Yep.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Sure looks that way.

           Clemens looks up at the tractor. Gesturing as he 
           illustrates...

                                 CLEMENS
                        He somehow fell in front of the 
                        tractor while doing his work. The 
                        boy shouldn’t been operating a 
                        tractor yet. Only 3 weeks on the 
                        farm. First farm job. Doesn’t make 
                        no sense to put him on this task.

           Clemens wipes the sweat from under his nose with a 
           handkerchief.
                                 BASTOGNE
                        Doesn’t make no sense at all, 
                        Sheriff. Do you want to fine Farmer 
                        Thompson?

                                 CLEMENS
                        For what? Hiring a foolish boy? 
                        Them’s all be paying fines if 
                        that’s the case.

           They laugh.

           The FLIES are starting to encroach. Bastogne flips open his 
           note pad. Pen in hand. 

                                 BASTOGNE
                        What’s the boy’s name?

           The boy’s ghastly face. His cornea torn.

           Clemens is about to speak as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MACHINE SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Sparks flare in the shielded face of EUGENE GORD (46) as he 
           works cutting steel. Even through his thickly protected eyes 
           we can see that his soul has been damaged. His psyche 
           continuously buffered by a controlled, trained intensity.

           The FOREMAN steps in front of him.

                                 FOREMAN
                        How ya doin’, Gord?

           Without missing a beat, the foreman continues his patrol, 
           clearly not expecting engagement.

           Gord lifts his mask. Sweat and grease caked on his face. 
           Taking off his mask completely we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET - TWILIGHT

           Gord is driving home in a circa 1950 truck, on its last legs. 
           Listening to the silence and the BREEZE.
           INT. GORD’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord’s home is cleaner than we’d expect. 

           Newspapers and magazines from the WWII era are stacked knee 
           high intermittently throughout his modest space.

           INT. GORD’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Gord washes his hands and face. The warm water feels good.

           Opening the cupboard he pulls down a fifth of cheap but 
           honest bourbon and pours himself a small glass.

           He spots a housefly BUZZING around a window.

           Gord takes an empty water glass and covers the fly against 
           the window. Making sure to not harm it, he gently slides a 
           magazine underneath the water glass, trapping the fly.

           EXT. GORD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Gord releases the fly.

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gord sits and closes his eyes -- clearly affected.

           Closing his eyes tightly, for a moment, we hear the 
           unmistakable sounds of WAR...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GORD’S GARAGE - LATER

           Gord strikes on the light to reveal a sculptural work in 
           progress. It’s of a man’s hand. Open as if it is reaching for 
           something. A thick scar runs diagonally across the palm.

           Gord continues the work until it is interrupted by a KNOCK.

           INT. GORD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           JON STEVENS (21) is at the door. Exuding youthful perfection, 
           he wears his formal army sergeant’s uniform as if it were his 
           own skin -- appearing unscathed by the war he just fought.

           Jon’s presence brings light to even Gord’s day.
                                 GORD
                        Well howdy, Jon.

                                 JON
                        Howdy, sir.

                                 GORD
                        You’re back. Safely. Glad to see.

                                 JON
                        I made Rangers.

           Gord eyes the Rangers’ emblem.

                                 GORD
                        Would you like to come in?

                                 JON
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GORD
                        Quit calling me sir. You already 
                        make me feel old enough.

           Jon smiles as he walks in...

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jon removes his hat. They sit.

                                 GORD
                        I just brewed some coffee--

                                 JON
                        Thanks. I’m fine. 

                                 GORD
                        Are you old enough for whiskey?

                                 JON
                             (smiling infectiously)
                        I’m fine. How have you been getting 
                        along, sir?

                                 GORD
                        Oh...staying out of trouble. 
                        Keeping my head down and my mouth 
                        shut.

           Jon fiddles with his hat.
                                 JON
                        Is Trent around? It sure be great 
                        to see him.

           Gord stands, uncomfortable. He grabs some periodicals off the 
           table and stacks them neatly on an adjacent pile.

                                 GORD
                        I’m afraid not. He moved out a 
                        while back.

                                 JON
                        How can I get a hold of him? I’d 
                        really like to see him.

                                 GORD
                        We aren’t exactly on speaking terms 
                        right now, son. But I’m sure a 
                        Ranger like yourself can track him 
                        down.

           Jon smiles sheepishly.

                                 JON
                        Okay.

                                 GORD
                        Sure I can’t get you something?

                                 JON
                        I’m going back, Mr. Gord.

                                 GORD
                        Where?

                                 JON
                        To Vietnam, of course.

           Gord sits.

                                 GORD
                        Coming back twice is harder than 
                        coming back once.

                                 JON
                        You came back more than twice.

                                 GORD
                        That was even harder.

                                 JON
                        That ain’t the point.
                                 GORD
                        Well if the point’s to die you are 
                        on the right track.

           Jon looks down to avoid conflict.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                             (pointing emphatically -- 
                              searching for words)
                        Them gooks do things different. It 
                        ain’t like the wars I fought.

           Jon stands, confused. Offended.

                                 JON
                        You’re making me uncomfortable, 
                        sir. If you were somebody else I 
                        might be obliged to be a little 
                        more direct.

           Jon heads for the door...

                                 GORD
                        If you find my son, please send him 
                        my best.

                                 JON
                        You should’ve let him sign up, sir.

           Gord hangs his head.

                                 GORD
                        He couldn’t have handled it. He 
                        wasn’t built for it.

                                 JON
                        That ain’t for you to decide.

                                 GORD
                        I didn’t. Army doctors did. Blame 
                        who you like. It don’t matter.

           John walks out.

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           Gord’s eyes are open as he lay fully clothed on top of his 
           neatly made bed.

           -- THE SOUNDS OF MACHINE GUN FIRE GIVE WAY TO KNOCKING at the 
           front door --
           INT. GORD’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord opens the front door. Morning light searing.

           Sheriff BRAD ZIN (59) waits, hat off. 

                                 ZIN
                        Morning, Gord. May I come in?

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           They sit around a coffee table.

                                 GORD
                        I just brewed some coffee. 
                        Well...yesterday. It still works.

                                 ZIN
                        No, thank you.

           Zin removes his hat as he picks up a paper off the table 
           headlined ‘BATTLE OF THE BULGE’.

                                 GORD
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Please. Put that down. Paper don’t 
                        like the oils on the skin.

           He obliges.

                                 ZIN
                        The best way for me to do this is 
                        jump right in.

           Gord looks up.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Gord, your son...

                                 GORD
                        What about him?

                                 ZIN
                        I’m sorry, Gord. 
                             (struggling)
                        He’s joined the almighty. 

           Zin is not very good at these conversations.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Accident. Tractor accident.
           Gord falls inward, leaning back, displaying a sort of 
           emptiness...

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        If you need to talk to someone, 
                        besides myself that is, there is no 
                        shame in that. How about that 
                        doctor you talked to after the war?

                                 GORD
                             (distant)
                        She ain’t a head doctor.

                                 ZIN
                        What difference does it make? She’s 
                        a doctor.

                                 GORD
                        Yeah.

                                 ZIN
                        They want you to identify the body. 
                        Up in Holdman County. Contact the 
                        Sheriff's office there.

           Zin leaves a small piece of paper with a number penciled on 
           it.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        The number’s there.

                                 GORD
                             (distancing himself)
                        That boy’s been nothing but 
                        trouble.

                                 ZIN
                        Do you want me to go with you? 

           Gord looks at Zin, shaking his head. 

                                 GORD
                             (ashamed)
                        Can it wait until the weekend? My 
                        boss isn’t the understanding type.

                                 ZIN
                        I’ll arrange that with Sheriff. 
                        Shouldn’t be a problem.

           Zin stands.
                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                             (forcing a little levity)
                        It isn’t too late for you to be a 
                        deputy. Probably squeeze a few 
                        years out of ya, yet.

                                 GORD
                        That ain’t for me. 

                                 ZIN
                        That’s hard to believe.

           Zin opens the door to leave.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        You let me know if the emotions 
                        catch up with you. 

           Zin eyes a lone cereal box in the minimalist nearby 
           kitchen...

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        You still eat cereal for dinner?

                                 GORD
                        Sometimes.

                                 ZIN
                        Why don’t you come over? Put 
                        somethin’ real in your gut. It’s 
                        been a long time, Gord. Too long.

                                 GORD
                        Sounds nice.

                                 ZIN
                        I’m sorry for your loss.

           The sound of the door CLOSING. Light shifting.

           INT. GORD’S GARAGE - LATER

           Gord enters in a quiet rage. 

           Picking up an axe, he HACKS THREE TIMES at his sculpture --

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Gord walks into the bar which looks more like a converted 
           barn. An old speak easy. Space for gambling but those gaming 
           tables are twenty years departed.

           The PATRONS, scattered amongst low-rise tables, are surprised 
           by Gord’s presence. He bellies up to the bar.

           The BARTENDER, late thirties, slides a napkin in front of 
           Gord. He too is startled by the visitor.

                                 BARTENDER
                        I’m afraid they don’t make your 
                        sipping whiskey no more, Gord.

                                 GORD
                        I’ll take what you got.

           The bartender pours.

                                 BARTENDER
                        It’s good to see you here, Gord. Me 
                        and the boys are going hunting next 
                        weekend. We’d love to be shown a 
                        thing or two.

                                 GORD
                        I don’t shoot animals. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Just people.

           Gord looks up at the bartender.

           The bartender moves along respectfully. Gord sips his drink.

           A large man, BENJAMIN (40ish) enters with a companion of 
           similar age and size, DAN. They are intoxicated.

                                 BARTENDER (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Oh lord.

           Patrons calmly watch the men as they make their way to the 
           bar, sitting on the opposite end of Gord.

                                 BENJAMIN
                             (to Bartender)
                        Bring us a couple of beers. We’re 
                        trying to sober up for the ride 
                        home.

           The drunks share an obnoxious LAUGH.
           Gord looks briefly at the man.

           The bartender cautiously approaches -- bringing the beers.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Is my credit still good here?

           The bartender wipes his hands wishing he could do more, then 
           walks away.

                                 DAN
                             (laughing)
                        I guess so!

           Benjamin takes a slurp, then SHOUTS at Gord:

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Where you from? I haven’t seen you 
                        around before.

           Gord sips his whiskey, ignoring him.

                                 DAN
                        Aren’t you going to answer the man?

           Benjamin takes another drink.

                                 BENJAMIN
                             (to Dan)
                        Maybe he’s deaf.

                                 DAN
                        Maybe.

                                 BARTENDER
                        That’s enough.

           Benjamin pounds his beer then holds it back as if he is going 
           to throw it at the bartender --

           -- The bartender cowers --

           -- Benjamin slams the glass down on the bar hard enough to 
           crack but not shatter the glass --

                                 BENJAMIN
                        That’s what I thought. Damn queer 
                        bar.

           Dan finishes his beer then drops his glass on the floor. It 
           shatters.
                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                             (referring to the glass)
                        You can put that on my tab too.

           A beat, then:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                             (smiling and gazing at 
                              Gord)
                        Let’s leave them queers to them 
                        queerish affairs. 

           The drunken pair walk out.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Damn Sheriff’s brother.

                                 GORD
                        Sheriff? Zin don’t have no brother.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Different Sheriff.

                                 GORD
                        Which one?

                                 BARTENDER
                        Clemens. Up in Holdman county.

                                 GORD
                             (nodding)
                        I’m heading that way soon.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What that hell you going to that 
                        shit hole for?

           Gord thinks for a moment, then:

                                 GORD
                             (whiskey almost to his 
                              lips)
                        Nothin’.

           We can hear their motorcycles FIRE UP outside as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN

           Gord passes a pristine lake in his own county as he 
           approaches the Holdman county line...
           Crossing over, we see the wide plains give way to nothing. A 
           poorly maintained road splits the, dry, infertile land...

           Gord’s truck thunders laboriously towards the horizon...

           INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Silence. Not a thing. Just Gord, the breeze, and the 
           flickering dawn...

           EXT. SHERIFF’S STATION - DAY

           Gord’s truck pulls into the lot outside the deteriorating 
           building...

           INT. SHERIFF’S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           A RECEPTIONIST keeps the front tidy despite it being riddled 
           with unfinished repairs. The renovation is overdue. A fan 
           whips unsteadily from above...

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        How may I help you, sir?

           Gord stands over her. Hat in hand.

                                 GORD
                        I’m here to see the Sheriff.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You have an appointment?

                                 GORD
                        I’m not sure.

           She looks at him funny.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        You Mr. Gord? Sheriff wasn’t too 
                        happy about coming in on a 
                        Saturday.

                                 GORD
                        You’re in on Saturday.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                             (deflecting)
                        Just be a minute.
           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Sheriff Clemens invites Gord to sit down. His office is 
           filled with fish and game trophies. A man whose insecurities 
           require the clustered hanging of animal heads on walls. Not 
           as if in sport, but in conquest. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        Please, Mr. Gord. Have a seat. I 
                        have to ask some obligatory 
                        questions before I can take you 
                        down to the coroner.

                                 GORD
                        Sheriff Zin told you who I am.

                                 CLEMENS
                        I know, sir. This must be 
                        difficult. I created this 
                        questionnaire myself for the 
                        department. Helps streamline 
                        investigations.

                                 GORD
                             (sarcastically)
                        That’s convenient. 

           Clemens is following his typed questionnaire. He fills in the 
           blanks as he goes.

                                 CLEMENS
                             (clearing his throat)
                        What’s the boy’s name?

                                 GORD
                        Trent.

                                 CLEMENS
                        How long has it been since you’ve 
                        seen him?

                                 GORD
                        Two years.

                                 CLEMENS
                        He run away?

                                 GORD
                        No. He was 18 and I kicked him out.

                                 CLEMENS
                        For what?
                                 GORD
                        I don’t see what this has to do 
                        with anything.

                                 CLEMENS
                        You don’t need to see. The law 
                        needs to. 

           Clemens CRACKS his knuckles.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Why did you kick the boy out?

                                 GORD
                        We didn’t see eye to eye.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Were you abusive?

                                 GORD
                        Not to my family.

           Clemens puts down his pencil.

                                 CLEMENS
                        What did your boy act like?

                                 GORD
                             (why is he asking?)
                        He acted fine.

                                 CLEMENS
                        And the boy’s mother? 

                                 GORD
                        She left went he was two.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Her name?

                                 GORD
                        Claudine. She may be dead. Heavy on 
                        the sauce. Heavier than anyone I 
                        ever come across.

           Clemens feigns sympathy, then shifts gears.

                                 CLEMENS
                        How would you like his personal 
                        effects dealt with? He had no money 
                        that we can find. Just some clothes 
                        and a radio.
                                 GORD
                        Those can be given to charity.

                                 CLEMENS
                             (beaming)
                        The only charity we have down here 
                        is the church.

           Gord doesn’t respond.

           Clemens takes notes.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Okay, why don’t we shuffle on down 
                        to the morgue?

           INT. MORGUE - LATER

           Turquoise trim. Odd for a morgue.

           Ubiquitous fluorescent light makes visible what shouldn’t be. 
           A good quarter of the bulbs need replacing.

           The CORONER, FRANK BLANE, leads the Sheriff and Gord down a 
           hall...

           They are led into a room...

           Pitch black for a moment until the light is STRUCK ON...

           The coroner pulls out the corpse cabinet. Trent’s body is not 
           covered...

                                 CLEMENS
                        Don’t you at least have the decency 
                        to cover the body, Frank?

                                 BLANE
                        Decency, yes. Funds, no.

                                 CLEMENS
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Gord. Is that your 
                        son?

                                 GORD
                        Yes.

           Gord is surprised by his son’s brutal remains. 

           Gord addresses Blane:

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        My boy got an autopsy, right?
                                 BLANE
                        No, sir. I’m not a doctor. I’m an 
                        elected official.

                                 GORD
                        Don’t you think an autopsy is in 
                        order...?

                                 BLANE
                        Sheriff would have to order it. 
                        Bring in an M.D. from another 
                        county. No doctor qualified in this 
                        jurisdiction.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Despite his lack of applicable 
                        education, he is a fine coroner. 
                        Would you like to see the scene of 
                        the accident, Mr. Gord? I can walk 
                        you through what happened. 

                                 GORD
                        Please.

                                 CLEMENS
                        I’m sorry, we simply do not have 
                        the funds to bring in outside 
                        doctors. Unless the evidence of 
                        foul play is compelling, which it 
                        is not. The opposite, in fact.

           EXT. FARM - DUSK

           Gord and the Sheriff walk carefully between the recently 
           tilled earth.

                                 CLEMENS
                        This is where it happened...

           Clemens lays out the scene with hand gesture. Nothing but 
           farm land.

           Gord looks around as if he is supposed to see something.

                                 GORD
                        I don’t see no tractor.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Tractor had to be moved.

                                 GORD
                        Where?
                                 CLEMENS
                        Back to John Deere. Had to get 
                        flesh parts cleaned out and all--

           -- Sheriff catches himself --

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Mr. Gord. Mighty 
                        insensitive of me. Wasn’t thinking.

                                 GORD
                        What’s the farmer’s name? The one 
                        my boy worked for.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Mr. Thompson.

           Clemens doesn’t like the question.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        What do you do for a living, Mr. 
                        Gord?

                                 GORD
                        Thank you for your time, Sheriff.

                                 CLEMENS
                             (smiling at the successful 
                              deflection)
                        Pleasure’s mine.

           Gord turns to walk away.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Oh. One more thing...how would you 
                        like the remains dealt with?

                                 GORD
                        I’ll collect him tomorrow.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Do you need a casket? We have a 
                        superb undertaker--

                                 GORD
                        No. I’ll build one in the morning.

           EXT. HORIZON - LATER

           The blood red Sun sets into infinity...
                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

           Gord wakes. His eyelids flutter to the cadence of a 
           disciplined MACHINE GUN.

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - MORNING

           Gord is having lumber freshly cut by a YOUNG MAN...

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        What are you building, mister?

                                 GORD
                        Casket.

           Taken off guard, the young man pauses for a moment...

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Did you lose interest?

           The youth continues cutting...

           EXT. FARM - DAY

           Gord and his truck pull up to the Thompson farm.

           Farmer Thompson approaches the truck.

           Gord dismounts.

                                 THOMPSON
                        What can I do for you?

                                 GORD
                        I was hoping you’d let me use your 
                        tools.

                                 THOMPSON
                        And why would I do that?

                                 GORD
                        My son perished on your land.

                                 THOMPSON
                             (uncomfortable)
                        You’re the father?
            A beat, then:

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        What are you building?

                                 GORD
                        A casket. For my son.

                                 THOMPSON
                        You got the wood?

           Gord puts his hand on the bed of his pickup, indicating that 
           he does have it.

           Thompson peeks in the back, seeing the stacks of lumber.

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        It’s the least I can do.

           INT. WORK SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord is led in to the well-supplied shed by Thompson. 

           Turning on the light:

                                 THOMPSON
                        Make yourself at home. Anything 
                        you’ll need should be at arms 
                        length.

                                 GORD
                        Thank you. I’ll find it.

           INT. THOMPSON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Thompson picks up the rotary phone and dials.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Hello...Sheriff...the boy’s father 
                        came up here...well, he is here, 
                        rather...no I don’t need you to 
                        come up...he’s building a casket 
                        for the boy. Needed tools...sure, 
                        I’ll give you a call when he 
                        leaves...just thought you should 
                        know.

           He hangs up the phone.
           INT. SHERIFF CLEMENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff hangs up the phone. He isn’t happy that Gord’s been 
           sticking around.

           EXT. FARM - HIGH NOON

           The Sun has reached its zenith. 

           Parched soil. 

           Radiating heat.

           INT. WORK SHED - CONTINUOUS

           Gord is sweating through the final stages of the casket’s 
           construction.

           Thompson enters.

                                 THOMPSON
                        You’re a fast worker.

           Gord puts down a tool.

                                 GORD
                        Was my boy a good worker?

                                 THOMPSON
                        Yes.

                                 GORD
                        Did he have any friends?

                                 THOMPSON
                        My boy and yours got along pretty 
                        well.

                                 GORD
                        You think I could talk to him?

                                 THOMPSON
                             (defensive)
                        Who?

                                 GORD
                        Well a conversation with my son is 
                        gonna have to wait.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Well, my boy’s not here right now.
           Gord picks up a tool.

                                 GORD
                        I’ll be out of here in an hour or 
                        so.

                                 THOMPSON
                        No hurry. 

                                 GORD
                        Thank you.

           INT. MORGUE - LATER

           Gord and Blane carefully lift the boy’s body into the casket.

           The Sheriff looks on with interest.

           EXT. MORGUE - DUSK

           Casket now in the bed of the truck, Gord covers it with a 
           tarp.

           The Sheriff extends a hand...

                                 CLEMENS
                        I’m sorry about your loss.

           Gord shakes his hand succinctly.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we could bring prompt 
                        closure to this matter. As I said, 
                        tax collection ain’t what it used 
                        to be.

                                 GORD
                        Maybe you should build some lakes. 
                        Seems to serve our county well.

           Clemens sours.

           Gord then gets in the truck and drives away.

           INT. DINER - NIGHT

           Gord’s truck pulls up outside. He gets out and enters the 
           diner. There is a section for whites and a section for 
           blacks.
           Marge Stevens (39), attractive, solid, is wiping down the 
           counter top...

                                 MARGE
                        Well hello, dear. I heard about 
                        your son. I’m so very sorry. 

                                 GORD
                        Marge, I’ve got a favor to ask.

           EXT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Both Gord and Marge are looking at the casket in the bed of 
           his truck.

                                 MARGE
                        Excuse my language, but how the 
                        hell are we gonna move this sweet 
                        boy all by our little selves? I’m 
                        flattered that you think I’ve got 
                        the strength but the “inner” 
                        doesn’t always work it out with the 
                        “outer”.

                                 GORD
                        What about your boy?

                                 MARGE
                        He’s a little irritated with you 
                        right now. And he’s no boy no more. 
                        He’s a man.

                                 GORD
                             (humbly)
                        Yeah.

                                 MARGE
                        But I can’t think of a better 
                        solution. Be right back.

           INT. DINER’S WALK IN FRIDGE - LATER

           Gord and Jon Stevens carefully push the casket into the walk-
           in fridge. They stop and catch their breath while they look 
           down where Trent sleeps.

                                 JON
                        I just can’t believe it. Boys 
                        survive years in combat, and Trent 
                        gets it from a tractor. Damn 
                        tragedy.
                                 GORD
                        Ain’t nothing can be done now.

           Jon looks at Gord in disbelief. 

                                 JON
                        How do you know that it was an 
                        accident?

                                 MARGE (O.S.)
                        Watch your tongue, boy.

                                 GORD
                             (to Jon)
                        What the hell are you talking 
                        about?

                                 JON
                        It doesn’t make no sense, sir. The 
                        lot of it. I knew him well enough 
                        to know that he wouldn’t end up 
                        like this. He may have been 
                        different from you but the boy was 
                        methodical. As methodical as you.

                                 GORD
                        It doesn’t have to make sense. 
                        Haven’t you learned that in the 
                        jungle, kid?

                                 JON
                        Apparently not.

           Jon walks out -- stopping when Gord speaks --

                                 GORD
                        I’d appreciate your coming to the 
                        service tomorrow. I know Trent 
                        would.

           Jon, without acknowledgement, walks out of the diner. The 
           door CHIMING behind him.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                             (to Marge)
                        I’ll collect him in the morning. 
                        Before you open.

           She smiles sadly then closes the fridge door firmly.

           EXT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord walks Marge to her car.
                                 MARGE
                        Sorry about my boy. Army made him 
                        cocky.

           She turns to him, running her finger over where her wedding 
           ring used to be.

                                 MARGE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to come over?

           He contemplates the best way to say no, then:

                                 GORD
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea.

                                 MARGE
                        I didn’t think you’d want to be 
                        alone on a night like this.

           A beat, then:

                                 GORD
                        Good night. I’ll see you in the 
                        morning.

           She forces a smile.

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Gord’s body’s impression is at the center of the bed. The 
           silence is broken by the sound of Gord entering the house. 
           Glasses CLAMOR in the kitchen, then he lumbers up the stairs.

           Sitting on the edge of the bed he gives in slightly to the 
           fatigue...taking a finger of whiskey...he lays back, filling 
           the impression...

           Closing his eyes, we...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING

           Casket in the bed, Gord pulls his truck into the rear of the 
           house.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord sits across from the funeral director, JAMES SHAMUS 
           (43), in the mahogany heavy office of the funeral home.
                                 SHAMUS
                        Would you like to hold a funeral, 
                        Gord?

                                 GORD
                        I wouldn’t know who to invite.

                                 SHAMUS
                        I could put an ad in the paper.

                                 GORD
                        No. That won’t be necessary. Can 
                        you bury him today?

                                 SHAMUS
                        I can manage that.

                                 GORD
                        How much will this cost me? If I 
                        had the land, I’d bury him myself.

                                 SHAMUS
                        This one’s on the house, Gord.

           Gord stands.

           Shamus follows.

                                 GORD
                        That’s mighty kind.

           Shamus nods.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to put the final nails in 
                        the coffin.

           INT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord carefully nails shut the top of the coffin. One nail...

           Two nails...

           On the third he misses, SMASHING his thumb --

                                 GORD
                        DAMMIT!

           EXT. CEMETERY - AFTERNOON

           Gord places one of his purple hearts on top of his son’s 
           casket.
                                 GORD
                        Okay.

           Shamus, by Gord, looks on as a GRAVE DIGGER covers Trent with 
           dampened soil at this modest cemetery. 

           Gord is doing everything he can to hold back a flood of 
           emotion. Slightly trembling, his eyes water...

           Gord’s thumb is swelling through a bandage, blood soaking 
           through. We can see the white slowly giving way to the red...

           Shamus looks down at Gord’s wounded hand.

                                 SHAMUS
                        You ought to get that looked at. 
                        Infection could set in. Cost you 
                        work hours.

           Gord looks at his hand as Jon walks up to the edge of the 
           burial site.

           Looking at each other, Gord smiles in gratitude.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Doctor ELLEN BAND, mid fifties, injects a hypodermic needle 
           into Gord’s stricken thumb.

           Pulling the needle out:

                                 BAND
                        I’m sorry to hear about your son, 
                        Gord. A man like you, after all 
                        you’ve been through. What a shame. 
                        I haven’t seen him since he was 
                        about 17.

                                 GORD
                        That sounds about right.

                                 BAND
                        What was he doing out there?

                                 GORD
                        I’m not sure. Working I guess.

                                 BAND
                        You weren’t close?

           Gord shakes his head. Can’t quite look her in the eye.
                                 GORD
                        He blamed me for his Mother being 
                        gone. She would write him letters. 
                        Lies mostly. That and I wouldn’t 
                        let him in the service when he was 

                                 BAND
                        He ran away?

                                 GORD
                        He left and didn’t come back.

           Band places a small band-aid over Gord’s thumb.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        I couldn’t talk to him. I didn’t 
                        know how. He saw me as a coward. As 
                        a husband, and a father. Suppose he 
                        was right. I had no business being 
                        a family man.

                                 BAND
                        I beg to differ. You’re a good man, 
                        Gord.

           Gord looks up at her.

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        It was an accident, huh? Out there 
                        on the farm?

                                 GORD
                        Yeah.

                                 BAND
                        Tractor?

                                 GORD
                        That’s what they say. Looked 
                        awfully messed up, though.

                                 BAND
                        What do you mean?

                                 GORD
                        They say the tractor chewed him up. 
                        He didn’t look chewed up. He looked 
                        beat up. Not like a machine got 
                        em’. I’ve seen it both ways 
                        before...but I can’t be certain.

                                 BAND
                        What did the autopsy show?
                                 GORD
                        They didn’t have none.

           Band washes her hands.

                                 BAND
                        Why not?

                                 GORD
                        Sheriff said it was an accident. 
                        Don’t have the county funds, 
                        neither. Evidence has to be 
                        “compelling”.

           Band leans against the counter away from Gord...thinking...

                                 BAND
                        It doesn’t have to be “compelling”. 
                        It simply has to be reasonable. And 
                        what you say sounds just that. I 
                        should take a look.

                                 GORD
                        At what?

                                 BAND
                        Trent’s body.

                                 GORD
                        That’s not necessary, Doc.

                                 BAND
                        I’d be happy to do it. It’s the 
                        right thing to do under the 
                        circumstances.

                                 GORD
                        He’s already buried.

                                 BAND
                        With your permission, I can have 
                        him exhumed. 

                                 GORD
                        What?

                                 BAND
                        His body taken out of the ground.

                                 GORD
                        I don’t know...

                                 BAND
                        It’s the least I can do. 
           Gord is uncomfortable.

                                 GORD
                        What could you possibly find? The 
                        boy’s dead.

                                 BAND
                        Quite a bit, actually. 

           She takes his hand, at first making him uncomfortable.

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        Look. It probably was an accident. 
                        But if my son died under those 
                        circumstances, I would want to 
                        know.

           Gord gets it.

                                 GORD
                        You’re the doctor.

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Gord’s phone rings as he smokes an unfiltered cigarette.

           Answering the phone:

                                 GORD
                        Hello.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Zin speaks into the phone from his kitchen.

                                 ZIN
                        Doc says you gave her the go ahead 
                        to exhume your son. She needs the 
                        go ahead from me. I need the go 
                        ahead from you.

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gord inhales deeply.

                                 GORD
                        Go ahead.

           He hangs up the phone.
           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Zin looks at the phone, startled by the terse response. He, 
           too, hangs up the phone.

           INT. GORD’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Gord strikes on the light to reveal his damaged sculpture. 

           He puts on his mask, fires up the blowtorch, and begins to 
           mend it back together...

           EXT. CEMETERY - THE NEXT DAY

           The boy’s body is being exhumed. 

           Gord takes the purple heart off the casket and puts it in his 
           pocket.

           INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           Doctor Band is performing an autopsy on Trent.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Dr. Band is sitting across from Gord in her country office.

                                 BAND
                        This is difficult for me to say...

                        Also, there are multiple linear

                        ankles, and there is acute

           Silence. The RAPPING of a fist at the door. 

           Gord gets up from his usual place of sleep.

           He passes a bottle of whiskey by the lamp. No glass.

           The tractor’s high-beam lights cut through the black morning 
           as it moves forward. 
           We can’t hear but can only see what Gord imagines.

                        Normally I wouldn’t ask this, as my 
                        duty supersedes just about 
                        everything else. But seeing all 
                        you’ve been through with your life, 
                        your service to your country, and

                        want me to pursue this further?

           Gord didn't expect this from Zin.

                                 GORD
                        I don’t have a choice.

           The boy’s hands again. Behind the wheel of the tractor. 
           Tender. Whole. Alive. 

           His eyes are tired but the face is young. So young.

           The boy is focused on the task at hand. Suddenly, his world 
           is SHATTERED by a heavy rock to the face which catapults him 
           from the tractor onto the soil --
           -- With all his might he props himself up from the earth --

           Trying to stay conscious. Viscous blood streaming. Dangling.

           A crowbar STRIKES the boy in the arm. He collapses again. 
           Bones BREAKING.

           He starts to tremble in shock as another blow CRACKS him in 
           the ribs. We can only see the boy’s SCREAMS. Blood pushing 
           out instead of words.

           One STRIKE. After ANOTHER. After ANOTHER.

           The boy’s eye and eyelid make their final movement --

                                 GORD
                        Except for what the doctor said.

                                 ZIN
                        Except for what the doctor said. 
                        And that ain’t good enough.

                        Ain’t it? I reckon so.

           Zin puts a comforting hand on Gord’s shoulder.

                                 ZIN
                        Now. Bury your son.

                                 GORD
                        I already did.

           Zin stops in his tracks. Can’t muster the strength to turn 
           and face him. Keeping his back to him he continues to walk 
           away.

           INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Gord, with the help of a hospital WORKER, lifts his son’s 
           refrigerated body into the casket.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           Gord watches his son be reburied. Again, he places the purple 
           heart on the casket.

           Jon walks up, catching Gord off guard. Jon can see in Gord’s 
           eyes that an injustice has been done.
                                 JON
                        I push off tomorrow.

                        about you too.

           Jon salutes Gord.

           Gord salutes back.

           INT. GORD’S HOME - NIGHT

           Gord enters his home. It feels like a vacuum.

           INT. GORD’S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           He takes down the bottle of whiskey, gets a glass, unscrews 
           it to pour. Even though he is glaring at the bottle, his mind 
           is elsewhere. 

           Gord leaves the bottle and the unfilled glass.

           INT. GORD’S “OFFICE” - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord enters the dark room and closes the door. We don’t know 
           where the light is coming from, but all we can see are his 
           distressed eyes.

           Placing his head between his hands, he is squeezing his skull 
           in frustration.

           -- We hear the sounds again --

           -- Memories --

           -- The sounds of sporadic GUNFIRE --

           -- SLOSHING of boots --

           -- An EXPLOSION --

           Releasing his head, breathing more heavily, the sounds 
           stop...

           Gord stands. More put together, he slowly exits the room...
           EXT. GORD’S HOME - FIRST LIGHT

           Morning light trickles onto his home...

           Gord exits the front door and enters his truck.

           INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord fires up the truck. Refreshed and collected, he drives 
           off...

           EXT. FARM - CONTINUOUS

           Gord pulls up to the Thompson farm. It’s a relatively small 
           property, fewer than 10 acres. Isolated.

           His eyes, in analysis, scan the building as he approaches the 
           front door...

           Gord KNOCKS.

           Farmer Thompson answers, dressed for field work.

                                 THOMPSON

                        Likewise. Do you mind if I ask you 
                        a few questions about my son?

           Thompson nods cautiously, letting him in.

           INT. FARMHOUSE  - CONTINUOUS

           Thompson and Gord enter the living room. Simple. Spare. 
           Christian symbols. A family portrait.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Would you like something to drink?

                        No. Thank you.

                        Wife’s with the chickens. 

           Thompson excuses himself.
           Gord’s eyes are at work again, scanning the room. Looking for 
           clues. We haven’t seen him act like this before...he is 
           waking...coming alive...

           INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Thompson quietly picks up the phone and dials as he speaks.

           Photographs of his large family are by the phone.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Are you sure I can’t get you 
                        anything?

                        It’ll just be a minute.

           A beat, then he speaks into the phone:

                             (softly)
                        Sheriff, please.

           INT. FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Thompson enters the room to find Gord exactly where he left 
           him.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I got the pot going at least.

           Referring to a purple heart on the wall:

                                 GORD
                        Were you in the War?

                                 THOMPSON
                        Yep.

           Thompson remains standing.

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        Were you?

           Gord gives his faint rendition of a smile...

                                 GORD
                        Which one?
           Thompson is now genuinely afraid.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Tell me about my son.

                                 THOMPSON
                        What do you want to know?

                                 GORD

                        You’re gonna have to narrow it down 
                        a bit.

                                 GORD
                        I ain’t gonna have to do nothing.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I don’t appreciate your tone.

           Thompson takes a step back. Nervous as hell.

                                 GORD
                        I don’t appreciate your lies.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I’m going to have to ask you to 
                        leave, Mr. Gord.

           Gord stands.

                                 GORD
                        You said our sons were friends. I 
                        want to talk to him.

                                 THOMPSON
                        He ain’t here.

                                 GORD
                        Where is he?

           The WHIRL of sirens can now be heard.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t have to do that.

           Thompson is practically pissing himself.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I didn’t do nothin’.

           Gord looks out the window to see three Sheriff cruisers pull 
           up to the house.
           Gord glares at Thompson -- thinks about taking drastic action 
           -- then decides to back down --

           Gord walks over to the front door and opens it --

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Clemens, Deputy Bastogne, Benjamin (in civilian 
           clothes) and 5 other DEPUTIES all have hands on revolvers or 
           shotguns in hand...

           Gord recognizes Benjamin from the bar (early scene in script -
           - Sheriff Clemens’ brother).

                                 CLEMENS
                        What are you doing on his land, 
                        boy?

                                 GORD
                        He invited me in.

           A beat, then:

                                 CLEMENS
                        That ain’t how we see it. That 
                        ain’t how he sees it.

           Gord looks back at Thompson, who is slowly backpedaling away 
           from the situation...

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll ask again: what are you doing 
                        trespassing...?

           Gord takes a step towards the officers --

           -- They tense at the move --

                                 BENJAMIN 
                        Hold it right there...

           Gord does.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Answer my brother, boy.

                                 CLEMENS
                        You armed?

                                 GORD
                        Do my teeth count?
                                 CLEMENS
                        Turn around. Hands on your head.

           Gord does.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Drop to your knees.

           Gord obliges.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Deputy Stirn, cuff this man.

           Stirn secures Gord.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Pat him down.

           Stirn frisks him.

                                 STIRN
                        He’s clean.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Sit him down.

           Gord drops to his behind.

           Clemens walks up to Gord, squatting next to him.

           Whispering into Gord’s ear:

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to give you one 
                        opportunity, and one opportunity 
                        only...

           Gord looks coldly at Sheriff...

                                 GORD
                        Sounds like a gold mine. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        You have two choices. Get out of 
                        town, or go to jail. And we don’t 
                        have no ordinary jail. It’s a 
                        special kind of jail. For a special 
                        kind of people. People like you, 
                        Gord.

           A beat, then:

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        What will it be?
                                 GORD
                             (reluctantly)
                        I’ll oblige.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Good. If you ever come near my 
                        jurisdiction again, there won’t be 
                        nothing to talk about...got it?

           Gord just stares at Clemens.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Good.

           Clemens pats Gord on the shoulder, stands, and walks away.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Deputy Stirn, release this man. 

           Stirn does.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Deputy Bastogne, take one of the 
                        boys and follow Gord to the county 
                        line. Radio in when you’re done.

           Gord gets in his truck and they drive off...

           INT. TRUCK - LATER

           Gord is driving down the straight highway, monitoring the 
           following Sheriff cruiser in the rear view.

           Beneath him, he feels and we can hear the road CHANGE quality 
           for the better. What was ROUGH, GRAVELED and UNEVEN is now 
           SMOOTH and CLEAN.

           The deputies pull to the side of the road, dirt 
           bellowing...they then turn around...

           Gord watches in the mirror...

           EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Gord’s truck moves down the highway...faster than we’ve seen 
           it before...

           Past another lake...
           EXT. CAR DEALER - LATER

           Gord pulls his truck into the dealership lot.

           EXT. CAR DEALER - CONTINUOUS

           Gord exits his truck and is greeted by FRANK TILLMAN (30ish), 
           the car salesman.

                                 FRANK
                        Howdy, Gord.

                                 GORD
                        Howdy.

                                 FRANK
                        In the market for a new car?

                                 GORD
                        I reckon. 

                                 FRANK
                        Whatcha looking for?

                                 GORD
                        I don’t know. Something simple.

                                 FRANK
                        Well you ain’t gonna find a 
                        Cadillac here. So, I can all but 
                        guarantee the straightforwardness 
                        of our product.

           A beat, then:

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What type of transaction are we 
                        talking about?

                                 GORD
                        Trade.

                                 FRANK
                        The truck?

                                 GORD
                        That’s right.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve got the perfect vehicle for 
                        you.
           EXT. CAR DEALER - LATER

           Gord drives out of the lot in a used Buick Riviera.

           INT. BARBERSHOP - EARLY EVENING

           A BARBER cuts Gord’s hair.

           INT. GORD’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Gord is touching up a fingernail on his sculpture...

           Standing back, he admires the completed work...

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Gord lays on the bed. No whiskey.

           The wind spreads and coils the drapes in his room. He looks 
           over, enjoying the fresh air, closing his eyes as we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. GORD’S BATHROOM - MORNING

           Gord is shaving -- we haven’t seen him clean shaven before.

           INT. GORD’S HALLWAY - LATER

           Gord carefully removes a floorboard from the ground.

           Inside the opening is an old safe. Spinning the code, it 
           opens.

           He pulls out a thick black duffle bag, grunting at its 
           weight. Behind the bag are stacks of cash. Varying 
           denominations.

           He thumbs money to take ...

           EXT. GORD’S HOME - LATER

           Gord puts the duffle bag, along with another in the trunk of 
           his new car. 

           Sheriff Zin pulls up in his patrol car.
                                 ZIN
                        Howdy, Gord.

                                 GORD
                        Howdy.

           Zin eyes the new car, concerned.

                                 ZIN
                        Nice car.

                                 GORD
                        Thanks.

                                 ZIN
                        Ain’t no use for the truck no more?

                                 GORD
                        I ain’t got no more dead folk to 
                        cart around.

                                 ZIN
                        You going somewhere?

                                 GORD
                        Often.

                                 ZIN
                        I tried calling but you didn’t 
                        answer.

                                 GORD
                        Didn’t hear the phone ring.

                                 ZIN
                        Sheriff Clemens called, Gord. Says 
                        you were up to no good.

                                 GORD
                        Oh?

                                 ZIN
                        Why don’t you come over to the 
                        house for dinner? Missus would love 
                        to see you...

                                 GORD
                        Very soon, Sheriff.

           Zin smiles cautiously and slowly drives away.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Dammit.
           Another patrol car pulls up to the curb around the corner 
           from Gord’s house.

           Gord notices.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Christ.

           Gord enters his home, closing the door behind him.

           INT. GORD’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Gord turns out the light, then looks out the window with a 
           pair of German binoculars.

           The patrol car is still there. He studies the faces of the 
           two DEPUTIES inside.

           He gently puts the binoculars down and picks up the phone.

           Into the phone:

                                 GORD
                        Hi, this is Doctor Cain down at 
                        County. Is Deputy Miller available?

           A beat, then:

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        I see. Could you let him know his 
                        wife just checked in. Looks like 
                        she might be pregnant again.

           A beat, then:

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Thanks very much.

           He hangs up the phone. Picking up the binoculars, he looks 
           back at the car...

           We see one of the deputies pick up the radio. They look 
           anxious about whatever was just discussed, then drive off...

           Gord turns the light back on.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord turns a light on here too, which can also be seen 
           through a window.
           EXT. GORD’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord gets into his new car and drives into the night...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           Gord is driving down an otherwise undisturbed stretch of 
           highway...

           A patrol car, sirens WAILING, is rapidly approaching Gord 
           from the rear...

           INT. GORD’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Gord watches the patrol car pull up right behind him...

           Sheriff Zin, accompanied by another DEPUTY, speaks through 
           the loudspeaker:

                                 ZIN
                        Pull over.

           Gord ignores him, not changing speed or course.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Pull over, Gord, or I will alert 
                        Sheriff Clemens.

           EXT. GORD’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Gord pulls over, resting his head against the steering wheel 
           in surrender. 

           The Sheriff and his deputy, CHARLIE (27), get out of the car. 

                                 ZIN
                        Don’t draw your weapon.

           Charlie is uncomfortable with this order.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Stay here and be careful. Gord’s 
                        outfit in WWII inspired Kennedy to 
                        create the Navy Seals.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Navy Seals? What are those?

           Zin rolls his eyes then walks up to Gord’s car.

           Gord lowers the window.
                                 ZIN
                        Where in God’s name are you going?

                                 GORD
                        An evening drive.

                                 ZIN
                        Uh huh. 

           Zin’s eyes scan the interior of the car.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any weapons in the 
                        vehicle?

                                 GORD
                        I’m not sure.

                                 ZIN
                        You’re not sure?

                                 GORD
                        Sometimes I forget. Leave em’ in 
                        the car.

                                 ZIN
                        Pop the trunk, Gord.

           Gord does.

           Zin walks over to the trunk. 

           To Charlie:

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Keep an eye on him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, Sheriff.

           Zin opens a bag in the trunk. Shuffles through it.

           He then opens the black duffle bag to find a 6 gauge shotgun, 
           a rifle, a 45 caliber pistol, and a K-Bar knife amidst other 
           supplies.

                                 ZIN
                        Christ. Charlie, put these bags in 
                        our trunk please.

           Zin walks back over to Gord.
                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Gord, I’m going to have to ask you 
                        to step out of the car.

           Zin’s unsteady hand is over his sheathed revolver.

           Gord gets out.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Please turn around.

           He does.

           Zin then cuffs him and walks him over to the patrol car.

           Charlie opens the door and they put him gently in the 
           vehicle.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Charlie, drive his car back to the 
                        station. Careful, he just bought 
                        it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, sir.

           INT. ZIN’S PATROL CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Zin is driving Gord back towards the station.

                                 ZIN
                        Clever move back at the house. 
                        Getting my deputies all mixed up. 
                        Didn’t think I’d come after you?

                                 GORD
                        I don’t know.

                                 ZIN
                        I think you wanted to get caught. 
                        Stop yourself from doing something 
                        stupid, Gord.

                                 GORD
                        What Sheriff Clemens did ain’t 
                        right. 

                                 ZIN
                        He concluded the investigation.

                                 GORD
                        His investigation was bullshit.
                                 ZIN
                        I can’t challenge him on it. All I 
                        can do is stop this situation from 
                        getting worse.

                                 GORD
                        Can’t always make the safe play, 
                        Sheriff.

                                 ZIN
                        What do you want me to do? Call the 
                        Feds?

                                 GORD
                        That’d be a good start.

                                 ZIN
                        You really think they’ll take on 
                        this case? Kick aside a reputable 
                        Sheriff? 

                                 GORD
                        That ain’t right.

           A beat, then Zin gazes into the rear-view mirror:

                                 ZIN
                        There’s nothing I can do.

           Gord looks out the window.

                                 GORD
                        Maybe not. But I can. It’s not 
                        somethin’ I want to do. But it’s 
                        the only way I know how to do it.

           Zin just looks at him.

           INT. ZIN’S JAIL - LATER

           Everything about Zin’s station seems more up-to-date than 
           Clemens’.

           The bars close on Gord, the sole occupier of the cell.

           Zin removes Gord’s cuffs from the outside.

                                 ZIN
                        We’ll talk about your future in the 
                        morning. Take this time to think. 
                        Hard.

           Zin walks out.
                                 GORD
                             (under his breath)
                        There ain’t nothing to think about.

           Gord sits on the edge of the bed. Pensive.

           He lays back and closes his eyes.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. ZIN’S JAIL - MORNING

           Zin walks in to greet deputy Charlie. 

                                 ZIN
                        Was he any trouble?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No trouble at all.

           Zin walks over to Gord’s cell.

                                 ZIN
                        Good morning.

                                 GORD
                        To some.

                                 ZIN
                        You’re not getting your guns or 
                        ammo back.

                                 GORD
                        You think I need em?

           Zin ignores him.

                                 ZIN
                        You can keep most the other stuff, 
                        though.

           A beat, then:

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        If I let you out you gotta stay out 
                        of trouble, Gord. Any indication 
                        otherwise and I’ll come after you. 
                        And if I can’t catch you I’m 
                        legally obligated to let Sheriff 
                        Clemens know you’re coming. Got it? 
                        I don’t need any blood on my hands.

           Gord doesn’t acknowledge him.
           Zin recognizes the irony of his last statement.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        I should make you sign a damn 
                        contract but that ain’t gonna 
                        happen, is it?

                                 GORD
                        I can’t write.

           The cell door UNLOCKS as Zin shakes his head.

           INT. MACHINE SHOP - DAY

           Gord is WELDING at work.

           INT. GORD’S GARAGE - NIGHT

           Gord is polishing his now bronzed sculpture. Running the soft 
           cloth over the long scar at its center...

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Gord sits on his couch, drinking a finger of whiskey.

           There is a KNOCK at the door.

                                 GORD
                        Don’t worry, Sheriff. I ain’t going 
                        nowhere.

           No response.

           Gord grunts, then gets up and walks over to the door. 

           Looking through the peephole, he sees no one.

           He opens the door and looks around.

           EXT. GORD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Nothing. Gord sees nothing unusual.

           He walks over to the patrol car that is staked across the 
           street from his home.

           Deputy Charlie rolls down the window.

                                 GORD
                        Did you knock?
                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 GORD
                        Somebody knocked at my door.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I didn’t see nothing.

           Gord walks back to his door to find an envelope on the 
           doorstep. He must have walked right over it before.

           He picks it up and quickly enters his house, closing the door 
           behind him.

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gord sits down in front of the envelope. He looks at it 
           suspiciously. Closing his eyes. Opening them. Contemplating 
           what to do.

           Deciding to open it, he tears at the back cleanly with an 
           index finger. 

           He looks inside...it appears to be a single, white piece of 
           paper...

           Slowly, Gord slides it out -- reading it -- pain spreading 
           across his face --

           Dropping it on the table, we can clearly read what is 
           scrawled across the paper in thick red writing...”Are you a 
           Faggot like your boy?”

           He puts a hand over his eyes as if a massive headache 
           suddenly emerged...

           Gord TEARS the paper in half, letting it drop to the floor...

           Gord boiling into a rage, constraining himself only to not 
           attract attention.

           He collapses onto the couch, covering his face.

           We think he is on the verge of tears. Shaking. But he is not.

           Rage echoes through quivering eyes as we...

                                                                CUT TO:
           BLACK.

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. GORD’S LIVING ROOM - DAWN

           Gord is asleep on the floor. Jacket as pillow.

           A KNOCK at the door.

           Gord wakes and is on his feet quickly. A chef’s knife is 
           behind him, gripped tightly as a weapon...

           He looks trough the peephole then opens the door.

           Dr. Band is there. Guarded.

                                 BAND
                        I hope I didn’t wake you.

                                 GORD
                        No, I was just making breakfast.

           He shows her the knife.

                                 BAND
                        Sorry to disturb you. May I come 
                        in?

                                 GORD
                        What’s this about, Doc? 

                                 BAND
                        May I come in?

           Gord extends a welcoming hand.

           Band enters.

           Gord puts the knife away in the kitchen.

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        May I sit down?

           Gord walks back to the living room.

                                 GORD
                        Please.

                                 BAND
                        May I have something to drink?

           She is clearly troubled.
                                 GORD
                        Water?

                                 BAND
                        No.

                                 GORD
                        Ain’t it a little early, Doc?

                                 BAND
                        I took the day off.

                                 GORD
                        Whiskey’s all I got.

                                 BAND
                        That’ll be fine.

           Gord returns to the Kitchen. We hear him making the drink.

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        There...there’s something I’ve been 
                        meaning to tell you, Gord...

           Gord returns with the drink, handing it to Band.

           She takes a sip. Hand slightly trembling. 

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        Please. Forgive me. It’s about your 
                        son.

                                 GORD
                        What about my son?

                                 BAND
                        There’s more to his injuries than I 
                        initially indicated to you.

           Gord just stares at her. 

           She downs the drink.

                                 BAND (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know how to soften this...

                                 GORD
                        Tell me.

                                 BAND
                        He was tortured, Gord.

                        Tortured how? Why the hell didn’t 
                        you tell me before?

                                 BAND
                             (strongly)
                        Because I’m a mother. And I 
                        wouldn’t want to know. Not after 
                        what’s happened.

           He can barely keep it together

                                 GORD
                        I ain’t you.

                                 BAND
                        I realized that. And the 
                        investigation’s dried up. That’s 
                        why I’m here.

           She looks right at him.

                                 GORD
                        What did they do to him?

           She covers her face with her hands.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Tell me. What did they do?

           She closes her eyes, exhaling...

                                 BAND
                        His rectum was torn. Badly. And 
                        part of his descending colon was 
                        severely damaged.

                                 GORD
                        Why would they do that?

                                 BAND
                        I don’t know.

           A beat, then:

                                 GORD
                        I need some time. To myself.

           Band understandingly stands and walk towards the door.

           Hesitating:

                                 BAND
                        I’ll talk to the Sheriff.
                                 GORD
                        No. Don’t tell nobody. I’ll take 
                        care of it.

           She nods nervously, then opens the door.

                                 BAND
                        I’m so sorry. I didn’t know what to 
                        do.

                                 GORD
                        Now you do.

           We hear the door CLOSE.

           Gord takes a deep breath, running his hands over his face. 
           Collecting himself. Clearing his throat. He picks up the 
           phone and dials.

           Into the phone:

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Hello. Sheriff...? I’d like to take 
                        you up on that dinner.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - NIGHT

           Zin’s home is warm and filled with his wife DOLLY’s 
           inexpensive trinkets.

           Dolly, Zin, and Gord are all sitting at the dining room 
           table, having just finished eating meatloaf and mashed 
           potatoes. 

                                 GORD
                        Thank you, Dolly. I haven’t had a 
                        home cooked meal in a long time.

                                 DOLLY
                        Anytime, sweetheart. 

                                 GORD
                        Doc came over to see me today.

                                 ZIN
                        Oh. Your hand okay?

                                 GORD
                        Just fine. 

           Gord takes a sip of water.
                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        She came to talk about my boy.

                                 DOLLY
                        It’s good to have friends who care.

                                 GORD
                        Awful things happened.

                                 ZIN
                        We know, Gord.

                                 GORD
                        No. More than you know. More than 
                        what I knew. Before today.

                                 ZIN
                        Doctor told ya?

                                 GORD
                        Yeah.

                                 ZIN
                        Tell me about it.

                                 GORD
                        That ain’t important.

                                 ZIN
                        Sure it is.

                                 GORD
                        What are these facts gonna change?

                                 ZIN
                        For whom?

                                 GORD
                        For the situation. The legal 
                        situation.

                                 ZIN
                        I don’t know until you tell me.

           Finding a way...

                                 GORD
                        Boy was tortured, Sheriff. 

                                 DOLLY
                        Oh Lord.

                                 ZIN
                        How?
                                 GORD
                        Badly.

           Zin acknowledges with a repeated slight nod.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me, ma’am. I hope I’m not 
                        stepping out of bounds.

           She smiles lovingly.

                                 DOLLY
                        I will get some coffee.

                                 ZIN
                        Thanks, Hun.

           A beat, then:

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Let me think this over.

                                 GORD
                             (pointing, lowering his 
                              voice)
                        No. You ain’t gonna do nothing and 
                        you know it.

                                 ZIN
                        Well that isn’t--

                                 GORD
                        Your hands are tied. You said it 
                        after you picked me up on the 
                        highway. These new facts don’t 
                        change nothing. 

                                 ZIN
                        What do you expect me to do?

                                 GORD
                        I know your limitations. 

                                 ZIN
                        And you don’t have none?

                                 GORD
                        We all do. Your shield for 
                        instance.

                                 ZIN
                        You’re in my home, Gord.

           Zin sits back in his chair.
                                 GORD
                        They put this on my doorstep last 
                        night.

           Gord slides him the “Are you a faggot like your boy?” note, 
           which is taped back together.

           Zin reads it.

                                 ZIN
                        Who did this?

                                 GORD
                        I don’t know.

                                 ZIN
                        I’ll keep the patrol car out front 
                        of your house until things settle 
                        down.

                                 GORD
                        Your deputy didn’t even notice.

                                 ZIN
                        I’ll have a talk with him.

                                 GORD
                        That ain’t good enough.

                                 ZIN
                        What do you want me to do? 

                                 GORD
                        Give me my guns back.

                                 ZIN
                        I can’t do that. 

                                 GORD
                        What if they come back? A man’s got 
                        a right to defend himself.

           Zin sighs. Studies the note again.

                                 ZIN
                        I’ll give you the shotgun back. One 
                        box of shells. You can pick it up 
                        from the deputy stationed outside 
                        your house when you get back from 
                        work. Check it in with him in the 
                        morning on the way out. You’ll do 
                        this day in and day out until I say 
                        otherwise.
           A beat, then:

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Self defense only. Any maleficence, 
                        and I’ll lock you up for a week. 
                        Maybe more. 

           Gord gets it.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        And in the meantime, I’ll talk to 
                        Sheriff Clemens about this 
                        business.
                             (referring to the note)
                        I’ll go up and see him. Face to 
                        face.

                                 GORD
                        I appreciate that.

           Zin smiles compassionately as Dolly brings in the coffee.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING

           A speck moves over the long, desolate highway. As it 
           approaches, seeming to gain shape and momentum, we see that 
           it is a Sheriff’s car...

           Since we are so far away, we can see a cluster of lakes in 
           the background...

           Moving even closer we identify Zin behind the wheel, powering 
           down the road...

           INT. SHERIFF CLEMENS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Clemens sits across from Zin.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Have a seat, Sheriff, please.

                                 ZIN
                        Thank you.

           Zin sits.

                                 CLEMENS
                        What can I do you for?

           Clemens folds his fingers over his stomach.
                                 ZIN
                        This note was placed in front of 
                        Gord’s home two nights ago.

           Zin slides him the note. 

           Clemens quickly scans the note.

                                 CLEMENS
                        And...?

                                 ZIN
                        I was wondering if it had anything 
                        to do with the case?

                                 CLEMENS
                        No. I told you, Sheriff. That case 
                        is closed.

                                 ZIN
                        It’s mighty coincidental.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Everybody in this town knew that 
                        boy was a faggot. 

                                 ZIN
                        That may be the case, but I think 
                        it should be explored.

           Clemens holds up the note.

                                 CLEMENS
                        This happened in your county, 
                        Sheriff. 

                                 ZIN
                        It will be investigated there too. 

           Demonstrating with his hand:

                                 CLEMENS
                        I’ve had it up to here with these 
                        cockamamy stories. The boy was a 
                        queer pure and simple. And queers 
                        get into trouble. Accidents happen. 
                        He was lucky to have a job.

           Clemens wipes some sweat from his head with a handkerchief.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll say it one. More. Time. Case 
                        closed. Am I clear?
           Zin glares at him.

                                 ZIN
                        I see how you see it but that isn’t 
                        good enough. 

           Clemens pops out of his seat.

                                 CLEMENS
                        How dare you come into my office 
                        and tell me how it is supposed to 
                        be!

                                 ZIN
                        It ain’t me tellin’ you nothin’. 
                        It’s the law tellin’ you. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        What about Christian law?

                                 ZIN
                             (standing)
                        What about it?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Listen, Sheriff. We can work 
                        together on this. There are murders 
                        and there are accidents. This was 
                        an accident. Nature took its 
                        course...

                                 ZIN
                        So now it’s natural law? I thought 
                        we were on Christian law?

                                 CLEMENS
                        What’s the difference?

                                 ZIN
                        Thank you for your time, Sheriff.

           Zin locks eyes with Clemens as he grabs the note and slowly 
           walks out.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - NIGHT

           Zin is alone at his dining room table, introspective, 
           drinking a beer out of the bottle.

           Dolly comes up behind him.

                                 DOLLY
                        Is everything alright, Hun?
                                 ZIN
                        Yeah. It’s just been a long day. 
                        That’s all.

           He forces a smile as they touch hands. Zin gets up walks 
           out...

           INT. ZIN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Zin closes the door behind him and dials a number.

           Into the phone:

                                 ZIN
                        We need to meet. Right now.

           EXT. NONDESCRIPT STREET - NIGHT

           Zin’s private car (not the cruiser) rolls slowly through the 
           otherwise still street.

           The Sheriff’s mind is clearly somewhere else. His eyes fixed. 

           EXT. CHILDREN’S PARK - CONTINUOUS

           The Sheriff parks, setting the gear. He exits the vehicle, 
           not in uniform.

           Gord rolls up behind him.

           EXT. CHILDREN’S PARK - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord and Zin are in the center of the park. The equipment 
           looks new. Bright colors.

           It’s a cold night. We can see their breath. Nerves aren’t 
           helping.

                                 ZIN
                        You know the old storage facility 
                        over on Larchmont Street?

                                 GORD
                        Uh huh.

                                 ZIN
                        Unit D. Go there tonight. Around 
                        midnight will be good. 
                                 GORD
                        What for?

                                 ZIN
                        Scale the fence in the rear. It was 
                        damaged in last winter’s storm. You 
                        don’t have to worry about the dog, 
                        neither. He was put down last week. 
                        The sliding door will be unlocked. 
                        Unit D. Don’t write this down.

                                 GORD
                        What’s going on?

                                 ZIN
                        Your bag’s in there. The one I 
                        took. You’ll see it. We never had 
                        this conversation, understand?

                                 GORD
                        Yes, sir.

                                 ZIN
                        And we’ll never have this 
                        conversation again. After tonight, 
                        wait a few days before we 
                        communicate about anything.

           Zin starts to walk towards his car.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        And Gord, don’t forget to lock the 
                        door behind you tonight. You were 
                        never there.

           Gord’s in agreement.

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Darkness of the thick woods. Insects CHIRP by the deafening 
           thousands. 

           Gord trots up to the edge of the wilderness, finding a 
           damaged fence. The barbed wire separated and unwound from the 
           top, providing a space to crawl through to the other side.

           He scales it quickly. Constantly cautious and aware.
           EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - CONTINUOUS

           Gord eyes a dark shack of a home on the property. Must be the 
           owner’s.

           He makes it over to the large sliding door marked “D.”

           Gord pulls at the lock, which easily opens.

           Slowly and quietly, Gord rolls up the sliding door.

           He snaps his flashlight on, orientating himself with the 12’ 
           x 15’ space.

           Gord locates his bag on some shelves to the left. 

           He opens it and examines its contents. Satisfied with what he 
           finds, he zips it back up and slings it over his shoulder --

           -- We hear the COCK of a revolver --

           -- Freezing Gord in his place --

           A voice emanates from the darkness:

                                 VOICE
                        Don’t move, mister.

           Gord squints, trying to discern the figure --

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Put down the bag. Slowly.

           Gord starts to obey the command as --

           -- The figure moves, slivers of light revealing pieces of his 
           face --

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Gord, is that you?

           Gord thrusts the bag at the MAN (60ish), knocking him back, 
           sending the pistol flying --

           Gord then pins the man, bringing a fist up as if to punch him 
           --

           Gord hesitates. Burying the beast.

                                 MAN
                        Gord, please...

           Gord gets off him. Grabs his bag. Disappears into the 
           darkness...
           The man breathes heavily as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GORD’S HOME - LATER

           Gord storms up to his car.

           Opening the trunk, he tosses the black bag in the trunk.

           Heading to the driver’s seat, his momentum is interrupted by 
           the phone RINGING in his house...

           Gord contemplates for a moment then decides to --

           INT. GORD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Gord enters, heading towards the phone.

           Picking it up --

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Zin is alone. He speaks quietly in the phone:

                                 ZIN
                        I swear on the heavens the Old Man 
                        wasn’t supposed to be there. 
                        Hunting trip was cancelled last 
                        minute--

           INT. GORD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Gord hangs up the phone in frustration.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Zin slides the phone off his finger onto the receiver.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord and his car tear down the highway...

           EXT. GORD’S HOME - LATER

           Zin’s cruiser pulls up to the house where Deputy Charlie 
           waits. Lights swirling above his cruiser.
           Zin pops out of the car.

                                 ZIN
                        Charlie, turn off the damn lights. 
                        You’re gonna wake up the neighbors. 

           Charlie obliges.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t think he’s here, boss. His 
                        car is gone. Do you want me to 
                        alert the other counties? Head out 
                        toward the highway?

                                 ZIN
                        God, no. This is a simple robbery.

                                 CHARLIE
                        With battery.

                                 ZIN
                        Alleged. Where’s your partner?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Called in sick, remember? Do you 
                        want me to wake the other deputies?

                                 ZIN
                        Please, son, let me do the 
                        thinking.

           Zin walks back to his car.

                                 ZIN (CONT’D)
                        Stake out his house for the night. 
                        I’ll have a plan in the morning.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes, sir.

           Zin gets in his cruiser and drives away.

           EXT. BUS STATION - DAWN

           Gord jerks awake in his car. It looks like he was dreaming.

           INT. BUS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord has his black duffle slung over his shoulder. He’s 
           talking to a TICKET AGENT.

           Zin is addressing his Deputies, including Charlie.

                                 ZIN
                        We’re not going to go outside our 
                        county yet. This is a small matter. 
                        A local matter. If we don’t find 
                        him in the next few hours, we’ll go 
                        APB. 

                                 CHARLIE

                        Sheriff Cle--

                                 ZIN
                        Sheriff Clemens will know soon 
                        enough. Charlie, go home. Your 
                        shift is over. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        But, sir--

                                 ZIN
                        Go home, son. If you had spotted 
                        the damned fool who slipped the 
                        note to Gord, maybe none of this 
                        would’ve ever happened.

           Charlie hesitates, grabs his coat, then walks out...

           INT. DEPUTY CHARLIE’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie is talking into the phone. His drinking is not only 
           evidenced by his behavior but by the bottle next to him.

           A baby is heard CRYING in the background.

                                 CHARLIE
                        There’s something I’d like you to 
                        keep in confidence, sir... Sir, 
                        Sheriff Zin is not doing his duty 
                        in telling you that Gord stole his 
                        guns back... Yes, sir... And, sir, 
                        we can’t find him...

           Gord exits the bus.

           The bus driver’s voice is over speaker:

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - LATER

           Clemens is addressing a group of DEPUTIES.

                                 CLEMENS
                        We have to assume that Gord is 
                        heading up here to continue his 
                        delusional investigation into the 
                        accidental death of his son. People 
                        who bury their children will seek 
                        reason when reason is not due. 
                        Assume he is armed and dangerous. 

           Clemens pats sweat off of his forehead.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Johnson. Caprese. You idiots get on 
                        out to that highway. See if you can 
                        spot him there.

           A beat, then:

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           They move towards their assignments.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gord settles into a room, pulling the blinds closed.

           Gord spreads the map out on the poorly lit desk. He places 
           his right index finger on the City of Langtree.

           He then uses a ruler to measure the distance between Langtree 
           and the Town of Essex.

           Gord is wearing a large backpack. Large enough to contain his 
           guns.

           He looks around cautiously, then crosses the street and 
           disappears into a dying cornfield.

           Gord uses a small light to check a compass.

           It’s cold. We can see traces of his breath.
           As he walks along the stalks in the chilled darkness, 
           memories surface --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FOREST - FLASHBACK

           Grey. Snow. Barren, contorted trees.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           EXT. DEAD CORNFIELD - PRESENT

           Gord shivers from the memory and the cold.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           EXT. FOREST - FLASHBACK

           A German SOLDIER. Alone. Smoking a cigarette.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           EXT. DEAD CORNFIELD - PRESENT

           Gord centers himself. Collected. He paces forward, deflecting 
           the elements.

                                                              INTERCUT:

           EXT. FOREST - FLASHBACK

           The German soldier. Enjoying the cigarette. We only see the 
           arms of the OTHER. The black flash of a knife and the quiet, 
           quick death of the soldier.

           A final release of breath. Blood runs over the buttons of a 
           faded uniform.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - LATER

           It’s still very dark. 

           Gord is monitoring the building through binoculars.
           A light is on inside. A deputy, RAINES, exits the building to 
           light a cigarette. Crickets CHIRPING.

           Raines looks at his wristwatch then drops and extinguishes 
           the cigarette with his boot.

           Raines turns back for the station when he is grabbed and 
           thrust to the ground in one swift motion --

           -- Raines’ face is slammed against the dirt --

           -- Gord on top of him, pinning him down ferociously --

                                 GORD
                             (softly)
                        If you say anything. That is, 
                        unless I ask you a question, I will 
                        remove your vocal chords. Do you 
                        understand?

           Raines nods.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Is there anyone else on duty 
                        tonight?

                                 RAINES
                        Two others. On patrol.

                                 GORD
                        When are they due back?

                                 RAINES
                        2 hours.

                                 GORD
                        Good.

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Raines is tied to a chair in front of dispatch.

           Gord is circling him.

                                 GORD
                        What’s your name?

                                 RAINES
                        What’s it to you, cowboy? 

           Gord tears off Raines’ name tag. 
                                 GORD
                        Raines...do you know who I am?

                                 RAINES
                        Nope. But I know what you are.

                                 GORD
                        I’m the father of Trent Gord.

           Gord continues to circle. He’s done this before.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Were you privy to the 
                        investigation?

                                 RAINES
                        What investigation?

           Gord leans in.

                                 GORD
                        Who done it?

                                 RAINES
                        Who done what?

           Gord is practically breathing down Raines’ neck.

                                 GORD
                        Who killed my son?

                                 RAINES
                        It was an accident.

                                 GORD
                        I’ll tell you what. You tell me who 
                        killed my son, and I won’t kill 
                        yours.

                                 RAINES
                        I don’t have a son.

           Raines looks at Gord.

                                 GORD
                        Your unborn son.

                                 RAINES
                        My wife ain’t pregnant.

           Gord sticks the deputy’s revolver into Raines’ crotch.
                                 GORD 
                             (COCKING it)
                        Your unborn son.

                                 RAINES
                        Oh Jesus.

           Raines wets himself.

                                 RAINES (CONT’D)
                             (petrified)
                        It must have been Clemens and his 
                        boys.

                                 GORD
                        It must have been?

                                 RAINES
                        It was. We all know it was.

                                 GORD
                        His boys?

                                 RAINES
                        His brother. His friends. Farmer 
                        Thompson.

                                 GORD
                        Farmer Thompson?

                                 RAINES
                        Yes.

                                 GORD
                        Why?

                                 RAINES
                        You don’t want to know. 

                                 GORD
                        Tell me.

                                 RAINES

                                 GORD
                        Tell. Me.

           Pushing the revolver down --

                                 RAINES
                        Your boy and Farmer Thompson’s 
                        son... 
           A beat, then:

                                 RAINES (CONT’D)
                        They were...doin’ things.  

                                 GORD
                        What things?

                                 RAINES
                        You don’t want to know, mister.

           Pushing the revolver down firmly --

                                 RAINES (CONT’D)
                        They was fuckin’.

           Gord pulls the revolver back, stepping away...

                                 GORD
                        Where is Clemens now?

                             (hesitating)
                        At home.

                                 GORD
                        Where does he live?

                                 RAINES
                        He’d kill me --

           Gord points the revolver at the back of Raines’ head --

                                 RAINES (CONT’D)
                             (closing his eyes)
                        Clemens Ranch. It’s about five 
                        miles north of Cliff junction. 
                        There is a dirt road that veers off 
                        there. You can’t miss it.

           A beat, then:

                                 RAINES (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to kill me?

           Gord leans in real close, practically whispering.

                                 GORD
                        I want you to tell your Sheriff 
                        that he has until noon tomorrow to 
                        turn himself in, or I’ll act on 
                        behalf of something greater. 
                        Understand? 
                                 RAINES
                        Yes, sir.

           Gord disappears into the blackness.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MORNING

           Sheriff Clemens is addressing his Deputies. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        What happened this morning is 
                        beyond unacceptable. 

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Should we contact Sheriff Zin?

                                 CLEMENS
                        No. He’s been nothing but a wrench 
                        in our gears. And although deputy 
                        Raines did a good job keeping his 
                        mouth shut, Gord will come to us. 
                        Bastogne...take Lark, Johnson and  
                        Raines. You’ll hole up here and 
                        wait. Sleep here if you got to.

           A beat, then:

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take Horn, and Stirn. We’ll 
                        head up to my ranch. If Gord is 
                        gonna come knockin’ it is going to 
                        be one of two places. 

                                 RAINES
                        What do we do? Arrest him?

           Clemens is practically radiant.

                                 CLEMENS
                             (shoot him)
                        No.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - DAY

           Deputies on guard in various posts. Brandishing weapons. 
           Waiting.
           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Lark is on guard outside. Shotgun in hand.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Farmer Thompson is sitting cross-legged across from Clemens 
           who is snacking incessantly from a bowl of stale peanuts.

           The room is decorated with taxidermy, swords, and firearms.

                                 THOMPSON
                        So...is he coming?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Who?

                                 THOMPSON
                        Dammit, Sheriff. Gord.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Nothing to be concerned about. Just 
                        an ignorant man with a chip on his 
                        shoulder.

                                 THOMPSON
                        What does he know?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Nothing. He knows nothing.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Then why are we holed up here?

           Clemens doesn’t answer.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord is on the phone.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Zin is listening.

                        go wrong.

           Zin sighs.

                                 ZIN
                        I can do that.

                        I’ve got a safe under the

                        your boots to find it. 28. 14. 12. 

           Gord hangs up the phone.

           INT. SHERIFF ZIN’S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Zin hangs up the phone, then writes the code down. Profoundly 
           troubled.  

           The reflection eating at him, he opens his door and walks 
           out...

           EXT. SHERIFF ZIN’S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Zin gets into his cruiser and heads out...

           EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Zin is racing down the road...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Clemens stands, still facing Thompson.
                                 THOMPSON
                        Do you think he’s gonna show up?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Stop it with that negative talk.

           Clemens turns and looks out the window which reveals a 
           sloping hill covered with tall, dried grass. 

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Hell, I don’t know.

           Through a reflection we can see the dry grass move elegantly 
           in the wind.

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Lark notices something...squinting towards the horizon...

           Zin’s car is approaching from the distance...

                                 LARK
                        Boys, I think we got company...

           Bastogne and Johnson join Lark on the porch...

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER

           Zin’s cruiser pulls up...

           Zin exits.

           Bastogne and his men are tense.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Afternoon, Sheriff.

                                 ZIN
                        Afternoon.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        What brings you into our county 
                        unannounced?

                                 ZIN
                        I need to speak with Sheriff 
                        Clemens.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        He’s on patrol.
                                 ZIN
                        Can you catch him on radio?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        I can try.

           Bastogne doesn’t move.

                                 ZIN
                        Now.

           Bastogne slowly walks into the station and closes the door 
           behind him. The two deputies remain.

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne picks up the phone and dials...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           The phone rings.

           Clemens picks up the phone.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Hello?

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Sir, Sheriff Zin showed up.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLEMENS
                        Zin? What’s he doing there?

           INT. SHERIFF CLEMENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                                 BASTOGNE
                        I don’t know. Wants to speak with 
                        you.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

                                 CLEMENS
                        I can’t be seeming suspicious. Send 
                        him up.
           He hangs up the phone.

           Thompson is staring at him, nervous.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        What, you rat bastard? 

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne walks onto the porch.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        I’ll give you a ride up to see him.

                                 ZIN
                        If you don’t mind, Deputy, I’d 
                        rather drive myself.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        I suppose that’d be alright. Follow 
                        me. Raines, Lark, you stay here. 
                        Keep sharp.

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Zin follows Bastogne out in their vehicles. The deputies look 
           on from the porch...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - LATER

           Zin and Bastogne’s vehicles can be seen parking in front of 
           the ranch.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Deputy Stirn, who is on guard, tightens.

           Bastogne and Zin step out of the cars. 

                                 ZIN
                        Am I interrupting a crime scene?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        No. Sheriff’s inside. Let me get 
                        him.

                                 STIRN
                        Deputy Bastogne, Sheriff says we 
                        got to take his gun first.
                                 ZIN
                        What is this?

                                 STIRN
                        Sorry. New policy.

                                 ZIN
                        Policy?

                                 STIRN
                        Yep. That’s all I know.

           Zin contemplates his options...

           The deputies are uncomfortable...

           Zin looks back at his cruiser...

                                 ZIN
                        Can I leave it in the cruiser?

           The deputies look at each other, seeking affirmation...

                                 STIRN
                        That’ll do.

           Zin walks slowly over to his trunk, unlocking and opening 
           it...completely hidden behind it...

           Still unseen, Zin grabs his .38 special and tucks it into his 
           sock. The revolver at his side he unsheathes and drops it 
           with a THUD in the trunk.

           Bastogne peers around the edge of the trunk to catch Zin 
           closing it --

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Shall we?

           Zin nods.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne shows Zin in then waits outside.

           Clemens is still sitting. Jittery.

           Clemens is standing.

           Zin cuts fragile Thompson with his eyes. Detects trouble from 
           the man.
                                 ZIN
                        What’s this about?

                                 CLEMENS
                        You tell me.

                                 ZIN
                             (referring to Thompson)
                        Who’s he?

                                 CLEMENS
                        That ain’t none of your concern.

                                 ZIN
                        I need to speak with you, Sheriff. 
                        Private.

           Thompson starts to stand.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Not a problem, I’ll--

                                 CLEMENS
                             (to Thompson)
                        Sit down!

                                 ZIN
                        What in hell’s business is it of 
                        his?

                                 CLEMENS
                        You’re in my home, after all.

           A beat, then:

                                 ZIN
                        I’m here to collect Gord and move 
                        on.

                                 CLEMENS
                        That ain’t possible.

                                 ZIN
                        Why it ain’t?

                                 CLEMENS
                        It ain’t because he tied up one of 
                        my deputies. It ain’t because he 
                        made threats. It ain’t because he 
                        needs to face justice in this 
                        county.

           A beat, then:
                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Tell me, Sheriff -- are you 
                        complicit? 

                                 ZIN
                        Say what?

                                 CLEMENS
                        You don’t strike me as a man who 
                        needs a vocabulary lesson.

           Zin decides to play the game.

                                 ZIN
                        What do you propose?

                                 CLEMENS
                        You know how he thinks.

                                 ZIN
                        A little.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Then perhaps you can assist my 
                        deputies in the search.

                                 ZIN
                        In exchange for what?

                                 CLEMENS
                             (looking down at his empty 
                              holster)

           INT. PHONE BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord is on this end. Maybe 1,000 feet from the Sheriff’s 
           station. He’s staring right at it --

                                 GORD
                        Have you got him?

                        So be it.

           He hangs up the phone and walks deliberately towards the 
           station...

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Raines looks into the phone before he hangs up. The fear sets 
           in. His proud stature dissolves. 

           He looks at Johnson, it’s just the two of them.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Clemens engages Bastogne.

                                 CLEMENS
                        You better get back down to the 
                        station. Gord may be a knockin’.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        What’s going on?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Just get and be ready. Nothing else 
                        to it. Raines is a little short 
                        handed. We’ll be alright here.

           Bastogne turns towards his cruiser.

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - LATER

           Gord is perched behind the cover of brush adjacent to the 
           station. Watching.

           Gord opens his sack and pulls out three Molotov cocktails.

           He follows that with a lit Zippo, igniting the first cocktail 
           --

           -- Allowing the flame to catch, he then hurls the first one 
           at the station --
           -- EXPLODING on impact --

           -- fire catching quickly on the poorly constructed building --

           INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           The Deputies react to the impact and the expanding blaze.

           EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - CONTINUOUS

           Gord runs around the exterior of the building --

           -- Repeating the process --

           -- Hurling another lit Molotov at the station --

           -- BURSTING on impact --

           -- The Deputies run out of the already collapsing structure, 
           pistols drawn in front of them --

           -- Gord picks up his rifle and yells at them --

                                 GORD
                        Drop your weapons!

           The deputies turn frantically -- scanning the brush alongside 
           the station -- pistols forward -- unable to see Gord --

           Gord slowly moves a few meters from his previous position -- 
           still concealed in the brush --

           -- Fixing the rifle on them --

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Drop! Your! Weapons!

           Deputy Johnson FIRES blindly into the brush -- missing wildly 
           --

           -- Gord aims carefully -- squeezing the trigger --

           -- The bullet STRIKES Johnson in the ankle -- he collapses 
           like a rag doll through a whirl of bellowing smoke --

           -- Raines drops his weapon and puts his hands over his head --

           -- Gord emerges -- rifle forward --

           -- Gord picks up both deputies’ weapons --

           Gord looks up into the now totally engulfed building.

                                 ZIN
                        On what charge?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Conspiring with a known felon. 
                        Aiding and abetting. Deputy, arrest 
                        him.

           Deputy Stirn hesitates...

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Arrest him, Deputy!

           Clemens hand is over his sheathed service revolver.
           Zin takes inventory of the situation. 

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Do it.

           The Deputy moves in but Zin falls to the ground and reaches 
           for the ankle pistol --

           -- Stirn draws his revolver --

           -- Zin fires first --

           -- THUD -- the bullet rattles in Stirn’s brain --

           -- Thompson is frozen --

           -- GUN SHOTS --

           Zin slumps over. Dead.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Christ.

           Clemens is at the end of a smoking gun. 

                                 THOMPSON (CONT’D)
                        Oh Christ.

           Thompson stands up. 

           Clemens walks over to his phone, picks up, and dials...

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne is approaching the burning station in his vehicle.

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne is shocked by the destruction.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        My Lord.

           He parks the car and snaps up the shotgun.

           EXT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           As Bastogne gets out, a pistol is put to his head. A pistol 
           connected to the confident hand of Gord. Blind-sided.
                                 GORD
                        The men here didn’t listen. Will 
                        you?

                                 BASTOGNE
                             (terrified)
                        Yes.

                                 GORD
                        This is not something I want to do, 
                        Deputy. It’s just the only way I 
                        know how to do it.

           The radio is chirping for Bastogne:

                                 CLEMENS (RADIO)
                        Sheriff for Bastogne.

                                 GORD
                        Answer it.

           He does:

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Go for Bastogne.

                                 CLEMENS (RADIO)
                        Return to base.

                                 GORD
                        Tell him okay.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        10-4.

           He hangs up the radio.

                                 GORD
                        Slowly place your shotgun and 
                        sidearm in the backseat. 

           He does.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Is that all you’re carrying?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Yes. 

                                 GORD
                        Get in.

           They do.
           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Gord puts the muzzle of the shotgun to the back of the 
           driver’s seat where Bastogne is positioned to drive.

                                 GORD
                        Drive.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Where?

                                 GORD
                        Clemens’ Ranch.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        You don’t want to go there.

           Gord BLOWS A HOLE through the front passenger seat with the 
           shotgun -- terrifying Bastogne --

                                 GORD
                        Drive.

           Bastogne obliges.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           A group of 6 horse-mounted men move side by side across the 
           vast open field that leads up to the main house. 

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Clemens watches the reinforcements. 

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne is driving fast.

                                 GORD
                        Slow down. We ain’t in no hurry.

           The car slows.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        What are we facing up there?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        We? I’m not facing anything but a 
                        peaceful end to this day. 
                                 GORD
                        Whose up there?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        I don’t know.

           Gord pumps the shotgun.

                                 BASTOGNE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Thompson. Deputy Stirn. 
                        Clemens, of course...your Sheriff.

                                 GORD
                        My Sheriff? Zin?

           Bastogne nods into the rear view mirror.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        What for?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        He come lookin’ for you.

           Gord falls back into his seat. Concerned.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           The horsemen shuffle in the front door. Benjamin Clemens, the 
           leader of the pack, comes in last. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        What took you so damn long? Have 
                        your boys lock and load.

           Clemens follows Benjamin over to the covered bodies.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Easy, brother. What happened?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Sheriff Zin decided to pay a visit. 

           Benjamin nods in understanding.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Is Jane here? The kids?

           Clemens shakes his head.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Thankfully, no. They’re up at the 
                        lake for another week.
                                 BENJAMIN
                        What are we dealing with?

                                 CLEMENS
                        The boy’s father. He crisped my 
                        station. Maybe more.

           Clemens walks over to the window.

                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        Deputy Bastogne should be back 
                        shortly.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        And if he comes here? Gord?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Shoot him for trespassing my land. 
                        Keep it clean.

           Benjamin beams.

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne looks back at Gord using the rear-view.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        They got marksmen up there.

                                 GORD
                        Yeah?

                                 BASTOGNE
                        They won’t take kindly to this, and 
                        what you’ve done.

                                 GORD
                        You’re right. Pull over.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        What?

                                 GORD
                        Pull over.

           He does.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Get out.

           They do.
           EXT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Bastogne is terrified.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Whatcha gonna do?

           Gord points the shotgun at Bastogne.

                                 GORD
                        Take off your clothes.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Benjamin is holding an M14 rifle, along with 4 of his men. 
           One of them, Dan (also from the bar scene), is holding a 
           shotgun.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Sheriff. Mr. Thompson. Care for a 
                        shotgun?

           Clemens nods.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Oh Lord Jesus. 

           Benjamin hands Clemens a shotgun.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        We’re gonna surveil things. We’ll 
                        circle up once Bastogne gets back. 
                        Dan, stay with Sheriff.

                                 THOMPSON
                        And if he doesn’t come back?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Give it an hour.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Can’t we just call him?

                                 CLEMENS
                        No. Let’s do it Benjamin’s way.

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Gord is driving. He’s wearing Bastogne’s uniform.

           Bastogne is wearing Gord’s clothes. He is firmly pressing the 
           shotgun against the base of Gord’s skull. 
           Bastogne’s hands are tightly tied in this position with a 
           rope. The shotgun has been emptied.

           Gord has him where he wants him.

                                 BASTOGNE
                        Make a left at the gate. Then it’s 
                        a mile up the road.

           Gord turns through an old, dilapidated wooden ranch gate. 

           Fields of dead grass cascade in all directions.

                                 BASTOGNE (CONT’D)
                        What do I do? When we get there.

                                 GORD
                        That’ll depend.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Benjamin is perched like a sniper next to a rotting tree. He 
           spots the approaching cruiser through a pair of binoculars.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Bastogne’s coming. Better cover 
                        just in case. 

           The 4 men position themselves along the slight hill 
           overlooking the road and the desolate town many miles in the 
           distance. The ranch house 100 feet to their right.

           Benjamin watches the cruiser getting closer, noticing the 
           window being damaged from the shotgun blast....

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        The window’s shot. Something’s up. 
                        Get ready.

           All the men but Benjamin raise their rifles.

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Gord sees the movement of a rifleman on the hillside. He then 
           looks at the adjacent ranch house and veers toward the far 
           west side of the home that is opposite of Benjamin’s position 
           to the east.

           The veering intentionally exposes the inside of the car to 
           Benjamin...
           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Benjamin can see the situation inside the cruiser --

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Hostage situation --

           Benjamin drops the binoculars -- picks up the rifle -- aims 
           for a moment -- 

           -- and FIRES --

           INT. BASTOGNE’S CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           -- THUD and SPLATTER --

           -- The bullet tears through the skull of Bastogne -- 

           Gord disappears behind the ranch house with the cruiser --

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord throws the car in park and jumps out.

           He opens the trunk quietly and pulls out his M1 rifle.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Benjamin and his four men, at first cautiously descending the 
           hillside, relax a little in satisfaction.

           One of them pats Benjamin on the shoulder in congratulations.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord squats at ready by the southwest corner of the house.

           He takes a deep breath then turns the corner, facing east, 
           rifle forward --

           -- Quickly SHOOTING two of the men the chest --

           -- Falling to the ground -- they die moments later --

                                 BENJAMIN
                        -- Shit --

           Benjamin and his 2 remaining rifle-bearing men take cover 
           against the east side of the house --
           Benjamin quietly addresses the men, BAILEY and STERLIN:

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Bailey you go around the north side 
                        of the house, flank him that way. 
                        Sterlin, you take the south, try to 
                        tangle up the son of a bitch in a 
                        fire-fight while Bailey cuts him 
                        down. Meanwhile I’ll enter through 
                        the window to make sure he ain’t 
                        already inside. Got it?

           They nod.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll push through and meet you at 
                        the west side. Go.

           They move. 

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Benjamin slides open the window and calls in through the 
           kitchen:

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Dan? Sheriff? 

                                 DAN (O.S.)
                        Benjamin? 

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Dammit, Dan, come out to the 
                        kitchen.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Sterlin peers around the northeast corner. Nothing. He 
           advances slowly west. Staying low. Rifle forward.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Bailey peers around the southeast corner. Nothing. He too 
           advances west.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Dan makes his way into the kitchen. Staying low. Crouching 
           with the shotgun.
           Benjamin joins him in good cover.

                                 DAN
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        He got James and Adam.

           Dan is falling apart.

                                 DAN
                        Holy shit--

           Benjamin grabs Dan’s shoulder and jerks some sense into him.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Pull yourself together! Where’s my 
                        brother?

                                 DAN
                        Locked up in the office. Sheriff’s 
                        keeping an eye on Thompson.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Good. I got Sterlin and Bailey 
                        trying to pin him down outside. 

           Benjamin points to the west side of the house. 

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s push through. Cautiously.  

           They move.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Bailey and Sterlin all but simultaneously turn their 
           respective corners at the west end of the house. 

           They see each other, then raise their rifles at Bastogne’s 
           seemingly empty cruiser. Engine running. Driver door open.

           They then look out over the wide extensive grass plains. 
           Nowhere to hide. 

           Their attention turns back to the cruiser. Gray fumes from 
           the exhaust. 

           Sterlin looks under the car. Nothing.

           Bailey spots a rifle on the ground in front of the trunk.

           Sterlin looks inside the from the driver’s window. Nothing.
           Bailey moves closer to the rifle which is weighing down a 
           piece of paper.

           Sterlin scans the rooftop...

           ...as Bailey picks up the paper...turning it over...

           It is the SAME NOTE that was left for Gord: ”Are you a Faggot 
           like your boy?”

           A fearful countenance sweeps Bailey until --

           -- The TRUNK FLIES OPEN --

           -- The BLAST of a SHOTGUN --

           -- BLOWING Bailey fatally off his feet -- 

           -- Gord rolls out of the trunk onto the earth --

           -- Picking up the rifle and shooting Sterlin in the ankle 
           underneath the car --

           -- Sterlin FALLS -- Alert -- staring down the barrel of 
           Gord’s rifle --

                                 GORD
                             (softly)
                        Is there anyone else?

           Sterlin shakes his head.

                                 SNAKE
                        Not outside.

                                 GORD
                        If you’re lying I’ll shoot you 
                        first. Do you want to live?

           Sterlin nods.

                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        How many inside?

                                 SNAKE
                        Four.

                                 GORD
                        Who?

                                 SNAKE
                        Sheriff Clemens. Benjamin. Dan. 
                        Farmer Thompson.
                                 GORD
                        What about Zin?

                                 SNAKE
                        He’s dead.

                                 GORD
                        Who killed him?

                                 SNAKE
                        Clemens.

           Gord doesn’t lose control.

                                 GORD
                        Take the cruiser and drive. Get out 
                        of here.

                                 SNAKE
                        But--

                                 GORD
                             (tensing)
                        Now. If you turn back, I’ll kill 
                        you.

           Sterlin limps into the cruiser and drives away...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Dan calls out to Benjamin -- 

                                 DAN
                        Look. I think he’s getting away.

           Benjamin carefully moves up to the window, facing south, 
           where Dan is positioned.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Blow out the window.

                                 DAN
                        What?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Shoot out the goddamn window.

           Dan BLASTS it open with the shotgun --

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Cover me.

           Benjamin takes aim at the fleeing driver...
           BAM. 

           The tire unravels on impact of the bullet, swerving off the 
           road...

                                 DAN
                        Why didn’t you shoot the bastard?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Shut up.

           Sterlin exits the cruiser and falters in step, then falls to 
           the grass in pain...grasping at his wounded ankle...

                                 DAN
                             (squinting)
                        Is that Sterlin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Get down.

           They do.

                                 DAN
                        We’ve got to help him.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Stop thinking.

           INT. CLEMENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Thompson is sitting behind a desk, anxiously TAPPING his 
           fingers.

           Clemens looks at Thompson, annoyed.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Are you sure this room is bullet 
                        proof?

                                 CLEMENS
                        That depends on the caliber.

           Thompson keeps TAPPING his fingers.

                                 THOMPSON
                        What the hell you build this for?

                                 CLEMENS
                        The Russians. Christ, will you cut 
                        it?

           Thompson stops.
                                 CLEMENS (CONT’D)
                        It seems like the boys might need 
                        my help. More than you do, anyhow.

           Clemens stands and walks towards the fortified door.

                                 THOMPSON
                        What are you going to do?

                                 CLEMENS
                        Handle it. I’m Sheriff after all. I 
                        can’t be found cowering behind a 
                        door.

                                 THOMPSON
                        Don’t I need something more than 
                        this here Colt?

           Clemens looks down at the Colt artfully rising from 
           Thompson’s hip.

                                 CLEMENS
                        If you are our last defense -- 
                        we’re screwed.

           He then UNLOCKS and OPENS the heavy old door...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Clemens walks down the hall, shotgun forward. The door closes 
           TIGHTLY behind him.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Benjamin?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        Stay down!

           Clemens continues to walk, following the voice of Benjamin. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        Haven’t got a hold of the 
                        situation, have you?

                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        We’ll get the sonofabitch.

           Clemens looks out the kitchen window to find two of the dead 
           men.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Anybody with you?
                                 BENJAMIN (O.S.)
                        Dan.

           Clemens walks into the room where Benjamin and Dan are holed 
           up.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Bailey? Sterlin?

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Get down!

           Clemens crouches.

                                 BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
                        Bailey is unaccounted for. Sterlin 
                        is wounded out in the field.

           Farmer Thompson is growing increasingly jittery...

           He stands up and starts to pace...

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Clemens stands...gazing out the window...thinking for a 
           moment...then heads towards the front door...

                                 BENJAMIN
                        What in hell’s name are you doing?

           Clemens looks at him, says nothing, then heads outside...

           Clemens walks out into the open through the front door...

           Benjamin stands and barks at Dan:

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Let’s cover him, dammit. 

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Wind whips across Clemens. Shotgun pointed towards the earth 
           at his side.
                                 CLEMENS
                             (calling out to Gord)
                        I have a wife and two children. Two 
                        boys, in fact. You’ve killed and 
                        wounded my men. Torn my law to 
                        shreds. Why don’t we talk this out?

           Gord appears around the southwest corner of the house with 
           his rifle pointed at Clemens.

           Clemens senses Gord, turning around to face him...

                                 GORD
                        I’m not interested in any more 
                        hocus pocus talk, mister.

                                 CLEMENS
                        Put the weapon down so we can work 
                        this through.

                                 GORD
                        Talking had its chance.

           Through the glare of the window, we can see Dan sneaking up 
           to flank Gord from inside the house...

           Without taking the rifle off Clemens -- Gord draws his pistol 
           -- 

           -- SHOOTING Dan squarely in the head -- window glass 
           SHATTERING into a thousand pieces --

           -- Clemens thinks about lifting the shotgun but backs off -- 
           he knows he’s out of his league --

                        Oh, Lord, please forgive me...

           Gord continues to move towards Clemens. Slowly. Rifle 
           forward.

           Clemens suddenly ERUPTS:
                                 CLEMENS
                        YOUR COCK SUCKING FAGGOT CHILD IS

                        CORNER OF HELL!!!

           Gord lowers the rifle and FIRES --

           -- Dark blood swelling from Clemens’ liver --

           -- Gord crouches and unsheathes Clemens’ sidearm -- unloading 
           it and tossing it aside along with the shotgun --

           -- Clemens writhing in that unthinkable pain -- covering his 
           wound -- blood now seeping through his fingers --

           Gord hears a horse GALLUP away --

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord comes up behind the eastward fleeing horse, commandeered 
           by Benjamin...

           50 yards and counting, Benjamin is getting away...

           Gord raises his rifle, and SHOOTS Benjamin squarely in the 
           back...

           Arms flailing, he falls to the earth...

           Gord approaches Benjamin, who is on his back...

           Benjamin just stares.

                                 GORD
                        I’ll put the bullet on your bar 
                        tab.

           Gord shoots him in the head.

           Gord points the rifle right up against Clemens’ forehead.
                                 CLEMENS
                        Straight in. Third door on the 
                        left. My office.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord walks down the hall towards Clemens’ office where 
           Thompson is still hiding.

           EXT. CLEMENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Standing to the side of the closed door, Gord attempts to 
           open the locked door --

           -- Three SHOTS penetrate the door intended for Gord --

           -- Gord BLASTS the lock out with his shotgun --

           -- Two more SHOTS are fired from within the room --

           -- Then nothing but the CLICK CLICK CLICK of a desperate 
           revolver --

           Gord enters the room.

           INT. CLEMENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Thompson drops the revolver from his right hand in surrender 
           from his seated position.

           Gord squats so he is eye-level with Thompson. 

           Gord pulls a knife and puts it to Thompson neck.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I didn’t mean for your boy to 
                        suffer. I’m just a simple farmer...

                                 GORD
                        What about your boy?

           Thompson finds what he thinks is strength.

                                 THOMPSON
                        I’ll make things right.

                                 GORD
                        Give me your hand.

           Thompson offers his left hand.
                                 GORD (CONT’D)
                        Your right hand.

           Thompson fearfully obliges.

           Gord cuts Thompson hand slowly and unevenly.

           Gord wipes blood from the knife as Thompson falls onto the 
           floor crying.

           INT. CLEMENS RANCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Gord towers over Zin’s body.

           He studies the corpse.

                                 GORD
                        I’ll look after your wife.

           Gord lifts Zin and throws him over his shoulders.

           EXT. CLEMENS RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Gord walks out. Zin still mounted on his shoulders. Lumbering 
           forward.

           Clemens is crawling towards his weapon. Gord kicking it 
           further away.

           Gord carefully puts the body in the backseat of the healthy 
           cruiser, treating Zin as if he is only in a deep sleep.

           He looks at Clemens, who is growing severely ashen. Shock 
           setting in.

           Gord cuts the horses free then heads for the cruiser. 

                                 CLEMENS
                        You’re gonna leave me here? Like 
                        this?

                                 GORD
                        Yes.

           Gord enters the vehicle without urgency and starts up the 
           engine.

           Slowly, he rolls into gear and drives off towards home...

           END.
