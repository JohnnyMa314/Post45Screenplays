            The Black List was compiled from the suggestions over 290 film executives, each of 

            whom contributed the names of up to ten of their favorite scripts that were written in, 

            or are somehow uniquely associated with, 2012 and will not have completed principal 

            photography during this calendar year.

            This year, scripts had to receive at least six mentions to be included on the Black List.

            All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein. 

            The Black List apologizes for all misspellings, misattributions, incorrect representation 

            identification, and questionable 2012 affiliations.

            It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

            The Black List is not a “best of ” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.

           It is 1951. Junior Senator Joe McCarthy feels lost. He’s anonymous, just another suit 
           on Capitol Hill. He craves attention and celebrity. He’s desperate to be noticed, to be 
           adored. Inspired by the response of the American public to the House of Un-American 
           Activities Committee, McCarthy decides that communism will be his defining issue. 
           What follows is nearly unthinkable -- national fame, a shocking conspiracy, a sitting 
           President afraid to oppose him, and a torrid journey of self destruction and paranoia.
