                                 September 17, 2012
                            For Jeff Silver and Matt Rosen
           EXT. PARK ROW, NEW YORK - DAY

           A tower, silhouetted by sun.  

           The New York World building, the city’s tallest at 14 
           stories, Gold Dome basked in warm light.  A young blond man 
           admires from the street.  Turned away from us.  He ignores 
           the other buildings.  He wants the World.  

           HOLD ON this small man and the colossal construction...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ELEVENTH STREET PIER - EARLY MORNING

           Superimpose: 1897             
                        Lower East Side, Manhattan 

           Fog lifting.  A ferry from “The City of Brooklyn” docks.  
           Under the boardwalk FOUR BOYS play as a red-and-yellow 
           oilcloth PACKAGE is pulled in by the current.  The boys push 
           and shove to get to it.  One rips away the cloth, sees:

           A MAN’S SEVERED TORSO AND TWO ARMS

           Bloody.  A crab crawls out of a gash between the nipples...

           INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY

           Hellish decay.  Sun streams through a skylight.  Corpses on 
           marble slabs, icy mist shoos away the flies. 

           The Torso-n-Arms is wheeled passed the on-duty Constable - 
           he’s unfazed, playing solitaire.  He simply doesn’t care.  

           Among a group of ever-present reporters, GEORGE ARNOLD, 
           working the morgue beat for the lowly rag NEW YORK JOURNAL, 
           watches SUPERINTENDENT inspect

           The serrated gash in the chest...      

           The arms, bluish pale and muscular...  

           The callused hands.

           Hideous and captivating, Arnold starts writing in a moleskin: 
           “...BEHEADED, CAST INTO RIVER...”

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PIER 14, NORTH RIVER (THE HUDSON, WEST SIDE) - DAY

           A MARCHING BAND PLAYS.  Celebratory balloons fly.  Waiters 
           with oyster trays weave through the upper-crust crowd and 
           (far too many) on-duty Policemen enjoying this lavish, 
           excessive affair.  At center, an ANNOUNCEMENT BANNER:

           “W.R. HEARST OFFERS A NEW EVENING JOURNAL”

           Everyone’s waiting for something.  Two relative nobodies: MR. 
           CLARK, 50s with mutton chops, berates the younger JAMES 
           GORDON BENNETT JR. for drinking the champagne. 

                                 CLARK
                        You’ve any idea what that’s cost us?

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        Us?  It’s the widow Hearst’s money.

                                 CLARK
                        Her money, my headache.  Goddamn 
                        boy.  It’s the commemorative launch
                        ...where in hell is he?!

                                                                CUT TO:

           A STEAM YACHT ON THE WATER - ITS BOW READS “VAMOOSE”

           Ugly, stripped to bare essentials so it’s fast. At the helm, 
           the young Blond man, eyes steady, hair blowing in the wind...

           ON THE PIER

           People notice the blur on the water getting closer.  Young 
           women, especially, crane their necks as the Vamoose docks --  

           Off steps WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST to applause and shouts of 
           congratulations.  Energetic, wide smile, 33 going on 21.

           But as he glad-hands, he notices something isn’t right.  
           Among all the excess, something is still missing.  His Sunday 
           editor, MORRILL GODDARD, 40s, eyes the Vamoose:  

                                 GODDARD
                        So that’s the world-record holder.

                                 WILL
                        27 knots...Morrill, how many people 
                        made it out here for today?

                                 GODDARD
                        It’s a good-size crowd.  

           But the boy-king is unsatisfied.  Across the way, he SEES the 
           No. 7 train letting passengers off at the station --  

           So Will starts walking.  And Morrill just shakes his head...
           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY

           Will charms the CONDUCTOR as Goddard blocks boarders from 
           getting on in the b.g.  

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Uh, but you see, Mr. Hearst --

                                 WILL
                        W.R., please!

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        Mr. W.R. the train runs on schedule  
                        so we can’t just lend it out --

                                 WILL
                        Who said anything about lending?

           Will slips an arm over Conductor’s shoulder and a check into 
           his pocket:

                                 WILL
                        See, I’ve just expanded my paper 
                        and I want the public to know about 
                        it -- all New York, not just the 
                        ones who made it out here today.

                                 CONDUCTOR
                        But sir, this is the city’s train.

                                 WILL
                        Today it belongs to the Journal.  

           Off the face of a man who never learned the word “no” 

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE TRAIN RUNNING THROUGH THE CITY - PARTY RAGING INSIDE.  

           But now, as rich folk celebrate onboard, ordinary citizens 
           can cheer the passing train and read the ANNOUNCEMENT BANNER 
           pinned to its caboose.  A brilliant advertizing ploy.

           Will hands Goddard a glass of champagne, they “cheers”.  

                                 WILL
                        To the new Evening Edition!  Now I 
                        didn’t see him onboard; is he here?

                                 GODDARD 
                        No, I’m gonna meet him tonight.  

           Clark approaches, struggling to balance as Goddard drinks.

                                 WILL
                        How’s it taste?
                                 CLARK
                        Expensive!
                             (pushing Goddard out)
                        I reserved the pier!  Was 
                        commandeering a train really 
                        necessary? 

                                 WILL
                        Publication without promotion, Mr. 
                        Clark, is well intentioned but 
                        ultimately futile...
                             (notices a young girl 
                              eyeing him)
                        ...like winking at a girl in the 
                        dark.  A new Evening Edition only 
                        succeeds against Pulitzer’s World 
                        if all New York knows about it.  

                                 CLARK
                        So you spent on caviar, balloons, a 
                        train - the only thing missing is 
                        the man you intend to run it!  Is 
                        it too much to even ask for a name?

                                 WILL
                        That reminds me, I need more money.

                                 CLARK
                        We made a million dollar investment.

                                 WILL
                        Well now I’m behind by two --

                                 CLARK
                        And losing thousands more every 
                        day!  It’s not enough you haven’t 
                        turned a profit in a year, but 
                        these frivolous purchases, be it 
                        cocktails or the whole Goddamned 
                        Morning Advertizer --

                                 WILL
                        What I “purchased” was its A.P. 
                        Wire Service - the newspaper just 
                        happened to come with it.  
                             (he’s incorrigible)
                        How I choose to spend my money is 
                        of no one else’s concern --

           Will starts to head toward the girl, Clark grabs his arm --

                                 CLARK
                        But it’s not your money, it’s your 
                        mother’s - and she’s made it my 
                        concern.  There’s a reason your 
                        father left it all to her.  Babicora 
                        may be in your name, but everything 
                        else belongs to her.  Remember it.  
                                 WILL
                        Believe me Clark, I don’t forget.

           Will goes to sweet talk the girl.  Clark enjoys his victory.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BRISBANE’S OFFICE, OFFICES OF NEW YORK WORLD - SAME TIME

           New York World Editor ARTHUR BRISBANE, 30s, handsome, watches 
           the party train from his 7th floor window.  His office also 
           serves as a small apartment, bed sheets unmade.  

           SEITZ, the World’s portly advertizing manager, knocks.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Solly’s leaving now, isn’t he?  
                        It’s the end of an era, Seitz.

           They walk out together.

                                 BRISBANE
                        You see what was going on at the 
                        pier?  I wonder how many on-duty 
                        police felt it necessary to patrol 
                        Willy-the-Worst’s launch party. 
                             (sarcastic:)
                        Misappropriation of Police 
                        resources - a page one story?

                                 SEITZ
                        Haha, that’ll be the day...
                             (spots a typo in notes:)
                        Hey, are there two “T”s in water?

                                 BRISBANE
                        Only the wettest.

           WORLD OFFICES

           Marble, impressive.  Brisbane and Seitz come onto the floor 
           where messengers walk practiced routes through ordered cubes.  

           Bronze wall-placards read:  Who?  What?  Where?  When?  How?   

                                       The Facts - The Color - The Facts 

                                       Accuracy, Accuracy, Accuracy!

           It’s quiet but for S.S. CARVALHO (Solly), goatee, impeccably 
           dressed, angrily boxing his things at a desk hardly befitting 
           his years and experience.  Retiring, this is his last day.

                                 BRISBANE
                        You’ll miss it.
                                 CARVALHO
                        Not all of it.  Can’t see why you 
                        insist on staying with him, Arthur.
                             (pause)
                        Well, uh, please give him this: 

           Carvalho leaves an envelope on the desk, shakes Brisbane and 
           Seitz hands and walks out.  Brisbane reads the envelope:

           Labeled: “For Mr. Pulitzer.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR, TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - LATE AFTERNOON

           Carvalho sits at the bar with his box-of-things.  He shares a 
           (couple) drinks with Hearst’s friend Goddard while scanning a 
           Town Topics gossip rag filled with stories about “Willieboy.”

                                 CARVALHO
                        It was smart to leave when you did.

                                 GODDARD
                        You didn’t think so at the time.  
                        But Solomon Carvalho - retiring... 
                        “My soul’s overwhelmed with sorrow; 
                        stay here and keep watch --”

                                 CARVALHO
                        What’s with the Bible talk?

                                 GODDARD
                        All newsmen study the tactics of 
                        their rival - when you edit a 
                        Sunday, your rival is God.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        “God”... I’m an old man, Morrill, 
                        all I’ve left to look forward to is 
                        my meeting with him.  

                                 GODDARD
                        Nah.  Like Lazarus you’ve just met 
                        a premature end.  And in your case,  
                        too, I know of another man to aid 
                        your resurrection...

           Puzzled, Carvalho follows Goddard’s gaze to a back corner 
           where sits the “other man” - Will - raising a glass of water.

           ANGLE - LATER

           Will and Carvalho sit together.  Carvalho sips scotch; Will 
           gulps water, arm draped around Carvalho’s seat seductively.  
           Accustomed with deadlines, their dialogue is quick-paced:
                                 CARVALHO
                        “Was forming an Evening Edition a 
                        good idea?”  You’re asking now? Ha!
                             (realizing it’s a test)
                        Well, they’re reading more in the 
                        evenings: they have a day’s pay to 
                        spend.  Staffs are rested, they can 
                        react to what people want...yeah, 
                        you may have a future yet.  Now, 
                        who are you putting in charge?

                                 WILL
                        You.

                                 CARVALHO
                        ...Excuse me?

                                 WILL
                        You’re going to run my Evening 
                        Journal - still think I’ve a future?

                                 CARVALHO
                        I may’ve spoke too soon.  Mr. 
                        Hearst --

                                 WILL
                        W.R. - my boys call me W.R --

                                 CARVALHO
                        I’m not your boy and I’m retired --

                                 WILL
                        Two things I wish to rectify --

                                 CARVALHO
                        Are you telling me you expanded, 
                        bought presses, bought the space, 
                        advertized and celebrated a new 
                        Edition and you’ve no one to run it?

                                 WILL
                        I do have someone to run it.

           Will hands him a check for $35,000 - the largest check he’s 
           ever seen!  Carvalho stands for emphasis as Town Topics falls 
           out his pocket:

                                 CARVALHO
                        Jesus!  Between moves like this and 
                        your poor readership you won’t last 
                        three months!

           Awwwkwaard.  Carvalho can’t believe he had the balls.  Will 
           picks up the gossip rag, sees the stories about him inside.

                                 WILL
                        You seem to know all about me...
                                 CARVALHO
                        Everybody knows about the “San 
                        Francisco-boy Millionaire.”

                                 WILL
                        I see that here, yes.  

           Realizing it was insulting, Carvalho re-sits, embarrassed.   

                                 CARVALHO
                        You know, you puzzle me Mr. Hearst. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re not the only one.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        No... A year ago you backed that 
                        man, uh, Jennings Bryan, in the 
                        election.  Seemed simple enough - 
                        he wanted to end the gold standard, 
                        your father owned a silver mine: a 
                        Bryan Presidency would have made 
                        your family richer.  
                             (Will sips his water)
                        But then most forget, your father 
                        owned a much larger gold mine... 
                        which means supporting Bryan would 
                        actually have destroyed the family 
                        coffers... not benefited them...

           He’s trying to ask Will “why”.  But no explanation comes.

                                 CARVALHO
                        I imagine you had a great many 
                        options; you could have done 
                        anything.  Why newspapers?

                                 WILL
                        What does that matter?

                                 CARVALHO
                        Bryan might have been a terrible 
                        leader - or an excellent one, but 
                        you only picked him based on 
                        personal motivations.  You print 
                        for yourself, with no regard as to 
                        how it affects...anyone else.  I 
                        just left a man like that, I don’t 
                        wish to be employed by another...
                             (gives back the check)
                        Far more generous though he may be.  

           BEAT.  He gets up to go, leaving Will to think on this.  

                                 WILL
                        Solly, all you need to know is that 
                        I surround myself with the best. 
                                 CARVALHO
                        It’s not enough.  The Mercury and 
                        Times evening editions had great 
                        men - Pulitzer ate ‘em both up.  

                                 WILL
                        Why?

                                 CARVALHO
                        It’s what I’m trying to tell you.  
                        You need something else - that won’t 
                        just appeal to your vanity, a real 
                        reason readers will want to defect,

           INSERT CUT: In the evening hours, Journal reporter George 
           Arnold files his “BEHEADED, CAST INTO RIVER” story...

                                 CARVALHO
                        ...to betray a publisher they’ve 
                        trusted so long to deliver the Word 
                        - and whose trusted them to buy it.  
                        What you need, Mr. Hearst, is --

                                 WILL
                        A story.

                                 CARVALHO
                        The right story.  Without that, 
                        you’ll be fodder for the 
                        competition.  And make no mistake, 
                        Joseph Pulitzer is the competition.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHATWOLD MANSION - “RIVER GIVES UP A MURDER MYSTERY”

           -- Reads the Evening World article under the fold.  The World 
           tops a stack of papers atop a silver tray carried by

           JABEZ, a Valet, gliding through this Lakewood mansion.  He 
           passes KATE PULITZER with her newborn and disappears into a 
           separate, secluded wing built of stone --

           THE TOWER OF SILENCE.  Lined with cushion like a sanitarium.  
           What years of success have built.

           INT. BASEMENT POOL

           Ocean fed and steam heated.  Sitting there, slumped, bearded: 
           the legendary JOSEPH PULITZER, 50s.  Atlas drained.

           INT. OFFICE, TOWER OF SILENCE

           Wheezing, Pulitzer grabs the World off Jabez’s tray; skims.  
           Then Jabez hands him the ENVELOPE Carvalho left “For Mr. 
           Pulitzer.”  Pulitzer reads to himself, then crumples it up.  
           Whatever it said, it ruined his day.   

                                 PULITZER
                        I want to see Brisbane first thing 
                        in the morning.

           Jabez nods.  As he opens the door to leave, a baby CRIES O.S.

                                 PULITZER
                        And if he’s going to make that 
                        indefuckingfatigable noise, tell my 
                        wife to take him outside!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT, THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - EVENING

           Will has sex with the girl from the train.  She’s trying hard 
           but his mind is elsewhere - Carvalho’s admonition.

           LATER

           The girl is gone.  Will sits on the edge of the bed reviewing 
           page proofs...

           He turns the pages with his toes.  An odd movement, solitary,  
           as he looks for the answer to his emptiness in those pages.  
           Instead, he finds an ad for a new play at The Herald Theatre - 
           “The Girl From Paris”...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “HERALD SQUARE” BROADWAY THEATRE - NIGHT

           A packed house.  Will enters, shakes USHER’S hand, familiar. 

                                 USHER
                        New girl tonight, I hear she’s 
                        good.

           Will’s view is terrible, blocked by a fat woman’s head.  He 
           sees a FOURSOME enjoying a BALCONY with a fantastic view --

           MOMENTS LATER

           Foursome count dollar bills as Will eases comfortably into 
           his new seats.  Applause as the curtain rises on The Girl 
           from Paris.  An actress appears on stage.  Blonde, a vision.  

           Will is shocked - he recognizes her: TESSIE POWERS, late 20s.
           INT. BACKSTAGE, VAUDEVILLE THEATRE - LATER

           Actors and stagehands greet Tessie with roses.  

                                 WILL (O.S.)
                        You should be making double what 
                        Lillian Russell is.  I’ll talk with 
                        the producer.

           Tessie is surprised to see him standing there. 

                                 TESSIE
                        Were they enjoying it?  

                                 WILL
                        There is no doubt.

                                 TESSIE
                        Then let Lillian Russell keep her 
                        money... William Randolph Hearst, 
                        how are you?

                                 WILL
                        Famished.  Have supper with me.

                                 TESSIE
                        I have plans with my friends.  

           He looks to the group, as if just realizing they’re there.

                                 WILL
                        Everybody, your meal is on me!  
                             (cheers, then much softer)
                        Only you’ll have to excuse Ms. 
                        Powers here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. “SHERRY’S” RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Very upscale.  Will belongs, Tessie doesn’t.  Other patrons 
           steal judgemental glances, Will is completely oblivious to 
           Tessie’s discomfort as he eats a plate of french fries.  

                                 WILL
                        I love the theatre; it’s my 
                        sanctuary.  Have you been in New 
                        York all this time?  

                                 TESSIE
                        Among other places.  Took time to 
                        get here from San Francisco.  

                                 WILL
                        Do you love it as much as you 
                        thought you would?
           She feels a rich woman’s eyes on her:

                                 TESSIE
                        Most days.  

           He sees her looking down at her plate embarrassed, notices 
           the rich woman giving them looks.  Will calls the waiter.

                                 WILL
                        Garçon, evening.  Seems the lady 
                        over there can’t take her eyes off 
                        my table...
                             (Tessie is twice as 
                              embarrassed now)
                        ...I think it’s the fries.  Send 
                        her a plate on me, please.

           Waiter nods.  Will stares at the woman until she looks away, 
           then smiles, pleased with himself. 

                                 WILL
                        You haven’t asked me anything...

                                 TESSIE
                        There isn’t much I don’t know, most 
                        of it’s printed in the gossips.  
                             (now he’s embarrassed)
                        I was very sorry about your father, 
                        I know how much he meant to you.
                        Do you ever go back to Babicora?

                                 WILL
                             (touched)
                        You remember Babicora?

                                 TESSIE
                        Your father’s ranch?  Of course, 
                        you loved it there.  I used to 
                        think that’s where you’d end up the 
                        way you’d talk about it.

                                 WILL
                        How did I talk about it?

                                 TESSIE
                        Like you could be happy there.  

                                 WILL
                             (stops eating)
                        Tess, I don’t know what my mother 
                        said to you to make you leave 
                        but... I’m on my own now.

                                 TESSIE
                        She doesn’t pay for all this?
                                 WILL
                        Not for long.  And when the Journal 
                        starts to turn a profit...you won’t 
                        have to worry about her.  We could 
                        be together again --

           Overwhelmed, she gets up, ignores the looks as she leaves...

           EXT. “SHERRY’S” RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Will follows Tessie out.  Down the street in an alley, a very 
           different class of people are drinking, laughing... He runs 
           across the road to her, upsetting the light traffic.

                                 WILL
                        Tess, she’s 3000 miles away...

                                 TESSIE
                        You really think I left because of 
                        your mother?  

                                 WILL
                        ...She didn’t want us to be 
                        together but now --

                                 TESSIE
                        It wasn’t her, Will!  (beat)  You 
                        don’t, you don’t understand me, you 
                        don’t really understand people.  
                        You ride in fast boats, buy balcony

                        I run a newspaper now!  And soon 
                        I’m gonna build papers in every

                        Everyone in there “knows” how I got 
                        mine - I have to distinguish 
                        myself.  I can do that by being 
                        bigger --

                                 TESSIE
                        Putting papers in every city with 
                        your mother’s money means nothing.  
                        It’s just more...collecting.  
                             (re: restaurant patrons)
                        And it won’t impress those people.  
                        Ever.  
           Then she points to the people in the alley:

                                 TESSIE
                        But I wonder, did you ever think 
                        about the people out here?  There’s 
                        a lot of them you know.  Lot of 
                        readers.  You think they care about 
                        railroads in Washington?   They’re 
                        too busy struggling.  Dying.  48 
                        papers in New York, not one speaks 
                        to those people.  But you - you 
                        have opportunity.  And will.  What 
                        you could do with it...

           He watches the people in the alley together.  An outsider. 

                                 TESSIE
                        If you had done nothing but vanish 
                        to Babicora I... I never needed the 
                        name... So you want to run a 
                        newspaper now.  Alright.  But then 
                        don’t expand it, run it.  Maybe 
                        even run stories about them.  Touch 
                        them, let them know their lives 
                        mean as much as the people in 
                        there.  If for no other reason than 
                        they won’t care how you got your 
                        start - they have their own lives 
                        to worry about...  I have to go.

           She kisses his cheek - an indication, perhaps, of what could 
           be.  Then she goes, leaving him to stand alone.

           EXT. HARLEM WOODS - MORNING

           Superimpose: Harlem

           A father plays hide and seek with his two sons.  One sprints 
           down a hill behind a rock.  He spies a package:

           Wrapped in red-and-yellow oil cloth.  He unwraps it:

           We don’t see inside, but the boy will never be the same...

           INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL HALLWAY/MORGUE - DAY

           The boy’s find is rolled in by Superintendent and 

           Veteran Detective ART CAREY, mustache.  As they roll through, 
           it catches the attention of physicians, patients, visitors...
                                 CAREY
                        It was found in the Ogden woods 
                        near Undercliff, but I read about 
                        oil cloth like this in the papers 
                        yesterday --

                                 CAREY
                        I am aware.

           They pass the ever-present group of reporters, always on the 
           hunt.  Journal reporter Arnold (seen earlier) overhears:

                        Was that Carey from Goatsville?
                        Must be his first stiff in years.

           They push and shove to catch a look as the cart hits a marble 
           slab.  Superintendent and Carey lift the unseen body part off-

           Yesterday’s Torso-n-arms lines up perfectly with today’s find: 
           A MAN’S MID-SECTION.  Pruned abdomen, shriveled penis, bloody 
           stumped thighs.  The two sections come from the same body.  

           Reporters immediately start shouting questions...mayhem.

           CONTORTED.  With great effort he breathes in, out...

                        Fuck...what is the point of this?

           He’s sprawled on the floor.  A fat DOCTOR with a thick German 
           accent kneels on his stomach.  Brisbane sits nearby stifling 
           laughter as Seitz munches on a piece of toast with jam.  
                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s the latest science in forcing 
                        one to take deep breaths --

                                 DOCTOR
                        The key is deep breaths, you must

                        with his mouth shut!  Help me up.

                        Important to whom?  We’re not, 
                        we’re not...touching people...

           Unable to communicate Tessie’s sentiments, he just leaves.

                        What the hell is he talking about?

           WILL’S OFFICE - WILL

           Shuts the door, frustrated.  Pinned to his wall, two maps: a 
           MAP OF GREATER NEW YORK (all the modern boroughs are 
           different cities) and a MAP OF AMERICA with certain cities 
           circled like San Francisco, Chicago, St. Louis.  Will tears 
           the second down.  Stares at Greater New York.

                                 WILL
                        What the hell am I talking about?

           INT. MAIN FLOOR, JOURNAL OFFICES, TRIBUNE BUILDING - EVENING

           Will steps out onto the floor, oversees:  

           The shabbiest newsroom on Park Row.  A CIRCUS of newsmen, 
           page boys, clerks, librarians and reporters roam through flat 
           and rolltop desks atop a sea of scrap paper, crammed under a 
           light grid; cigar smoke, loud chatter, tobacco spat into  
           brass spittoons...

           A BELL RINGS to signal a changing of the guard: reporters 
           make last edits, turn in their stories to the various editors 
           - sloppy stacks to be organized in a pre-computer age.  Hats 
           come off stands and sleeves unrolled as they file out and the 
           Morning Edition staff parades in to do it all again.  

           Will finds Goddard  at his desk, reviewing submissions:

                                 GODDARD
                        Find what you’re looking for?

                                 WILL
                        I want to get out of the office.  
                                 GODDARD
                        Yeah.  Take the Vamoose out for a --

                                 WILL
                        No, I want take a beat.  See what’s 
                        to be seen. 
                             (Goddard looks surprised)
                        What do think? City beat, the hall?

                                 GODDARD
                        George!

           The reporter we’ve been seeing, George Arnold, comes in, meet 
           hanging from his lip.  Goddard motions for him to wipe.

                                 GODDARD
                        W.R. here’s looking for a story.  
                        Take him to Bellevue.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL MORGUE - EVENING

           Will and Arnold file in unnoticed among a gathering of 
           reporters and physicians as CORONER inspects the (half) body.  

                                 ARNOLD
                             (sotto to Will)
                        Two pieces of some body were found 
                        at the pier and in Harlem.

                                 WILL
                        And?

                                 ARNOLD
                        And nothing. 

           Disappointed, Will watches Coroner measure the wingspan -- 

                                 CORONER
                        He was about five foot eleven... He 
                        was very strong... You can tell by 
                        the muscle development.  He was 
                        stabbed several times, poisoned, 
                        severed in - well - more than one 
                        place, possible signs of drowning 
                        and boiling.  And I can say without 
                        hesitation that this...
                             (looks at the penis)
                        ...man...was alive 48 hours ago.  

           There’s a response, but Will’s unimpressed.  As he leaves 
           Arnold there:

                                 WILL
                        This isn’t it.
           Detective Carey steps forward to address.  He hasn’t been 
           this important in some time - Arnold is ready to record for 
           the Journal as is NED BROWN for the World.  

                                 CAREY
                        Initially we speculated the body 
                        was prepared for photography as for 
                        a medical college.  But it still 
                        retains its organs and the wounds 
                        were inflicted before death.  I 
                        imagine this section here, in the 
                        chest, was removed to erase some 
                        identifying mark, possibly a 
                        tattoo. The upper half, was most 
                        likely dropped in Brooklyn, the 
                        lower in Harlem, meaning different 
                        jurisdictions and impossible to 
                        know where the act was committed.

                                 ARNOLD
                        What act, Detective?

                                 CAREY
                        Murder.

           QUOTE!  MURMURING.  Arnold sees Brown leave early...

           INT. OFFICES OF THE NEW YORK WORLD - AFTERNOON

           ...Brown submits an article for tomorrow’s World, titled: 
           “River Mystery Grows in Horror”...

           BRISBANE’S OFFICE

           ...Brisbane reviews articles, picks up Brown’s; reads. 

           He grabs yesterday’s Sunday, finds the River Gives Up a 
           Murder Mystery article, lays today’s next to it.  He adds an 
           exclamation point to the new title:  “...Grows in Horror!”

           Smirks.  

           INT. OFFICES OF THE NEW YORK WORLD - NIGHT

           Brisbane walks the hall, finds Brown...  (Nearby, we may 
           notice a painter scratching “Editorial Manager” off the door 
           of the recently-promoted Bradford.) 

                                 BRISBANE
                        Brown, good work on this river 
                        story.  I’m thinking front page for 
                        the Morning - and Evening.  Now, 
                        let’s find an illustrator...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT/DAWN

           Will wanders, thinking.  Sees two Police step over a homeless 
           man reaching up - not malicious, not helpful either.   

           He walks on.  Nearby, World NEWSBOYS cut rope from the day’s 
           paper stacks.  He sees they’re hooked by something:

           WORLD HEADLINE: “RIVER MYSTERY GROWS IN HORROR!”

           And underneath the headline:

           An ILLUSTRATION OF THE DEAD MAN’S HAND, GRABBING OUT AT THE 
           READER.  Gruesome and captivating.

                                 NEWSBOY
                        The two pieces line up perfectly!  

           Will watches Boy spread his hand out, lining it up with the 
           illustrated hand; smiles at the World’s brilliant tactic...

           And realizes.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           him, rushing past Nighthawk cabbies --

           INT. JOURNAL OFFICES - WILL

           Rummages through various article submissions, finds Arnold’s.

           WILL’S OFFICE - LATER

           Will consults Arnold as he paces the room, energized...

                                 WILL
                        You’ve been following this case...

                                 ARNOLD
                        Yeah.  

                                 WILL
                        Tell me about it.

                                 ARNOLD
                        Not much to tell.  Two pieces of 
                        the same body, turned up in two 
                        different parts of the city...

           As Arnold talks, Will takes a blue pencil to his MAP OF NEW 
           YORK and colors in the Bowery near 11th St.  Then West 
           Brooklyn.  Then Harlem.

                                 WILL
                        What are the police doing about it?
                                 ARNOLD
                        Heh, not much.  They don’t care 
                        ‘bout a case like this.

                                 WILL
                        A case like what?

                                 ARNOLD
                        Unclaimed body, don’t know whose 
                        jurisdiction it’s in - New York or 
                        Brooklyn - don’t want the headache.

                                 WILL
                        What about justice for the victim?

           Arnold snickers.  Will grabs his World, leaves him there...

           INT. BAR, TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - DAY

           The same bar we were in earlier.  Carvalho nurses a drink.  
           Sees Will come in, World paper in hand.  

                                 WILL (PRELAP)
                        Run my Evening Edition.

           ANGLE - LATER

           They’re both at the bar, leaning close.

                                 CARVALHO
                        Mr. He -- W.R. -- I told you I 
                        appreciate your offer but... You 
                        want a drink?

                                 WILL
                        No - water, thanks - what if I told 
                        you I had a story?  Like you said, 
                        a story on which to launch.

                                 CARVALHO
                        What story?

           Will throws the World onto the bar. Carvalho scans the page:

                                 CARVALHO
                        A murder?  No, a waste of time.

                                 WILL
                        ...The World wants it.

                                 CARVALHO
                        The World can afford to.

                                 WILL
                             (with a smile)
                        So can I.  
                                 CARVALHO
                        It’s not news.  Goddamn awful but -- 
                        look change in Cuba is news.  
                        Change in New York is news.  
                        Murders happen everyday.  

                                 WILL
                        That’s what I thought too - everyday 
                        a body’s found in an alley, some 
                        corpse on a corner - but how often 
                        do body parts start popping up 
                        across New York?  He was hacked into 
                        pieces.  Spread around.  It took 
                        time.  Savagery.  And the police 
                        don’t care.  The World will cover it 
                        for a few days, milk the headlines, 
                        and then this horrible crime will be 
                        forgotten.  But.  What if we shed 
                        light?  Asked the right questions --

                                 CARVALHO
                        What questions?

                        What crime warranted that?  Who is 
                        worthy of such a death?  Who --  

                                 CARVALHO
                        Who thinks they can get away with it?

                        been done before.  Let this be how 
                        we do it.  With real life on our 
                        pages.  They’ll buy the Journal 
                        because.  It’s.  Theirs.  “Murders 
                        happen everyday” - how much longer 
                        will people permit the apathy of 
                        their guardians and leaders?  No, 
                        if any more go unsolved they will 
                        tear this island apart.  But if 
                        they see that someone - we - are 
                        willing to pick up the pieces of 
                        this bloody puzzle, it will be the

           In droves, they grab copies of the new Evening Journal as a 
           Newsboy prepares to shout and we go

           INT./EXT. LIBERTY YACHT - EARLY MORNING

           A $1.5 Million vessel at 300 feet.  Pulitzer eases into a 
           SILENT ROOM: like Chatwold’s Tower, it filters exterior 
           noise.  Jabez hands Pulitzer the Evening Journal 

           JOURNAL HEADLINE: $1000 REWARD 
           (And here is where we HEAR THE NEWSBOY shout the “extra!”)

           The gauntlet thrown.  He reads, a thousand emotions swirling.

                                 PULITZER
                        ...well done.  Little shit.  

           AND SO IT BEGINS...

           The machines are going, loud.  An impressive sight.  Will and 
           Carvalho walk through, shouting over the noise.

                                 CARVALHO
                        You got Pulitzer’s attention, he’ll 
                        be looking to control the story now!

                        Well...why should anyone care, they 
                        don’t even know who the stiff is!

                                 WILL

           INT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL MORGUE - MORNING

           A CROWD strains to see if the body might belong to missing 
           kin.  Ned Brown pushes through; everyone watches an OLD WOMAN 
           inspect the body and faint at the sight of the penis!

           A BIGGER CROWD has gathered to watch people try for an ID.  

           Among the gathered, Tessie watches, a copy of the Journal in 
           hand.  She smiles, proud of what Will has inspired.
           IN BACK 

           Arnold pursues a different angle:

           Interviewing Detective Carey as he plays with a piece of the 
           red-and-yellow oil cloth (crime-scene evidence)...

                                 CAREY
                        I was under Detective Thomas Byrnes 
                        when the charges came down.  Pushed 
                        me out of the department...no 
                        fuckin’ loyalty.
                             (Arnold nods, sympathetic)
                        Please don’t print this but...I was 
                        excited to see a corpse again...the 
                        old wheels started turning - this 
                        cloth he was wrapped in, it’s the 
                        key, you know. I was out but murder 
                        followed me here.  And you brought 
                        me back.  You and Mr. Hearst...

           Mutual understanding as they look at the cloth in his hands.

           MAIN ROOM - LATER

           Curiosity having gotten the better of him, Brisbane enters, 
           moleskin in hand.  He takes notes on the crowd’s interest.  

           Through the floor-show, he notices the nail on the body’s 
           right index finger is missing. 

           INSERT CUT:  FLASHBACK - A HAND SENSUALLY RUBBING BRISBANE’S 
           SHOULDER; THE SAME FINGER MISSING A NAIL.

                             (to himself)
                        I know that hand...

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE, JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           There’s a hustle-n-bustle.  A BARBER gives Will a shave, 
           Arnold pitches a story, Carvalho and Goddard read 
           submissions.  As Will flails about, Barber strains not to cut 
           his face: stop moving!  

                                 WILL
                        So who is this Detective...Carey?

                                 ARNOLD
                        He works Harlem.  Two years ago, 
                        Commissioner Roosevelt tries 
                        “purging” the department of all 
                        corruption.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARNOLD (CONT'D)
                        Carey got thrown out with the bath 
                        water - he’s been out “tending the 
                        goats” since.  Hell,  PD forgot 
                        about him ‘till he came in with the 
                        second piece of body.    

                                 WILL
                        So “disgruntled ex-bull,” that’s 
                        your angle?

                                 ARNOLD
                        No see you’re the man pulled him out 
                        of the Stix... and he knows it.  A 
                        loyal detective could be valuable.  

           He hands Will the oilcloth Carey was playing with - evidence.  

                                 WILL
                        Very.

           Onto the next piece of business: 

           The Journal’s young Artist enters, Carvalho recognizes him:

                                 CARVALHO
                        Outcault, you work here, too?

                                 WILL
                        Of course, Outcault is the best 
                        artist in town, I bought him from 
                        Pulitzer two weeks before you...

           Will looks at Outcault’s famous Yellow Kid cartoon; caption: 
           “SAY! HOGAN’S ALLEY HAS BEN CONDEMNED BY DE BOARD OF HELT.” 

                                 WILL
                        Imagine when Pulitzer sees the old 
                        snaggletoothed Yellow Kid in our 
                        pages.  Ha!  Good work, Outcault!  

                                 GODDARD
                        But Pulitzer owns the rights to the 
                        Hogan’s Alley title, doesn’t he?

                                 WILL
                        The title - but not the image...
                             (and he realizes:)
                        And it’s the image that captures 
                        attention!  Arnold, Carey thinks 
                        the oilcloth’s the key: track it, 
                        supplier to the buyer.  Take the 
                        beat ten men we’ve got with you.

                                 CARVALHO
                        We can’t lose ten men to one story.
           Will starts sketching madly: his own comic.  The others 
           strain to see as the sketch comes to life: a squad of heroes.

                                 WILL
                        Not lost, just... reallocated.  It’s 
                        a race with the World to uncover the 
                        identity of this victim.  We need 
                        every advantage we can get.  One 
                        reporter collects piecemeal, but the 
                        image of a group is odd, attracts 
                        attention - and will bring the 
                        stories to us... I see a cabal 
                        spiriting around New York.  Give ‘em 
                        badges, hell give ‘em guns!

                                 GODDARD
                        I don’t think we can issue badges.

                                 WILL
                        Sure we can.  The blue boys didn’t 
                        want it - let ‘em sit this one out.

                                 CARVALHO
                        So what’ll they say, your badges?

                                 WILL
                        Journal...Journal Murder squad.

                        Blazing in the night together...

           And Arnold’s off running.  Carvalho leans to Goddard --

                                  CARVALHO
                        What new contraptions?

           BICYCLE WHEELS as we see --

           SERIES OF SHOTS: ARNOLD AND THE MURDER SQUAD race through NY 
           on bronze bicycles, weaving through crowds.  We think we’ve 
           seen it all, then Will comes riding out in front, a crusader!

           Riding through the Theatre District, Will goes right passed 
           Tessie.  They lock eyes.  He smiles at her, rides on --

           Using the Red-and-Yellow Oilcloth sample, they hit up 
           manufacturer A.F. Buchanan & Sons.  Then every one of its 
           retailers.  Interviewing (and intimidating) salesmen, reading 
           ledger books, eventually coming to Riger’s Dry Goods Store.

           D.B-3220 matches the cloth.  Arnold checks the purchaser...

           Marble floors, steamy.  Brisbane approaches the counter.  
           FRANK GARTNER, 40s, rail thin, operates.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Morning, I’d like to have a massage 
                        today.

                                 GARTNER
                        I’ll see what’s available.  Say, 
                        you’ve been in here before, no?

                                 BRISBANE
                        Yes, well, in my line of work, a 
                        man often needs some relaxation.

                                 GARTNER
                        What kind of work is that?

                                 BRISBANE
                        ...Oh, a little reporting...
                             (as if just remembering)
                        You know last time I was here, I 
                        had a rubber I was very happy with.  
                        He was tall, quite strapping...
                             (taking a shot)
                        He had something on his chest --

                                 GARTNER
                        Oh that sounds like Villy.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Villy...

                                 GARTNER
                        Well “Willy,” but he’s a Bavarian.   
                        Tattoo on his chest of a woman and 
                        a dick the size of my arm.  Willy 
                        Guldensuppe.  But now that I think 
                        about it, he hasn’t been in the 
                        last few days...

           Bingo.  Brisbane pulls out his moleskin nonchalantly...

                                 BRISBANE
                        Hm. If I wanted to maybe find him?

                                 GARTNER
                        He ain’t in trouble is he?

                                 BRISBANE
                        What could I do about it, right?
                        But no I was thinking about a human 
                        interest story: kind of men come 
                        into a place like this.  I wanted 
                        to get it from the horse’s mouth.
           Brisbane slides Gartner a buck; he looks through a directory.

                        He never moved in there, no he’s,

           Brisbane stares up at the low-rent tenement.  Laundry hangs 
           from fire escapes, heat sizzles off the brick.  Nearby, a 
           local soap salesman makes the rounds: “Soap, only a nickle!”

           INT. HALLWAY, APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Brisbane walks to a door.  A plaque reads: “AUGUSTA NACK - 
           LICENSED MIDWIFE.”  He writes it down.  About to knock, 
           checks his pockets - empty.  Thinks...

           INT. AUGUSTA NACK’S APARTMENT - A KNOCK

           AUGUSTA NACK, 40, German and hair askew, opens the door - 
           Brisbane is there holding a suitcase.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Afternoon ma’am.  Selling soap 
                        today at 5 cents; only a nickle.

                        Oh but ma’am, try the first bar, 
                        get the second only a penny.  At 
                        third free you’re making a steal.  
                        Why not try for yourself!

           Finally she let’s him in.  He has trouble with the latches as 
           he opens the case; pulls out a bar. Augusta takes it, heads 
           for a bathroom O.S.  Brisbane notices a few PACKED SUITCASES.

           The faucet shuts off.  He needs more time --

                                 AUGUSTA (O.S.)

           Faucet comes back on.  He continues his search, then sees --

           A PHOTOGRAPH: AUGUSTA and “VILLY” GULDENSUPPE at the beach.  
           His shirt off, a tattoo on his chest.  Brisbane swipes the 
           photo, sticks it in the briefcase just as she returns.

                        Found it!  The Oilcloth came from a

                        we found the record of a buyer -

           Arnold is stunned, Will hands him an EVENING WORLD.  An

           Will looks at the bashed press...and his BLACK fingers.

                                 WILL
                        So let’s print it right.

           Carefully pencils eye shadow as Will SLAMS a copy of the

                        Ah!  Will how did you -- you can’t 
                        just come barging --

           He holds it up, headline is a glorious red: VICTIM IDENTIFIED

                        First in history for a breaking 
                        story.  I wanted to show you.

                        It’s beautiful.  So you found him!  
                        Oh Will, I’m...I’m really happy you 
                        took on this story.  They’ve all

           to the center.  Patrons pat him on the back.  Accept him. 

           After, Tessie’s theatre friends clamor to sit with Will.

                        Yeah, my father owned a ranch - 
                        Babicora. 900,000 acres; beautiful, 
                        open, the way the explorers would 
                        have seen it...

                        Well cheers!  To the man who found 
                        Willy Guldensuppe.  I’m sure you 
                        gave his family closure, even if 
                        they never find the killer.

                        question of “why.”  Why’d he do it?

                        chopped up.  What do you think?

           BEAT.  Then laughter.  Tessie loves the way he interacts with

           Will leads Tessie into the room.  BEAT.  He steps away.  She

           She kisses him, he holds her close...  

           LATER

           Tessie lays in bed, rolls over to see Will sitting on the 
           edge, flipping the page proofs with his toes.  She laughs.  
           She comes around, sits between his legs, shows him how-to 
           with a real dancer’s graze.  They turn the pages together.

           As Will leaves, he sees a thin man in TUXEDO standing out 
           front holding a silver tray with a glass of Brandy on top. 

                                 WILL
                        Waiting for someone?

                        Lap number six, here I come!

           Bennett Jr., seen earlier at the pier party, rides up in a 
           three-piece suit on a boneshaker (bicycle with big wheel in 
           front, little wheel in back).  He grabs the glass of Brandy.  

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        Evening, W.R.

                        James Bennett, Jr. - actually it’s 
                        4:30 in the morning.  What are you 
                        doing out here?

                                 BENNETT JR.
                             (downs the Brandy)
                        Exercise!  Come ride with me!

           He wheels out another boneshaker as Will heads off to work --

                                 WILL
                        Another time. 

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        You frightened?  
                             (then)
                        You know printing the ID was a 
                        mistake...  

           Will stops - Bennett knows he’s got him.  

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        Jameson, lucky number seven coming 
                        up - make it a double this time.

           Will and Bennett racing around the block at 4:30 a.m.

                                 BENNETT JR. 
                        I saw your boys on these, I just 
                        had to have one! 

           They pass Valet, Bennett grabs the Brandy without stopping, 
           takes a sip, throws the glass into the street: clash!
                                 BENNETT JR. 
                        So it’s just you and Pulitzer now, 
                        eh?  Forget us other poor saps...

           Bennett nearly knocks over a drunk-passerby, doesn’t slow. 

                                 WILL
                        Your father’s Herald invented the 
                        modern paper, James.

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        But how quickly the story changes - 
                        he had his devoted following ‘till 
                        Jewseph Pulitzer came along... with 
                        a Nose to overshadow him, haha!  

                                 WILL
                        Here’s your chance to restore it.

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        No, the paper was my father’s game.  
                        Dividends keep me fed... But you, 
                        you beat Pulitzer and you win the 
                        people’s trust.  
                             (prodding)
                        Or’s it a bit the other way ‘round? 
                        You wanna beat him don’t (you?) --

           Will stops.  Bennett realizes and turns around.  

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        You haven’t thought it all the way 
                        through.  

                                 WILL
                        What was wrong with the I.D.?

                                 BENNETT JR. 
                        There was this murder in Chicago... 
                        A sausage maker named - well who 
                        can remember - he stuffed his wife 
                        into one of his vats, boiled her to 
                        death.  That was the story, except 
                        they couldn’t ID the body...
                             (Will doesn’t get it)
                        You printed the ID, but Nack claims 
                        Villy is still alive; you can be 
                        proven wrong.  If you’re wrong, 
                        you’re no longer trusted.  And 
                        that’s what he wants.  He has to 
                        put you down now.  As long as the 
                        head is missing, Pulitzer can win.  
                        Because there is doubt.  

                                 WILL
                        Why are you helping me...I thought 
                        you didn’t care about newspapers. 
           Bennett urinates into the street, his back to Will. 

                                 BENNETT JR.
                        I don’t.  Father wasted his life on 
                        deadlines and ink just to have it 
                        snatched away, not me...
                             (buttoning up his fly)
                        Still, what son doesn’t carry his 
                        father’s shame everywhere he goes? 
                             (beat, then walks on)
                        Remember W.R., Park Row is only 
                        ever the crown and the competition.

           Bennett disappears into the night as nearby a World cart 
           drops the morning paper.  Now we see it in full:

           Brisbane fell asleep reading the paper.  A hand gently shakes

                        Mrs. Pulitzer, evening.  What are 
                        you doing here?

                                 KATE
                        I thought I’d take Herbert to see 
                        where his father works.

           But she sets Herbert down on the desk, lets him crawl.  They 
           both watch him as they speak of other things.

                                 KATE
                        It’s good to see you.  Though you 
                        look terrible - I know you’ve been 
                        working hard, but are you alright?
                                 BRISBANE
                        I am.  Thank you for asking.  I am. 
                             (she’s not buying it)
                        I just knew him is all. Guldensuppe.  
                        Not well, not well at all actually 
                        but...I knew him and now he’s dead.  
                        And I feel a little strange.

                                 KATE
                        No, you’re angry.  And you’re 
                        allowed to be, it was a gruesome 
                        thing done to this man.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Yes but gruesome things come across 
                        my desk every day.  I never felt 
                        anything for them.  And, as editor 
                        for the largest paper in the world, 
                        never did anything for them 
                        either... I’d like to find out what 
                        happened to this man.  I’m going to.

           She watches him, admiring the display of conscience. 

                                 KATE
                        I’ve missed you.  I think about --

                                 BRISBANE
                        Mrs. Pulitzer --

                                 KATE
                        Why are you calling me that?

                                 BRISBANE
                        Because it’s your name.

                                 KATE
                        You used to call me --

                                 BRISBANE
                        And that was a mistake.  I betrayed 
                        him.

           BEAT.  Neither one has spoken of this in some time.

                                 KATE
                        No, you were good to me.  While he 
                        was in France or wherever he goes, 
                        you were good to me... Anyway you 
                        repaid your debt many times over 
                        I’m sure, doing all his bid(ding) --

                                 BRISBANE
                        I love working for him.  And I owe 
                        him a lot.  

           A KNOCK at the door.  Seitz enters, surprised to see Kate --

           EXT. PULITZER’S JEKYLL ISLAND ESTATE - DAY

           A lavish debutante party for Pulitzer’s 17 year-old, LUCILLE.  
           Delicate, she plays hostess to 100 guests; a table of caged 
           canaries for party favors.   At a table, Brisbane finds 
           Pulitzer’s brother ALBERT, about 300 pounds, shoving a piece 
           of cake into his mouth. 

                                 BRISBANE
                        Well if it isn’t Albert Pulitzer, 
                        good to see you.

                                 ALBERT
                        You mean “surprised”.  I assume my 
                        sister-in-law made the guest list.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Why don’t you go say hello to him?

                                 ALBERT
                        Why break a longstanding tradition?  
                        He knows where to find me.  

           Pulitzer stands on the periphery - in sunglasses - awkwardly 
           positioned to see out his good eye.  Brisbane joins him.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Glad to see you stateside again.  
                        How long will we have the pleasure?

           A peacock SQUAWKS, setting off pain all over Pulitzer’s body - 
           he has his answer.  He notices Pulitzer’s awkward stance.

                                 BRISBANE
                        How are your eyes?
                             (no response, he sighs)
                        She’s beautiful.  As is the affair.  

                                 PULITZER
                        $10,000 for a Goddamn party. 

           They both watch Kate, beautiful today, a real socialite.

                                 BRISBANE
                        You could have told her “no.”  

           But he didn’t.  They walk the garden’s edge, avoiding guests.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Well it’ll attract the right kind 
                        of husband. 

                                 PULITZER
                        My name takes care of that.  But 
                        what don’t they know: she’s fluent 
                        in five languages, she’s an artist, 
                        a musician...she didn’t want this --
                                 BRISBANE
                        She’s having a lovely time. 

                                 PULITZER
                        Look at ‘em all.  Just wait until 
                        you get your paper.  They line up 
                        to bark favors, their opinions --

                                 BRISBANE
                        I have to get my paper first.

                                 PULITZER
                        You have to bring up my Evening 
                        numbers first.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Is the Evening important again?  

                                 PULITZER
                        You have something to say to me?

                                 BRISBANE
                        It was a mistake to wait on the ID.  
                        We don’t have the luxury to wait a 
                        day on a story, let alone ‘till the 
                        end of a week.  It moves too quick.  

           Pulitzer stops.  He watches all the people, suddenly uneasy.

                                 PULITZER
                        This Hearst moves quick, pilfering 
                        my staff, our leads, but also with 
                        his stories.  If his suspect is 
                        wrong the Journal loses all clout -- 
                        do we know all these people?  

                                 BRISBANE
                             (thrown, looks around)
                        I assume; Kate made the guest list.

           Pulitzer’s head cocks from side to side, trying to pick up 
           bits of dialogue, slightly paranoid.  Brisbane continues --

                                 BRISBANE
                        ...the detective on the case is as 
                        much a Journal man now as Carvalho 
                        or Goddard.  He brings the evidence 
                        to them before Mulberry St. 

                                 PULITZER
                        So he has Manhattan, but the murder 
                        happened in Queens, no?  
                             (beat)
                        He wants to clear the Nack woman.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        She may not be involved --
                                 PULITZER
                        She’s involved.  Just have to prove 
                        it.  I need some fucking quiet.  
                        Tell Kate, I want a copy of the 
                        guest list and a list of everyone 
                        who was actually here - who knows 
                        what other tactics he’s used.  Then 
                        get to Queens and find me a story.

           He heads back to the house as violinists play, passing Kate.

                                 KATE
                        Joseph, how about a waltz?  Like we 
                        used to.  

                                 PULITZER
                        It all...it looks wonderful, Kate.

           He goes inside.  Kate catches Brisbane’s eyes, he looks away.

           In the hallway, he notices something others missed.  A small 
           hole - a bullet hole?  Nearby, A BLOOD SPOT on a floorboard.  

           Brown eyes the distance from the hole to the blood spot.  
           Looks around...

               EVENING WORLD HEADLINE: BLOOD IN THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY!                                      
                                      Science Proves Alternate Theory

                                 CARVALHO
                        W.R. it’s just another theory --

                                 WILL
                        We said it could not have been Nack 
                        - a little frail woman against a 
                        man his size.  A bullet hole means 
                        a gun and a gun takes size out of 
                        the equation!  Looks like we don’t 
                        know what we’re talking about!  

           His angry mood so different from the audience laughter O.S.

                                 GODDARD
                        I thought Carey told us --

                                 CARVALHO
                        Carey works Manhattan. Pulitzer may 
                        have gotten to the Queens force --

                                 WILL
                        Pulitzer is in Europe or shut in on 
                        his boat.  And he’s still ahead.  
                        What do I have to do?  Hm?  

                                 GODDARD
                             (very sarcastic)
                        Steal evidence, apparently. 

           Audience laughs, applauds O.S.  Will peeks in on the crowd 
           reacting to the play.  And it dawns on him.  A true epiphany:

                                 WILL
                        No. We just have to entertain them.  
                        It's not enough to be their 
                        advocate.  We have to excite them 
                        with drama.  Engage them.  With 
                        engaging stories.

                                 GODDARD
                        ...you want to change the stories?

                                 WILL
                        No no, the facts are the facts.  
                        But we can tailor them. 

           Goddard looks at him, slightly concerned.  Carvalho notices.
                                 WILL
                        Look Morrill, no one has done more 
                        than the Journal to bring justice 
                        to this case.  When the police gave 
                        up we stepped in, we may even solve 
                        this thing.  But it’s symbiotic, 
                        they have to keep us around long 
                        enough to help.  And it’s our job 
                        to give them a reason why they 
                        should.  Sugar with the medicine.   

                                 CARVALHO
                        So where do you want to take it?

                                 WILL
                        Pulitzer has them asking about 
                        Thorn - fine.  Carey had a source, 
                        the barber that helped set the 
                        sting.  But not just any barber, a 
                        friend of Thorn’s - the friend who 
                        “betrayed” him.

                                 GODDARD
                        ...And how exactly do we bring him 
                        back in?

                                 WILL
                             (heading back in)
                        The Journal promised a reward.  And 
                        it has yet to be claimed...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GRAND JURY SESSION - DAY

           Gotha gives a deposition.  Everyone listens, rapt...

                                 GOTHA
                        He told me that he...he shot and 
                        stabbed him, then cut him up in a 
                        bathtub, out in Woodside, Queens...

           EXT. JOURNAL OFFICE, TRIBUNE BUILDING - DAY

           And John Gotha receives a $1000 check from Carvalho.  They 
           pose for a photo.  CHEERS from the gathered throng...  

           INT. HOUSE OF HORRORS, EDEN MUSÉE DIME WAX MUSEUM - DAY

           A crowd gleefully observes the latest edition: 

           A DETAILED WAX REPLICA of the murder: Thorn holds a saw to 
           “Villy”, bits of red drip into a white bathtub.  So real!
           INT. JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           Carvalho reviews Arnold’s article.  A sub-heading reads:

           “Journal Takes Part in Arrest”

           Carvalho crosses out “Takes Part in.”  He writes something 
           else, then hands the page to Outcault the artist...

           EXT. MIKE LYON’S ALL DAY/ALL NIGHT RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Will and Tessie exit, seized upon by a horde clutching 
           Journal copies.  Under the headline: 

           “Journal Leads Arrest.”  And an illustration of Will heading 
           Thorn’s arrest party.  Tessie beams with pride.

           Policeman steps forward, shakes Will’s hand for keeping the 
           streets safe.  While they’re all looking at the illustration:

           BULB FLASH! A young PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture.  Will’s 
           enamored - by the camera...

                        it’s going to be dead, too!

           EXT. EAST RIVER - DAY

           Four GIANT MOTORIZED BOATS dredge the water with a series of 
           hook-lines.  Passersby stop to watch from above...

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE, JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           Will colors more of his New York Map: the city of Queens and 
           East Manhattan.  Half of Greater New York is now blue...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SILENT ROOM, LIBERTY YACHT - NIGHT

           Pulitzer grips the telegraph message Butes just handed him. 

                                 PULITZER
                        Goddamnit!  God DAMN him!  Fucking 
                        John Gotha just happens to testify 
                        the moment we come out against 
                        Nack?  Unscrupulous cocksucker!   
                        They lose faith in a case against 
                        Nack...we’ll restore it.  Who is 
                        this fucking boy, hm?  Who is he to 
                        come at me with nothing...
           Butes takes the momentary silence as a signal to leave.

                                 PULITZER
                        I took on Bennett, Dana, Godkin, 
                        Shurz... and this child tries to 
                        bait me with innuendo and Goddamn 
                        fabrication?!  Appealing to the 
                        most base levels of bullshit.  We 
                        must smash this fucking interloper!

           He SMASHES furniture, enraged and exerted when suddenly -- 

           He grabs his eye.  Slumps, breathing heavily, wheezing.  He 
           scoots onto the bed, clutching his eye.  HOLD.  A while.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE DOOR OPENS - Jabez wheels a breakfast cart in.  

                                 JABEZ
                        Breakfast, sir.  Mr. Pulitzer?

           He opens the curtains, DAYLIGHT streams onto Pulitzer’s face.  

           No reaction.  He is blind.  They both know it.

           Both frozen in terror.  Pulitzer feels around to the cart.  
           He smells the coffee, feels for a roll - BREAKS it apart, 
           HEARS flakes HIT the plate.  All other senses coming into 
           play.  He finds his way to a chair, sits, exhausted.  

                                 PULITZER
                             (an attempt at humor)
                        So quiet, Jabez, anything wrong?
                             (then)
                        If my men think me incapacitated, 
                        they’ll put me out to pasture.  

           His hand finds a rolled newspaper on the cart - Jabez gulps.   

                                 PULITZER
                        My subordinates are letting this 
                        boy creep in like...darkness  
                             (he tries to laugh)
                        No more gallivanting, Jabez.  I 
                        have work to do...

           INT. OFFICES OF NEW YORK WORLD - DAY

           Brisbane finds Seitz at his desk, munching away on a snack.

                                 BRISBANE
                        He’s coming in.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - EVENING

           Liberty sails to the docks.  In the distance, the World Tower 
           Dome catches setting sun’s light - a beacon calling him home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHATWOLD MANSION - DAY

           Jabez leads Brisbane, Seitz, Butes and business manager JOHN 
           NORRIS through the magnificent house to the Tower of Silence.  
           They pass Kate.  Brisbane nods cordially and moves on.  Jabez 
           opens a door for all of them, then stops Brisbane to speak...

           INT. TOWER OF SILENCE, CHATWOLD - DAY

           Brisbane enters.  Darker than usual, Pulitzer’s at his desk 
           one with the gloom like a Fuseli painting.  As they pace, 
           gesture wildly, Pulitzer stays seated, a rock.  In this way, 
           it is more difficult to notice his handicaps.  

                                 NORRIS
                        Mr. Pulitzer, The World’s weekday 
                        readership now sits squarely at 
                        435,000.  The Journal’s is 400.
                             (beat, lets it sink in)
                        And if he continues at this rate, 
                        Hearst will surpass the World in a 
                        matter of weeks.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        How is that possible? Joseph didn’t 
                        even rise that fast.  

                                 NORRIS
                        No one has ever risen this fast.  
                        Not on Park Row, not anywhere.   

                                 SEITZ
                        It’s the way he’s been reporting.  
                        Facts of the case aren’t nearly as 
                        important as the way in which he 
                        reveals them.  It’s not just about 
                        frights, it’s a whole narrative --

                                 BUTES
                        We can compete.  Challenge him 
                        directly.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        A battle in the gutter, we both 
                        wind up covered in shit.  

                                 BUTES
                        Then what do you suggest?
                                 NORRIS
                        A price cut.  Fifty percent.  We 
                        bring it down to a penny.

                                 BRISBANE
                        The Morning?

                                 NORRIS
                        And Evening --

           Pulitzer’s hand SLAMS against the table, making them jump - 
           and reminding them he’s still in the room.  

                                 PULITZER
                        Back to a fucking penny.  Took me 
                        years to get here...

                                 SEITZ
                        There’s little stigma anymore, even 
                        the Journal’s slogan is “You can’t 
                        pay less than a cent, you can’t --”

                                 PULITZER
                        I don’t care about the FUCKING 
                        JOURNAL’S SLOGAN!

                                 NORRIS
                        Yours is still the standard, sir.  
                        The name most trust.  Make the 
                        World a penny paper, I guarantee we 
                        sell a million copies overnight.  
                        The flood will attract a whole 
                        gaggle of advertisers and we’ll 
                        leave that rich prick in the dust.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Cut down to a penny, we operate at 
                        a loss.  Chief, do it for too long, 
                        even you could lose everything. 

           Hard to tell if Pulitzer is registering the fact.

                                 NORRIS
                        Once Hearst is gone we can re-raise 
                        costs.  But if you don’t get rid of 
                        the competition, it’ll be Hearst 
                        who’s setting prices.  And Hearst 
                        who sits on the throne.  

           WE SLOWLY PUSH IN on Pulitzer, deciding, as the debate heats 
           up around him.

                                 BRISBANE (O.S.)
                        We could reach out to his people, 
                        maybe even to Hearst directly...
                                 NORRIS (O.S.)
                        How would that look --

                                 SEITZ (O.S.)
                        Assuming he’d be receptive --

                                 BROWN (O.S.)
                        I could get word to George Arnold --

                                 BRISBANE (O.S.)
                        Reporter to reporter, approach it 
                        like a business arrangement --

                                 PULITZER
                        None of you are going.

           This is felt around the room, Brisbane shakes his head.  

                                 PULITZER
                        This is a matter to be settled 
                        proprietor to proprietor.  He’s 
                        copied me, engaged me - he’ll 
                        listen to me.  I’ll meet with Mr. 
                        Hearst myself.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DELMONICO’S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

           The creme-de-la-creme of 5th Avenue Steakhouses - and the 
           entire place is empty except in the back, a table’s candle 
           glows and a man eats alone: Pulitzer.  Will approaches...

                                 PULITZER
                        My staff just told me you were 
                        expelled from school for sending 
                        each of your professors chamber 
                        pots with their names engraved on 
                        the sides... it wouldn’t have done 
                        the trick to just send one? 

           Will sits.  Pulitzer eats a thick slab - rare - keeping his 
           eyes down to hide his blindness.  

                                 WILL
                        In for a penny, in for a pound... A 
                        young man, you ventured into the 
                        French’s Hotel lobby only to be 
                        thrown out.  Twenty years later you 
                        had it razed to the ground - the 
                        World tower now stands in its 
                        place...I’ve studied you for years.  

                                 PULITZER
                        Flattering.  Wish my sons showed 
                        that kind of passion for something. 
                                 WILL
                        I’m sure they do --

                                 PULITZER
                        Mm, spending.  A man shouldn’t have 
                        both success and sons.  One always 
                        means unhappiness with the other.  
                        Maybe you’ll find that out one day.  

           He washes his gullet with water as Will signals to a WAITER.  

                                 PULITZER
                        Don’t bother, I ordered one of 
                        these for you.  “Studied me for 
                        years”...you know all my secrets 
                        then.

                                 WILL
                        A few.  My...financial advisor... 
                        couldn’t understand why I bought a 
                        whole newspaper for its A.P. wire.

                                 PULITZER
                        It’s what I did in St. Louis.

                                 WILL
                        I know.  And you like editors 
                        better than reporters...

                                 PULITZER
                        Well they decide what goes in, what 
                        stays out.  But the real geniuses: 
                        the illustrators.  If they furnish 
                        you with pictures, you can 
                        furnish... well, anything.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll remember that.  

           A shared moment.  Pulitzer forgets himself, the hatred, looks 
           up, exposing his eyes.  Will’s sudden silence unnerves him.

                                 PULITZER
                        Do you know what kind of man sends 
                        chamber pots to professors?  One 
                        who stands to lose nothing.  But 
                        who fights and wins every time?  
                        Someone with nothing to lose.
                        You learn that watching the fights.  
                        The strong jawline of a battling 
                        boxer - you a fan of boxing, boy?  

           Pulitzer reaches for his glass, misses, barely noticeable.  

                                 WILL
                        Actually, no.  I abhor it.
                                 PULITZER
                             (laughs; condescending)
                        Excuse me, didn’t realize I was in 
                        the company of such fuckin’ 
                        “sophistication.”  
                             (cuts another piece)
                        It’s a man’s sport.  But if you did 
                        watch you’d know: it’s the one with 
                        no cut man in his corner puts his 
                        opponent down - he has nothing to 
                        go back to.  

                                 WILL
                        We’ve more in common than you think. 

                                 PULITZER
                        Now you’re flattering yourself.  

           Pulitzer puts down his knife and fork.  Sits back.  He stares 
           right at Will, yet milky eyes make for a lifeless gaze.

                                 PULITZER
                        You’ve had it in for me.

                                 WILL
                        Not at all, it’s just for every 
                        World read it’s a Journal not --

                                 PULITZER
                        No, this goes beyond profit margin, 
                        I think.  Beyond pride, even.  Why?  
                        I ever throw you out of my lobby?

                                 WILL
                        You’re mistaken.

                                 PULITZER
                        Am I?  Why did you buy the Journal?

           There’s something to his question, both know it.  A history.

                                 WILL
                        It was for sale.

                                 PULITZER
                        So were half a dozen other papers.

                                 WILL
                        I got a good price on this one. 

           BEAT, Pulitzer deciding something. Then he returns to eating:

                                 PULITZER
                        So your decisions are financially 
                        based sometimes.  Good.  I have an 
                        offer, I suggest you take it:  We 
                        split the market.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 PULITZER (CONT'D)
                        Journal continues at a penny, World 
                        dailies stay at two, we form a 
                        collaboration, and put 
                        this...competition...to bed.

           Waiter sets a plate in front of Will.  Lifeless prey. 

                                 WILL
                        You’ve destroyed every competitor, 
                        now you want to partner with one?

                                 PULITZER
                        There’s more of the penny crowd, my 
                        lot pays a higher price, we both 
                        come out on top, otherwise, well, 
                        World already blocked out the Sun. 

                                 WILL
                        You should have stayed abroad, 
                        Joseph, I might have stayed afraid.

                                 PULITZER
                        You are afraid.  Little boys who’s 
                        fathers give them the world...I had 
                        to build mine from the ground up.  
                        Makes me sick to look at imitators.

           Pulitzer doesn’t see his napkin fall to the ground: Will 
           notices.  He SCRAPES his knife against the plate - Pulitzer 
           tries to conceal his pained reaction - as Will takes pleasure 
           jabbing at Pulitzer’s side with every name:

                                 WILL
                        Carvalho said you’d try this.  
                        Goddard, too.  And Chamberlain.  
                        Outcault drew me a picture.  All 
                        left you for me and you know why?

                                 PULITZER
                        You pay more. 

                                 WILL
                        No.  I keep them well into the 
                        night, they’ve no time to spend 
                        what I pay.  But working for me 
                        reminds them why we do what we do.

                                 PULITZER
                        What do we do?  Lead stray cattle?  
                        We’re being herded.  You’re making 
                        it the trend.  Convincing them that 
                        journalism and capitulation to the 
                        masses’ appetite for melodrama are 
                        one and the same.  But when the 
                        story has no more turns to take 
                        what then?  Readers already 
                        conditioned for “breaking news” 
                        every fucking day --
                                 WILL
                        And you followed me.  So what does 
                        that say about you?

                                 PULITZER
                        I played the game. I’ve played 
                        many.  Whatever the new rules I’ve 
                        always made losers of my 
                        competition and managed to separate 
                        myself from...from everyone.  All 
                        for a black-and-white rag with a 
                        very lofty title. 
                             (beat, self-aware)
                        Is that really what you want?  

                                 WILL
                        I have other intentions --

                                 PULITZER
                        We always do. But that’s all you 
                        get.  It’s even less when this bile 
                        you call effort is the foundation 
                        on which you’ll build everything.  

                                 WILL
                        I’ll build everything atop your 
                        tower’s rubble.  After I raze it to 
                        the ground.  

                                 PULITZER
                        I’ve spent half a century doing 
                        this, boy.  This story merely puts 
                        a cap on it.

                                 WILL
                        No.  This murder defines a new 
                        century - one to which you don’t 
                        belong.   And you know what they’ll 
                        say?  It wasn’t because of who was 
                        killed or because of who killed him 
                        - but because of how the killing 
                        was covered.  I reject your terms.  

           Will picks up Pulitzer’s napkin, lays it on his lap.  He puts 
           the frail man’s hand to his jawline so he can know his face.  

                                 WILL
                        I may not like boxing, but you see, 
                        Mr. Pulitzer, I am a fighter.  

           Pulitzer’s hand comes to life, forces Will’s to his own jaw --

                                 PULITZER
                        You see, Mr. Hearst, so am I.

           Will walks out, Pulitzer wipes his hands with the napkin as 
           score takes us into
           A SEQUENCE OF SCENES: EVERYONE STEPS UP THEIR EFFORTS --

           EXT. ELEVENTH STREET PIER - DAY

           Police escort a cuffed Augusta Nack and Martin Thorn onto a 
           ferry headed for Queens.  They say nothing to each other.  
           LARGE CROWDS have gathered to witness the spectacle...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Nack or Thorn?  The question on 
                        everyone’s lips.  They’ve been 
                        ferried out to Queens county...

                                 CARVALHO (V.O.)
                        We’re not keeping them in New York?

           INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

           A formal committee meeting.  A large map presents the greater 
           New York area and the proposed joining of the five boroughs.  

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        “New York” hasn’t consolidated yet - 
                        Queens is where it happened so 
                        Queens is where they’ll be tried.  
                        And where Thorn will be convicted.

           A meager few spectators observe the meeting, one of them is 
           Morrill Goddard.  The sparsity is contrasted by --

           INT. EDEN MUSÉE DIME WAX MUSEUM - A PACKED HOUSE

           Observe the changed display: now Thorn and Nack are depicted 
           hacking Guldensuppe up in the bathtub.  Spectators marvel.  

                                 CARVALHO (V.O.)
                        What about the bullet hole, Nack --

           A promotion ceremony, Carey is one of a few named “Detective 
           Sgt.”  Arnold is among friends and family, applauds.  

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Forget the bullet hole, bury it.  
                        Our villain is Thorn - Carey 
                        assures me the evidence is mounted 
                        against him.  Even if it wasn’t...
           INT. PRISON CELL, THE TOMBS - DAY

           Augusta reads a love letter, smells it and smiles (it’s been 
           sprayed with perfume).  There’s a stack waiting to be read.

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        ...Nack’s getting love letters and 
                        marriage proposals - they love her.  
                        No, Nack will go free, and Thorn 
                        will get the chair.  Let Pulitzer 
                        try to sway opinion against her.

           EXT. WORLD BUILDING, PARK ROW - EVENING

           Next to the building, a crowd has gathered around a LIGHT --

           THWONG!  It snaps on and after a moment to generate, it casts 
           a 200,000 candlepower light into the sky, projecting: THE 
           WORLD, ONE CENT, CIRCULATION NEARLY ONE-HALF MILLION PER DAY!

           INT. UNION CLUB OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK - DAY

           Clark reads a World editorial to his mutton-chop cronies:

                                 CLARK
                        “The reason for this price 
                        reduction is a secret that we are 
                        ready to share with the people: we 
                        prefer power to profit.”   - how 
                        humorous of him - “The enormous 
                        sales of the Evening and Sunday 
                        editions so far surpassing all 
                        other journals permit a sacrifice 
                        in revenue.”  What a load of shit.   

           INT. JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           Carvalho takes a meeting with men in suits, handshakes as 
           Goddard looks on from his corner...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Pulitzer needs advertisers’ dollars

           INT. TOWER OF SILENCE, CHATWOLD

           Pulitzer hands Brisbane a homemade, leather-bound 300-pg 
           book, inside a ledger with two columns of words:

                                 PULITZER
                        From now on we communicate by

                        offices, the boy could pay 
                        operators for our content.  So I 
                        invented my own code...

           QUICKS SHOTS: Pulitzer dictates to a handful of secretaries; 
           secretaries transcribe long-winded instructions into code, 
           code is transported to Telegram offices and World staff under 
           Brisbane’s direction struggle to understand them.

           INT. BAR, TENDERLOIN DISTRICT - NIGHT

           On Brisbane, PAN OVER to the MAN sitting across being HIRED.  
           PAN BACK: Carvalho has replaced Brisbane with a better offer.  

           He reluctantly hands over a check signed by “W.R. Hearst.”  

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        Finally, we hit him where it hurts.  
                        Any talent plans on joining the 
                        World, we offer him double the 
                        salary, on the spot!

           INT. UNION CLUB OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK - DAY

           The blue bloods read copies of the Journal and World, 
           colorful, packed pages with pictures and bold print. 

           James Gordon Bennett Jr. holds up a copy, its Yellow Kid 
           cartoon prominently displayed on the front --

                        Absolutely.  Pure sensationalism,

           INT. VAUDEVILLE THEATRE - NIGHT

           Tessie performs, Will in his balcony seat.  But when not 
           reading a Journal, he watches the audience, not the stage...

                                 WILL (V.O.)
                        The Guldensuppe murder is the most 
                        important matter facing every 
                        constituent of this city.  It 
                        concerns the security, the unity 
                        and prosperity of each denizen. We

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE, JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           Will stands over his key men, doling out instruction:

                                 WILL
                        Because someone will take the fall 
                        for this murder.  And when justice 
                        is served, one paper will be New 
                        York’s victorious tribune, while 
                        the other is renamed the obsolete 
                        sheet that victimized an innocent.  
                        And that sheet will lose the trust 
                        of the people forever.  No mercy 
                        gentlemen, it is the only thing we 
                        share with our competitor.  This is 
                        a fight for our survival!

           END SEQUENCE.
           INT. WILL’S OFFICE, JOURNAL OFFICES - LATER

           As Will escorts everyone out, shuts the door.  He turns to 
           see Carvalho still standing there.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        No holds barred, eh?
                             (off his silence)
                        Well there’s a problem, we’ve no 
                        money left.  The presses, the 
                        advertising, Nack’s building, the 
                        launches you’ve insisted on keeping 
                        out everyday --

                                 WILL
                        I want the launches out there.  
                        It’s important we keep looking for 
                        Guldensuppe’s head.   

                                 CARVALHO
                        Important we keep looking or that 
                        they know we keep looking?
                             (beat, Will paces)
                        I work for you.  And I want this 
                        paper to succeed but this all-
                        out...assault you’ve outlined, we 
                        just can’t do it --

           Will SLAMS the table out of frustration.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        Can you go to your mother?

                                 WILL
                             (hates it)
                        I don’t go to my mother, I go to 
                        Clark.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        Why’d she make him the bookkeeper?

                                 WILL
                        ‘Cuz he’s also her cousin.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        Must be some family picnic.  

           He notices Will looking at something out the window, we don’t 
           see what it is.

                                 WILL
                        We need it?  I’ll do it.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. “SHERRY’S” RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Where Will and Tessie ate earlier.  Probably the same 
           patrons, too.  Will sits alone, nervous.  Clark joins him.

                                 WILL
                        ...I asked to see my mother.

                                 CLARK
                        She couldn’t come.

                                 WILL
                        Couldn’t or wouldn’t?
                             (beat, very humble:)
                        I need to ask you for more money.  

                                 CLARK
                        You just don’t learn, Will.  As a 
                        business man you need to --

                                 WILL
                        I’m not a business man, I’m a 
                        newsman and to report the news I 
                        need means to do so.  I need my...
                             (embarrassed)
                        mother to “authorize” more funds.

                                 CLARK
                        I wish you could appreciate how 
                        difficult it’s been for me to 
                        effectively convey to her how ill-
                        advised your expenditures are.  Ten 
                        thousand here, twenty thousand 
                        there - nothing’s too good for her 
                        boy.  But yet, the mere idea of 
                        your bringing shame to the family 
                        name...well that is intolerable... 

           Clark drops a TOWN TOPICS gossip column onto the table:
           “Willy-the-Worst” Spotted on the Town with Actress!  

                                 CLARK
                        All these tarts.  You can imagine 
                        her disappointment.  And now this 
                        “actress” you flaunt about town --  

                                 WILL
                        Flaunt...I love --

                                 CARVALHO
                        It means I am no longer authorized 
                        to finance your New York ventures.

           BEAT.  The ground has opened up; Clark is proud of himself.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll go under, we’ll be ruined.  
                                 CLARK
                        Then go back home to San Francisco.  
                        Or, if that is unsuitable, you can 
                        go to Babicora.   You always loved 
                        it there.  Suppose that’s why your 
                        father left it to you.  But 
                        this...episode is done.  

           Will glances at the patrons, they’re looking at him, 
           whispering.  He never blows, just looks back at Clark.  

                                 WILL
                        No, I’ll just sell it.

                                 CLARK
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        Babicora.  I’ll sell it.  And if 
                        she cares so much about the family 
                        name, then Phoebe Hearst has 24 
                        hours to buy it from me, for the 
                        bargain price of one million 
                        dollars.  Or I sell to an outsider.

                                 CLARK 
                             (as Will rises)
                        Wait, Will, it’s the only thing in 
                        your name!  You’ll have nothing.  

                                 WILL
                        I’ll have the Journal.  24 hours.  

           He gets up and leaves.

           Sitting out in the sun, waiting for someone.  The mansion 
           basks in light.  His brother Albert sits down into frame, 
           wheezing slightly from the effort and trying to hide it.  

                                 PULITZER
                        The man I asked to see was always a

                        P.T. Barnum escapee.   

                                 ALBERT
                        I was told you can’t see anything.
                                 PULITZER
                        I heard the chair’s wood 
                        splintering under your fat ass.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Well it’s half a decade since last 
                        we spoke and I’m greeted by insult.  
                        There was a time we could at least 
                        be civil.  Are you still so angry 
                        with me?
                             (Jabez approaches)
                        Some coffee, please.

                                 PULITZER
                        I should ask you that question.  

                                 ALBERT
                        Why.  Because you abandoned us?  
                        Because you never came home for any 
                        of their funerals? 
                             (pause)
                        I forgave you years ago.  So what 
                        do you want? 

                                 PULITZER
                        I want to ask you a question.  All 
                        New York is talking about my feud 
                        with this young man, Hearst --

                                 ALBERT
                        I don’t pay attention to those 
                        things --

                                 PULITZER
                        No you traipse around Paris shoving 
                        pastries into that hole in your 
                        face.  But Hearst came to New York 
                        with a wealth at his disposal - and 
                        a wealth of options on which to 
                        squander it.  So of all the papers 
                        on Park Row, with their 100 and 
                        200,000 in circulation, I’m left to 
                        wonder why young W.R. Hearst took 
                        on the Journal, a floundering rag 
                        at a mere 75,000 daily which, only 
                        a short time before that, was owned 
                        by my dear brother Albert.  

           BEAT.  

                                 ALBERT
                        I ran it, then sold it to McLean.

                                 PULITZER
                        Who turned around and sold it to 
                        Hearst in the time it takes a 
                        normal-sized man to shit breakfast.

                        I’ll bet he paid handsomely, too.

           Jabez brings the coffee.  Albert calmly pours himself a cup. 

                                 PULITZER
                        You’re a fat coward, Albert.  

                                 ALBERT

                                 PULITZER
                        Well he won’t break me.  But I tell 
                        you this, he’ll come far closer in 
                        the attempt than you ever did.

                        printing a better story.  The

           A famous bowery joint for criminals and cops alike.  Journal 
           men celebrate with shots; Arnold and Goddard at a bar 
           yellowed by tobacco spit, charred by the butts of a thousand 
           cheap cigars.  Arnold is in good spirits, Goddard is quieter.

                                 ARNOLD
                        ...so they wed inside the Statue of 
                        Liberty, thereby answering the 
                        riddle: “what man married a woman 
                        while inside another?”

           Goddard courtesy-laughs as he downs his beer, orders another.

                                 ARNOLD
                        So glum. Business is booming, we’re 
                        in a dead heat with King Croeseus, 
                        you’ve a problem with success?

                                 GODDARD
                        I’d just rather get drunk tonight.  
           Arnold notices a few cops flirting with prostitutes.  A 
           policeman’s hand disappear up a woman’s skirt.

                        I know what’s bothering you.  But 
                        it’s always been this way, these 
                        petty rivalries.  Before Pulitzer 
                        and the World it was Bennett and 
                        the Herald, before Bennett and the 
                        Herald it was Dana and the Sun.  
                        The titans we ask to hold up the 
                        world - it’s a revolving door.

                        Oh? They’re just “prophets raised

                        It’s different now.  Every headline 
                        now contains the paper’s name.  
                        When did that become the rule 
                        rather than the exception?

                                 ARNOLD
                        If they know who we are they know 
                        where to get their information.

                        They know who we are they know who 
                        to listen to.  Our own “brand” of 
                        news.  Of truth.  Soon these people 
                        won’t even have to think for

                        At least we’re still trying to 
                        discover the truth in this case - 
                        but will that always take precedent 
                        over the need to out-do our rival?  
                        What if our sales fall?

           Stretching along his path as far as he can see, children and

           you can buy a copy of the World or the Journal.  An industry 
           based on the Hunt.  Will lays his bike down, buys a lemonade - 
           and a Journal - and marvels at what he’s helped to create...

           EXT. COTTAGE, WOODSIDE, QUEENS - DAY

           Still surrounded by shoving on-lookers.  Unable to get in,  
           Will gets pushed to the periphery, down to the edge of the 
           pond seen earlier.

           Will turns - it’s the Farmer seen earlier when first shown 
           the Murder House.  He sprinkles bread crumbs to his ducks.

                        Digging up the earth day and night, 
                        can’t plant anything!  Keep looking 
                        for that damn head!

                        They’re just curious.  Aren’t you?

                        me nothing but misfortune.

                        My ducks.  They were crossing this 
                        field here to Mrs. DeBeuchelare’s 
                        dairy, you see, not all the way 
                        down to the next street where Mrs.

                        worried about their digestion --

                        Mr. Wahle, excuse me, can you tell 
                        me anything about your neighbor?

                        I know where you mean!   No one 
                        there named Thorn, though.  

                                 WILL
                        He introduced himself as Braun?

                                 FARMER
                        And his wife: Mrs. Braun.

           BEAT.  Will takes some bread, starts feeding with Farmer.

                        I knew my ducks, see, they’d been 
                        swimming around the drain there so 
                        I went over and right at the end of 
                        the pipe, there was water coming 
                        out.  But it was reddish...

           INSERT CUT: RED LIQUID drips from the pipe leading from the 
           house into the pond.  FARMER sees a duck climb out, red water

                        It was probably blood.  
                                 FARMER
                        Yeah but they said this all 
                        happened end of June.  My ducks

           EXT. PIG MARKET, HESTER STREET - DAY

           An outdoor bazaar where immigrants haggle over everything 
           from peaches to suspenders in six languages (everything but 
           Pig, hence the name).  Pulitzer walks through - sunglasses, 
           cane, and hat; Butes leads him by the arm.

                                 PULITZER
                        Smell that, Butes?  Smell of the 
                        mud.  My doctor tells me fresh air 
                        may sooth my stresses. I’m not sure 
                        how the retinae and olfactories 
                        connect but who the fuck am I to 
                        question a quack... See her, Butes?

                                 BUTES
                        Who’s that, Mr. Pulitzer?

           With his cane he directs Butes’ eyes in the general direction 
           of the Statue of Liberty, clearly visible in the harbor:

                        I didn’t know that, sir.

                        dimes, nothing more than a dollar: 
                        150,000 of them built themselves a 
                        symbol. They have that power, en

                        Those closest to me are scheming, 
                        Butes... You’ll assume control of 
                        special projects.
                             (then)

                        They say we’ve debased ourselves.  
                        We are “so low in moral tone as to 
                        make our toleration and success a 
                        reproach upon the community...”

           Unimpressed, Will starts scanning tomorrow’s Morning...

                                 CARVALHO
                        Covering this case has been fun but 
                        there are other issues; Spain’s 
                        crushing the Cuban rebels --

                                 CARVALHO
                        I’m talking about your reputation.  
                        Sensational headlines are fine 
                        grabbers but --

                                 WILL
                        “Sensationalism” is always the cry 
                        of the paper to the rival which 
                        passes it.  But while they condemn 
                        me, their readers will indulge.  
                                 CARVALHO
                        You got the readers.

                                 WILL
                        The “penny crowd”?  But they were a 
                        given, not like his “high-class” 
                        following.  You know what?  They’re 
                        no different.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        And you want them all. 

                                 WILL
                        I want them all.   

                                 CARVALHO
                        It could take years.  

                                 WILL
                        I don’t think so.  

           Will suddenly notices something in the broadsheet.  

                                 WILL
                        It’s not right.  
                             (off Carvalho’s look)
                        This page, it’s not right.
                        What time have you got?

           The whole building starts to RUMBLE, a rocket blasting off.  

                                 WILL
                        Never mind...

           Will sprints out the door - Carvalho follows through the 
           madness, down to the second floor where we find the source of 
           the earthquake:  GIGANTIC HOE PRESSES printing - obviously 
           the operation has expanded.  Will grabs the ‘bulldog’ - the 
           first copy fresh off the machine.  

                                 WILL
                        Stop ‘em.  Stop these presses now!!

           PRESS OPERATOR leans his head out.

                        But we won’t make the mail train!  
                        A delay will cost --

                                 WILL
                        You’ll never send this paper out 
                        with my name on it!  Kill it!

           A calamitous shut down.  Will shows Carvalho the ‘bulldog’:  

                                 WILL
                        A misspelling - third paragraph.
           Carvalho just looks at him - has he even heard a word?

                                 CARVALHO
                        Level off costs.  In a couple 
                        years, you’ll make back the money 
                        you invested.  But keep going like 
                        this - and if we’re wrong about 
                        this one story - you’re done for!

                                 WILL
                        We won’t be wrong.  

           BACK ON THE MAIN FLOOR

           Will and Carvalho find Arnold surrounded.  He is worried.

                                 WILL
                        What?

           INT. OFFICES OF THE NEW YORK WORLD - NIGHT

           Clock reads 1 a.m. as a group of police headed by Detective 
           Carey - and flanked by Arnold - storm onto the floor.  Some 
           World men try to protest but they walk right on up to Seitz.

                        Where’s the head?

                        We don’t!

           No one understands.  Carey walks the floor, “inspecting”...

           The baby GURGLES.  Brisbane lifts him from his crib, sits.  
           Kate wipes a tear away.  Brisbane takes her hand.  They sit

           SLOW MOTION (40 fps): a GATHERED THRONG goes ape as Nack, 
           dressed the part of star witness with veil and sun umbrella, 
           ascends the front steps with LAWYER.  Across the street, Will 
           watches, wide brimmed hat, hands on hips.  His silhouette 
           framed against the slow-moving scene is a dynamic image.  

           Scene resumes normal speed as Arnold whispers in Will’s ear:

                                 ARNOLD
                        Got a lead on Mrs. Braun...

           EXT. THE BOWERY - AFTERNOON

           Will walks through the neighborhood looking for an address. 
           Everywhere he looks, they read papers on stoops, in 
           windows... 

                                 ARNOLD (V.O.)
                        I put out the name Braun everywhere.  
                        Hospitals, morgues, banks, finally 
                        picked it up from a stevedore lives 
                        down the Bowery; he’s expecting you.

           A PRELAP KNOCK, then

                        So what do you want?

           INT. BOWERY APARTMENT - EVENING

           Small, in desperate need of a woman’s touch.  Tenant FERRAMON 
           is perpetually distracted.  Will has a hard time making sense 
           of the small space and moldy food sitting out...

                                 WILL
                        I’ve been looking for a couple goes 
                        by the name Braun, had a home in 
                        Woodside.  I’m told you might know 
                        them?

                                 FERRAMON
                        Woodside, I never been there.  You 
                        want somethin’?

           Ferramon starts to make another sandwich with old meat.  
           Spreading some kind of condiment with a knife...

                                 WILL
                        ...No, thank you. So you knew them?
                                 FERRAMON
                        Knew the wife, not personally but...

                             (shakes his head)
                        My girl, Ginny, we were 19, you 
                        know?  I wanted to get married. We 
                        didn’t have so much money and...she 
                        was in the family way, you know?  

                                 WILL
                        Your wife was with child?

                                 FERRAMON
                        We weren’t married.  She didn’t 
                        want to have it before, was afraid 
                        how it’d look.  I heard about this 
                        woman though, had a place in 
                        Queens.  She could take care of it.  
                        Take care of Ginny, then we could 
                        get married.   

           Ferramon hands Will the disgusting sandwich.  Stares at him.  
           Will wants him to keep going... takes a bite... and swallows.

                                 WILL
                        So what happened?

                                 FERRAMON
                        I wanted to go with her.  But I had 
                        to work so she went alone to have 
                        it done.  She never came back.

                                 WILL
                        Is it possible she...ran away --

           Unknowingly waving the knife --

                                 FERRAMON
                        Ran away!?

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry, I just --

                                 FERRAMON
                        She didn’t run away.  We were in 
                        love, you understand?  I loved her 
                        and she loved me.  She never came 
                        back ‘cuz that woman did something 
                        to her.  My Ginny woulda come back.  
                        I couldn’t go to the police...

           Will nods, knowing all-too-well, as Ferramon is lost in 
           tears.  He latches onto Will’s coat, won’t let go.  
                                 FERRAMON
                        I know you, you’re the one arrested 
                        that man, you’re better than the 
                        police, you can find her!

                                 WILL
                        I, I’m not...that’s not...

                                 FERRAMON
                        Please, please!  Help me.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry...I can’t.  
                             (long beat)
                        Braun: how did you find her?

           Will takes out some money, realizes the futility, drops the 
           bills anyway and leaves.

                        name?...Murray...Times Square!
                             (about to hang up)
                        I don’t care, pay it!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MURRAY HILL TURKISH BATH HOUSE, TIMES SQUARE - DAY

           Frank Gartner (the receptionist seen earlier) steps out of 
           the sauna, naked.  He hears footsteps ECHOING.  Looks up - 
           Will emerges through the heavy mist, fully dressed.

                                 GARTNER
                        Can I help you?

                                 WILL
                        I’m here about Willy.  

                                 GARTNER
                        ...I already, um, I already talked 
                        to the police.
                                 WILL
                        Yes and now I’m here for the truth.  
                        For the woman he was seeing in 
                        Queens, the one he was telling 
                        young men about...or I can print 
                        that Frank Gartner offered no help 
                        in bringing this killer to justice - 
                        on page one.  

           He’s got him by the balls...almost literally.

           ANGLE - LATER

           Gartner sits with a towel as Will stands over him, listening.

                                 GARTNER
                        Villy, he’d tell stories about her, 
                        you know how it is in here.  Talked 
                        of moving out to Queens with her, 
                        gettin’ out of the rubber-business.  

                                 WILL
                        To do what?

                                 GARTNER
                        Open a farm.  Not like, with 
                        chickens and cows and things, it 
                        was a place for young girls.  In 
                        trouble...thing is, I don’t think 
                        she was very good at it.  

                                 WILL
                        Braun... Are you telling me the 
                        killer could still be out there?  

                                 GARTNER
                        I don’t know. But he told me once, 
                        the girls going up there, lot of 
                        times they didn’t come back.  I 
                        mean she wasn’t trained or nothin’. 
                        Wasn’t like anyone could tell the 
                        police what had happened, not with 
                        what they was doing.  Besides, 
                        Braun found all kinds of different 
                        ways to get rid of the bodies.  

                                 WILL
                             (concealing his fear)
                        Keep going.

                                 GARTNER
                        Then, he got tired of her.  Or 
                        maybe that was bullshit, maybe she 
                        wanted to get rid of him, I dunno.  
                        But he was gonna tell the police 
                        about what she was doing...
                                 WILL
                        So she went to Thorn.  

           Will sits down, eye-level with Gartner. 

                                 WILL
                        The women that went up and didn’t 
                        come back, how many were there?

                                 GARTNER
                        I don’t know.

                                 WILL
                        Frank --

                                 GARTNER
                        I don’t! 

                                 WILL
                        Not good enough.

                                 GARTNER
                        She was doing this two or three 
                        times a month --

                                 WILL
                        I need to know --

                                 GARTNER
                        For eight to ten years.  

                                 WILL
                             (beat)
                        How many?

                                 GARTNER
                        In my conservative estimation, 300.

           EXT. PARK ROW - NIGHT

           Will walks the Row, lost.  A JOURNAL NEWSBOY holds up the 
           paper, shouts the headline:

           INT. HALLWAY, CHATWOLD MANSION - NIGHT

           Kate speaks with Doctor outside Lucille’s room.  Brisbane 
           sits nearby reading a World, missing the action.

           He sees Kate smile, kiss Doctor’s hand.  

           INT. BEDROOM, CHATWOLD MANSION - NIGHT

           Brisbane takes off his jacket, lays his paper on the stand.  
           Kate’s already in a nightgown looking into Herbert’s crib.  

                                 KATE
                        Finish reading?

           He nods, conscience clearly weighing on him.  As always, she 
           sees it.  

                                 KATE
                        You could write a book.  I think 
                        you’d write a very lovely novel.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        That Doctor charges a fortune.  

                                 KATE
                        You think I care in the least?
                        Come, let’s join everyone in 
                        dreamland. 

           She lays down.  He looks into the crib, the baby smiles.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        You don’t have to care.  

                                 KATE
                        What?

                                 BRISBANE
                        You don’t have to care how much he 
                        charges.  Her father has the money.

           Very slowly he grabs his coat, puts it back on.  

                                 KATE
                        Arthur?  What’s happened?

                                 BRISBANE
                        I can’t keep doing this.  What did 
                        I think, that I could move into his 
                        house?  His bed?

                                 KATE
                             (stands)
                        Well, what if...what if I left?
                                 BRISBANE
                        No your place is here.  And mine is 
                        by his side to protect him, even 
                        from himself. God, I wanted so much 
                        to find that man’s killer.  I had 
                        that opportunity and I let it go, I 
                        forgot my duty to him, to Joseph --

                                 KATE
                        And what about me?!  
                             (he’s startled)
                        It’s not fair  To play the part of 
                        a silent wife every single day? 

           He holds her...

                                 BRISBANE
                        We all have parts to play.  You 
                        play yours for your children.  

                                 KATE
                        My children...

                                 BRISBANE
                        Lucy was sick.  And she’s better 
                        now because she had great care.  
                        Because her father is Joseph 
                        Pulitzer.  Everyone in his family 
                        benefits from that name. 

           He starts for the door...

                                 KATE
                        Even your child?

           BEAT.  She takes Herbert from his crib, walks to Brisbane. 

                                 BRISBANE
                        Would you rather he bore the name 
                        of some unknown editor without an 
                        apartment, or a king with a castle? 

                                 KATE
                        I’d rather he know his father.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        I’m giving him a better story, 
                        Kate.  Didn’t you know?  “A better 
                        story is all that matters.”  

           Baby in arms, they embrace for the last time.  As a family.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        You have seen, and known, the best 
                        of me.

           Brisbane steps off a train.  Crickets and owls SQUAWK.  Jabez 
           is waiting for him...

           EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

           A single lamp lights the tiny vessel; Jabez rows as Brisbane 
           waits patiently.  They graze the shoreline, the houses of the 
           titans of the universe barely visible in the night...

           INT. ENCLOSED PORCH, PULITZER’S JEKYLL ISLAND HOME - NIGHT

           Pulitzer sits at the far end, in darkness.  Brisbane opens 
           the door, steps in, the wood creaks under his weight.  He 
           walks the long corridor-like porch to Pulitzer.  

                                 BRISBANE

           Pulitzer hoists himself out of the chair, he seems so old and

           INT. POLICE PADDY WAGON - NIGHT

           Thorn sits shackled to the floor.  Outside the driver shouts 
           “Woah!” as the horses stop.  Carey opens the back door - Will 
           steps inside, sits across from Thorn.  Carriage drives on.  

                                 THORN
                        Who are you?

                                 WILL
                        Your accuser.

                                 THORN
                             (remembers)
                        The paper man.  My “captor.”  How’s 
                        your jaw?
                             (then)
                        What’d you, come for a quote?

                                 WILL
                        What can you lose? Defend yourself: 
                        Tell me what was happening at that 
                        cottage, with the woman --
                             (Thorn’s eyes go wide)
                        Mrs. “Braun.”
                                 THORN
                        I have nothing to say.

                                 WILL
                        Nack’s implicated you.  She’s the 
                        public’s favorite - I made sure of 
                        that.  And now they’re going to 
                        send you to the gallows.

           Shackles rattling... Will’s within strangling distance.

                                 THORN
                        Then you get what you want. 

                                 WILL
                             (and he realizes)
                        You’re protecting this woman.  You 
                        fall in love?  Men do crazy things 
                        for love.  You might have cut him 
                        up after but that doesn’t mean you 
                        killed him.  It doesn’t make you a 
                        killer... Blue boys thought they 
                        found a bullet hole... Did Braun 
                        shoot him?

           In the shadows, we almost make out the tear falling from 
           Thorn’s eye.  Then he actually laughs at Will, with pity.  

                                 THORN
                        “Braun.”  Wouldn’t that just work 
                        out for everyone...I could be free 
                        and you could still be right.  Get 
                        the fuck away from me.

           Will sits next to Thorn - will he strike?

                                 WILL
                        She played you, didn’t she?  

                                 THORN
                        “Me” - that’s rich.  
                             (then)
                        All these papers, seems like more 
                        of them City types read the World.  
                        Not like Queens.  They say it’s all 
                        gonna be one city come January one -  
                        if I coulda had my trial then, 
                        maybe I coulda gotten some more of 
                        them World readers on my jury.  

                                 WILL
                        Doesn’t work that way.

                        Sure.  
                                 WILL
                        It’s not too late, Thorn.

                                 THORN
                        She put me in here...

           Will’s on his feet, pleading...

                                 WILL
                        She...?

                                 THORN
                        I loved her.  

                                 WILL
                        Don’t do this to yourself.

                                 THORN
                        Leave me alone.

                                 WILL
                        Thorn tell me who Mrs. Braun is!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BAR/LOBBY, HOFFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           High ceilinged, a private art gallery of nudes, marble and 
           bronze statues of Eve and Bacchus.  Looking down from behind 
           the mahogany bar, W.A. Bouguereau’s Nymphs and Satyr painting-
           on-canvas, the famous calling card of the Hoffman House.  

           Will sits quietly with a half-drunk glass of the most exotic, 
           fruit cocktail you can imagine.  A passing drunk hounds him.

                                 MAN
                        Mr. Hearst, surely you must know 
                        which way the jury will --

                                 WILL
                        No comment.  

           He moves off.  Carvalho enters, chuckles at the sight.  

                                 WILL
                        Solly!  Any word?

                                 CARVALHO
                        None, they’re still deliberating.  

           Will nods, drinks more.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        I thought you gave it up.  
                        Everything alright? 
                                 WILL
                             (re: the nymphs)
                        Thought I’d join the fun.  

                                 CARVALHO
                             (smiles)
                        I hear anything more tonight, I’ll 
                        be sure to let you know.  

           Pats Will on the shoulder, turns to go...

                                 WILL
                        What makes him run, Solly?

                                 CARVALHO
                        Who?

                                 WILL
                        The blind monarch.  The carnivore 
                        of the Silurian era.  You worked 
                        for him, give me the headline.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        Can’t boil a man down like that.

                                 WILL
                        What are you talking about?  We do 
                        it all the time.  Whole human 
                        dramas shrunk down to 
                             (measure with his fingers)
                        this many inches.  You worked with 
                        him, kept him going after Morrill 
                        left.  Come on, tell me.  

           Carvalho joins him at the bar.  

                                 CARVALHO
                        He’s a great man, W.R.  Tormented.  
                        Fierce, ambitious --

                                 WILL
                        He doesn’t like his sons very much.

                                 CARVALHO
                        ...Don’t know much about that...

                                 WILL
                        Something he said.  To me.

                                 CARVALHO
                        Dunno.  Hm, I wonder, a man like 
                        that who comes from nothing, builds 
                        a fortune, no schooling... then 
                        your children have everything, I 
                        wonder if you’d...envy them for 
                        having what you never had--
                                 WILL
                        Or hate them, for lacking what you 
                        never lacked.  

           Confused, Carvalho watches Will play with his glass.

                                 CARVALHO
                        W.R...your father... he doesn’t 
                        sound to have been anything like...

           He doesn’t finish the sentence.

                                 WILL
                        He’d make me ride ‘round Babicora, 
                        “Outdoors are where men are made.”  
                        He left it to me to remind me that. 
                             (to bartender)
                        Another please, with the mango yes! 
                             (then)
                        What kind of idiot goes into 
                        newspapers?  You have to love it.  
                        My father bought a newspaper.  You 
                        had to own a newspaper if you 
                        wanted to run for office and he was 
                        running for office so he bought a 
                        newspaper. The San Francisco 
                        Examiner. I used to write him from 
                        school, send him ideas - for the 
                        mining and things; and the paper.  
                        Tell him how I thought he could 
                        expand, what I thought about 
                        school, what I thought about 
                        mother...what I...thought.  And you 
                        know what he told me?
                             (Solly shakes his head)
                        Nothing.  No, he never wrote me 
                        back once.  He wrote my mother - 
                        and there were so many spelling 
                        errors in those letters, Solly, ha 
                        ha, he spelled ‘journalism’ with 
                        two L’s!  You think maybe that’s 
                        why he didn’t write me?  He didn’t 
                        want me to know he couldn’t spell?

                                 CARVALHO
                        Maybe W.R., maybe. 

                                 WILL
                        Self-made man.  Man of the earth, 
                        of the rocks and ore.  Built a 
                        fortune out of nothing.  Became a 
                        Senator!  A god of Industry and 
                        Politics.  Couldn’t even spell.  He 
                        bought a newspaper...but there’s no 
                        way in hell he could have run it.

           He drinks.  For the first time, Carvalho watches him, afraid.
           INT. APARTMENT, THE HOFFMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           Will stumbles in, drunk.  Tessie wakes, sees him wobbling.

                                 WILL
                        What do you think, Tess?  What do 
                        you think?

           She turns on the light.  He shields his eyes...

                                 TESSIE
                        Will?  Are you drunk?

                        our who, our what and where and 
                        when - but why? 

                                 TESSIE
                        You weren’t going to drink anymore, 
                        not after the school --

                                 WILL
                        I had a little downstairs, what of 
                        it?  I have to be up in two hours.  

                                 TESSIE
                        No you need to sleep.

                                 WILL
                        What do you think?  

                                 TESSIE
                        Put that to rest, later --

                                 WILL
                        No!  Now.  What are they saying in 
                        the Bowery Bars, in the Lobster 
                        palaces?  What do you all believe?

                                 TESSIE
                        “You all?”  
                             (beat, very quietly)
                        Will, what am I to you?  

           He’s drunk, but he heard the question.  She circles him...

                                 TESSIE
                        What do we all believe?  How do we 
                        talk of Willy?  Of Will.  What am I 
                        a...a sampling of your readers?

                                 WILL
                        Well you’re certainly cheaper than 
                        a poll, ha ha ha!

           She slaps him.  He grabs, she pushes away --
                                 TESSIE
                        “What if I told you I’m not so sure 
                        Thorn’s the one that did it?”  I 
                        thought you were confessing to me, 
                        I wasn’t paying attention - you 
                        were asking permission to take your 
                        fucking story that way --

                                 WILL
                        Don’t use that language with me --

                                 TESSIE
                        And that night with everyone.  I 
                        was so proud of you and you only 
                        wanted to know which story would 
                        keep us guessing - keep us buying! 
                        Who cares if it’s true!  

                                 WILL
                        Don’t do this --

                                 TESSIE
                        Is this what you wanted?

                                 WILL
                        Tess --

                                 TESSIE
                        Just print anything, is this the 
                        life you dreamed for yourself?  

                                 WILL
                        I had to sell my dream - for you!

                                 TESSIE
                        No, don’t you DARE put that on me!
                        You had enough, before. We could 
                        have gone away if you wanted, but 
                        you didn’t because this war with 
                        him is so much more important --

                                 WILL
                        Stop it!

                                 TESSIE
                        Why else keep going?  We had enough 
                        to get away.  From your mother, 
                        Clark, everyone, we had enough 
                        fucking money, why --

                                 WILL
                             (like a demagogue)
                        Because a newspaper is not a money-
                        making machine, Goddamn you!  It is 
                        the instrument of the will of 
                        hundreds of thousands, millions of 
                        readers.

                        Through which power can be exerted!  
                        And when the Hearst name is in St. 
                        Louis, Chicago, Chattanooga...and 
                        Paris and Cairo and Mumbai, power 
                        will be exerted!

           Tessie looks at the total stranger in front of her...

                                 TESSIE
                        Were you always this person?  Have 
                        I always known you?  No.  What made
                             (pointing at the thing in 
                              front of her)
                        ...you?

           Will sits down, quiet and calm.    

                                 WILL
                        Did you know, there was a man in 
                        Chicago who boiled his wife in a 
                        vat so bad, they couldn’t identify 
                        her body.  They tried.  But they 
                        could never prove it.  And guess 
                        what happened to the paper sales?  
                        I learned that lesson too late, I 
                        printed my ID.  

                                 TESSIE
                        ...Guldensuppe?  You found him.

                                 WILL
                        And killed the mystery.  But 
                        Pulitzer knew: if the case remains 
                        unsolved, people, they are riveted.  
                        No more loose ends, they just stop 
                        caring.  But give them a mystery, 
                        color is far more important than 
                        fact.  They hear and smell the 
                        sizzle, they forget they’ve gone 
                        hungry having been denied the 
                        steak.  Never find the head.  Just 
                        make sure they know you’re looking.  
                        Who made me?  You did.  And every 
                        other gutter rat just like you.  

           ON TESSIE, frozen.  And Will, daring her to judge him.

                                 TESSIE
                        “Spread the Hearst name.”  There 
                        was a time you never wanted 
                        anything to do with it.  Goodbye, 
                        Mr. Hearst. 

           She leaves, her dress tearing against the door jam...  A long 
           moment before he realizes - too late - that she’s gone.

           Will, regaining sobriety, totally disheveled - and destroyed - 
           walks to Nack’s cell.  Finds her reading a love letter.   She 
           looks up, surprised. BEAT.

                        The illustrious W.R. Hearst.

                        It is not me.  I still think Willy 
                        is alive and when he returns --

                                 WILL
                        It’s you.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        ...Your paper says otherwise.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t care.  I don’t care 
                        anymore.  It has to be you.  You 
                        shot him and Thorn did your dirty 
                        work.  I don’t know how I’m 
                        going...but it’s you.

           She comes to the bars, a breath away from his face.

                        You’ll have wasted it all.  You’ll 
                        be a laughing stock --

                                 WILL

           Will is on the floor, obsessively searching through notes, 
           old issues of the Journal and World, scraps - a madman on the 
           hunt for...something.  Out the office window he SEES --

           Everyone on the floor has stopped moving.  Will steps out...
           MAIN FLOOR

           And sees Arthur Brisbane, briefcase in hand.  

           INT. WILL’S OFFICE, JOURNAL OFFICES - LATER

           Will seated at his desk, Brisbane opposite.  Brisbane is 
           ready with negotiating tactics, Will’s just very tired.

                                 BRISBANE
                        I would require an assistant and I 
                        should think that --

                                 WILL
                        How much was he paying you?

                        ...$15,000, and I --

                        a damn about the money.  I’ll work 
                        for you, be loyal to you on one 
                        condition. We report. Investigate.

           Carvalho enters, bags under eyes.  He shakes Brisbane’s hand 
           as only a comrade-in-war can, a bond not even W.R. can know.

                        Oh yes.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe you take it over for a while.

                        To what end?
           Brisbane seems to suddenly notice the mess.

                                 WILL
                        Your employer chose right - he just 
                        doesn’t know it.  Thorn’s not the 
                        devil we’re after.  And any hour 
                        now, that jury is going to come 
                        down with a verdict, based only on 
                        the testimony of a few witnesses, a 
                        couple “experts” and the dominating

                        Why?

                                 WILL
                        Because I, too, have become tired 
                        of the game.

                        I asked about Brisbane, Jabez.

           Will has just laid it all out for Brisbane.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        You realize what you’re saying?

                                 WILL
                        Yes.

                                 BRISBANE
                        You put it on Thorn since day one.  

                                 WILL
                        Yes.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Go after Nack now, you vindicate 
                        Pulitzer, it’ll look like he had it 
                        right all along.  

                                 WILL
                        Yes.

                                 BRISBANE
                        And drive the nail into your 
                        coffin.

                                 WILL
                        But the story will be right. 

                                 BRISBANE
                        OK then...

           ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
           Carvalho slams a box on Will’s desk: more clippings. Brisbane 
           takes out his moleskin, a sacred relic of a former age...

                                 BRISBANE
                        I can’t remember the last time I 
                        opened this.  Stopped recording 
                        facts some time ago.  

           He starts flipping through it for clues...

                                 WILL
                        Can I see that?
                             (off his look)
                        Let’s switch - fresh eyes...

           ANGLE - STILL LATER

           Brisbane going through clippings, notes, court transcripts.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Somehow we need to prove Nack and 
                        Braun are the same person.  

           Will combs through Brisbane’s moleskin until he finds:

           “Augusta Nack - Licensed Midwife”  

                                 WILL
                        What is this?

                                 BRISBANE
                        It was a plaque outside her door.
                             (noting the irony)
                        Advertising.  

                                 WILL
                        Midwife.  Nack was a Midwife. 

                                 BRISBANE
                        Yeah...so what?  

           Carvalho enters with more files.

                        Braun’s farm for young girls...  
                        Nack was advertising herself as a 
                        licensed midwife --

                        New York doesn’t issue midwife 
                        licenses.  

           They both look to him - what?

                                 CARVALHO
                        They don’t...twenty years as a

                        And Thorn had a house in Woodside --

                                 WILL
                        What about before she met Thorn --

                                 BRISBANE
                        Wait a minute...

           He flips through a few more pages, reads:

                                 BRISBANE
                        I asked Frank Gartner, from the

                        “If I wanted to find him.....get it 
                        from the horse’s mouth...” Gartner: 
                        “1671 Eastburn, no wait, he never 
                        moved in there...”
                             (to Will)
                        Then why provide it as an address?  

           A moment - and they’re out the door --

                        1671 Eastburn.  Let’s go.

           A gray day, the wind has some strength to it as if the whole

                        You lose track of when you're 
                        awake.  So you start to fear sleep.  
                        Which is sad, when so much of your 
                        life has been a dream...How long 
                        have you been in my employ, Jabez?

                        call for the same benediction.  
                        “Living-dead”: all that means is 
                        one who does not contribute.  I’ll 
                        not be that man...anymore.  Our

           INT. APARTMENT, 1671 EASTBURN AVENUE, BRONX - DAY

           Superimpose: The Bronx

           Brisbane and Will are with an old, be-speckled woman named 
           IDA ZIEGLER.  You’d think they were cops.  

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        Oh yes, it was back in March, I 
                        placed an advertiss-ment to rent my 
                        room.  

                                 WILL/BRISBANE
                        And did anyone/Was there anyone...

           Brisbane allows Will to continue.

                                 WILL
                        Did anyone come by showing 
                        interest, Mrs. Ziegler?

           She bumbles around the kitchen, boiling water on the small 
           iron stove’s flame.  
                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        Let me think...yes, yes there was a 
                        woman that came by...

           Will and Brisbane exchange looks - Will is about to 
           interject, Brisbane motions for him to stay silent --

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        ...She said she was interested but 
                        she didn’t rent here.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        Did she say why not?

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        Yes.  I remember because it was so 
                        odd...she said the bathtub was too 
                        small!
                             (oblivious to their 
                              reactions)
                        Can you imagine a silly thing like 
                        that?  She didn’t look like a big 
                        woman to me.  And then she asked me 
                        about my garden outside.  

                                 WILL
                        What about it?

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        She wanted to know if she’d strike 
                        water, if she dug three feet down.

           Will gets close to her now, kneeling to her eye level:

                                 WILL
                        Mrs. Ziegler, what was her name?

           Ziegler searches through a drawer of clippings, Will’s 
           anticipation building.  We don’t see what Brisbane is doing 
           in the b.g. --

           Ziegler finds a clipping.

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        Mrs. Braun.

           Will is deflated - just as Brisbane pulls the PHOTO he swiped 
           of Nack and Guldensuppe from his suitcase:

                                 BRISBANE
                        Is this her, ma’am?  Is this woman 
                        Mrs. Braun?

                                 IDA ZIEGLER
                        Yes!
           INT. PRESSED ROOM, JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           The doors fling open, Will and Brisbane move in with purpose, 
           climb the stairs as fast as their feet can carry them:

                                 WILL
                        He thinks she’s looking for a new 
                        place to operate but she’s actually 
                        looking for a place to cut him and 
                        bury him instead --

                                 BRISBANE
                        She looks under the fake name 
                        “Braun,” registers the house in 
                        Queens under the same name --

                                 WILL
                        Wants to rent outside the city, 
                        goes to the Bronx, then Queens.  
                        The body turns up in Harlem, and 
                        Brooklyn and Staten Island --

                                 BRISBANE
                        All New York’s murder...

           As they pass the second floor press room, Will screams in:

                                 WILL
                        Stop the presses, we’ve a new 
                        headline to run!

           That same Press Operator leans his head out:

                                 PRESS OPERATOR
                        Yes, sir, W.R.!

           A calamitous shut down...

           They climb the stairs, cross the floor, jogging, then running 
           as they head for Will’s office, adrenaline racing --

                                 BRISBANE
                        How do we alert the jury?

                                 WILL
                        They read this, they’ll know the 
                        verdict to hand down.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        So let’s do it quick.  You know how 
                        you’re gonna write it?

           Will nods as they enter --

           WILL’S OFFICE

           Will sits at a typewriter.  Brisbane paces, elated.
                                 BRISBANE
                        That’s history’s greatest 
                        retraction you’re about to print.  
                        Could kill the paper.  You ready?

                                 WILL
                             (at peace)
                        Yes, I think I am.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        What will you do next?

                                 WILL
                        Buy a ticket to the theatre.  
                             (and with a laugh:)
                        After that, well, I don’t know.

                                 BRISBANE
                        Well, something tells me you won’t 
                        have to struggle.   

           A hiccup in Will’s excitement.  Brisbane doesn’t notice.

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean?

                                 BRISBANE
                        Your name is Hearst!

           He leaves.  Will sits there.  He opens a locked drawer at his 
           knee, pulls out a worn binder full of letters.  All addressed 
           to “Father.”  Then he looks out the window.  And this time, 
           we finally see what he’s been looking at all these months: 

           A view of a JOURNAL BILLBOARD shadowed by the World tower.  

           Will starts typing...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. APARTMENT, HOFFMAN HOUSE - MORNING

           Will wakes from a deep sleep, alone.  Goes to the window in 
           his silk pajamas.  Draws the curtains and looks out --

                                                          MATCH CUT TO:

           A CROWD Looking up, frozen.  A moment before we realize 
           they’re not under Will’s window but rather at

           EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - MORNING  

           Everyone holds their breath.  Newsboy bolts out the doors, 
           Moses on the Mount with God’s decree: the verdict --
           EXT. PARK ROW - DAY

           Brisbane walks, content.  A mass of people surrounds a hawker 
           shilling fresh sheets.  Brisbane picks one up:

           JOURNAL HEADLINE: THORN GETS THE CHAIR! NACK GETS NINE YEARS!  

           A gut punch.  Brisbane can’t believe it.  Neither can anyone 
           else - as he goes, Journals are devoured everywhere like the 
           twilight zone.  And there’s not a World to be seen.  

           INT. JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

           Brisbane enters as Carvalho addresses the staff from atop his 
           desk, champagne bottles for every two men. Only Goddard sits, 
           watching from his corner - not celebrating, not judging.

                                 CARVALHO
                        W.R. wanted to be here but I told 
                        him to get some sleep.  But you’ll 
                        all be happy to know, the Journal 
                        just reached one million readers.  
                        In one day!  Congratulations!

           Corks pop and fly.  Over the sounds of celebration we go to

           INT. JOURNAL OFFICES - BRISBANE - NIGHT

           Looking at the map.  He sits, alone, nowhere to go.  A door 
           opens.  GIGGLING.  Brisbane sees two young girls (Millicent 
           and her sister) come in, followed by Will giving them a tour.  

                                 WILL
                        And this is where magic is conjured.

           Will sees Brisbane.  Leaves the girls, sits with him.

                                 BRISBANE
                        You’re not out celebrating.

                                 WILL
                        That kind of thing usually requires 
                        a drink.  Thought I’d show a few 
                        new friends the place instead.  

           They both know the 800-pound elephant in the room.

                                 WILL
                        How could I do it?  How could I let 
                        her off?  Ask me.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        It’s your paper, you can do what 
                        you want.

           But he wants to know.  

                                 WILL
                        People...don’t want information.  
                        They want entertainment.  It’s like 
                        a magic act, give them the answer 
                        they’re pining for, they lose 
                        interest.  They knew who was 
                        guilty.  But she wasn’t the story.  
                        Guldensuppe wasn’t the story.  It 
                        was all of them out there, their 
                        injustice.  That’s the drama. 

           It rolls off his tongue so perfectly.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        That may all be true. But it doesn’t 
                        mean I have to be a part of it.

           Brisbane rises, ready to leave with his dignity.

                                 WILL
                        And what will you do up there, on 
                        the moral high ground?

                                 BRISBANE
                        Maybe I’ll...write the great 
                        American novel after all. 
                                 WILL
                        You know it’s not as though we 
                        could’ve brought him back.  So why 
                        labor over fine points when we can 
                        just give them a better story?  

                                 BRISBANE
                        What did you say?

                                 MILLICENT 
                             (calling from the back)
                        W.R. you promised to take us to 
                        Sherry’s!

                                 WILL
                        That’s all this is: we give them a 
                        better story.  
                             (then)
                        Will I see you tomorrow?

                                 BRISBANE
                        I honestly don’t know, Chief.

                                 WILL
                        Call me W.R.  

                                 BRISBANE
                        No, I don’t think I will.  

           As Brisbane walks to the door Arnold rushes in, blows passed.

                                 ARNOLD
                        There’s been an explosion!  On the 
                        Maine, down in Cuba.  How do you 
                        want to handle it?

           Will looks to Brisbane, who leaves, as we

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY - SERIES OF SHOTS

           All New York - Manhattan, Long Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx 
           and Queens - stands still, enraptured by the words on the 
           page, gripping their copies with clenched fists.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
           EXT. THE CLARENDON BUILDING, RIVERSIDE DRIVE - DAY

           Superimpose: 1908

           Augusta Nack, a decade older, stares up at the brick-and- 
           rusticated limestone behemoth.  She looks side to side, 
           expecting someone to notice her.  They don’t.  

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           Opulent.  A set of elevators on one side, a single on the 
           other for the top floors.  Augusta approaches RECEPTIONIST.  

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        May I help you?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        I’m here to see Mr. Hearst.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        And you are?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        ...I am Augusta Nack.  

           Perplexed, Receptionist reaches for a phone...

           INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR 

           Augusta and Receptionist ride up in silence.  Close quarters.  
           Receptionist isn’t the least bit worried.  Doors open into

           ANTEROOM

           Receptionist gestures for her to sit, rides back down.  A 
           buzzer SOUNDS, Nack opens a door to

           INT. HEARST’S BEDROOM OFFICE - DAY

           A grand bedroom/office.  Filled with a collection of statues, 
           tapestries, camera equipment, the ceiling itself taken from 
           some European castle.  Will - a decade older, waist line 
           grander, so let’s call him HEARST - sits behind a great desk.   

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Do you recognize me?

                                 HEARST
                        Of course.  

           She smiles, pleased (and relieved).
                                 HEARST
                        You were released, then?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        A little over a year ago.  

                                 HEARST
                        What have you been doing?

           She sees a photo of Hearst and his wife on his desk, picks it 
           up to look at it.  And we see:

           THE PHOTO: A Husband-and-Wife portrait, Hearst and Millicent.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        She is a handsome woman.  

                                 HEARST
                        What is it you’d like, Ms. Nack?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        $10,000.  And in return I will give 
                        you an exclusive!  My story.

                                 HEARST
                        Is that so?

                                 AUGUSTA
                        People will pay to read my account, 
                        sir.  

           He can’t help but giggle.  It makes her uneasy.  She goes on 
           the offensive.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        Do you know what happened to the 
                        last man that laughed at me?

                                 HEARST
                        I can only imagine.

                                 AUGUSTA
                        You tried to beat me.  To put me 
                        away, to have me killed - but here 
                        I am seated before you.  You 
                        couldn’t get rid of me - my name 
                        was the Headline.  Not everyday you 
                        meet an adversary, is it?

           He looks at her.  It borders on pity and shame.  

                                 HEARST
                        Ms. Nack, I have only ever known 
                        one adversary.  And you are 
                        certainly not that.  There’ll be no 
                        purchase of your story. You may go.  
           She is shocked.  Ready to voice objection and throw a fit.  
           But suddenly aware of where she is, she picks up her umbrella 
           with all the dignity she can muster and heads for the door.  

                                 HEARST
                        And Ms. Nack --
                             (she turns)
                        Your name may have been the 
                        Headline.  But the Headline changes 
                        daily.  The Masthead never does.  
                        And as you see, that is where my 
                        name sits.

           Bested, she leaves.  He sits there.  Atop his larger-than-
           life desk, blueprints for a small bungalow to be built in the 
           California hills; a copy of the Journal-American, his 
           flagship paper, as well as 100 other Hearst publications...

           He comes out from behind the desk and walks to the window.  
           He is BAREFOOT.  High above, Citizen Hearst looks out at New 
           York, the city he now holds in his hand.

           WHICH THE WORLD HAD NEVER KNOWN. AT 55, HE STARTED AN OPEN 
           EXTRA-MARITAL AFFAIR WITH A 22 YEAR-OLD ACTRESS, MARION 
           DAVIES.  ONE OF THE RICHEST MEN IN THE WORLD, HE WAS 
           ULTIMATELY PLAGUED BY EXTREME DEBT AND FORCED TO SELL THE 
           MAJORITY OF HIS EXTENSIVE COLLECTIONS.  TODAY HE IS 
           REMEMBERED FOR YELLOW JOURNALISM, INSTIGATING THE SPANISH-
           AMERICAN WAR FOR HIS OWN PROFIT AND IMMORTALIZED AS A 
           LOVELESS, ILL-FATED TRAGEDY IN ORSON WELLES’ “CITIZEN KANE.”

           JOSEPH PULITZER DIED WITHOUT HIS FAMILY ABOARD HIS YACHT, 
           LIBERTY. THE NEW YORK WORLD CLOSED ITS DOORS IN 1931. AFTER 
           HIS DEATH, PULITZER BEQUEATHED $250,000 TO COLUMBIA 
           UNIVERSITY TO START A JOURNALISM SCHOOL, THE FIRST OF ITS 
           KIND. HIS DREAM TO HONOR INTEGRITY AND ACCURACY IN JOURNALISM 
           WAS REALIZED BY THE PULITZER PRIZE.
