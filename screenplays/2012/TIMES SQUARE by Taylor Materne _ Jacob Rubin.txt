                   In the year 1980, 2300 crimes were committed on 42nd 
                 street between 7th and 8th Avenue, a block known as “The 
                                      Deuce.” 

                 Fifty percent of these were violent felonies, including 
                                   rape and murder.

           EXT. ALLEY. DEN OF SIN -- EVENING

           SUPER: 1980. TIMES SQUARE. NEW YORK CITY

           Eleven-year old WILLIE O’HARA, Irish and auburn-haired, 
           sucks in a deep breath, trying to find his courage. From 
           the bar comes the murmur of drunken goodtimes, jukebox. 
           We PAN over to its front door, where a large BLACK 
           BOUNCER stands guard. The name on the door, “DEN OF SIN,” 
           stenciled in black. A doe-eyed HOOKER leads a stumbling  
           BLIND MAN out of the back exit. Willie grabs the door a 
           split second before it locks shut and sneaks inside.

           INT. DEN OF SIN 

           Christmas season in Times Square. LOCALS stumble and 
           dance against a faded oak bar, carouse in back booths. 
           Everyone knows everyone here - hustlers, pros, union 
           reps. It’s packed. 

           An attractive--in a local sort of way--Irish woman, LYNN 
           RYAN (20’s), pours shots for two Vice detectives at the 
           bar. CALE RYAN and DAVE MACDOUGAL (both 20’s, 
           neighborhood guys) raise their glasses.

                                 CALE
                        To my lovely wife.

           ON Lynn rolling her eyes at Cale’s apparent drunkenness.

                                 LYNN
                        Ex-. Couldn’t never compete with 
                        the badge.

           Cale shrugs as Lynn turns away. The empty glasses drop on 
           the bar. Cale whispers to Mac, but looks straight ahead.

                                 CALE
                        He’s got to connect to Rothstein 
                        and DiBernardo. That’s conspiracy. 
                        Obscenity charge won’t cut it.

           MacDougal nods at Lynn. Refill. As MacDougal reaches for 
           his drink, Cale spots a cord peaking out from his 
           waistline. He’s wearing a wire. Cale glares at him. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           MacDougal’s been in deep cover for two years, posing as a 
           dirty cop -- too long. He’s starting to forget which way 
           is up.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. Tuck it away, Mac. 
                        (BEAT) You do a good run tonight, 
                        we grand jury Sin’s ass and you 
                        get your life back. No mistakes.

           Cale is far from drunk and definitely on his shit.

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        I got it, Cale. I fuckin’ got it. 

           You wouldn’t know it by the shaky way he slams his shot 
           down on the bar. Cale watches with concern. There is A 
           LOT riding on this. 

           Further down the bar, Lynn grabs the empty glass of the 
           target, SINCLAIRE “SIN” RUBIX (40’s, lean, attractive), 
           and refills his scotch. He owns this place, along with 
           many of the smut emporiums in Times Square. He’s mob-
           affiliated but doesn’t look it: ascot, tailored suit. 
           When he talks, he sounds like a well-bred financier.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Thank you, my dear.

           Planted beside him is a hippie gone to seed, Vietnam vet 
           EMMANUEL “MANNY” GOLDMAN (late 30’s). Beret and a decades-
           faded tie-dye shirt stretched over an amorphous paunch. 
           Lebowski’s Dude if he were the right hand to a gangster.

           At the bar, MacDougal, grin strung like Christmas lights 
           from ear to ear, belts out an old Irish classic.

                                 CALE
                        (shaking his head) Three shots and 
                        he’s fucking Pavarotti.

           As MacDougal sings, the scene unfolds...

           Lynn peers across the bar. Notices something.

                                 LYNN
                        Ah, shit. 

           Sinclaire and Manny turn around. 

           Willie, they see, sits alongside a group of rough-looking 
           neighborhood guys: the WESTIES. On Willie’s right, one of 
           them is near-passed out.  

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MANNY
                        They won’t lay a finger on him, 
                        darlin’. Not in here.

                                 LYNN
                        I ain’t worried about him.

           Lynn taps Cale on the shoulder, nods at Willie in the 
           corner. Cale turns around, spots the boy. Sighs. Not 
           tonight.

           Back at the table, Willie passes out shots for the 
           Westies. The men cheer riotously, tousling Willie’s hair 
           like a mascot.  

           The waitress returns with more shots. Willie slides them 
           out. A quick cheers, and they’re SLAMMED. By now the man 
           next to him is completely passed out. CLOSE on Willie’s 
           hands under the table. He pulls out a straight razor, 
           flips it open. Delicately, he SLICES a hole in the pants 
           pocket of the drunken Westie beside him. The man’s wallet 
           falls into Willie’s waiting palm. Just as Willie is 
           sliding out of the booth, the Westie comes to and peers 
           down to find his pocket ripped out. 

                                 WESTIE
                        What the fuck?!

           He grabs for Willie, who goes sprinting towards the exit, 
           weaving through tables. The Westie gives chase, but trips 
           over the leg of a stool. He hits the ground with a THUD. 

           ON Cale as he jumps up, hot on Willie’s heels...

           ON the Westie as he picks himself up and comes barreling 
           over to the bar. He calls to Lynn.

                                 WESTIE (CONT’D)
                        Kid’s gonna find himself in the 
                        river.

           Sinclaire and Manny peer down at the man’s shredded pants 
           and share a grin. Solid play. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                              (casually)
                        Not unless he’s fishing you out.
                              (to Lynn)
                        Send another round, my dear. For 
                        the inconvenience.

           The Westie swallows his pride and heads back to his 
           table. No one dares question the boss. 

           We stay ON Sinclaire, curiosity piqued.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Who is he?

                                 MANNY
                        O’Hara’s boy. You want Mac to have 
                        a word?

           Sinclaire peers over at MacDougal, still singing, then 
           notices Cale’s empty seat. Screws his eyes. Not a fan.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Seems the other one’s taking care 
                        of it.

           MacDougal milks the final note. When he finally lets it 
           go, the bar erupts into applause. He smiles...until he 
           locks eyes with Sinclaire. The smile vanishes. 

           Sinclaire slaps Manny on the shoulder and stands.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Besides, Officer MacDougal has a 
                        prior engagement.  

           EXT. STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale and Willie walk silently down ninth avenue, a light 
           snow shower spitting from above. The reflection of the 
           Square a block away cast the two in a garish, 
           otherworldly light: Mustard-yellows and robins-egg blue. 
           HOOKERS call to Cale and Willie, shadows except for the 
           fish-glint of hungry eyes and $10 jewelry. PIMPS linger 
           in alley ways, low-ride in Monte Carlos. 

                                 CALE 
                        Two seconds late and that razor’s 
                        in your neck.

                                 WILLIE
                        Yeah, and some scientist on the 
                        news was saying if the sun gets 
                        too close the Earth’ll blow up. 
                        Don’t think it’s happening any 
                        time soon.

           Willie has a distinctive neighborhood edge to his voice. 

                                 CALE
                        (chuckling) Wise ass...

           They stand before a wrought-iron fence surrounding a 
           brick tenement and adjacent church. A sign reads SACRED 
           HEART HOME FOR BOYS. An angry, sleep-deprived nun, SISTER 
           MARGARET, awaits them, wrapped in a blanket...

                                 CALE
                        Meeting with social services on 
                        Thursday, Willie. It won’t be much 
                        longer.

           Cale gets serious - thinking of the investigation against 
           Sinclaire.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        A whole lot’s about to change. 
                        (BEAT) Got plans next Saturday? 

                                 WILLIE
                        Supposed to go sailing with my 
                        great Uncle.

                                 CALE
                        (snickers) Too bad. Thinking you 
                        might wanna go to the Garden with 
                        me and Mac Christmas Day. Celtics 
                        in town. You can trim Bird’s 
                        ‘stache from where we sit.

           Willie smiles with boyish excitement. Then he looks over 
           at stern Sister Margaret. Slumps.

                                 WILLIE
                        She ain’t letting me go.

                                 CALE
                        Let me handle her. (pointing to 
                        his badge) This comes with its 
                        privileges.

           Willie pulls out the money he took off the WESTIE, 
           extends to Cale.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Keep it. You’re buying franks.

           Willie grins, then enters the courtyard, where Sister 
           Margaret angrily yanks him farther inside.

           INT. COP CAR -- LATER

           Sinclaire sits in the passenger seat, MacDougal drives. 
           The customary arrangement.

                        That do-gooder partner of yours - 
                        what’s his relationship to the 
                        boy?

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        Looks after him and shit, I dunno. 
                        Guy’s got a stick up his ass he 
                        likes to call justice.

           Sinclaire chuckles.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I’m surprised a boy scout like 
                        Cale Ryan hasn’t shown greater 
                        interest in our affiliation.

           MacDougal squirms. He’s nervous. 

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        Cale? Please...third grade ain’t 
                        worthy of your radar, Sin. Trust 
                        me.

           We PUSH IN on MacDougal’s waist and see the faint 
           blinking red light of the wire.

                                 MACDOUGAL (CONT’D)
                        Listen, Sin. Johnny and Bobby are 
                        both talking.  FEDS are squeezing 
                        ‘em on the Gambino rackets. We 
                        gotta get in front of this. Put 
                        ‘em down. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (giggling) “Put them down?” I 
                        don’t recall asking for your help.

           Sinclaire sits back, studies MacDougal, who tries to mask 
           his frustration.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You seem flush.

           Sinclaire eyes him suspiciously...

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        Just the booze, Sinclaire. 

           INT. RYAN’S BAKERY -- AFTERNOON

           Willie sits at a table in his Catholic school uniform, a 
           textbook open, a plate of cookies before him. The kind 
           owner, ADELINE RYAN (50’s), Cale’s mother, oversees.

           CONTINUED:

           A bell jingles as someone enters. Two chairs slide over 
           joining Willie’s table. Willie peers up, freezing when he 
           sees Manny and Sinclaire. Sinclaire reaches for his 
           homework, inspects.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (to Manny) I think he might be 
                        smarter than you already.

           Manny snickers as Sinclaire grabs the lapel of Willie’s 
           Sacred Heart coat, inspecting the crest. 

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        (to Manny) Look at those freckles.

                        Mom musta been Pippi Longstocking.

                                 WILLIE
                        Willie.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        William O’Hara. Irish as untimely 
                        death. 

           Behind the counter, Adeline Ryan avoids eye contact with 
           Sinclaire. Knows her place.

           Sinclaire pulls out a handful of jellybeans and extends 
           them to Willie, still frozen. Sinclaire happily trickles 
           the lot into his mouth.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        The bar the other night. You know 
                        that was my place?

           Willie’s eyes remain fixed on the table.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Your father would have taught you 
                        to look a man in the eye when he’s 
                        talking to you.

           Willie looks up fiercely. Upset by the mention of his 
           father.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        He would have also taught you that 
                        it’s rather poor judgment to steal 
                        from my customers.

                              (barely audible)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (smiles) Quite a hustle. 
                              (to Manny)
                        “Live among the wolves, you have 
                        to act like a wolf.” Right, 
                        Emmanuel? 

           Manny chuckles.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’ll work it off. Saturday. Ten 
                        AM.

                                 WILLIE
                        Sister Margaret says we ain’t 
                        allowed in the Square.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        But you’re allowed to cheat 
                        gangsters after midnight? 
                        (to Adeline) Ms. Ryan, you keep 
                        this boy in muffins for me.

                                 ADELINE
                        (barely looking up) Sure thing, 
                        Sinclaire.

           Sinclaire extends a hand, Willie shakes. Sinclaire peers 
           down at his hand...

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You’ve got his fingers, you know.

           Sinclaire tips an invisible cap as he and Manny depart. 
           Adeline stares at Willie, concern on her face.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- AFTERNOON

           Daylight in Times Square. TOURISTS, PANHANDLERS, PIMPS, 
           and RUNAWAYS, all bundled up. Willie weaves past the Port 
           Authority, dashes in front of one-run movie theatres 
           where a troupe of BREAK-DANCERS pop and lock. A game of 
           three-card monte goes sideways when a TOURIST chases the 
           HUSTLER who stole his money. Casually the HUSTLER turns 
           around and CLOCKS the tourist in the face. The tourist 
           crumbles in the middle of the street, out cold. His wife 
           screams, but no one helps. Willie keeps running, then 
           peers up at his destination...

           In blinking fluorescent lights a dangling plastic leg 
           introduces: SKIN WORLD. Bright lights advertise 25-cent 
           peep rooms, Live Sex, adult videos. Willie ascends a 
           rainbow stairwell...

           INT. SKIN WORLD -- CONTINUOUS

           The main floor is a flight up from the street. 
           Immediately Willie’s eyes GO WIDE. Magazines, videos, sex-
           dolls. A mounted TV plays a video of a man kissing a 
           topless woman’s neck. A red sign points upstairs for the 
           Live Sex Show and Private Booths. A creepy VOICE beckons 
           customers for quarters over the P.A. 

           *Note: For the rest of this sequence Willie will be slyly 
           hidden from the grimier elements of Sinclaire’s universe. 
           We experience Skin World as he does: A glamorous playpen.

           Manny stands behind the counter arguing with an 
           attractive Italian, SKINNY LOU (20’s).

                                 MANNY
                        You’re the only kid in America who 
                        complains about having to make 
                        love to beautiful women all day. 

                                 SKINNY LOU
                        You wouldn’t be sayin’ that if you 
                        saw how swole my--

           Noticing Willie, Manny stops Skinny Lou before he can 
           finish.

                                 MANNY
                        (to Willie) Right on time. (to 
                        Lou) See that, Lou? Kid’s a 
                        clock.(To Willie) Gimme a minute. 

           He starts walking. Thinks of something.

                                 MANNY (CONT'D)
                        (to Willie) Keep your hands outta 
                        your pockets.

           Manny winks then disappears through a door marked 
           “private” in the rear of the floor. 

           ON Willie as he sees the parade of CUSTOMERS, middle-aged 
           white men with furtive grins on their faces. 

                                 MANNY (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Can you handle a mop, kid?

           CONTINUED:

           *The Talking Heads Life During Wartime kicks in over SKIN 
           WORLD MONTAGE:

           -PEEP SHOW BOOTHS: Willie stands outside of the booths, 
           holding a mop. A red light signals occupancy. A line of 
           MEN, every walk of life, wait. The lunch rush. A sign 
           above the door reads: You drop it, we mop it.

           An OVERWEIGHT MAN in a double-breasted suit emerges. 
           Willie rushes in, sprays disinfectant, mops furiously. 
           The velvet window has already slid shut. Inside is 
           nothing more than a wooden chair, a coin slot, and a roll 
           of toilet paper. Necessities.

           -LIVE SEX SHOW: Willie spies through a cracked door where 
           a busty Latina, MARIA, waits as a customer’s hand pushes 
           through a partition. Dollars fall as she grabs his hand, 
           licks his fingers and shoves them towards her crotch. 

           ON Skinny Lou in the corner, in tighty whities, awaiting 
           his invitation to perform. He turns and locks eyes with 
           Willie. Willie freezes, then sprints away...

           -FRONT DESK: It’s early morning and Willie mans the front 
           desk, reading from an algebra text book. Manny appears 
           behind him and places an open porno magazine over his 
           text book. They both crack up...

           END MONTAGE

           INT. DIAMONDS BURLESK -- WEEK LATER

           A crowd of drunken MEN applauds as a young nubile BLONDE 
           takes the stage, dressed in a silk negligee and feathered 
           headpiece. Diamonds Burlesk is one of Sinclaire’s 
           “classier” joints: strip club meets Burlesque theater. 

           Willie ogles the dancer as Manny escorts him to a private 
           door. Manny makes a point of blocking his view as the 
           REAL show begins: the woman produces a dildo and starts 
           to fondle herself on stage.

           INT. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE. DIAMONDS BURLESK -- CONTINUOUS

           Sinclaire discreetly lowers a blind over the one-way 
           mirror in his office so that Willie can’t see the rest of 
           the show. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (pointing behind him, toward the 
                        blind) Constance is a professional 
                        screen actress.

                        your debt paid, William. 

           Sinclaire strikes a more serious note.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Have a little Christmas present 
                        for you.

           INT. ABANDONED BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           *An eerie red glow suffuses the scene, but we’re unaware 
           of why. A DRUG DEALER, nude, badly beaten, duct tape over 
           his mouth, is tied down to a chair. Manny stands before 
           the man, holding a nine. Sinclaire rests his hands on 
           Willie’s shoulders. The kid stares ahead, shaken.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Maurice is the jackal that sent 
                        you to that dreadful home. The man 
                        that made you a bastard, William. 

           The dealer pleads with his eyes, screaming through the 
           tape. Sinclaire grabs Willie’s chin forcing him to watch.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Crimes against our own do not go 
                        unpunished.

           Sinclaire nods to Manny who aims, as we pull out of the 
           space to the other side of the lights... 

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- EVENING

           We’re in the middle of Broadway where the Coca-Cola 
           billboard hangs. In the fogged glass behind the sign 
           appear the silhouettes of Sinclaire, Manny, and Willie. 
           Only Sinclaire has this kind of access. 

                                 SINCLAIRE (V.O.)
                        Merry Christmas.

           BANG! BANG! The orange streak of two bullets pass behind 
           the lights of the billboard. It’s done.
           EXT. SACRED HEART HOME FOR BOYS -- DAYS LATER

           Cale, in his uniform, stands with Sister Margaret 
           awaiting Willie and Sinclaire. Willie freezes when he 
           sees them. 

                                 CALE
                        There he is.

           Cale pulls an autographed Knicks hat from behind his 
           back, hands it to Willie. Willie beams.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Bill Cartwright, right there.

                        Margaret) Freakin’.

                        (eyeing Sinclaire) Should’ve been 
                        there to meet him yourself. 

           Sinclaire ignores him.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Sister, forgive our tardiness. We 
                        ended up at the movies. 

           The nun smiles wider than Willie’s ever seen. 

                                 SISTER
                        As long as Willie enjoyed himself.

           Willie stares at Sinclaire, awed by his power.

                                 SISTER (CONT’D)
                        (to Willie) Sinclaire grew up in 
                        this very same building. Just like 
                        you. Though I wish he attended 
                        service more often.

           Sister Margaret peers down at Willie gently.

                                 SISTER (CONT'D)
                        Come along then. Time for bed.

                        We’ll see you Saturday, William?

           Willie looks to Sister Margaret, who doesn’t object.

                                 WILLIE
                        You got it.

                        Thanks, Cale.

           Sister Margaret and Willie disappear into the courtyard.

           Cale stares at Sinclaire, not with kindness.

                        Think it’s wise to have a kid that

           They eye each other hotly. Nemeses.

                        I couldn’t agree with you more.

           Shots fired at the Howard Johnson.

                        Your commitment to doing “the 
                        right thing” is so precious, Cale, 
                        like quilting or a fondness for 
                        Ming plates. A hobby that means 
                        jack-shit in the real world. Your 
                        partner understands that, why 
                        can’t you?

                                 CALE
                        It won’t always be like this, Sin. 
                        Just wait. Your words won’t total 
                        half a shit when you’re toothless 
                        at Rikers. 

           Sinclaire screws up his eyes. His voice drops.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Be careful. I’d hate for anything 
                        to happen to my favorite bartender 
                        because a blue got too blustery 
                        with his language.

           Lynn - his ex. Cale tenses up, but there’s nothing he can 
           do.

           Cale’s walkie-talkie crackles again. He’s gotta go.

                                 CALE
                        Fuck you.

           With that, Cale turns and marches into the night.

           Sinclaire calls to him.

           PAN UP to TENEMENT, where we can see Willie looking down 
           at the men from his window.

           EXT. PENN STATION -- NEW YEARS EVE EARLY MORNING

           LT. CONRAD JORDAN (40’s) waits before a coffee vendor as 
           Cale makes his way over. Jordan’s old-school New York, 
           balding, quick lip. He hands Cale a black coffee, starts 
           heading uptown.

                        he can’t tell his right from his 
                        fuckin’ left. 

           Cale nods. He’s as impatient as Jordan for results.

           He slaps Cale on the shoulder and saunters away, humming. 

           INT. DEN OF SIN -- MORNING OF NEW YEAR’S EVE 

           MacDougal, in uniform, slumps at the bar, his face 
           riddled with nerves. He grips a half-empty Scotch. 
           Concerned, Lynn studies him from the back of the bar, 
           gearing up for the party later that night.

           The front door SLAMS open. Cale flies in, angry. He spots 
           MacDougal at the bar, bee-lines.

                        (despondent) He knows, Cale. I can 
                        feel it.

           MacDougal heads for the bathroom. Cale on his heels.

                        You gonna hold my dick?

           EXT. SACRED HEART HOME FOR BOYS -- NEW YEARS EVE MORNING

           Willie slams the gate and heads out. In a quick montage, 
           we see Willie cruising across 42nd Street. Cops push the 
           homeless away from the ball-drop barricades. The guardian 
           angels patrol like Black Panthers, along with packs of 
           disheveled commuters herding toward the train.

           EXT. ALLEY. DEN OF SIN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale has MacDougal pinned against the wall outside.

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        I gotta fucking piss, Cale.

                                 CALE
                        You gotta finish this, Mac. Guys 
                        like Sin don’t get to win. 

           ANGLE ON WILLIE spying from the mouth of the alley.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. All the shit you’ve 
                        done--I.A. will have your badge if 
                        you don’t deliver. 

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        Fuck I.A. and fuck the force. 
                        Sin’s got people everywhere. I

                        your christly pursuits.

           MacDougal begins to walk away. Cale jumps in front of him-
           -a hand on his chest.

                                 CALE
                        Give me your badge then.

           Cale puts out his hand. 

                                 CALE
                        You treat it like a fuckin’ toy. 
                        Give it to me.

           MacDougal thinks about it. He scratches his head, looking 
           like he’s about to apologize then - WHAM! - he sucker-
           punches Cale.

                                 MACDOUGAL
                        Fuck you.

           As Cale stumbles back, holding his ringing head, 
           MacDougal REACHES FOR SOMETHING AT HIS WAIST...

           ON WILLIE who sprints over in a panic, grabs a lead pipe 
           next to the dumpster. MacDougal turns to face Willie...

                                 MACDOUGAL (CONT’D)
                        Kid, what the hell --

           Willie takes a big-league swing, CLUBBING MacDougal in 
           the head. 

           BOOM! Like that, MacDougal DROPS limply to the pavement. 
           Face down. Blood leaking from the side of his head.

           Cale looks at MacDougal, then Willie, then MacDougal. He 
           crouches over the limp body, flips it over. We see what 
           MacDougal was reaching for: His BADGE. It falls out of 
           his death-loosened grip.

                                 CALE
                        Mac...Mac...

           Cale frantically checks for a pulse, lays his ear to his 
           mouth. No vitals.

           ON WILLIE who’s white as a Klansman, shivering. 

                                 WILLIE
                        I thought he was going for his 
                        gun, Cale. His fuckin’ gun...

           Cale bounces on his heels, wheels turning.

                                 CALE
                        All right, all right...Think...

           Willie’s in shock. Staring into space.

                        Willie, let’s go! If Sin knows you 
                        knocked Mac, the shine he took to 
                        you won’t mean shit next to the 
                        corpse of his inside guy. You got 
                        that? Now if we ship Mac outta 
                        here, we can make it look like he 
                        got jumped.

           Willie doesn’t move. Catatonic.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Take his legs, Willie. Let’s go!

           Willie nods, crying. Makes a move toward the body. Just 
           as they start to try to lift the body --

           VOICES stream in from the bar, Sinclaire’s and Manny’s. 
           FUCK! There’s NO TIME.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no!

                        I killed a cop....

                        What about the plan? You can’t

           He musses Willie’s hair. Sinclaire’s and Manny’s voice

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Be strong, Willie...You’ll sell 
                        it...

           Cale stealthily moves away, disappearing around the 
           alley.

           Willie breathes deep, wipes his eyes. Getting ready to 
           tell his lie. Knowing that everything has changed...

           INSERT: The lavender window of a peep booth slides open 
           and a NEWSREPORTER appears. We cut between snippets of

           through the years...

           The lavender window closes, and that creepy voice beckons 
           for another quarter over the PA. We HEAR the trickle of a

           EXT. CITY HALL -- AFTERNOON

           SUPER: 1994

           On the steps of City Hall, mayor Rudy Guiliani, one year 
           into the job, concludes his Thanksgiving Day address.

                        the street tax paid to drunk and

           INT. SKIN WORLD -- EVENING

           A RAID, absolute chaos. Enforcement COPS RUSH the door. 
           The COPS swarm, violently grabbing bratty UPTOWN TEENS 
           with fake ID’s, nodded-out BUMS from video rooms, seedy 
           OLD MEN, scowling DANCERS.

           EXT. SKIN WORLD -- CONTINUOUS

           The CUSTOMERS shiver in the early winter chill. In the 
           storefront we notice that sporting apparel and comic 
           books now share window space. A nod to new legislation 
           requiring no more than 40% adult material.

                        peddlers and panhandlers, and open-

           EXT. DIAMONDS BURLESK -- EVENING

           The COPS are more gentle ushering Sinclaire’s 
           STRIPPERS/PORN STARS outside. 

                                 COP
                        What’d we tell you about the box

           EXT/INT. SIN -- EVENING

           CLOSE ON black doors as they FLY open. Stenciled on the 
           door, now simply “SIN”. It’s no longer a neighborhood 
           dive. It’s been transformed into a sleek lounge.

                        change to the people of New York, 
                        and today is the first step in 
                        that effort.

           COPS charge in. PATRONS desperately try to ditch little 
           bags of blow as they are TOSSED against the bar and 
           searched. Gone are the rough and tumblers. This group is 
           fashionable, trendy. The new locals.

           INT. SIN -- MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON CONRAD JORDAN, now fully bald, a Captain and in 
           plainclothes. Alongside him is a young detective, BRIAN 
           STRONG (20’s), Ivy league, shaved head, and a gym rat. 
           They approach a banquette where neighborhood pimps once 
           shared shots with local cops. No more. 

           SINCLAIRE, age only evident in the lines around his 
           mouth, sits beside MARIA, the former dancer. Still in the 
           game. Sinclaire glares up at Jordan and Strong.

                                 JORDAN
                        Can’t say you weren’t warned. I’m 
                        in your ass every night, Sin. 

           Strong grabs him by the arm, jerks him up violently.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        The courtship ritual of a 
                        government slug. 

           Jordan reaches down to grab Maria. She slaps his hand 
           away.

                                 MARIA
                        Get your fuckin’ hands off me.

           INT. BACK OFFICE. SIN -- MOMENTS EARLIER

           The BOOM of the raid startles MANNY, a little rounder, 
           but still holding tight to his hippie persona. He gets up 
           from the edge of a couch where he’s been sharing a joint 
           with a nervous bartender, JESSE (mid 20’s). 

                                 MANNY

                        shift.

           Manny leads a reluctant Jesse through a backdoor, into a 
           secret hallway, and then through a tunnel below the 
           building.

           With Jesse a step ahead of him, Manny grins to himself. 
           Predatory...

           EXT. SIN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Sinclaire is being shoved into the back of a waiting cop 
           car. Strong closes the door on him and nods to two ROOKIE 
           COPS who sit shotgun. 

                                 STRONG
                        Take this fuck the scenic route.

           ANGLE ON: WILLIE rushing up to the scene. He’s a man now, 
           mid 20’s, attractive and confident.

                                 WILLIE
                        Whoah, whoah, whoah. What’s the 
                        charge?

           Strong whips around, purposely shouldering Willie.

                                 STRONG
                        None of your fucking concern.

           Willie pushes him back. Strong gives him an icy glare.

                                 STRONG (CONT’D)
                        Do it, hotshot. Nothing would 
                        please me more.

           Sinclaire stares out his window, eyes locked on Willie.  

           A stunning socialite and Willie’s lady, TAMSIN DUNLAP 
           (20’s), rushes up. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        Willie, don’t!

           She grabs Willie’s arm, pulls him back. Tamsin’s got 
           style in spades. The girl who got kicked out of boarding 
           school. Willie stands for a second, lost in the blare and 
           wash of sirens, then grabs Tamsin’s arm, pulling her away 
           from the masses.

                                 TAMSIN (CONT’D)
                              (off Strong)

           CONTINUED:

           Willie watches as the cop car pulls away with Sinclaire 
           in the back. He whistles for a cab.

           Tamsin’s face says it all. She’s crushed.

                                 TAMSIN (CONT’D)
                        Not tonight, Willie.

                        I’ll meet you there. An 
                        hour...tops. 

           Willie jumps in the cab, rolls down the window.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        It won’t always be like this, I 
                        promise.

           He blows a kiss. The cab tears out, leaving Tamsin to 
           stew on the corner 

                                 TAMSIN

                        you?

           EXT. STREET. BROWNSVILLE, BROOKLYN -- LATER

           A cop car screeches around the corner in a very sketchy 
           neighborhood. The door FLIES open. Without stopping, 
           Sinclaire comes BARRELING out, SLAMMING and ROLLING on 
           the pavement. A Rookie cop yells as they drive away...

                                 ROOKIE COP 
                        Try relocating, asshole!

           Local THUGS in woolies and puffer coats pass a joint on a 
           project bench. They glare at Sinclaire, all but licking 
           their lips.

           EXT. STREET. BROWNSVILLE, BROOKLYN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Willie’s cab comes to a sudden halt. Willie jumps out, 
           sees Sinclaire surrounded by the THUGS.

           Willie runs over, fists balled, ready for war, but 
           instead finds Sinclaire chuckling with the locals. He’s 
           scratched up, but nothing’s broken.

                                 SINCLAIRE

           Sinclaire leads Willie back toward the waiting cab.

           INT. CAB -- MOMENTS LATER

           William and Sinclaire sit side-by-side. Sinclaire’s in a 
           foul mood.

                                 WILLIE
                        They’re after blood now, Sin. I’m

                        (to the cabbie) Can you step on

                        (dismissively) That’s what happens 
                        when you date the customer. Too 
                        much maintenance. Like a Mercedes - 
                        it’s the repairs that bankrupt 
                        you.

                                 WILLIE
                        (laughs) Play nice, Sin. You could 
                        use a drink.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (shrugs) Getting thrown out of a 
                        car by two twats cuts down 
                        remarkably on one’s desire to 
                        socialize.

           Willie smiles and offers a quote - a parlor trick he 
           learned from Sinclaire.

                                 WILLIE
                        “A great nation is like a great 
                        man. He thinks of his enemy as his

           INT. CHIC DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT -- LATER

           Willie sits at a bar stool, halfway through a whiskey 
           neat. Tamsin, drunk, slinks between his legs. The crowd 
           around them is young, trendy, moneyed. 

                                 WILLIE
                        So I’m forgiven?

                                 TAMSIN
                        For now. Every girl knows a 
                        surprise party trumps a police 
                        raid. Hell, it’s right out of the 
                        Delinquent’s Handbook to Romance.

                        (smiles) Fourth edition.

           Tamsin’s gaze wanders over to Sinclaire walking slowly 
           toward them. In the hip crowd, he sticks out like a sore 
           thumb.

                                 TAMSIN
                        (whispering) Look at him. Like a 
                        colonial right before the natives 
                        revolt.

           Sinclaire studies the crowd with disdain. He’s a nobody 
           in this world, and he hates that.  

                                 WILLIE
                        (whispering) Nah, he’s the native.  
                        It’s the land that’s changed 
                        around him.

                        Play nice.

           Tamsin straightens her expression just as Sinclaire 
           arrives. He barely acknowledges her.

                        (to Tamsin) Happy Birthday. 

           He tips his cap and saunters out.  As he’s leaving...

                        Modest celebration for a modest 
                        gal...

           Tamsin sighs. NOT a fan of Sinclaire.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Creep. I don’t know why you put up 
                        with him. 

                                 WILLIE
                        We could sit here and bitch about 
                        Sin or I could feed you shots and 
                        take advantage of you. Which do 
                        you prefer?

                                 TAMSIN
                        (grinning) It’s my birthday, 
                        shouldn’t I be taking advantage of 
                        you?

                                 WILLIE
                        As long as I get to pick the ball 
                        gag...

           Tamsin laughs, leads him through the party by the hand.

           INT/EXT. APARTMENT -- DAWN

           Adeline Ryan, now in her 70’s, is shaken awake by the 
           vibration of construction next door. She slowly rises. 
           Beside her bed sits a picture of Cale as a young cop. She 
           gets up, opens the window.

           She screams at TWO WORKERS drilling in the alley below...

                                 ADELINE
                        You’re supposed to start at seven-
                        thirty! It’s not even seven!! 
                        Every morning with this garbage!

           The men don’t even look up, pretending not to hear. 

                                 ADELINE (CONT’D)

           Enraged, Adeline slams the window. Her face contorts and 
           she grabs for her arm. A heart attack. She reaches for 
           the phone just inches from her fingers...collapse.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- AFTERNOON

           The holidays in Times Square. Christmas colors and 
           lights. HUSTLERS snap Polaroids for a quarter. Gangs of 
           KIDS park in front of the arcade. POLICE on horseback 
           parade down 42nd street. Among the chaos, the lights of a 
           familiar sign...DIAMOND BURLESK.

           INT. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE. DIAMOND BURLESK

           CLOSE on Sinclaire staring into a mirror. He dabs 
           Neosporin on his elbow, courtesy of his ride to Brooklyn. 
           An omnipresent bowl of jellybeans rests on his desk. In 
           the one-way mirror, a STRIPPER, eyes blood-shot, shoves 
           her crotch against a customer’s face. Dollars fall from 
           the man’s palm. Box Lunch. 

                                 WILLIE 
                        Sin, you hearing me? They sure as 
                        shit didn’t sell the Pussycat. You 
                        see the padlocks they got up?

                        Manny) Damage?

           Manny’s all business.

                        We’ll live. Couple misde’s on the

                        They’re gonna keep coming, Sin. We

                        play and get paid. On our terms.

                        I know your position, Willie.

           He nods to the door.

           Willie, disapproving, leaves. Sinclaire and Manny wait 
           till the door shuts. Sinclaire nods to a small headline 
           in NY POST on his desk: “FALL FROM GRACE”.

                        You call this a quiet denouement

                                 MANNY
                        That pig raid hit right when I was 
                        doing my thing. (shrugs) Had to 
                        improvise.

           SMASH FLASHBACK:

           The night of the raid. Manny leads Jesse through the 
           chaotic Times Square subway station (loud drum circle, 
           sermonizing street preacher) towards the far end of the S 
           train platform. The lights of the train beam into the 
           station. Manny puts his arm around Jesse on the edge of 
           the platform. They lock eyes. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy blue heaven.

           The kid knows what’s coming, but it’s already too late. 
           With a subtle shift of weight, Manny shoves Jesse, his 
           body TUMBLING onto the track just as the train arrives. 
           BAM! The train jerks violently...

                        being. Once they’ve upped their 
                        arrest numbers and held some tacky 
                        press conference on New York 1, 
                        our men in blue will no doubt

                        (V.O.) He mighta seen a thing.

           Times Square subway station. The train jerks violently - 
           hitting the body. Manny looks up. Through the subway 
           doors, an inch way, he sees the face of BOOTLEG KENNY 
           (outlandish skinny pimp) with his flock of TRANNY HOES 
           inside the train. SHOCKED. Bootleg looks Manny dead in 
           the eyes, everyone screaming around them.

                                 SINCLAIRE (PRE-LAP)
                        Ah, Bootleg. (BEAT) We’ll have to 
                        persuade him the old-fashioned 
                        way... 

           Manny walks away from the scene of the crime calmly, 
           despite the chaos of the subway platform, where people 
           have now discovered the body. Guy’s a pro.

           INT. BUILDING. NEW PALTZ, NY -- EVENING

           CALE RYAN, older, messy mane, but still handsome pursues 
           a MASKED FIGURE in what looks like a modern office 
           building. It’s dark, but we can tell he’s in uniform. 

           The figure he’s chasing tosses a chair over his shoulder, 
           narrowly missing Cale’s knee. The crackle of Cale’s 
           walkie erupts: “NEED BACK UP OVA THERE?”

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           The figure rips open the doorway of a room. Cale follows 
           closely, but he’s losing steam. A large conference table 
           separates Cale and the masked man. A face off. 

                                 CALE
                        I’m sendin’ you my chiropractor 
                        bill.

           The man peers in both directions. No escape. Then he 
           turns around and JUMPS out an open window. Cale rushes 
           over, looks down. At least eight feet.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck my ass.

           Cale jumps...

           OUTSIDE

           Cale lands awkwardly, but hops up. He can see the masked 
           man’s gained some distance on him. Cale hops into a golf 
           cart parked in front of the building and screeches out, 
           his uniform illuminated by the street lamps above. It 
           reads: Campus Security. We’re on the grounds of a college 
           campus. Cale’s new world.

           Cale weaves through buildings on the golf cart, takes a 
           stairwell at full speed and then rounds a corner--BOOM! 
           He BARRELS into the masked man with the front bumper of 
           the golf cart. The masked man is laid out, groaning on 
           the ground, Cale crouching beside him. Cale rips off the 
           mask: He’s a kid, maybe eighteen and scared shitless. 

           Cale reaches over and grabs a stolen exam. He reads it, 
           with shock.

                                 CALE
                        Exercise science? You fucking 
                        kidding me? Calculus, Chemistry--

                        spend fifteen K a year so you can

           Cale picks the kid up off the ground, hands the test back 
           to him.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Just don’t become a banker.

           The kid nods, stunned that his life isn’t over. Cale hops 
           in the golf cart, pulls out.

           EXT. SECURITY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale pulls the dented golf cart up to the small security 
           office on campus.

           A fellow cop emerges from the building, surveys the cart.

                        If it’s the folks at Powerball, 
                        tell them I opt for the lump sum.

                                 CAMPUS COP
                        Even more shocking: a woman. Said 
                        her name was Lynn. 

           Cale turns, surprise on his face.

           INT. CITY HALL -- MORNING

           Willie, in a business suit, cruises through the hallways 
           of City Hall. He shakes hands, nods, waves. Dude makes an 
           entrance. Willie approaches a court CLERK, heavyset black 
           woman. She shakes her head playfully: She’s been a victim

                        Harlem Boys Choir singing some 
                        early Johnny Mathis. 

           She giggles, paging through the files in front of her, 
           reading what she sees.

           ST. LUKE’S HOSPITAL -- WEEK LATER

           Cale sits beside his mother. She’s tubed up: a coma. 
           Flowers from the neighborhood clutter the table and 
           windowsill. 

                                 JORDAN (O.C.)
                        Sorry, Cale. She was a good one.

           Cale looks up and sees Jordan standing before him.

           Cale rises, and they shake hands. Cale doesn’t know what 
           to make of Jordan’s being there.

                                 CALE
                        Thanks, Connie. You really didn’t 
                        have to visit.

           Awkward BEAT. Jordan comes clean.

                                 JORDAN
                        That’s not exactly true.

           Jordan puts on his cap.

                        Tomorrow morning. My office.

           He quickly turns back...

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        And my wishes for a speedy 
                        recovery.

           On his way out, Jordan notices a card from the local 
           church. He points it out to Cale.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Believe this guy’s a preacher now?

           Cale picks up the card, studies it. It’s from Sacred 
           Heart Church, featuring a photo of Skinny Lou, the sex 
           performer from back in the day, in a clerical collar. 
           Older but definitely recognizable.

           As Jordan leaves, Cale studies the card. Hmmm...

           INT. JORDAN’S OFFICE. MIDTOWN SOUTH PRECINCT -- MORNING

           JORDAN sits at his desk, Cale across from him. Behind 
           Jordan, with the stiff bearing of military personnel, 
           stands Strong.

                        they find him dead in a vacant--
                        where the fuck you been, slick?

           Cale jumps up, pushes back. There’s an edge to Cale we 
           haven’t seen before. He whispers in Strong’s ear...

           Strong steps toward Cale. Ready to go.

                        Take it easy, Strong. Cale was 
                        cleared by yours truly--what more 
                        you want? Operations get blown, 
                        people die. If he sticks around, 
                        who knows, maybe Sinclaire drops 
                        him in that same vacant. 

                                 CALE

           Jordan grins.

                                 JORDAN
                        Giving you another shot.

           Strong walks around the desk, facing Cale. He gets into 
           it.

           Strong flips a bulletin board over: tacked to it are 
           pictures of Sinclaire, Manny, Maria, Willie. Cale’s eyes 
           hold on Willie.

                        Great show, but I must be missing

           A DJ spins, MODELS, CELEBS, I-BANKERS buying bottles. A

           more out of place. 

           Willie runs out from behind the bar, gives Cale a firm

                        As I fucking live and breathe. 
                        (BEAT) I was sorry to hear the 
                        news.

                        Thanks for the flowers, kid.

           Willie nods. Of course. Tamsin sidles up next to him.

                                 WILLIE
                        (proudly) Cale Ryan, Tamsin 
                        Dunlap.

                                 TAMSIN
                        The Cale Ryan? 

                                 CALE
                        “The” is fine. No need for 
                        formality.

           Willie and Tamsin chuckle.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Nice to meet you in the flesh. I 
                        thought you were a myth the way 
                        Willie talks about you.

           She extends her hand. Cale shakes.

                                 CALE
                        A parable, maybe.

                              (to Willie)
                        Topper and his friends are in the 
                        back. Come say hi when you have a 
                        sec.
                              (to Cale)
                        It’s an honor, Cale.

                                 CALE
                        All mine.

           Cale and Willie watch as she glides through the crowd and 
           takes a seat at a banquet next to four YUPPIES.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jesus. Girl like that doesn’t even 
                        have to wipe, I bet.

                                 WILLIE
                              (grinning)
                        Still a sick fuck, I see. 

           Cale holds Willie at the shoulders, appraising him. He 
           squints, notices something.

                                 CALE
                        You got mousse in your hair?

           Willie smiles self-consciously, waving his hand through 
           his hair. Cale slaps him on the back.

                                 WILLIE
                        (sincerely) I missed you.

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, I missed you too, kid.

           INT. BAR. SIN -- LATER 

           Willie and Cale are reminiscing giddily over drinks. Old 
           friends telling old stories. Cale is red in the face with 
           laughter...

                                 CALE
                        (cracking up, imitating the 
                        sergeant) “Be on your way, son.” 
                        Jesus, there’s a New York cop for 
                        you.

           Cale shakes his head in amused disbelief. 

                                 WILLIE
                        So how’s campus life? Postcards 
                        make it look like some shit out of 
                        Stephen King.

                                 CALE
                        It is what it is. Bunch of snow. I 
                        got a nice little A-frame and that 
                        empty bedroom when you’re ready.

           Willie smirks. They’ve been down this road before.

                                 WILLIE
                        Not sure the lady would appreciate 
                        me taking on a roommate.

                                 CALE
                              (looking around, 
                               impressed)
                        Look at this shit. Surprised I 
                        ain’t seen your name in Page Six.

                                 WILLIE
                        Stay off the heavy literature, 
                        Cale. Don’t want you hemorrhaging.

           Cale snorts.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t complain. Sin put me in 
                        charge of this place.

                        Clientele’s haughty as shit, but 
                        I’m working on something, Cale. 
                        Something big.

           A BEAT as sadness creeps into Cale’s expression. This 
           kid, so full of ambition and spunk, could go away for A 
           LONG TIME.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        How long you sticking around?

                                 CALE
                        Couple weeks at least. (secretive) 
                        Think that’s all right with the 
                        management?

                                 CALE
                        Wouldn’t want you sticking your

                                 WILLIE
                        Why not, I learned it from you...

           They both smile. Willie looks up, spots someone.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                              (whispering)
                        You got company.

           Lynn, still a local beauty after all the years, appears 
           behind Cale. 

                                 LYNN
                        I got fuckwads in suits doing 
                        lines on the table and the new kid 
                        you hired keeps sneaking sips. We 
                        can’t afford another citation, 
                        Willie.

                                 WILLIE
                        Go easy on him. Christ, they’re 
                        dropping like flies around here.

           Cale turns around in his stool. He and Lynn lock eyes. 
           Long time. 

                                 LYNN
                        Motherfucker.

           Willie jumps up, quotes a Bukowski poem. Very Sin-like.

                        “Ain’t got no money, but we got 
                        plenty of rain.”

           Cale double-takes. He can hear Sinclaire in him, and it 
           stings. He turns back to Lynn. 

                                 CALE
                        You look good.

                                 LYNN
                        You look like a friggin hillbilly. 

                                 CALE
                        Thanks for calling.

           Lynn nods. Of course.

           EXT/INT. THE LINX CLUB -- DAYS LATER

           Willie, suit and tie, sits beside Tamsin in a stuffy 
           uptown members club off Park. Dress code, butlers, 
           backgammon tables. Place reeks of power. A laptop sits in 
           front of them. Willie’s nervous, but hides it well.

                                 TAMSIN
                        How are you so calm? I think I 
                        peed myself.

           Willie smiles, pats her on the leg compassionately.

                                 WILLIE
                        That’s gross.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Ass.
                              (looking up)
                        Here they are.

           Tamsin quickly rises as four YUPPIES (30’s) from the club 
           saunter in. Willie jumps up and puts on his game face. 
           The smug leader of the group, TOPPER, extends a hand.

                                 TOPPER
                        The free bottle buys you a half-
                        hour. I’m prepared to be wowed. 

           Willie hands out NDA’s to each of them, waits as they 
           take their seats.

                                 WILLIE
                        I appreciate you taking the time.

                        You have Tam to thank for that. 
                        She and I go way back. Senior 
                        formal. We had a time, didn’t we?

                        I was still in my cutting phase so 
                        it’s a bit of a blur.

           The other yuppies chuckle lightly.

                                 TOPPER
                        All right. I got a meeting at two. 
                        What you got?

           LATER

           Empty coffee cups and small plates litter the table, as 
           the men page through the prospectus.

                        It’s a solid plan, but any Hunter 
                        grad with an MBA can build a deck. 
                        What’s your vision? Why would we 
                        want to work with you?

                                 WILLIE
                        Because I know the history. Oscar 
                        Hammerstein owned almost all of 
                        forty-second street at the turn of 
                        the twentieth century. He even 
                        named it Times Square.  

           Topper stops him there.

                                 TOPPER
                        This isn’t Jeopardy, Willie. I 
                        couldn’t learn to care about Oscar 
                        Hammerstein.

                        And your future tenants will know

                        Way I see it, the most valuable 
                        property in the United States of 
                        America is about to go on the 
                        market. The question isn’t do you 
                        have enough money to buy it - 
                        there are plenty of grandiose 
                        shits with big pockets - the 
                        question is, do you know what to 
                        do once you have it.

           They’re listening to him now.

                                 TOPPER
                        And your boss - he won’t consider 
                        selling outright?

                                 WILLIE
                        The point is we add value here. We 
                        know the alliance, the store 
                        owners, the tenants. On your own 
                        you’re outsiders trying to profit 
                        and those guys will see your Gucci 
                        loafered-ass before you even get 
                        into the cab. As much as it might 
                        sting, you need us. 

                                 TOPPER
                        You talk a big game, Willie.

                                 WILLIE
                        Yeah, well, there are some things 
                        a Hunter MBA buys that a Harvard 
                        one doesn’t, and that’s friends in 
                        low places. Without us, you got no 
                        shot. 

                                 TOPPER
                        What do you get out of this? Maybe 
                        Sinclaire kicks you some dough, 
                        but you’re working awfully hard 
                        for maybes. 

           Willie stares at Tamsin, considers.

                                 WILLIE
                        Freedom...And a foot in the door.

           Topper’s impressed, though he tries to hide it.

                                 TOPPER
                        You got a pinky-toe for now, 
                        Willie. I’ll think it over.

           The businessmen stand, Willie and Tamsin with them. 
           Handshakes. Topper hugs Tamsin...

                                 TOPPER (CONT’D)
                        You could have done worse, Tam. 
                        I’ll give him that. 

           Topper winks at Willie, as the group departs.

           EXT. GREEK DINER -- AFTERNOON

           Cale, sunglasses and hat, sits in a Greek diner sipping a 
           cup of coffee when Strong, plainclothes, enters.

                                 STRONG
                        You got a game plan for me?

                                 CALE
                        Yeah, fuck off and don’t blow my 
                        cover.

                                 STRONG
                        (pissed) Play uncle with kid. 
                        That’s fine. But if you freelance 
                        for a heartbeat, you better 
                        fuckin’ loop me in.

                                 CALE
                        Just to be clear: when I said, 
                        “fuck off,” I intended that to be 
                        the end of our conversation.

           With that, Cale throws some money on the table. Strong 
           watches him exit. We notice the familiar sight of the 
           Sacred Heart Church across the street.

                                 STRONG
                        (shaking his head) Dirtbag. 

           INT. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

           Willie enters to find Sinclaire in discussion with a 
           nervous businessman BERNARD (40’s, balding). The man 
           stands, pleading with Sinclaire. 

           WHAM! Sinclaire smacks him. HARD.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 SINCLAIRE 
                        As I recall, you’d used the word 
                        “fool-proof” in your little piss-
                        ant sales pitch, and now, Bernard, 
                        I have stooges tying laces around 
                        the coins and pulling them out 
                        after every cunting show!

           Sinclaire pulls a blade from his back pocket, places it 
           on Bernard’s butt.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        I should just stick this up your 
                        ass right now...

           Willie’s seen enough. He places a calming hand on 
           Sinclaire’s, lowers the blade. 

                                 WILLIE
                        What Sin’s saying, Bernard, is 
                        it’s on you to get those machines 
                        fixed. Twenty-five for the next 
                        four weeks seem fair?

           Bernard nods. Willie throws his arm over him.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’ll get him outta here. 

           Willie lightly shoves Bernard out of the office and 
           follows him out, as Sinclaire mumbles to himself...

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (worked up) Who has time for 
                        incompetent twats? It’s the 
                        nineties!

           EXT. HALLWAY. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Away from Sinclaire, Willie changes his tone. Comforting, 
           compassionate.

                                 WILLIE
                        Get yourself cleaned up.

           He hands Bernard a roll of bills.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Let me know if you want me to take 
                        a look at those machines, ‘kay? I 
                        know some wizards in Flushing.

           Bernard nods appreciatively.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BERNARD
                        It’s just a glitch, Willie. I--

                                 WILLIE
                        Shhh. Just don’t even think of 
                        being late on the payments.

           Willie pats Bernard on the shoulder, returns to 
           Sinclaire’s office.

           INT. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Sinclaire faces the one-way mirror, watches the usual 
           show.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I heard the Irish Setter paid you 
                        a visit at the club. 

                                 WILLIE
                        (nods) In town for Adeline.

           Sinclaire pauses, arches an eyebrow. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Didn’t think that rated a mention? 
                        The man did try to penetrate my 
                        ass.

                                 WILLIE
                        I was planning to before you 
                        played tetherball with Bernard’s 
                        skull. 

           Sinclaire chortles.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Cale Ryan. His mother was a good 
                        woman, but he inherited some kind 
                        of rare shitbird gene from his 
                        father.

                                 WILLIE
                        You should see him now. The
                        man’s been living in New Paltz 
                        brown-bagging tallboys on a 
                        Walmart stoop. He’s not here to 
                        stir shit. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I should sure as hell hope not. He 
                        should be kissing my fucking ring 
                        before he steps foot in this town.

                        I’m doing the kneeling for him.

           Sinclaire mulls it over. Then nods. He’s made a decision.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Consider it a favor to you. But 
                        the moment the old lady’s in the 
                        ground, I expect that worm on a 
                        Greyhound.   

           Sinclaire is not playing around.

                                 WILLIE
                        He will be.

           Sinclaire scoops a bunch of jellybeans, plops down in his 
           chair.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s more.

           Sinclaire waits to hear.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Those developers. (excited) It’s 
                        real. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Have I not made it clear I’d 
                        rather watch Skinny Lou sport fuck 
                        than sell my land? 

                                 WILLIE
                        That’s the beauty of it. This 
                        would be a full-on partnership. We 
                        retain control and get paid. Win 
                        fucking win.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Eh. Partnership’s a word MBA sluts 
                        use to make take-overs sound like 
                        summer camp.

                                 WILLIE
                        Maybe. Or maybe we actually have 
                        something these guys want. What we 
                        own - it’s about to be the most 
                        desired property in all of 
                        America. Every investor coast-to-
                        coast’s going to be buying us the 
                        filet at Luger’s.

           Sinclaire scoops another handful of jellybeans into his

                        You know what stood out to me the 
                        first night I saw you ripping off 
                        those paddy shmucks? Your 
                        ambition, William. It’s as rare a 
                        thing in this world as beauty and 
                        as hard to fake. 
                              (BEAT)
                        But like beauty, it can attract 
                        some undesirable suitors. (BEAT) 
                        I’ll take the meeting, but I’m not 
                        promising anything.

           Sinclaire shows Willie to the door. 

           Alone, Sinclaire slinks back to his desk and picks up the 
           phone...

           INT. BASEMENT. SACRED HEART -- MOMENTS LATER

           Skinny Lou is on the phone with Sinclaire, still firmly 
           in the shit. Behind him Maria is ushering WORKING GIRLS--
           illegals--down the hall into various rooms: how they pay 
           off their trip to the states. 

                                 SKINNY LOU
                        Cale Ryan? Shit, I thought that 
                        mook was croaked.

           INTERCUT with Sinclaire, on the phone:

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        If the blue weren’t up my ass, the 
                        man wouldn’t last an afternoon in 
                        this city. (BEAT) Keep him close, 
                        Lou.

           We PULL OUT of the church window...

           *POV from outside. Skinny Lou peers down at a date book 
           through the church window. Pacing.

           A lens closes on him - someone taking photos. ON Cale, 
           behind a dumpster, photographing Lou in the window the 
           church. 

           The tail following the tail.

           BACK ON Lou, who hangs up and walks outside. There are 
           three banker-looking types waiting in the alley. Johns. 
           Lou impatiently ushers them inside. 

           Cale keeps taking photos. Smirks to himself.

                                 CALE
                        A scumbag don’t know how to

           *The Manhattan’s Boy From New York City pumps in...

           Willie and Cale are being escorted to their seats by a 
           burly LATINO man. The man stops three rows up from the 
           court. Cale’s impressed.

                                 WILLIE
                        Thanks, Rene.

           Willie and Cale pop down as the action between the Knicks 
           and Suns heats up. Barkley and Ewing going at it. 

                                 CALE
                        Jesus. I can see Ewing’s third 
                        foot from here. What’s the hook-
                        up? 

                                 WILLIE
                        I helped get Rene’s wife over from

                        (grins) You haven’t changed.

           Willie raises a beer.

                                 WILLIE
                        Just happy we finally got in a 
                        game.

           They knock beers.
           --EXT. STREET -- EARLY EVENING

           Sinclaire shuffles his way through the neighborhood. 
           Locals call to him, nod. In the courtyard of a Catholic 
           school CHILDREN are playing in Giants and Jets jerseys--a 
           gift from Sinclaire. When they see Sinclaire, they run 
           over, screaming with delight.

           --INT. SUBWAY

           Willie and Cale chat as a 6 train jerks its way uptown.

                        He’s nice, Dad. Hasn’t even tried 
                        to finger me yet.

           Cale frowns.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You know Sin, come on. He’s been 
                        good to me. He’s stubborn as shit, 
                        but he’s coming around.

                                 CALE
                        Shit has a way of leaving a trail,

                        security guard? I keep forgetting.

           Cale puts Willie in a playful headlock. 

           EXT. 11TH AVENUE -- EVENING

           BOOTLEG KENNY stands in a fur coat on 11th Avenue by the 
           mouth of the tunnel, watching three of his linebacker-
           sized, cross-dressing HOES holler at passing cars. He 
           sucks on his trademark Blow-Pop.

           Manny rounds the corner. Bootleg grins at him.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Beautiful boy, what’s the noise? 

           Manny can’t help but grin at the delightful character 
           that is Bootleg.

                                 MANNY
                        No more Port Authority?

                        Not tonight. Jersey boys love a 
                        thick nigga in a dress. Gotta

                        Pockets light?

                        got cousins living beneath the 
                        subway, baby. Check this shit--

           He lifts a foot showing off a cowboy boot.

                        get you a pair. Have you fucking a 
                        bitch and kicking her to the curb 
                        with the same toe, baby. 

           Bootleg pulls out a roll, hands it over. Manny counts, 
           hands the money back. An offering.

                                 MANNY
                        Sin doesn’t like loose tongues so 
                        consider this payment for some 
                        temporary memory loss. I know you 
                        think you might’ve seen something 
                        newsworthy on the subway.

           Bootleg gets it.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Shit I know the code and wrote the 
                        scripture. ‘Mine eyes only seen, 
                        the glory of the green,’ baby.

           Bootleg salutes as Manny starts down the street.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- DAYS LATER

           Establishing shot of the neighborhood. The pomp of the 
           holiday season is now in full effect. A light snow 
           shower. Bundled-up TOURISTS herding toward Rockefeller 
           Center. Christmas is around the corner. 

           INT. WILLIE’S OFFICE. SIN -- EVENING

           Willie’s in his office going over paperwork with 
           Sinclaire. Willie walks to a window, overlooking the bar 
           below with a glint in his eye. 

           Willie’s POV: The bar is empty at this early hour except 
           for Cale who slides onto a bar stool. Willie smiles to 
           himself. Like old times.

           Sinclaire holds out a few forms for William. As he does, 
           his eye catches a postcard from New Paltz on Willie’s 
           desk. A hint of jealousy.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I need your signature on these.

           Willie gives him a look...

                        Don’t look at me like that. I’m

           BAR

           Cale’s alone, not a soul around.

           A MOMENT before Lynn comes out from the back.

                        Honor code.

           Cale nods, taking in his surroundings. A whole different 
           world from what he remembers.

           Lynn returns, slides on a stool beside him. They stare at 
           each other. Hard. Until Lynn finally frowns.

                                 CALE
                        You look good, you know.

                        any new material?

           Cale pours himself another.

           Cale nips at his glass. Decides to tell the truth.

           Cale glares at Sinclaire and Willie coming down the 
           stairs. Sinclaire and Cale lock eyes. The two surrogates 
           sizing each other up after all these years. Sinclaire 
           signals for Willie to give him a minute and starts over. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Well, well. The rumors are true.

                        (toying with him) Is it, really?

           A moment of tension. Cale thinks about it, speaks 
           plainly.

                                 CALE
                        No. Not really.

           Sinclaire lets the tension linger, then laughs in a 
           controlled way. Menacing.

           Cale meets Sinclaire’s angry gaze. Fiery look in Cale’s

                        five and she’s been drawing Vice 
                        with the new routine.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Ah, Ling. Only two months removed 
                        from firing ping pong balls from 
                        her twat in a Patpong brothel. 
                        Another success story.

           Sinclaire begins to leave, then quickly hisses to Cale.

                        As soon as your mother passes to 
                        the other side, I expect us all to 
                        relish the pleasure of your 
                        absence. I trust you won’t be 
                        needing a reminder. 

           Sinclaire tips his invisible cap and heads off, Willie 
           behind him, giving Cale a look. Cale’s eyes remain locked 
           on Sinclaire.

                                 LYNN
                        Let it go. No need starting a 
                        fight you can’t win.

           Cale shuts it off, grabs for her hand.

                                 CALE
                        How about I start some shit with 
                        you?

                                 LYNN
                        Is that your new material? Mother-

                        I remember you throwing up on my 
                        back.

                                 CALE
                        It was the eighties. We were all 
                        into some weird shit.

           Lynn laughs, then considers.

                                 LYNN
                        Your dick even work?

           INT. LYNN’S APARTMENT -- LATER

           Cale, pants still hooked around his ankles, grunts a 
           final time as he collapses on top of Lynn, her blouse 
           ripped. They barely made it to the bed...

           They pant heavily. Cale kisses her on the forehead.

                        this another shot?

           Lynn raises her eyebrows.

                                 LYNN
                        This was pity. Don’t misinterpret.

           They both bust out laughing. 

           PULL OUT of the apartment and down to the street where...

           EXT/INT. SKINNY LOU’S CAMRY -- CONTINUOUS

           Skinny Lou sits in his car peering up at Lynn’s 
           apartment. Tailing Cale...

           INT. RESTAURANT. NOLITA -- AFTERNOON

           Tamsin sits alone, reading a Village Voice. Willie enters 
           the restaurant, concern on his face. She stands up to hug 
           him, tears in her eyes.

                                 WILLIE
                        I got your message. What’s going 
                        on?

           Tamsin sits down, wipes away tears.

                                 TAMSIN
                        It’s Topper, Willie. He won’t do 
                        it...He says you’re beneath him.

                                 WILLIE
                        What the fuck!? Why?

           The anger is flush on Willie’s face.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        That motherfucking cocksucker...

           Just then, a huge smile appears on her face...

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is so funny?

           Tamsin can’t keep a straight face.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Are you messing with me?

           She cackles...

                        He’s in! He wants to sit down with 
                        Sin and make a formal offer.

                                 WILLIE
                        You little bastard! I literally 
                        thought my life was over.

           He runs around the table picks her up. She tries to dodge 
           him, laughing. They embrace, kiss. 

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe this. We did it. 
                        We fucking did it.

                                 TAMSIN
                        You did.

           INT. DIAMONDS BURLESK -- EVENING

           Sinclaire sits with two PERFORMERS at the bar. Mid-grade 
           pornstars. They fawn over Sinclaire. On his right 
           shoulder is draped a former PERFORMER, JUSTINE (26, 
           feathery blonde hair, put together). Sinclaire loves the 
           attention. A true daddy-o. 

           Sinclaire sings Cheek to Cheek by Fred Astaire...

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I’m in heaven...

           The girls chime in...

                                 SINCLAIRE/PERFORMERS
                        I’m in heaven...and my heart beats 
                        so that I can barely speak...

           He smiles. Affectionate. Almost baby talk.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (to the current performers) Never 
                        forget there’s a life beyond the 
                        pole, my sirens. Look at Justine 
                        here - the most delectable 
                        beautician in all of Jackson 
                        Heights.

                                 JUSTINE
                        (grateful) Couldn’t a done it 
                        without you, Sin baby. Eight grand 
                        was a dream number till you became 
                        my sunshine daddy-o.

           Willie enters.

           The pornstars murmur hello to Willie, make their exit.

                                 WILLIE
                        It’s time, Sin. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        For what?

                                 WILLIE
                        The future. 

           Willie leads him to a back table where Tamsin and Topper 
           sit. They speak quietly as they approach...

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Now, I know you said be patient, 
                        but these guys are coming to the 
                        table with something real.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You’re springing this on me now, 
                        William? Men who relish control 
                        avoid surprise.

                                 WILLIE
                        You kept putting it off, Sin. What 
                        other move did I have? 

           Willie claps him on the back, leads him to the table...

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Topper Stewart, my boss, Sinclaire 
                        Rubix.

           Topper extends a hand, which Sinclaire accepts 
           tentatively. Tamsin offers a less than enthusiastic 
           hello.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Hi, Sinclaire.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I should have known little Brooke 
                        Astor would be here.

           He does little to hide his distaste.

           LATER

           Willie, Sinclaire, Tamsin, and Topper sit at the booth. 
           Topper addresses Sinclaire.

                                 TOPPER
                        Mr. Rubix, when Willie came to me 
                        I certainly had my doubts. Of 
                        course, you’re in possession of 
                        some very attractive property. 
                        That said, I have some concerns 
                        about a working relationship. 
                        Willie’s done a good job helping 
                        me come around. Most of the way.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You talk like you’re already my 
                        boss. Is that what they teach in 
                        business school? Presumption? If 
                        so, I’m sure your father’s pig-in-
                        shit pleased with his investment.

           A conversational slap in the face. Topper clenches up.

           Willie jumps in, desperate to save the meeting.

                                 WILLIE
                        I think I can speak to Topper’s 
                        openness and willingness to make 
                        this work...for all of us.

                                 TOPPER
                        What Willie’s outlined is a mix of 
                        commercial and moderately priced 
                        housing along forty-second street. 
                        I won’t lie and say that if you 
                        were willing to go completely 
                        commercial there would be more 
                        money to be made here, but I 
                        recognize your needs to take care 
                        of the community. Frankly, that’s 
                        what attracts me to you both as 
                        business partners. Willie says we 
                        need you. I actually believe the 
                        guy is right.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Did William mention that our fair 
                        mayor is trying to graft his thumb 
                        to the inside of my rectum?

           Topper’s taken aback by Sinclaire’s tone.

                                 TOPPER
                        I believe that’s why we’re all 
                        here, Sinclaire. I read the 
                        papers.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (proud) Perhaps my young associate 
                        failed to mention that I am an 
                        institution in this neighborhood. 
                        That people count on me.

                                 WILLIE
                        I think we all recognize what 
                        you’ve done, Sin, but we’ve got to 
                        get ahead of the curve here.

           Sinclaire flinches.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Gentlemen. Lady Bracknell. I 
                        appreciate your interest, but the 
                        timing isn’t right. Goodbye.

           Sinclaire stands up and leaves. 

                                 TOPPER
                        What the hell was that?

           Willie tries to play it cool.

                                 WILLIE
                        I’ll speak to him. I think he’s 
                        just overwhelmed.

                                 TOPPER
                        I’ll give you time, Willie, but 
                        not much. 

           Willie jumps up and follows Sinclaire towards his office.

                                 WILLIE
                        Sin, Sin!

           Sinclaire stops at his office door. We finally see Willie 
           snap...

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck was that? These guys 
                        are as real as it gets.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Real? (snickers) That wing-tip 
                        shit goes cradle to grave without 
                        ever touching something real. 
                        Excuse me.

           William puts his hand on Sinclaire’s chest. Sinclaire 
           takes visible issue with the hand.

                        at the club) This isn’t going to 
                        last. Can’t you fucking see that? 
                        The Pussycat, World, Circus, 
                        Peepland. All gone. We’re 
                        dinosaurs, Sin, and there isn’t a 
                        play in the world that’s gonna 
                        save us from the meteor headed our 
                        way.

           Sinclaire eyes him coldly.

                        This Mayor’s not the first suit to 
                        dream of cleaning the Deuce. They 
                        say they want it all gone, these 
                        cops, but they don’t have the 
                        fucking stomach for it. Like your 
                        do-gooder buddy, Cale. You think a 
                        cop knows what to do with a strung-
                        out stripper who just got knocked 
                        up by her pimp schmuck boyfriend? 
                        You think a cop wants some fifteen-
                        year-old whore crying on his 
                        shoulder cause daddy touched her 
                        wrinkle? You know what cops do? 
                        They shove these girls into foster 
                        care, social services, places you 
                        and I came from, and what does it 
                        do for them? Nothing, William. 
                        Worse than nothing. Me? I give 
                        them work, I give them purpose. I 
                        find a place for these bruised 
                        little dolls in a world that 
                        couldn’t generate a single shit 
                        about them. Don’t you see? I’m not 
                        a business man, William. I am a 
                        fucking economy. Don’t forget it.

                                 WILLIE
                        This time it’s different, Sin. 
                        Tell me you can see that.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I know you’ve got your finger in 
                        some uptown snatch, but that 
                        doesn’t change where you came 
                        from. Remember who got you here.

           Sinclaire departs, leaving William furious. Willie turns 
           back towards the table where he locks eyes with Tamsin. 
           Shame on his face. Pity on hers.

           Sinclaire storms into...

           INT. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           He paces angrily, looking at the stage through the one-
           way mirror. A dancer is performing a burlesque routine in 
           which every curve of anatomy is wrapped like a christmas 
           gift. She opens each gift, slowly, revealing more skin. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                              (yelling to himself)
                        Can someone tell me why this new 
                        doll refuses to show snatch until 
                        the fifth song? It’s Christmas for 
                        Christ’s sake!

           He slams his first, clearly worked up.

           INT/EXT. SMITH’S BAR AND GRILL -- DAYS LATER

           Cale and Willie are throwing back eggs and bacon at the 
           Hell’s Kitchen establishment. One of the few places left 
           to grab  a stiff drink at 8 AM.  

                                 WILLIE
                        I’m trying to stuff money in his 
                        pocket. He’s so wrapped up in the 
                        old game he can’t fucking see it.

           Cale plays it cool.

                                 CALE
                        You know Sin, Willie. He likes 
                        power. He wants to feel that 
                        command. Being some property owner 
                        ain’t enough for him.

           Cale pushes, just a bit.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        He’ll burn down the Square if he 
                        has to. You worried you might get 
                        caught in the fire?

           Willie cools down, self-conscious about discussing 
           Sinclaire in mixed company.

                                 WILLIE
                        Whatever. 

           Cale and Willie drop some dollars on the table, nod at 
           the grizzled bartenders. Relics.

                                                          (CONTINUED)

                        I gotta hit the head. Meet you 
                        outside.

           ON Willie as he walks outside, Bootleg Kenny appears from 
           the around alley.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Little Willie...

           Willie turns, surprised to see him. Goes over. 

                                 BOOTLEG (CONT'D)
                        Ain’t seen you in a minute-rice, 
                        man.

           Bootleg hands him a roll, which Willie refuses. 

                                 WILLIE
                        What the hell you doing?

           ON Cale exiting the bar and spotting Willie. He walks 
           over and spies from a distance with interest.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t fucking collect, you know 
                        that. 

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Shiiit. Y’all came looking for me. 
                        I’m doing my part.

                                 WILLIE
                        Who came looking?

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Manny, but he ain’t nowhere at the 
                        moment.

                                 WILLIE
                        Then wait for him. I don’t deal 
                        with this shit.

           Bootleg sighs, moves on.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Got up early, too. Think a nigga 
                        like me don’t need beauty sleep? 

           Willie walks back. Casually, Cale joins, as they walk 
           down 8th Avenue.

                                 CALE
                        Tell me that wasn’t Bootleg?

                              (BEAT)
                        Thought you weren’t doing that 
                        type of work anymore.

                                 WILLIE
                        I’m not.

           Cale nods, not buying it.

                                 CALE 
                        You should take that girl and get 
                        outta here, Willie. Hell, come 
                        stay with me. Been asking you damn 
                        near ten years.

           Willie brushes him off.

                                 WILLIE
                        We missed our window, aright.

                                 CALE
                        I’m serious, Willie. If Sin’s not 
                        giving you a shot, then maybe it’s 
                        time to move on.

           Willie quotes Arthur Miller.

                                 WILLIE
                        “The man’s not an orange,” Cale.

                                 CALE
                        What the fuck’s that even mean? 
                        Jesus, you even sound like him 
                        now.

                                 WILLIE
                        It means I’m not in the habit of 
                        disappearing, okay?

           That stings. 

                                 CALE
                        Don’t forget why I did. So you 
                        could have a real future, kid, not 
                        play the slick little gangster.

           Willie looks at him. Fuming.

                        I wouldn’t push it, aright?! 

           Cale stands down. Heat in his eyes...

                                 CALE
                        Fair enough.

           EXT. ALLEY. SACRED HEART -- MIDNIGHT

           Cale sits in the driver seat of a sedan, scoping the 
           church through binoculars. Not much doing. Skinny Lou 
           opens a back door, takes out a heaping bag of trash. Goes 
           back inside.

           A dull moment. Then the faint blare of a siren. Just 
           then, four cop cars screech to a halt in front of the 
           church. Strong, vested-up and raid-ready, emerges from 
           one of them. Six rooks quickly follow.

           Cale can’t believe it: Strong is raiding the church. 
           Blowing his investigation.

                                 CALE
                        (furious) You dumb fuck...

           Through the binoculars, we see Strong march into the 
           church, followed by his eager soldiers. Cale punches the 
           steering wheel. Infuriated.

           INT. SACRED HEART OF JESUS AND MARY -- CONTINUOUS

           COPS direct weeping NUNS to lie face down on the floor. 
           Strong directs the rest of the team.

                                 STRONG
                        Hit the basement.

           Skinny Lou walks out to object, but Strong immediately 
           SLAMS him against the wall. 

                                 STRONG (CONT’D)
                        You been running pros? Illegals?

                               up!

           Skinny Lou drops to the ground. One of the cops appear in 
           the hallway...

                                 COP
                        Clean downstairs.

                        Perhaps you’ll leave a donation 
                        for our trouble.

           Strong grabs him by the clerical collar raises him to eye 
           level. His anger is overwhelming, but he has no words. 
           Skinny Lou grins through the pain. Strong tosses him back 
           down and walks out. Failure.

           EXT. MASSAGE PARLOR -- NEXT MORNING

           Cale stealthily slides into a midtown massage parlor.

           ANGLE ON LOU in his Camry, watching his every move.

           INT. MASSAGE PARLOR

           Cale is led to a back room by a slinky EUROPEAN GIRL in a 
           nightgown. Jordan and Strong are waiting for him. The 
           girl quickly departs.

           Cale goes right at Strong, pushing him against the wall. 

                                 CALE
                        You meathead fuck! 

           Strong shoves him back, but Jordan quickly separates 
           them.

                                 JORDAN

                        You were brought here to bring 
                        leads. I’ll decide what we move

                        need is you two to fuck. Remember, 
                        Cale: Sin killed cops! My fucking 
                        people! We’re not the enemy here.

           Cale’s not having it.

                                 CALE
                        Police work might get somewhere if 
                        there weren’t so many police to 
                        fuck it up.

           He storms off...

                                 STRONG
                        Guy’s a cowboy complaining about 
                        us going rogue. Fuck him...

           Jordan sighs. Strong stares off. He’s done waiting...

           EXT. BACK ALLEY - POLICE PRECINCT

           Cale sneaks into the building through the back door - 
           cautious as always to evade notice. He knocks twice on a 
           locked metal door, and it opens to... 

           INT. POLICE HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           HOWIE FLAHERTY, 60 veteran cop, pot-belly, old pal of 
           Cale holds the door. Doing a favor.

                                 CALE
                        Thanks again, Howie.

           Howie waves it off. It’s nothing.

                                 HOWIE
                        Deuce without Cale Ryan’s like a 
                        Carnegie Deli without corned beef 
                        for fuck’s sake.

           Howie hands him keys to the file locker. Cale slaps his 
           arm appreciatively.

           INT. HALLWAY. SINCLAIRE’S OFFICE -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Bernard, his shoulder in a sling, his face bandaged--the 
           victim of a brutal beating--walks down the hallway 
           towards Willie. He holds a manila envelope under his arm. 

                                 WILLIE
                        Jesus, Bernard. What the fuck 
                        happened to you?

           Sinclaire pokes his head out before Bernard can respond. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Two weeks in a row. You’ve 
                        restored my faith, Bernard.

           Willie and Sinclaire lock eyes as the door slams shut. 
           Willie’s shaken, angered. 

           INT. POLICE RECORDS ROOM -- TWO HOURS LATER

           Cale sits amid a lake of opened files and papers, poring 
           over old arrest records now that the Lou lead has gone 
           cold. Murder. Prostitution. Rubs his eyes. Exhausted. 
           Then he comes across a file: DAVID MACDOUGAL.

           Curiosity trumps trepidation: Cale grabs the file on his 
           old partner. Opens it, begins reading. He sees 
           MacDougal’s face. Emotion in his eyes. Then shock.  

           His eyes zoom to key phrases: DIED FROM BULLET 
           WOUND...EXECUTION STYLE...45 SLUG...

           Cale grabs his jacket, leaps out of the chair.
           INT. SIN -- LATER

           Cale BURSTS through the door, almost identical to his 
           entrance years before. Lynn’s behind the bar, stacking 
           receipts. 

                                 CALE
                        Where’s the kid?

                                 LYNN
                        In the back. You aright?

           Cale bee-lines to the back alley...

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        Cale, what the hell is going on? 

           Cale FLINGS open the alley door, Willie stands talking to 
           a BUSBOY. Willie takes one look at him and knows it’s 
           serious.

                                 WILLIE
                              (to busboy)
                        Give us a few minutes, aright?

           The busboy disappears inside.

                                 CALE
                        Did you know? 

                                 WILLIE
                        Nice to see you, too.

                                 CALE
                        Did you know?!

                                 WILLIE
                        What the fuck you talkin’ about?

                                 CALE
                        MacDougal! What happened?!

                                 WILLIE
                              (sighs)
                        Jesus, Cale. You were there, 
                        remember?

           Cale grabs Willie by the collar, violently pushes him 
           against the wall.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is wrong with you!

                        Don’t bullshit me. Did you know 
                        they shot him?

           Willie just looks at him...he knew.

           SMASH FLASHBACK INSERT: ALLEY. 1980. New Year’s Eve

           Willie and Sinclaire stand over the body. Lynn watches 
           from the doorway, tears in her eyes.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                              (speaking to the 
                               body)
                        I know that I shall meet my fate
                        Somewhere among the clouds above;
                        Those that I fight I do not hate,
                        Those that I guard I do not love.

           Sinclaire looks up at Willie then at Lynn. 

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Cale wouldn’t dare return... 

           Sinclaire locks eyes with Willie...then turns to Manny.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Make it go away.

           Sinclaire puts his arm around Lynn. They shuffle inside.

           A BEAT as Willie and Manny stand over the body.

                                 MANNY
                        Grab his feet.

           Willie, teary-eyed, grabs both legs, Manny the arms. 

           INT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING -- 1980. New Year’s Eve

           Manny tosses MacDougal’s body to the floor of the empty 
           shooting gallery in the Bronx. Just then, MacDougal 
           gurgles and moans. ALIVE!

           They both startle. Manny giggles.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Sounds like bong water.

                                 WILLIE
                        (terrified) Maybe he’ll be okay.

           Manny shakes his head.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 MANNY
                        It’s way too late for okay, kid. 
                        We’re in the graveyard.

           Manny pulls out a .45.

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Do him a favor.

           Manny sticks the gun in Willie’s hand and walks him right 
           up to MacDougal. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        This is the way it works, kid. One 
                        for you, one for us. 

           Manny guides Willie’s hand until the gun is inches from 
           MacDougal’s forehead. Tears pour down Willie’s face. 

                                 MANNY (CONT’D)
                        Steady.

           Willie’s hand SHAKES violently. Manny steps behind him, 
           places his hand over Willie’s...

           MacDougal’s eyes flash open! Creepy. They lock on Willie. 
           Willie freezes, then quickly pulls...BANG! 

           A hum of cheers can be heard from outside, the pop of 
           fireworks. Manny glances at his watch. Happy New Year. 

                                                        JUMP BACK TO:

           ALLEY -- PRESENT

           Cale is speechless. Willie can barely look at him.

                                 CALE
                        (shaking his head) All these 
                        goddamn years I’ve been living in 
                        the sticks covering for you. Why 
                        didn’t you tell me?

                                 WILLIE
                        I was eleven years old burying a 
                        fucking body, Cale. I was just 
                        trying to move past it.

                                 CALE
                        You were just a fucking juvi, 
                        Willie. We could have put that 
                        body on them. Christ! We could 
                        have had our lives back.

                                 WILLIE
                        Bullshit! You couldn’t come back -- 
                        it didn’t change shit with Sin. 
                        You were a target no matter what.

                                 CALE
                        Truth’s good to know, Willie. Even 
                        if you can’t do shit about it.

           Sinclaire’s voice can be heard from inside the club. 
           Willie pushes Cale off him, straightens his shirt. Upset, 
           angry.

                                 WILLIE
                        Now are we done with the fucking 
                        therapy session? Maybe Sin was 
                        right - maybe this town is better 
                        off without you riding in and 
                        dusting up old melancholy 
                        bullshit.

           Willie walks back inside the club, passing Lynn who’s 
           been eavesdropping the whole time. SHOCK on her face.

           EXT. STREET -- MORNING

           It’s still early as Willie heads out from his apartment. 
           The square is scarce, save for a few homeless starting 
           their day. Willie walks up to a coffee shop, its grate 
           down. He bangs on the shop door to no avail...

                                 WILLIE
                        Simon!

                                 HOMELESS MAN (O.C.)
                        Mister Perna couldn’t afford them 
                        new rents. Man been here thirty-
                        seven years. 

           In a doorway a HOMELESS MAN with long stringy white hair 
           gathers his things. He mumbles to Willie...

                                 HOMELESS MAN (CONT’D)
                        They say we all goin’ be gone by 
                        the time the mayor done.  

                                 WILLIE
                        This place has a way of changing 
                        on you. Like people, I guess.

           It’s a loaded comment.

                        say. You show me a good war, son.

           The homeless man grabs his things and moves on.

           EXT. STREET. CHRISTMAS EVE -- MORNING

           The commuter rush from the Lincoln tunnel jams the 
           streets. Willie and Tamsin stand before a coffee vendor. 
           A Unicef Santa rings his bell as people pass by. 

           The VENDOR hands over the two coffees, and they begin to 
           walk. 

           Tamsin rubs Willie’s back...

                                 TAMSIN
                        You’re awful quiet this morning.

                                 WILLIE
                        Just in my own head, you know.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Has Sin apologized yet? I cannot 
                        believe he behaved like that. You 
                        ever think he might just be 
                        stringing you along?

           Willie stares at her dead-on. Serious.

                                 WILLIE
                        On my eighteenth birthday Sin put 
                        each of these properties in my 
                        name. He handed me the keys, Tam, 
                        but his lawyers still have to sign 
                        off on any move I make. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        Damned if you stay, damned if you 
                        don’t.

                                 WILLIE
                        (nods) There are always options. 
                        Sin taught me that. (BEAT) He also 
                        taught me it’s better to have them 
                        than to need them.

                                 TAMSIN
                              (smiles)
                        Well, you’ve got plenty.

           The infamous Fascination Arcade on 8th Avenue.

                                 TAMSIN
                        An arcade. This is your surprise?
                        How original: a twenty-six year 
                        old who’s into video games.

           SERIES OF SHOTS WITHIN ARCADE:

           - Tamsin is making a pinball machine blow up like slots. 
           Willie watches with envy. The arcade is half full of 
           GHETTO KIDS, NERDS, napping BUMS. 

           - Willie sits in an arcade racing car. The monitor shows 
           he’s lost. Tamsin casually walks past him...stops...bends 
           down to tie her shoes and flashes a confident wink. 
           Willie can only laugh at her posturing.

           - Tamsin holds a rifle and with surprising skill takes 
           out deer after deer in BUCKHUNT. She passes the rifle to 
           Willie who proceeds to aim it at his own head and pull 
           the trigger. Tamsin playfully pushes him. 

           EXT. ARCADE -- LATER

           Tamsin rushes out, a huge grin on her face. Willie 
           follows, defeated.

                                 WILLIE
                        You probably had a game room as a 
                        child. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        Nope, just gifted. (checks her 
                        watch) I have to catch the 3:10. 
                        The old man would never forgive me 
                        if I missed pre-church cocktails. 

                                 WILLIE
                        I love it when you get all 
                        Cheever.

           She laughs and kisses him.

           The Pogues’ Fairly Tale New York City chimes in...

           CHRISTMAS MONTAGE:

           -LYNN’S APARTMENT: Cale knocks on the door. It swings 
           open, Lynn behind it wearing a Santa hat and negligee, 
           holding a glass of eggnog. A huge grin on her face. She 
           pulls him inside, plants the Santa hat on his head, and 
           they go at it.

           -BOOTLEG KENNY’S APARTMENT: In a rundown apartment 
           Bootleg Kenny hands out gifts (fake gold chains, etc) to 
           his flock of TRANNIES. They scream with delight. 

           -DIAMOND BURLESK: Sinclaire, dressed as Santa, sings 
           while Manny ladles some egg nogg for the lonely JOHNS 
           who’ve got nowhere else to go. STRIPPERS in reindeer 
           costumes frolic about. Willie watches from the bar. A 
           tradition.

           -SACRED HEART: A group of young neighborhood children 
           perform a Nativity play. Skinny Lou watches from the 
           pulpit, turns his back to key some coke. We PAN to the 
           congregation where Sinclaire, Manny, Maria, Willie and 
           the girls smile in the front row. In the rear of the 
           church, Cale and Lynn hold hands.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. SIN -- EVENING. DAYS LATER

           Willie stands behind the bar. Tamsin sits on a stool, 
           staring at a beautiful gold watch on her wrist. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        It’s too much, Willie.

           Willie peers up, takes notice of someone at the door.

                                 WILLIE
                        You expecting company tonight?

           Tamsin turns around as Topper heads towards them.

           INT. SKIN WORLD -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Manny leans on the counter. He pages through a personal 
           photo album, larded with Polaroids of himself and the 
           many pornstars he’s come to know. 

           The door buckles open. Who else but Strong. Manny hardly 
           looks up. Strong pulls out his badge and puts it in front 
           of the album. Manny grins, slides the badge aside, 
           continues paging. 

           Manny pulls out a polaroid of a beautiful porn queen. 

           CU: she’s nude on his shoulders, circa 1987. Manny holds 
           it up to Strong, smiling as he reminisces.

                        in the park...sweet kid.

                                 STRONG
                        Where she now?

                                 MANNY
                        Made a couple pictures. Found out 
                        she wasn’t a star.
                              (shrugs)
                        AIDS, maybe. You hope they marry 
                        the customers. Otherwise it ain’t 
                        a happy ending. 

           Strong pulls out a picture of the bartender, Jesse...

                                 STRONG
                        You know him?

                                 MANNY
                        Sure. Kid poured doubles like it 
                        was charity. Found him like a rat 
                        on the S train, way I heard.

           Strong tries to play it off.

                                 STRONG
                        We got wits all over that station, 
                        say he wasn’t solo when he 
                        slipped.

           Manny doesn’t flinch.

                                 MANNY
                        Maybe God was with him?

                                 STRONG
                        (angry) He was one of our people, 
                        you fat fuck. When I string you 
                        up, I hope you remember his face. 

                                 MANNY
                        Anything else? I was in the middle 
                        of an article.

           Strong POUNCES, pure rage. He LEAPS over the counter and 
           grabs the rotary phone. He bashes it against Manny’s 
           skull till he drops to the floor. Strong kicks him in the 
           gut, yelling.

                                 STRONG
                        You think Sin’s gonna take care of

           He tosses the phone on the floor and exits.

           MOMENTS LATER Manny picks himself up, bleeding profusely 
           from his head. He grabs the phone and dials...

           INT. SIN -- LATER

           Willie, Tamsin, and Topper sit in a banquet. No drinks, 
           strictly business.

                                 WILLIE
                        He doesn’t mean any disrespect. 
                        It’s just his style.

                                 TOPPER
                        The man’s stubborn. He built a 
                        legacy and wants to preserve it. I 
                        get that. There will always be 
                        real estate. That’s not why I’m 
                        here.  

           Willie can’t figure out where this is going...

                                 TOPPER (CONT’D)
                        I could use your drive. It 
                        wouldn’t be glamorous but it’s 
                        real. 

           Willie looks at Tamsin - she’s glowing. He’s completely 
           caught off guard.

                                 WILLIE
                        I appreciate the offer, but it’s 
                        not that simple for me. 

                                 TOPPER
                        It never is, Willie. Think on it. 
                              (off Tam)
                        A couple golf lessons and he’ll 
                        have my job.

           Topper kisses Tamsin on the cheek and pops up. 

           EXT. POLICE STATION -- NEXT DAY

           Strong exits the station. He jumps into an unmarked 
           Sedan. Call comes over the line. He picks up.

           As we pull out, we recognize Skinny Lou’s Camry following 
           a few cars behind...

           EXT. PROJECTS -- LOWER EAST SIDE

           Strong parks the sedan in the courtyard of some projects. 

           ON A MAN IN A TRENCHCOAT, Cale, stealthily making his way 
           to the Sedan.

           INT. SEDAN -- CONTINUOUS

           Cale jumps in the backseat, hiding.

                        what you are. I’m bringing you in 
                        because I can’t do this alone.

                        We can’t go after anyone real 
                        after the church shit. We push

                        they’ll button up before we get a 
                        shot.

                        A pimp from back in the day. I saw 
                        the guy try to make a drop to 
                        Willie. We start with a soldier, 
                        he corroborates and the whole 
                        pyramid falls. It’s our only 
                        option.

                        Fitness will still be there the 
                        next day. I’ll pick up the pimp 
                        after the ball drops. You grab 
                        Willie if he hasn’t shown by 
                        morning. I figure by the time word 
                        gets back to Sinclaire we’ll 
                        already have had them in the box 
                        for a while. Might give us the 
                        time we need to break ‘em.

                        cuffs on the kid.

           Strong gets it. Cale pops out of the car, looks back.

           Cale thinks it over.

                                 CALE
                        Hate for it to get too clean. Cops 
                        and crooks can color a city just 
                        the same. 

           With that, he disappears.
           INT. SKINNY LOU’S CAMRY -- MOMENTS LATER

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE. NEW YEAR’S EVE -- EVENING

           Absolute chaos. Mobs of people, balloons, confetti, 
           reporters, police. Willie leads Tamsin by the hand 
           through it all.

                                 TAMSIN
                              (screaming)

                        Just wait.

           They cut down an alley off Broadway, slip through a 
           construction barrier. Willie holds open a basement hatch 
           for her to enter. Tamsin gives a questioning glare.

                                 WILLIE (CONT'D)

           Willie leads Tamsin through the darkness. Rats squeak and 
           scurry. Water drips. When they emerge, they are in a...

           BUILDING LOBBY

           Tamsin brushes herself off, examines her surroundings. 
           They are on the first floor of a skyscraper under 
           construction. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        Should we be here?

           He rushes her to the elevator shaft and escorts her on.

           From below, we watch as it ascends thirty floors to 
           the...

           PENTHOUSE

           Through giant glass windows we see the chaos of Times 
           Square thirty stories below, but this room is silent.

                                 TAMSIN
                        (wow) How did you know about this?

                                 WILLIE
                        As a kid, I was pretty well-
                        schooled in getaways. (BEAT) 
                        C’mon...

           Willie leads her to the end of the abandoned floor and 
           pushes open another door. They climb a small stairwell 
           and emerge onto the...

           ROOF

           The sound of Times Square overtakes the entire scene. 
           It’s a hurricane of noise. They walk to the edge of the 
           roof, standing directly in front of the Times Square Ball 
           drop.

                                 WILLIE
                              (screaming over the 
                               noise)
                        Nice view, right?

           Tamsin is speechless. Willie reaches into a backpack, 
           pulls out a bottle of champagne and pours two glasses. 

           The crowd below begins the countdown...

                                 CHANT
                        Ten, nine...

                                 WILLIE
                        To the Deuce...

                                 TAMSIN
                        To new opportunities...

                                 CHANT
                        Six, five...

                                 WILLIE
                        I love you...

                                 TAMSIN
                        You better...

           They click glasses.

                                 CHANT
                        Two, one...

           EXPLOSION of noise, revelry, chaos below them. Willie 
           drops his glass. It shatters on the roof. He grabs Tamsin 
           by the face and kisses her like it was his last moment on 
           earth. Her glass falls and shatters, joining the jubilant 
           chaos of the square below.

           INT. SIN -- LATER

           Balloons dangle from the ceiling. Music fills the room as 
           FRIENDS and FAMILY dance, drink, smoke grass, and eat. 
           Feels like old times. 

           Cale sits at the bar nursing a drink, quietly chatting 
           with Lynn. She stands with a tray of drinks and WE FOLLOW 
           her to Manny, planted next to Sinclaire at a corner 
           booth, butterfly stitches in his brow. Their eyes trail 
           Willie as he dances closely with Tamsin. ANGLE BACK ON 
           Cale spying on Manny and Sinclaire through the mirror on 
           the bar. Everyone watching everyone.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        In the car? Really?   

                                 MANNY
                        What Lou said. Cop was pushing way 
                        too hard, they must be desperate.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        The definition of Cale Ryan....I 
                        knew it.

           Lynn walks over and drops two drinks on the table.

                                 LYNN
                        Gin and a whiskey.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Where’s my hug?

           Lynn frowns as Sinclaire stands to embrace her.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you, doll. Always been my 
                        best.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           ANGLE ON Willie and Tamsin, dancing playfully alongside 
           Maria and others. Willie’s sneaking looks at Manny and 
           Sinclaire.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Forget him, Willie.

                                 WILLIE
                        I got to, Tam. You know that.

           He pulls her towards the table. Sinclaire smiles.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Happy New Year, Sin.

           Sinclaire rises and gives Willie a hug, whispers.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        See our new mayor up there? We’ll 
                        outlast him yet.

           Willie’s still sore from the failed meeting with Topper.

                                 WILLIE
                        Not for long.

           Not pleased with Willie’s response, Sinclaire eyes 
           Tamsin. A mean glint comes into his eye.

                                 SINCLAIRE 
                        Edie Sedgewick! A Happy New Year 
                        to you! 

                                 TAMSIN
                        (cold) You too, Sin.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I wonder, have you ever considered 
                        dancing on the stage? Willie says 
                        you’re between careers. Perhaps it 
                        would satisfy that itch for the 
                        wild side...

           Willie’s taken aback...

                                 WILLIE
                        Sin, watch your--

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        What, William? She’s lovely. 
                        Perfectly built. Great ass!

           Tamsin is VERY turned off.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WILLIE
                        What the fuck’s the matter with--

           Tamsin SLAPS Sinclaire. Hard.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Don’t talk to me like that. I’m 
                        not some stripper, you scumbag.

           ANGLE ON CALE and LYNN at the bar still watching. Lynn 
           shakes her head, concerned.

                                 LYNN
                        Christ...

           BACK ON Tamsin as she storms off. Sinclaire holds his 
           face, stung, emitting a creepy chuckle.

                                 WILLIE
                        What the hell is wrong with you?!

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Just having a laugh, William. I 
                        didn’t realize the doll couldn’t 
                        take a joke.

                                 WILLIE
                        Fuck you. It’s a wonder you ended 
                        up a criminal.

           Willie walks off to catch up with Tamsin. 

           STAY ON Manny and Sinclaire, as Sinclaire’s smile 
           flattens abruptly.

           BAR: ON Cale as he stands to leave and follow Willie.

                                 LYNN
                        Don’t do it.

                                 CALE
                        I got to, Lynn. You know that.

                                 LYNN
                        I was just getting used to this. 
                        To us. Don’t disappear on me 
                        again. 

           He kisses her forehead gently.

                                 CALE
                        I like that worry.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Cale and Sinclaire lock eyes as Cale’s forced to pass 
           Sinclaire’s table to exit. Sinclaire reaches a hand out, 
           grabbing Cale’s wrist.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (shaking head) I look at you, 
                        Cale, and I see a swimmer paddling 
                        in vain against a mighty current. 

           Cale’s got to get a move on.

                                 CALE
                        Funny, I look at you and see 
                        exactly the same.

           Cale takes a look around.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Everything you got, Sin. This 
                        club, Skin World, (pointing to his 
                        clothes) that fuckin’ suit. You 
                        know what it’s made of? The bones 
                        of honest people. You can call it 
                        a kingdom, you fuck. I call it a 
                        scam. 

           With that, Cale makes his exist. Sinclaire watches 
           coldly, speaks to Manny without taking his eyes off Cale.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Cale’s been on borrowed time for 
                        years. His loan just ran up.

                                 MANNY
                        Thought we were (big word) 
                        abstaining?

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        (decisive) Abstinence has no place 
                        in our industry, Emmanuel.

           Manny doesn’t flinch, as they watch the door buckle 
           closed behind Cale. 

           Lynn glares at Sinclaire as he exits, hatred in her eyes. 
           “Old Long Syne” carries over the crowd.

           EXT. STREET -- MOMENTS LATER

           Willie chases Tamsin down the street, weaving through the 
           crowd of revelers.

                        was.  

                                 TAMSIN
                        Don’t make any fucking excuses for 
                        him, Willie. He’s threatened by 
                        me. By the fact that someone else 
                        believes in you.  

                                 WILLIE 
                        I know.

                                 TAMSIN
                        Then do something about it! He’s a  
                        cancer. 

                                 WILLIE
                        I know! You don’t think I fucking 
                        know that?! I know it’s over, it’s 
                        just not that easy for me. 

           Just then, Cale comes jogging up behind them.

                                 CALE 
                        I need to talk to you, Willie.

           Tamsin tries to wipe away tears.

                                 WILLIE
                        I’m in the middle of something 
                        here, Cale.

                                 CALE
                        You owe me a minute, kid. 

           Tamsin rolls her eyes and storms up the stairs of 
           Willie’s apartment building. 

           Cale lets it fly.

                                 CALE (CONT’D)
                        Jordan’s taking you down. You got 
                        the rest of the night to start 
                        using your fucking head. I’m 
                        telling you this to give you a 
                        chance. 

           Willie shakes his head. His world, days ago full of 
           opportunity, is falling apart. 

                                 WILLIE
                        (shakes his head) I should’ve

                        Vice has got you cold on the club 
                        for laundered money, tax evasion. 
                        It won’t be long till the money 
                        connects to a whole suite of shit. 
                        We’re talking ten inside, Willie. 
                        Maybe more.

           Willie shakes his head, disgusted.

                                 WILLIE
                        I let you back in. I put myself on

                        The only reason I agreed was to

                        don’t need you, Cale. You get it? 
                        I’m not your fucking snitch. Put 
                        me in jail. I hope it makes your 
                        year.

           Willie makes to turn away.

                        That bartender from your club they 
                        found on the tracks--he was 
                        undercover.

                                 WILLIE 
                        (disbelief, confusion) What?

                                 CALE
                        Jordan had him inside. Just a 
                        coincidence he takes a fall?

                                 WILLIE
                        Sin’s not that fucking stupid. He 
                        wouldn’t risk everything with the 
                        shield all over us.

           Cale looks at him closely, angrily. He raises his tone. 
           WHY CAN’T WILLIE SEE...

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 CALE
                        You’re too smart to see how dumb 
                        you are, kid. Everyone knows 
                        you’re better than this. Sinclaire 
                        above all. That’s why he’s got his 
                        nails in your neck. (BEAT) You got 
                        till the morning.

           Willie, frightened and betrayed, watches Cale storm away.

                                 WILLIE
                        (calling out) Another fucking 
                        great New Year’s with you, Cale!  

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale weaves through throngs of drunken tourists. A WOMAN 
           screams that she’s lost her son. A TEENAGER crawls on the 
           ground searching for his wallet, convinced he’s not the 
           victim of a pickpocket. A MAN curses his WIFE; she 
           retaliates by hitting him with her purse.

           When Cale finally reaches his car, he peers at his side 
           mirror, spots Manny’s face among the crowd. He’s a 
           hundred yards back, but obviously following Cale. No 
           local would be caught dead in this crowd.

                                 CALE
                              (to himself)
                        Jesus Christ. Not tonight.

           Cale steps back from his car, pockets his keys and 
           continues through the masses. He doesn’t have the time to 
           deal with Manny.

           Picking up the pace, Cale turns the corner on 42nd Street 
           and slides into an immensely crowded hot-dog counter, the 
           famous...

           INT. GRAND LUNCHEONETTE

           Drunken revelers line up out the door, as Cale makes a 
           bee-line for the back exit. Cale locks eyes with the 
           OWNER, who immediately senses the tension. Not the first 
           time.

                                 OWNER
                        Git yer hotdogs! Buck twenty-five. 
                        You’ll feel a whole lot better in 
                        the morning with a few of these in 
                        your belly! 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Manny pops in, surveys the crowd, searching for Cale. He 
           calls out over the crowd to the owner’s SON, a mentally 
           handicapped twenty-something, working the grill.

                                 MANNY
                        Adam, you see Cale Ryan come 
                        through here?

           The son peers up from the grill. His father tries to make 
           eye contact with him. Unsuccessfully. It’s too late...

                                 SON
                              (stuttering)
                        To-to-to-too busy too be-be, 
                        llllooking for ghosts, MMMMManny. 

           The owner smiles. Whatever his limitations, the kid knows 
           the game. Manny heads for the back door, exits into the 
           alley.

           In the luncheonette, Cale removes a pair of absurd 1995 
           NEW YEARS glasses and a top hat with a blond wig, giving 
           them back to a drunken lady in line. He was hiding in 
           plain sight.

                                 CALE
                        (to the son) Saved my ass, kid.

                                 SON
                        Wa-wa-wouldn’t be the first time.

           Cale smiles, heads out the front door.

           EXT. PORT AUTHORITY -- LATER

           Bootleg Kenny in fur boots and a top hat with streamers 
           and ear flaps sits in the shadow of idling buses sucking 
           on his usual Blow-Pop. He’s got his arm around three of 
           his TRANNIES as they sing “Ain’t No Stopping Us Now,” 
           slugging champagne. 

           Abruptly, though, he stops, sensing a fast-approaching 
           shadow. Alarmed, he grips the bottle of champagne and 
           flings it at the wall, sending champagne and glass shards 
           flying.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Run, hoes!

           Bootleg Kenny hops up and SPRINTS inside the terminal, as 
           the approaching figure - CALE - gains on him. The cross-
           dressers SCATTER down alleyways like running backs.
           INT. TERMINAL. PORT AUTHORITY -- CONTINUOUS

           Cale chases Bootleg inside, but can’t spot him. It’s an 
           eerie place at this late hour. Nodded out bums and 
           wayward teens. Cale makes eye contact with a TELLER who 
           nods towards the bathrooms. 

           INT. WOMEN’S BATHROOM. PORT AUTHORITY -- CONTINUOUS

           Cale doesn’t even bother checking the men’s bathroom. Too 
           easy. He inches his way in, quickly scans underneath the 
           stalls. No feet.  

           From underneath the baby-changing table, Bootleg emerges 
           behind Cale, holding a switch blade to his throat, 
           SLAMMING his face into a stall door.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Fuck you working for?! Seymour? I 
                        ain’t try to poach that ho... 

                                 CALE
                        When you get so rugged, Boots?

           Bootleg recognizes the voice.

                                 BOOTLEG 
                        Ryan? 

           Bootleg eases off just enough. Then gets pissed anew at 
           the trouble.

                                 BOOTLEG (CONT’D)
                        Muthafucka - I’ll slit your shit 
                        just the same.

           Cale spins around, disarms the pimp, and SLAMS him to the 
           floor.

                                 CALE
                        Good to see you, too.

           EXT. ALLEY -- SIMULTANEOUS

           Willie shoots down an alley off Ninth Avenue. He presses 
           the buzzer on a metal door with a security camera above 
           and is quickly buzzed into a building.

           He’s nervous. Pride swelling in his chest. 
           INT. BATHROOM. PORT AUTHORITY -- MOMENTS LATER

           We are underwater on Bootleg’s tortured face. Cale pulls 
           his head up from the toilet. Bootleg gasps for air.

                                 CALE
                        They’re taking Sin down, Boots. 
                        What side you wanna be on?

                                 BOOTLEG
                        The side that breathes, 
                        muthafucka. Ain’t no snitch, you 
                        know that. 

                                 CALE
                        Guy killed a cop, Boots. This 
                        won’t end well for you. 

                                 BOOTLEG
                        You ain’t no cop, no mo’, pale 
                        Cale.

           Cale grabs his head and jams it back in the toilet. 
           Bootleg’s whole body jerks. Cale brings him back up.

                                 CALE
                        Don’t play dumb. The undercover 
                        that didn’t make it crosstown...

           Bootleg flinches. How could Cale know that? Cale 
           immediately picks up on the tell.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        I’m just a squirrel in this world, 
                        Cale. Ain’t know shit about shit.

                                 CALE
                        How come I don’t believe you?

           INT. BEDROOM. BROTHEL -- MOMENTS LATER

           Sinclaire watches as a half-nude COUPLE makes out in 
           front of him. It’s an odd sight. Devious and eerie. An 
           eight ball lies exposed in cellophane on a bedside table. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        On her nipple.

           The young man dribbles a little coke on her breast, rips 
           a line through a cut straw. Wiggles his nose.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Take his belt off, darling.

                        What could possibly be so 
                        important?

                                 RANDOM DEVIANT (O.C.)
                        A mister Willie. Says it’s urgent.

                               couple)
                        Cover up.

           They grab satin robes and cover themselves.

                        Come on in.

           Willie enters the large, loft-sized bedroom. The two 
           teens scurry out. For the first time Sinclaire isn’t put 
           together. His pants unbuttoned, his shirt untucked. He 
           leans back on the bed, sipping a glass of red wine.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’re here about Tamsin. How 
                        chivalrous.

           Willie studies the room uncomfortably, not sure where to 
           sit. Sinclaire notices and slides over, making room.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be a prude.

           Willie sits. Steaming. Wringing his hands.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been thinking with your 
                        eggs ever since you met that 
                        broad. I need you focused, 
                        William.

                                 WILLIE
                        That’s why I’m here, Sin. I--I 
                        can’t do this anymore. I don’t 
                        want this. You don’t listen to me. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Even if I believed that, I 
                        wouldn’t know what it meant.

           Willie explodes.

                        socialite bitch and her gang of 
                        banker boys give a shit about you? 
                        They give a shit about the 
                        property that I own. They give a 
                        shit about the clothes you wear 
                        with the money that I pay you. 
                        They are using you to get to me. 

                                 WILLIE
                        You don’t know shit, Sin.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Remind me, were those vampires in 
                        Chanel and Brooks Brothers--were 
                        they the ones who saved you from 
                        that shithole when you were a boy?  

           Willie eyes Sinclaire down.

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        The only difference between you 
                        and (pointing to the hall) that 
                        pair outside this door is ME.

           INT. BATHROOM. PORT AUTHORITY -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale pulls Bootleg up by his shoulders and pushes him 
           towards the door. He holds Bootleg’s blade against his 
           back.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        You couldn’t lemme have one more 
                        night? Had to step on my suede. 
                        Cold blooded, Pale Cale.

                                 CALE
                        I’m buying you some time. Once Sin 
                        finds out I scooped you you’re 
                        gonna be target practice.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        I get witness protection or some 
                        shit? What about my bitches? They 
                        can’t handle no Arizona heat. Get 
                        all musky and shit.

           Cale pushes Bootleg through the bathroom door and into 
           the...

           TERMINAL

           Bootleg continues to mouth off... 

                                 BOOTLEG
                        All y’all some evil niggas. You, 
                        Sin, Manny, all you muh’fuckas---

           Just then, Cale spots Manny at the ticket counter, covers 
           Bootleg’s mouth, and pulls him back behind the wall. 
           Bootleg peaks up and sees the teller pointing Manny 
           towards the bathroom. Headed straight towards them. Fear 
           contorts Bootleg’s face.

           As Manny nears, Cale and Bootleg slide around another 
           corner, narrowly avoiding Manny’s eye line. As soon as 
           Manny gets to the bathroom, Cale grabs Bootleg. They 
           desperately hustle towards the waiting buses.

                                 CALE
                        Move your ass.

           INT. BEDROOM. BROTHEL

           Willie stands, furious.

                                 WILLIE 
                        They’re coming tomorrow. For 
                        everyone. But it’s my signature on 
                        those bank accounts. I’m the one 
                        that ends up doing a dime for your 
                        bullshit.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Cale tell you that?

           Willie stops. How did he know?

                                 SINCLAIRE (CONT’D)
                        You think I don’t know what Cale 
                        is up to? This is why I can’t let 
                        you make decisions. Because you’re 
                        still far too rash. The only 
                        person that can hurt you is 
                        yourself. I can protect you, son. 

           He lays his arm on Willie’s shoulder, who shrugs it off 
           angrily.

                                 WILLIE
                              (shaking his head)
                        You're a twisted fuck, Sin, and 
                        you come from a twisted world. Why 
                        would you ever wanna go straight? 
                        (chuckles angrily to himself) Your 
                        moral blueprint looks like some MC 
                        Escher shit. (BEAT) I'm not your 
                        son. I'm your employee, and I 
                        fuckin’ quit. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                              (raising his voice)
                        So what, you become a rat? Does 
                        dear Cale know, per chance, about 
                        the blood on your hands?
                              (a creepy chuckle)
                        That’s if he sticks around...The 
                        man has a bad habit of 
                        disappearing. 

           A tense MOMENT as the realization hits Willie. Anger 
           distorts his face. Sinclaire put the hit out.

                                 WILLIE
                        You motherfucker...

           Willie rushes out of the room.

           EXT. BUS TERMINAL. PORT AUTHORITY

           A BUSDRIVER loading passengers calls out to them... 

                                 BUSDRIVER
                        You gentlemen coming? No ticket, 
                        no ride.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Cale pulls Bootleg towards a corner of the terminal just 
           as Manny comes jogging through the glass doors. 

           Manny scans each bus, walking up and down the rows, 
           peering underneath. With each row he’s getting closer and 
           closer to Cale and Bootleg.

           Bootleg slides off his boots.

                                 CALE
                        Stop fucking moving.

                                 BOOTLEG
                        Go kill that muthafucka. 

                                 CALE
                        And leave you? I’d rather see him 
                        rot in prison.

           Bootleg squirms, wanting desperately to run, but Cale 
           pulls him back. In the process a Blow-Pop falls from 
           Bootleg’s jacket. In slow-motion they both watch it hit 
           the ground. 

           Manny hears the faint sound from a few rows over and 
           picks up the pace. As he nears the back corner of the 
           terminal, he pulls a long blade from his back pocket. 
           Manny steadies himself, makes the turn and...

           Nothing. Manny peers around. No Cale. He looks underneath 
           the bus. Nothing. What the hell just happened?

           INT. LUGGAGE UNDERCARRIAGE. BUS

           Cale and Bootleg lie in the bus’s luggage compartment, 
           tighter than sardines. Bootleg’s sweating bullets, 
           cradling his boots in his arms. They can hear Manny’s 
           footsteps right outside the compartment.

           EXT. BUS TERMINAL. PORT AUTHORITY

           Manny casually walks away from the area, still searching.

           INT. SIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Willie rushes up to the bar, where Lynn is cashing out. A 
           few REGULARS who nodded off in the corner are being 
           pushed out by the BOUNCER.

                                 WILLIE
                        Where is he?

                        He said he was coming to get you.

                                 WILLIE
                        He found me, but where is he now?

           Lynn grabs the bar phone and dials her home line, waits.

                                 LYNN
                        He’s not at the house.

                                 WILLIE
                        Shit!

                                 LYNN
                        Willie, what the fuck is going on? 

           Willie runs out the door. Lynn calls after him...

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        (concerned) Goddamnit, Willie! 

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Willie sprints across 42nd street. It’s the same run he 
           made as a boy, but the landscape’s changed entirely. Mom 
           and Pops are now chains; smut parlors now sell Disney-
           wears and I LOVE NY t-shirts. Pimps, Hustlers, and Hoes 
           replaced by cartoon characters taking pictures with wide-
           eyed children in town for the ball drop.

           INT. LUGGAGE UNDERCARRIAGE. BUS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Cale opens the compartment and peaks out. Turns to 
           Bootleg...

                                 CALE
                        Fucking close.

           Bootleg’s eyes go wide with horror. Cale turns. Manny 
           stands over him with the blade trained right at Cale’s 
           heart, holding the Blow-Pop in his other hand.

                                 MANNY
                        Happy New Year.

           Manny comes down with his full force, but Cale catches 
           his hand just in time, holding him off. 

                                 CALE
                        Run...

           CONTINUED:

           Bootleg tries to kick out the other side of the 
           compartment, but it won’t budge. 

           With his free hand, Cale reaches for Bootleg’s blade in 
           his back pocket. He swings it, slicing Manny’s leg. Manny 
           winces - but pulls back his knife again, jamming the 
           blade deep into Cale’s heart. Twists. Bootleg can’t even 
           scream he’s so frightened. Many rips the knife from 
           Cale’s chest. We pull out, as Manny goes to work on 
           Bootleg, stabbing violently.

           Finished, Manny casually leans down and shuts the 
           compartment door on the two mangled bodies. He backs 
           away, blood on the arms of his shirt. 

           As he limps out of the terminal and on to the street, 
           Manny hums SUITE JUDY BLUE EYES.

           In the distance, we see Willie running to an 
           intersection. He stops for a moment and looks both ways 
           just as Manny turns the corner. Willie sprints on, 
           yelling in vain...

                                 WILLIE
                        Cale...Cale! 

           EXT. BUS TERMINAL. PORT AUTHORITY -- THE NEXT MORNING

           A DETECTIVE stands at the edge of the bus terminal on his 
           walkie. A group of tourists and locals crane their necks 
           to see what’s going on. A UNIFORM tapes off the scene. 
           Beneath the bus, a pool of blood has formed from a 
           leaking luggage compartment.

           INT. JORDAN’S OFFICE -- LATER

           Jordan is apoplectic, dressing down Strong.

                                 JORDAN
                        So it’s all gone to shit--is that

                        bodies and no Sinclaire? 

           Jordan slams his hand on the desk.

                        He’ll be right there.

           The COP quickly leaves.

                              (shaking his head)
                        Fuckin’, Cale. Any justice in this 
                        shit, and they’d put a billboard 
                        of that sad fuck all over the 
                        Square.

           INT. OUTSIDE BULLPEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Jordan watches through the BULLPEN GLASS. We HEAR 
           nothing. Strong stands over Willie sitting in a chair, 
           worn out. Strong leans down, breaks the news: Cale’s 
           gone. Willie nods his head, then weeps quietly. 

           INT. BULLPEN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Willie stares across at Jordan and Strong, his face is 
           all business. A tape-recorder sits in the middle of the 
           table. 

                                 JORDAN
                        You got one chance here, kid. And 
                        trust me, if it weren’t for 
                        Detective Strong and Cale Ryan, 
                        I’d toss your dick to the wolves. 

           Willie stares across the table, puts himself together.

                        What do you want to know?

                        loose. Everything.

           Strong clicks record.

           A TIME LAPSE of Willie spilling everything. We hear 
           snippets of sentences about MacDougal, his father, 
           payoffs, Skinny Lou, etc...

           Strong clicks the recorder to off.

                        Cale know you popped Mac?

           Willie nods his head...yes.

                        You did good, Willie.

           Willie sits there, numb. Meanwhile, Jordan smiles. They 
           got what they needed. 

                                 JORDAN

           EXT. DIAMONDS BURLESK

           Strong escorts Sinclaire onto the sidewalk. A crowd, 
           including TV REPORTERS, watches the scene. 

           ANGLE ON Willie and Tamsin standing behind a few of the 
           officers. Sinclaire catches his eye and tips his head, 
           his hands cuffed. Willie walks over to face him.

           Sinclaire seems strangely confident. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You broke my heart twice, William. 
                        That kind of thing can make a man 
                        like me cause a whole manner of 
                        pain.

                                 WILLIE
                        “Moderation is the secret to 
                        survival.” You went too far, Sin. 

           Sinclaire snarls at him. Not playing around.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Dig this, you Irish cunt: This is 
                        my neighborhood. Everyone here is 
                        my fucking tenant.

           Willie and Sinclaire remain locked on each other for a 
           BEAT before Strong finally pushes Sinclaire into a car. 
           Willie watches as the black and white peels away. 

           In the shadows of the alley, Lynn watches. Broken. Angry.

           We FLASH to other strip clubs and Triple X stores in the 
           area, all once owned by Sinclaire. Midtown Enforcement 
           Cops blast through each one. All of them now shuttered 
           and empty. 

           EXT. GREENWOOD CEMETERY -- AFTERNOON

           CLOSE ON a graphite casket being lowered into the ground. 

           PULL BACK to reveal MOURNERS for the funeral of Cale 
           Ryan. A grief-stricken Lynn tosses a rose into the plot. 
           Tamsin ushers her away, as people begin dispersing.

           Willie lingers, watching the coffin get lowered. Strong 
           approaches.

                        Posted bail this morning. 

           Willie nods.

                                 STRONG (CONT’D)
                        We got Manny’s blood at the scene, 
                        but he ain’t flinching. Neither is 
                        Lou.  

           Willie shakes his head.

                                 STRONG (CONT’D)
                        Sinclaire might not do years, but 
                        his reign is done.

           Willie nods, crosses his chest and begins walking away. 
           Strong stays put.

                                 STRONG (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about Cale.

                        detective.

           Willie turns around, departs...

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING. MIDTOWN -- AFTERNOON

           Topper and his partners depart a midtown high rise. A 
           black town car creeps towards them, a tinted window rolls 
           down: Tamsin, incognito. She waves Topper over.

                                 TOPPER
                        Jesus, Tam. I thought the worst. 

                                 TAMSIN
                        Get in.

           Topper slides inside, where Willie sits waiting.

                                 WILLIE
                        I got a proposition for you. 

           LATER

           Willie and Topper are in deep conversation. Tamsin sits 
           beside them in the backseat. 

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TOPPER
                        You’re asking a lot here, Willie.

                                 WILLIE
                        I’m bringing a lot to the table.

                                 TOPPER
                        How do you know this will work?

                                 WILLIE
                        Desperation. Once the case hits 
                        trial, he’ll have to unload.

                                 TOPPER
                        Give me a day to get this cleared, 
                        all right?

           The car stops and Topper opens the door.

                                 TOPPER (CONT’D)
                              (to Tamsin)
                        You stuck with him even through 
                        the cloak and dagger, huh?

                                 TAMSIN
                              (grinning)
                        I like a man with options.

           INT. THE LINX CLUB 

           Sinclaire enters the dining area of the posh men’s club -- 
           not the type that Sinclaire normally frequents. Not a 
           nipple in sight. He bee-lines towards a table where 
           Topper sits alone.

           LATER

           Topper and Sinclaire are discussing business, contracts 
           laid out before them.

                                 TOPPER
                        Let me be clear, Sinclaire. While 
                        I’m happy you’ve reconsidered, 
                        this is no longer the deal I 
                        offered in December. I’m giving 
                        you a way out here.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You sure know how to court a man 
                        before you cum in his eye.

           Sinclaire scribbles his signature on the contract.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 TOPPER
                        As you know, we’ll also be 
                        requiring Willie O’Hara’s 
                        signature as his name is also on 
                        the deed.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I’m happy to have dear William 
                        sign, but I’ve heard he’s become 
                        quite scarce around town -- 

                                 WILLIE
                        Sorry I’m late.

           ON Willie as he casually walks in. He and Sinclaire lock 
           eyes.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        You’ve got some nerve, child.

                                 WILLIE
                        I see you finally came around.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        The meteor is imminent, my lawyers 
                        tell me.

           Willie leans down and signs. Sinclaire can’t believe his 
           moxie.

                                 WILLIE
                        See you in court, Sinclaire.

           With that, Willie stands and departs. As he’s leaving, 
           Sin lets fly a guarded threat.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        Or before...

           EXT. LINX CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

           Willie exits the club, where Tamsin is waiting for him.

                                 TAMSIN
                        So?

           Willie nods. Yup.

                                 TAMSIN (CONT’D)
                        Does he know?

                                 WILLIE
                        Not yet.

           She beams at him. Proud, impressed, elated. 

           INT. ST. LUKE’S HOSPITAL

           Willie walks up to Adeline’s hospital room. Lynn sits 
           beside her. Nothing has changed. She won’t ever wake up. 
           Willie drops flowers by the bed.

                                 LYNN
                        They’re pulling her next week. No 
                        family to argue.

           Willie nods. Lynn starts to cry. Willie wraps his arm 
           around her. She squeezes him tightly, whispers... 

                                 LYNN (CONT’D)
                        He could never let you go.

           Willie nods. Adds to the sentiment.

                                 WILLIE
                        He couldn’t let anything go.

           Lynn snorts. Willie chuckles. Together the grieving pair 
           chuckle through tears. We pan to the bedside table, where 
           a photo sits of Willie and Cale at the Knicks game from 
           weeks earlier. 

           EXT/INT. SKIN WORLD 

           It’s late evening. The stairwell lights are dim, the sign 
           off. An eerie sight.

           Inside, Sinclaire, casual in chinos and a golf shirt, 
           ambles across the empty main floor, pain in his eyes. He 
           reaches behind the counter, picks up a lone polaroid of 
           Manny and a STRIPPER. 

           CU on polaroid: Manny holds her ankles as she dangles 
           backwards by his crotch. They laugh at the camera. 

           Sinclaire smiles.

                                 WILLIE (O.C.)
                        Figured you’d be gone by now.

           Sinclaire looks up, Willie, suit and tie, stands at the 
           door. By the looks of it, they’ve switched places.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        What the fuck are you doing here? 
                        Looking for some cum to mop up?

           Willie ignores him. Pulls out a camera, starts snapping 
           pictures.

                        For your fucking scrapbook?

           Willie continues clicking as he speaks...

                        You taught me a lot, Sin. The 
                        value of property. Loyalty. 

           Willie puts the camera by his side for a second.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        When you grow up like we did you 
                        just want something to call your 
                        own, right? A little piece of the 
                        world to point to.

           Willie goes back to clicking.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t have to kill Cale.

                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Willie snickers, Sinclaire’s precautions.

                                 WILLIE
                        They’re gonna call this “ESPN 
                        Zone.” Five screens per wall. 

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I guess they got their wish. 
                        Genocide in the Deuce. Where will 
                        you go, William? Maybe you can 
                        become a security guard at some 
                        shithouse university like your 
                        hero.

                                 WILLIE
                        I’m actually staying here, Sin. 
                              (he turns toward him)
                        You see I made a deal, too. I get 
                        you to sell the properties with no 
                        strings and I become an equal 
                        partner. A guy like Topper needs a 
                        guy like me to deal with people 
                        like you. To understand their 
                        vulnerabilities.  

           And it hits Sinclaire. HE SOLD HIS PROPERTY TO WILLIE.

                        You were always a petty little

                        father. Maurice told me he begged 
                        like a crack-whore just before 
                        they tossed him. I wonder what 
                        you’ll sound like? 

                                 WILLIE
                        At least you’ll know where to find 
                        me, right? Now get the fuck off my 
                        property, Sinclaire.

           Sinclaire gets close to Willie.

                                 SINCLAIRE
                        I wouldn’t get too comfortable, 
                        William. I still have a Rolodex of 
                        desperate men eager to do me a 
                        good turn. 

           Sinclaire spits, storms off.

           As soon as he opens the front door, his face contorts in 
           shock. A guttural moan. Lynn stands before him, a knife 
           firmly implanted in Sinclaire’s chest.

                                 LYNN
                              (whispering)
                        We’re supposed to look out for our 
                        own. Right, Sin?

           She jerks the knife out, Sinclaire slumps to the floor.

           Willie jumps, looks over. Lynn stands over Sinclaire’s 
           dying body. She stares at Willie. A silent understanding 
           before she flees the scene.

           EXT. SKIN WORLD -- LATER

           Strong and Willie huddle on the street.

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 STRONG
                        You didn’t get a look? Witness 
                        said they saw a blond sprinting 
                        down 8th.

                                 WILLIE
                              (shaking his head)
                        No. It was definitely a guy. 
                        Probably a junkie. 

                                 STRONG
                        His wallet was still on him. Can 
                        you think of anyone who might want 
                        to hurt Sinclaire?

                                 WILLIE
                              (smiling to himself)
                        “He hasn’t an enemy in the world, 
                        but all his friends hate him.”

           Strong grins. He’s gonna let this one go.

                                 STRONG
                        If you think of anything else...

                                 WILLIE
                        (smiling) Of course.

           EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- EVENING

           Willie and Tamsin walk hand and hand through Times 
           Square. Lou Reed’s Walk on the Wild Side takes us out.

           From Willie’s POV, we see the past and present meld 
           together:

           Bootleg Kenny stands in front of the Port Authority next 
           to one of his “girls.” He turns back, grins at Willie 
           then slowly DISAPPEARS from frame, leaving nothing but 
           the idling busses.

           Willie continues walking, looks to another corner:

           Skinny Lou stands on the church steps, broom in hand, and 
           peers back, nods, a Menthol dangling from his lip. He, 
           too, slowly DISAPPEARS, leaving the present-day church.  

           Willie stops across the street from what was SKIN WORLD:

           A young Manny and Sinclaire depart Skin World circa 1980. 
           Manny eyes the camera with contempt. Sinclaire wears a 
           wide grin, tips his invisible cap. They both slowly 
           DISAPPEAR, and Skin World fades into an ESPN ZONE.  

                                                          (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           As they walk, Willie’s POV:

           Two cops, a young Cale and MacDougal in their blues stand 
           on the corner, outside the subway entrance. The heart of 
           Times Square. MacDougal winks. Cale calls out...

                                 CALE
                        Stay safe, kid.

           Slowly they both DISAPPEAR and we are back in the middle 
           of Times Square, present day. Willie stops walking, 
           stares at everything swirling around him, closes his 
           eyes, breathes it in. Tamsin looks back at him.

                                 TAMSIN
                        What is it?

                                 WILLIE
                        (smiling) Just memories.

           Tamsin walks back, grabs his hand and we watch as they 
           slowly melt into the crowd...

           PULL OUT: we’re within the peep booth and the lavender 
           curtain closes for the last time...BLACK.

           POSTSCRIPT:

                 In the year 2010 there were only 800 crimes reported in 
                                 all of Times Square.

                        Eighty percent of these were nonviolent.

                   Times Square is now home to over 39 million visitors 
                                     every year.
