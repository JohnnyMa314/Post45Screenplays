                                                                  11/3/2012
                                                            OVER BLACK:

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        You’re not gonna like the way my 
                        story ends. But I think you’re 
                        gonna like my story.

           The sound of LAPPING WAVES takes us to...

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           The waves calmly wash the shoreline. The clouds are puffy 
           white, the sand gleams, it’s wonderfully serene.

           We WIDEN OUT to see the PEOPLE on the beach. They’re ALL 
           NAKED. And not hot Italian women and perfectly manscaped body- 
           builder naked. Flabby, rolly, young to middle to old-aged 
           naked. It’s a nude beach.

           We WIDEN OUT FURTHER to see a teenage girl, WALLY POTTER 
           (16), as she walks onto the beach. She looks horrified.

                                 WALLY
                        What is wrong with you, you brought 
                        us to a freakin’ nude beach?

           MAX (late 40s) catches up with her. His eyes go wide as he 
           sees what she sees.

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t know it was a nude beach. 
                        I just GPSed the nearest one.

                                 WALLY
                        Really killer parenting, Dad.

           Wally turns to go back -- but a NAKED JOGGER stretches behind 
           them. Totally cool with his junk just flopping all over the 
           place. He gives her a wave. Mortified, she turns back around.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe this is happening.

                                 MAX
                        You can never tell anyone that I 
                        brought you here.

                                 WALLY
                        I would die before I’d tell anyone 
                        about this. Now will you let me 
                        know when the naked lunger is gone 
                        so I can get out of here without 
                        being further scarred by this day?
           Max glances at the jogger, just as uncomfortable as she is.

           Then, A NAKED STONER, hair in dreads, a dirty hippie aura to 
           him, comes up to them. Wally and Max both avert their gaze.

                                 NAKED STONER
                        You looking to buy?

           Max is forced to look at him. Wally might implode.

                                 MAX
                        To buy...?

                                 NAKED STONER
                        Moon cabbage.

                                 MAX
                        Excuse me?

                                 WALLY
                        Weed, Dad!

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, I know it’s weed, Wally, 
                        although I don’t like that you do.
                             (to the Stoner)
                        We’re not interested. 

                                 NAKED STONER
                        No worries. First-timers?

                                 MAX
                        We’re no-timers, actually.  

                                 NAKED STONER
                        Don’t be nervous, let it all hang 
                        out, bro.  

           The guy eyes Wally up and down with a grin.

                                 NAKED STONER (CONT’D)
                        You too, little lady. 

           Wally looks up. Max throws his hand over her eyes.

                           WALLY
                                                           MAX
           Dad!
                                              We’re leaving.

           As he pivots her around, hand over her eyes, we SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. L.A. STREET/INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           SUPER: ABOUT A WEEK EARLIER
           Morning rush hour. Max sits second in line in the left-turn 
           lane. Blinker on. Let’s really meet him:

           If you ask Max, he’s reasonably content. He’s smart. He’s got 
           a wry sense of humor. He’s protective -- some would argue 
           overprotective but he’d tell them to drop that tone of voice 
           with their father.

           The CAR AHEAD OF MAX turns left as the light turns red. 
           Everyone knows Max should make an LA left right now. But he 
           just sits, calmly. The WOMAN in the SUV behind him honks. 

           Unperturbed, Max glances in the rearview and sees her 
           flipping him off. She’s got a KID next to her.

                                 MAX
                        And the mother of the year award 
                        goes to...

           INT. OFFICE - BULLPEN - DAY

           There’s APPLAUSE from a small group of BUSINESS PEOPLE in the 
           bullpen. Max stands in the middle.

                                 MAX
                        Thanks everyone. I heard there was 
                        a cake that met its end in a tragic 
                        fridge-to-counter fumble incident, 
                        but I appreciate the gesture. And 
                        now, unless we want to get really 
                        wild and, I don’t know, do lines of 
                        Sweet’n Low, I regrettably think we 
                        all need to get back to work.  

           People start to disperse, back to their offices and cubicles. 
           A YOUNG GUY comes up to Max.

                                 YOUNG GUY
                        Congrats, boss. Twenty years is 
                        pretty big. 

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, it’s like eighty percent of 
                        your lifetime. Let’s not mention it 
                        again.

           The guy’s not sure how to respond.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding, Ian. I appreciate that 
                        you guys did all this. Really, 
                        thanks. Even though I know you’re 
                        coming for my job one day.
                                 IAN
                        I’m not.

                                 MAX
                        You are.

                                 IAN
                        I am?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t know. You’re a much better 
                        analyst than I was when I started.

                                 IAN
                        I heard you sucked.

                                 MAX
                        Who’d you hear that from?

                                 IAN
                        You.

                                 MAX
                        Well, I have always been my own 
                        worst enemy. Go look productive, 
                        will you? 

           As Max peels off, he touches his forehead. Headache. 

           INT. MAX’S OFFICE - DAY

           Max enters his office. More lived-in than fancy. He grabs an 
           aspirin bottle and pops a few, then dials his phone.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, I had an idea. You. Me. Late 
                        afternoon beach trip. I’ll cut out 
                        of here early, we haven’t gone 
                        together all summer. -- Oh, I 
                        didn’t know you were with Sandra. -- 
                        That’s fine, but don’t think you’re 
                        getting out of this. We’re 
                        reinstating the tradition before 
                        school starts. -- Yeah, see you at 
                        home.   

           He hangs up. Kinda bummed. He plays with a rubber band for a 
           moment...then opens a file and goes to work. 

           EXT. POTTER HOUSE - EVENING

           A nice, unassuming house in a nice, unassuming neighborhood.
           INT. POTTER HOUSE - WALLY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           MUSIC BLARES as Wally applies dark eye makeup in the mirror. 

           Meet Wally: she’s half grown-up and half a kid and can’t 
           stand being in between. She’s smart, stubborn, and fancies 
           herself tough so she’d never let you see her cry.

           She starts to dig through her pile of various makeup. Can’t 
           find what she’s looking for. She rifles through a drawer and 
           comes up with the lipstick she wants. 

           Her eye catches on a beat-up photo she’s unearthed. She picks 
           it up: A BLONDE WOMAN (20s) with a baby. In the mirror, she 
           tries to imitate the woman’s facial expression.

                                 MAX (O.S.)
                        Wally!

           As if caught, Wally quickly tosses the photo down. On the 
           back of it, we see written, “Wally, 6 mos.”

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Wally enters wearing dark red lipstick. Max’s eyes go wide.

                                 MAX
                        What’s happening here, are you 
                        trying to be a French model?

                                 WALLY
                        I just wanna look good, okay?

                                 MAX
                        For the fancy leftovers I’m making?

                                 WALLY
                        I’m going to the batting cages 
                        after dinner.

                                 MAX
                        So you’re trying to be Marilyn 
                        Monroe.

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t even know what that means.

                                 MAX
                        It means that makeup’s a bit much. 

                                 WALLY
                        No one ever got anywhere by not 
                        being bold and not taking chances. 
                                 MAX
                        Are you quoting Seventeen?

                                 WALLY
                        I haven’t read Seventeen since I 
                        was like thirteen.

                                 MAX
                        Then why am I still paying for a 
                        subscription?

           Wally shrugs.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Are you going with Glenn tonight?

                                 WALLY
                        Yes.

                                 MAX
                        Who’s driving?

                                 WALLY
                        He is.

                                 MAX
                        Not a chance.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad!

                                 MAX
                        Didn’t he just get a ticket? You’re 
                        not getting in a car with him.

                                 WALLY
                        Maybe if you would let me get my 
                        license, I could drive myself, did 
                        you ever think about that?

                                 MAX
                        Briefly. Then I sobered up. 

                                 WALLY
                        You’re seriously not letting me go?

                                 MAX
                        No, you can go. But I’m driving.

           Wally lets out an exasperated sigh.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Let’s cool it on the dramatic arts, 
                        the leftovers are getting cold.
           EXT. “ADVENTURE CITY” - BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

           Wally swings at a ball and misses. Next to her, GLENN McGARRY 
           (16, floppy hair, winning smile, an air of coolness), grins.

                                 GLENN
                        Not even close.

                                 WALLY
                        I told you I don’t know what I’m 
                        doing.

           Glenn puts his arms around her and the bat. Let’s be clear: 
           this is nothing but an excuse to grind on her. And judging by 
           the fact that Wally’s breathing’s accelerating and her 
           heartbeat’s in her ears, she doesn’t mind.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        This is such a cliche. 

                                 GLENN
                        What about this?

                                 WALLY
                        What?

           Wally turns to look at him. He kisses her.   

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Still a cliche but I approve.

                                 GLENN
                        Well, I tried. Now you wanna make 
                        progress on these balls or not?
                             (off her silence)
                        Come on, that was funny.

           But Wally’s distracted by something she sees in the distance.

                                 WALLY
                        I’ll be right back.

           EXT. ANOTHER BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

           A ball flies by Max. He doesn’t swing. Another flies by. 
           Again, doesn’t swing. As he lets a third one by...

                                 WALLY
                        We want a hitter not an overbearing 
                        date-crasher.  

           Max turns, surprised by her presence. She looks pissed. 
                                 MAX
                        Are you ready to go?

                                 WALLY
                        No, but you are. You said you were 
                        just dropping me off. Do you know 
                        how embarrassing it’s gonna be for 
                        me if Glenn sees you?

                                 MAX
                        I wanted to bat a little too. Not 
                        everything’s about you.

                                 WALLY
                        When I have plans that you hijack, 
                        it kind of is.

                                 MAX
                        By the time I get into anything, 
                        you’d be calling for a ride, so --

                                 WALLY
                        You’re the one who insisted you 
                        drive! If you don’t wanna go home, 
                        I am begging you to pretty please 
                        go anywhere else. 

                                 MAX
                        You know, one day you’re going to 
                        start wishing you had me around. 
                        I’m actually a pretty cool guy.

                                 WALLY
                        Keep dreaming, Elmer Fudd. 

           She opens the cage door and waits for him to leave.

                                 MAX
                        Elmer Fudd? I’m cooler than Elmer 
                        Fudd.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 

           Max nurses a drink. On a small stage, a GUY WITH A GUITAR 
           sings soulfully (read: makes pained faces and almost hits his 
           high notes). Max grimaces after a particularly rough patch.  

                                 ANNIE
                        He goes platinum from here, right?

           Max turns to see a friendly, fun woman, ANNIE.
                                 MAX
                        Yeah. Then I take my face off and 
                        reveal I’m actually George Clooney.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s odd, we can’t both be George 
                        Clooney. Drop your pants, there’s 
                        only one way to settle this.

                                 MAX
                        You first.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t tempt me.

                                 MAX
                        I’m Max.

                                 ANNIE
                        Annie. So, we get Sad Thad off the 
                        stage and put you up there, what do 
                        you belt out? 

                                 MAX
                        You know, I don’t really sing. 

                                 ANNIE
                        And to think I almost dropped trou 
                        for you. I’d do Mr. Tambourine Man.

                                 MAX
                        Huh. Unexpected. Full Dylan?

                                 ANNIE
                             (a la Bob Dylan)
                        Heyyyy Mr. Taaaambourine Man...

                                 MAX
                        That is truly something special.

                                 ANNIE
                        Thank you. I take my accolades in 
                        the form of gin martinis. 

                                 MAX
                        Before we go any further: do I seem 
                        cooler than Elmer Fudd to you?

                                 ANNIE
                        The bald cartoon character with a 
                        speech impediment? God I hope my 
                        standards haven’t dropped that low. 

           Max smiles and motions to the bartender.
           INT. DIVE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

           Max and Annie are mid-drink, having a good time.

                                 MAX
                        Credit risk analysis.

                                 ANNIE
                        This is one of those times when 
                        narcolepsy would be so convenient.

                                 MAX
                        It’s not as bad as it sounds. 

                                 ANNIE
                        You’re going to try to convince me 
                        of that, aren’t you?

                                 MAX
                        Nope. We could talk about anything. 
                        Where do you come down on Libya?

                                 ANNIE
                        So you put on a suit, go sit in a 
                        cubicle...

                                 MAX
                        I’ve outgrown the cubicle, thank 
                        you very much.

                                 ANNIE
                        Well in that case, marry me.

                                 MAX
                        Not without checking your credit.

                                 ANNIE
                        If you ask Tom, it’s pretty good. 
                             (to the bartender)
                        Right, Tom?

                                 MAX
                        Admitting to being a dive bar 
                        regular. Ballsy. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Shame is for schoolgirls.

           Max cocks an eyebrow. Likes her. Then, his phone vibrates.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, I just need to...
           He checks the phone -- text from Wally. “You can pick me up 
           now if you want OR GLENN CAN JUST DRIVE ME.”

                                 ANNIE
                        Another woman?

                                 MAX
                        She’s 16 and has half my DNA.

                                 ANNIE
                        How can I compete with that? 

           Max gives a bittersweet smile and pulls out his wallet.  

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Holster it, cowboy. It’s on me.

                                 MAX
                        I can’t let you do that.

                                 ANNIE
                        Don’t worry, really it’s on Tom. My 
                        credit sucks. But hey --

           She writes her number on a coaster and hands it to him.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        If you ever need a girl in a bar. 

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Wally lies on the couch watching TV. Max enters.

                                 MAX
                        Hey, I -- is that Sesame Street?

                                 WALLY
                        Nothing good is on and this makes 
                        me feel smart. 

                                 MAX
                        Right. I’m going to the doctor for 
                        these headaches I’ve been having.

                                 WALLY
                        I’ve said for years you should get 
                        your head checked out.

                                 MAX
                        Funny. Anyway, they might do an MRI 
                        if they think it’s migraines so it 
                        could take a while. 
                                 WALLY
                        I’m going over to Sandra’s in a bit 
                        so I won’t even notice you’re gone.

           Wally turns back to the TV. Max heads for the door.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, good luck or whatever though. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - MRI - DAY

           Max lies inside an MRI machine. It’s loud, claustrophobic. 
           The MRI TECH, a nerdy guy, speaks to him through a mic.

                                 MRI TECH (O.S.)
                        I always tell people to imagine 
                        they’re in a spaceship. More fun 
                        than lying a scanner, right?

                                 MAX
                        Do people ever die in these things?

                                 MRI TECH (O.S.)
                        Please don’t move your head. 

           Max shuts up. After a few moments:

                                 MRI TECH (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Patients have died in there but not 
                        because of the machine. 

                                 MAX
                        They should put that in the 
                        advertising campaign. 

           Max closes his eyes, tries to block it out.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - BLEACHERS - DAY

           Wally and SANDRA, her preppy, girly best friend, who’s 
           currently painting her nails, sit in the empty stands. 

                                 WALLY
                        Wouldn’t it be more fun to skip 
                        cheer camp and hang out with me?

                                 SANDRA
                        Just because you don’t like 
                        cheering other people on doesn’t 
                        mean the rest of us can’t.
                                 WALLY
                        Whose idea was it to come watch 
                        Glenn play?

                                 SANDRA
                        I’m pretty sure his because if you 
                        were actually watching the game, 
                        you’d have noticed by now that 
                        they’ve stopped playing.  

           Wally looks up -- the pick-up game they’ve been watching is 
           paused.  And Glenn, shirtless, is running up to them. 

                                 WALLY
                        Game’s behind you, isn’t it?

                                 GLENN
                        You’re getting really good at this 
                        sports thing. Zac’s ditching out 
                        because he claims he sprained his 
                        ankle, so we need a goalie.

                                 SANDRA
                        Is he okay?

                                 GLENN
                        He’s a drama queen. So, which one 
                        of you wants to fill in?

                                 SANDRA
                        Wet nails.
                             (off his look)
                        Chipped nail polish doesn’t make 
                        you a cheer captain, McGarry.

                                 GLENN
                        Alright, Wally, you’re up. 

                                 WALLY
                        You don’t want me to do it. I will 
                        let every ball by and you will lose 
                        and you will regret it forever. 

                                 GLENN
                        I’ll make it worth your while. 

           He smiles. She smiles. Totally melting.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

           Wally plays goalie, looking like a nervous wreck. Luckily 
           Glenn and the others keep it pretty far away...
           Until somebody wallops the ball and it flies directly at 
           Wally. She sees it coming and doesn’t move, paralyzed, she 
           closes her eyes -- and it SMACKS HER IN THE CHEST.

           She opens her eyes -- she’s as surprised as anyone that she’s 
           holding the ball. She’s panting. How did she pull that off?

           Sandra CHEERS from the stands. Glenn runs over. 

                                 GLENN
                        Knew I wouldn’t regret it.

           He kisses her. A big, passionate, makeout kiss. It goes on 
           and on. Co-sponsored by Energizer and Shakespeare. Time 
           stops, angels get their wings, and Wally’s BLOOD POUNDS IN 
           HER EARS. They pull apart, she looks him in the eye -- and we 
           CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

           We hazily BLINK IN FROM BLACK. Wally’s POV. On the ground, 
           looking up at Glenn and Sandra.

                                 SANDRA
                        Wally? Wally? What’s your name? 

                                 WALLY
                        Wally.

                                 SANDRA
                        Full name.

                                 WALLY
                        Wallis Diana Potter.

                                 SANDRA
                        Flying colors. You’re okay.

           Wally sits up. She glances at Glenn, who looks both concerned 
           and freaked out. Wally’s beyond embarrassed.

                                 GLENN
                        You okay?

                                 WALLY
                        Never better. 

                                 GLENN
                        That was crazy. Never seen someone 
                        pass out from catching a ball.

                                 WALLY
                        What can I say? I’m one of a kind.
           He takes Wally’s hands and helps her up. 

                                 GLENN
                        It was a great block.

           He tries to kiss her, she moves her head away.

                                 WALLY
                        I need to keep all my oxygen to 
                        myself for a second. Still woozy.   

                                 GLENN
                        Want me to take you home?

                                 WALLY
                        I didn’t nearly die for you to 
                        forfeit the game. Finish winning. 
                        I’m gonna go sit, I’m good at that. 

                                 GLENN
                        Alright. But don’t keep all that 
                        oxygen to yourself for too long.

           He grins and runs towards the other players. Wally and Sandra 
           head toward the stands.

                                 SANDRA
                        That kiss? Romance novel. Was it as 
                        good as it looked?

                                 WALLY
                        There was a distinct heart-racing 
                        quality about it. 

                                 SANDRA
                        No one has ever even thought of 
                        kissing me like that. I hate you.

                                 WALLY
                        If he keeps it up, he’s gonna land 
                        me in the hospital.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - DAY

           A closed office door that reads, “DR. HANLU LIN, NEUROLOGY.”

           INT. DR. LIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Max paces across from DR. LIN. 

                                 DR. LIN
                        Are you sure you don’t want to sit?
                                 MAX
                        I know you didn’t pull me in here 
                        to tell me something good. I need 
                        to be up. Now what do I have?

                                 DR. LIN
                        It’s called a chordoma. It’s a bone 
                        tumor at the base of the skull. 
                        It’s slow-growing but malignant -- 
                        probably been there for years.

                                 MAX
                        Jesus. Is there a version of “it’s 
                        worse than it sounds” coming out of 
                        your mouth next?

           Dr. Lin shakes his head.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        No. Okay. It’s as bad as it sounds. 
                        Alright. So, what -- what do we do? 

                                 DR. LIN
                        The only effective treatment is 
                        surgery. Followed by radiation to 
                        make sure it doesn’t come back. 

                                 MAX
                        Wow. That’s...a lot.   

                                 DR. LIN
                        But I need to be completely candid 
                        with you. Because of the size and 
                        placement of the tumor -- look at 
                        it here on your scan -- surgery is 
                        complicated. If we’d been lucky --

                                 MAX
                        I wouldn’t have a tumor in my head?

                                 DR. LIN
                        The lucky version of the tumor 
                        would have allowed us to do an 
                        endoscopic endonasal procedure. But 
                        to do a total resection would 
                        require a craniotomy, and --

                                 MAX
                        Layman’s terms. 

                                 DR. LIN
                        Any surgery is a risk. The patient 
                        could die on the table, not to 
                        mention post-op complications. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DR. LIN (CONT'D)
                        This one would involve proximity to 
                        the brain stem and -- sorry, bottom 
                        line: there is a very large chance 
                        that you don’t survive the surgery. 

                                 MAX
                        And if I don’t have it...

                                 DR. LIN
                        It’s hard to predict, chordomas are 
                        rare. Best guess? A year.

           Max is silent, then:

                                 MAX
                        What’s this desk made of, mahogany? 
                        It’s solid, right?

                                 DR. LIN
                        What?

           Max kicks the desk. Hard. Dr. Lin jumps. 

                                 MAX
                        Shit! That hurts. Sorry. I should 
                        have warned you I was about to...

                                 DR. LIN
                        Usually it’s fists and walls.

           He motions to a patch on the wall that’s clearly been painted 
           over. Max stares at it, everything sinking in.

           Off a POUNDING SOUND --  

           EXT. POTTER HOUSE - GARAGE ROOF - NIGHT

           Max is top of the garage, pounding the roof with a hammer. 
           THUD. THUD. THUD. Not really paying attention to what he’s 
           doing, he’s pounding just because he can.  

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        Dad?

           Max looks down below, Wally’s out front.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Is there any particular reason 
                        you’re hammering at 1 am?

                                 MAX
                        I thought I’d finally fix the hole 
                        from that branch last fall.
                                 WALLY
                        In the middle of the night?

                                 MAX
                        Couldn’t sleep.

                                 WALLY
                        Right, home improvement is the next 
                        logical step.

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t think I’d wake you.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m like the princess and the pea 
                        of eardrums.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry. Go back to bed. I’ll stop. 

                                 WALLY
                        Is everything okay?

           Max looks at her. Messy hair, cartoon character pajamas, 
           rubbing her arms in the night air. Just a kid. 

                                 MAX
                        Are you wearing your retainer?
                             (off her silence)
                        I didn’t pay for braces so that -- 

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah, I know. I’ll put it in. 

                                 MAX
                        Good. Everything’s fine. Just made 
                        a bad coffee decision, that’s all.

           Wally goes inside. Max tosses his hammer down and sits by the 
           hole in the roof, stares out blankly.

           Then he takes out his phone, debating something. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Max, half-drunk, downs a drink. He’s not looking great. Next 
           to him sits an overwhelmed Annie.

                                 ANNIE
                        Christ. I was your phone-a-friend?
                                 MAX
                        I needed to tell someone who didn’t 
                        have a vested interest in me.

                                 ANNIE
                        True, my interest in you is 
                        strictly sans vest. Sans shirt, for 
                        that matter. Sorry. I make jokes in 
                        these situations. My therapist 
                        assures me it’s charming. Wow, two 
                        for two. I don’t have a therapist. 
                        Hey, let’s talk more about you. Are 
                        you...having the surgery?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t see how I can risk it. My 
                        daughter’s not ready for me to be 
                        dead in, I don’t know, a week.
                             (beat)
                        Although I don’t know how she’ll be 
                        ready for me to be dead in a year, 
                        either.

                                 ANNIE
                        You know, mine isn’t the best, but 
                        I’ve heard that families are good 
                        at rallying in times like this. I’m 
                        sure she’ll have people who will --

                                 MAX
                        I’m an only child. Dead parents. 
                        I’m kind of it for her.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yikes. You are...quite a sob story, 
                        my friend. She have a mom?

           Max says nothing, just clenches his hand around his glass.

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        That bad, huh?

                                 MAX
                        I don’t even know where she...

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh come on. The guy I gave my first 
                        hand job to in high school wants to 
                        add me to his LinkedIn network, you 
                        can’t find your baby mama somewhere 
                        in the dregs of the internet?

           Max thinks about it for a while. 
                                 MAX
                        You know what? You’re right.

                                 ANNIE
                        He said, not at all surprised.

                                 MAX
                        But I think I can do one better 
                        than LinkedIn.

           He gets up, a new urgency to him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Right now? You’re blue-balling me 
                        again? Some nerve, this guy.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, I --

                                 ANNIE
                        Max, I’m kidding. Go. Do.

           Max starts off. Annie hesitates, then:

                                 ANNIE (CONT’D)
                        Hey Max?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah?

                                 ANNIE
                        I’m not a girl in a bar because I’m 
                        great at, you know, relationships.

           She looks sad. Wishes it weren’t true.

                                 MAX
                        Understood. Thanks for this.

                                 ANNIE
                        I hope you have the most wonderful 
                        year of your life. 

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - MAX’S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

           Max rifles through a pile of mail and finds a postcard from 
           NEW ORLEANS UNIVERSITY. It advertises the CLASS OF 1987 25TH 
           REUNION. AUGUST 11TH. VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFORMATION.

           Max pulls up the website on his computer. Amidst reunion 
           information, he finds a “SEE WHO’S COMING!” link. Clicks.

           He scrolls until he sees “DALE SASSOON + 1 GUEST.” 
           INT. MAX’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK - 14 YEARS EARLIER

           The place is a mess, toys, clothes, baby life. Max (early 
           30s) plays with TODDLER WALLY. He’s next to a phone that’s on 
           SPEAKERPHONE, speaking to a voice we’ll come to know as GUY.

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        So have you heard the news? About 
                        Wallis?

                                 MAX
                        No. 

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Do you want to hear it? I don’t 
                        know how much you want to know 
                        about your cheating ex-wife.

                                 MAX
                        Usually not much but you seem to 
                        want to tell me.

           There’s a beat of silence.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Guy?

                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Wallis and Dale got married.

           As Max digests this news, we CUT BACK TO -- 

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - MAX’S STUDY - PRESENT

           Max stares at “DALE SASSOON + 1 GUEST.”

           He looks to a framed photo of him and YOUNG WALLY at the 
           beach. She’s grinning wide, not a care in the world. 

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - WALLY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Wally bounces around her room, music blasting. She’s putting 
           away clean clothes. She stops to dance, totally nerding out. 

           When she finally opens her eyes and sees Max in the doorway:

                                 WALLY
                        What is the rule about knocking?

                                 MAX 
                        The door was open. 
                                 WALLY
                        Can I help you?

                                 MAX
                        I printed out the driver’s handbook 
                        for you to read. You’re taking your 
                        permit test tomorrow. 

           Wally can barely contain her excitement.

                                 WALLY
                        Finally. Now I won’t be the only 
                        junior who still can’t drive.

                                 MAX
                        You need to pass on the first try. 
                        We’re hitting the road Wednesday.

                                 WALLY
                        Wait, we’re what?

                                 MAX
                        It’s my 25th college reunion this 
                        weekend in New Orleans. We’re going 
                        to make a trip of it.

                                 WALLY
                        You can’t just spring this on me. I 
                        have things to do.

                                 MAX
                        What things?

                                 WALLY
                        Lots of things.

                                 MAX
                        Your boyfriend will still be here 
                        when you get back.

                                 WALLY
                        He’s not my boyfriend.

                                 MAX
                        Did you break up?

                                 WALLY
                        We can’t break up, we’re not  
                        official. We’re just hanging out.

                                 MAX
                        Is he taking advantage of you?
                                 WALLY
                        What? What does that even mean? 
                        What’s wrong with you?

                                 MAX
                        You’ve been going out with him 
                        almost every day all summer and he 
                        won’t commit to being your 
                        boyfriend? You don’t know this yet 
                        because you’re 16, but guys -- 

                                 WALLY
                        Dad, stop. You don’t understand and 
                        I don’t want to talk about it. And 
                        I don’t want to go to New Orleans. 
                        If you wanna go, I’m sure I can 
                        stay with Sandra for a couple days.

                                 MAX
                        No, we’re going together. I’m the 
                        dad trump card, the end. Study up.

           He tosses a stack of papers on her desk and walks out.

           Wally fumes for a moment, then follows.

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Max enters with Wally on his heels.

                                 WALLY
                        Why have you suddenly decided you 
                        want to see everybody from college? 
                        Do you even talk to them anymore?

                                 MAX
                        That’s the point. We’ll reunite.

                                 WALLY
                        Can’t you get Facebook for that?

                                 MAX
                        We’ve never taken a real road trip 
                        together. You’ll love it. 

                                 WALLY
                        Nobody else is gonna bring their 
                        kid. It’s weird. I don’t wanna go.

                                 MAX
                        Can you please just once make it 
                        not about you and do this for me? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t a big 
                        deal.

           Wally says nothing, just glares at him. Knows she can’t win.

           Finally, she turns and opens the fridge.

                                 WALLY
                        We’re out of orange juice.

                                 MAX
                        It’s a quick walk to the Ralph’s. 
                        Take a five from my wallet.

                                 WALLY
                        Now you’re making me buy the 
                        freaking groceries? 

                                 MAX
                        Driving’s just one of many steps 
                        towards independence. 

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t even know what to do with 
                        you. 

           She storms out. Max deflates. He’s not enjoying any of this. 

           EXT. POTTER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Max and Wally put bags in the trunk.

                                 MAX
                        That it?

                                 WALLY
                        Does it look like I have any more 
                        bags to put in?

                                 MAX
                        I could do without that tone.

           As he closes the trunk, Wally moves to the driver’s side.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Where you going?

                                 WALLY
                        I thought I was driving.

                                 MAX
                        Good one.
                                 WALLY
                        How am I gonna learn if you don’t 
                        let me? 

                                 MAX
                        Doing the basics in an empty 
                        parking lot does not make you ready 
                        for the LA freeways. Unless you’ve 
                        got a death wish.

                                 WALLY
                        That’s not out of the question.

                                 MAX
                        I have something else for you.

           Wally looks dubious. Max reaches in the backseat and pulls 
           out a huge stack of college brochures that he hands her.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Time to start talking college.

                                 WALLY
                        That’s two years away.

                                 MAX
                        I should have started you thinking 
                        about it years ago. Come on, drop 
                        the pout and get pumped. We’ve got 
                        a big adventure ahead of us.

                                 WALLY
                        No, none of that. You are not Don 
                        Quixote, I am not Pancho Villa, 
                        this is not some magical journey. 

                                 MAX
                        Sancho Panza. Pancho Villa was a 
                        Mexican revolutionary. You know, we 
                        should probably nix the Ivies from 
                        the list of schools you could get 
                        into.

                                 WALLY
                        Shut up, I could if I wanted!

           He grins as he gets in the car. In a huff, Wally gets in too.

           Max backs out and they start off down the street. Here we go.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DRIVING - DAY

           Max drives. Wally texts, trying to ignore him.  
                                 MAX
                        Advertising.

                                 WALLY
                        I can’t even get through Mad Men.

                                 MAX
                        Journalism.

                                 WALLY
                        I hate talking to strangers.

                                 MAX
                        Law. You can’t tell me you don’t 
                        love arguing. 

           Wally says nothing, she’s too busy responding to a text.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Stop texting and talk to me.

                                 WALLY
                        I have nothing to say on this 
                        subject. But we could talk about 
                        something else. What do you think 
                        of velcro? Retro-cool or just lame?

                                 MAX
                        Why are you being so difficult?

                                 WALLY
                        Because being on this trip together 
                        does not mean we suddenly need to 
                        insta-bond.

                                 MAX
                        Fine.

           Wally goes back to her phone. After a few moments...

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You really haven’t given any 
                        thought to what you want to study 
                        or who you want to be?

                                 WALLY
                        Oh my God, you act as if that’s as 
                        bad as like memorizing Mein Kampf.  

                                 MAX
                        At least that would show 
                        initiative.

           Wally returns to her phone. Max gets in a lane to exit.
                                 WALLY
                        What are you doing now?

                                 MAX
                        I was going to let you drive, since 
                        we’re out of LA. But if the 
                        fraulein doesn’t feel ready...

           Wally looks out at the open road, excited.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m totally ready.

           INT. MAX’S CAR/EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP - DAY

           Wally drives slowly up the on-ramp. 

                                 MAX
                        You need to start speeding up so 
                        you can merge with traffic. 

                                 WALLY
                        I know, Dad.

                                 MAX
                        You say that, yet you’re going 
                        maybe 20 and they’re doing 80. Damn 
                        it, this was a bad idea.

                                 WALLY
                        You’re stressing me out, Dad!

                                 MAX
                        Feeling’s mutual, kid. 

           They reach the top of the ramp. A CAR SPEEDS BY. Wally brakes 
           to a stop. She looks out the window at the oncoming cars.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Rule #1. Stopping is pretty frowned 
                        upon in high-speed situations. Now 
                        you need to wait for a break...

                                 WALLY
                        Stop talking, I can do it! 

           Max cranes his neck to look at the cars speeding by. 

                                 MAX
                        There’s a break.

           Wally accelerates, then sees another car and -- 
           EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP - DAY

           Wally SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. 

           The car is still for a few moments. Then she pulls forward a 
           couple inches -- and slams on the brakes again. 

           Inches forward...and does AGAIN. 

           And AGAIN. She is a jerky caterpillar of freeway mergers.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           The car jerks and stops. Max white-knuckle grips the door.

                                 MAX
                        You just need to commit and do it.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m trying but there’s like a 
                        billion cars!

           A HORN HONKS. Max glances back; there’s a car behind them.

                                 MAX
                        We’ve gotta move. Now. 

                                 WALLY
                        If I just close my eyes and gun it, 
                        they’ll let me in, right?

                                 MAX
                        No! Under no circumstances do you 
                        close your eyes on the road, ever!

           Wally stares at the traffic, her eyes wide with sheer terror. 

           EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP - MOMENTS LATER

           Max and Wally get out of the car and rush around to the 
           opposite doors. Max gives the other car an apologetic wave.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry! Student driver!

                                 WALLY
                        Dad, you’re embarrassing me!

                                 MAX
                        I think you managed that all by 
                        yourself, kiddo.
           They get back in the car and Max takes off. 

           EXT. VEGAS STRIP - AFTERNOON

           The Potters drive down the Vegas Strip...which always looks a 
           little sad in direct sunlight.

           INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Max puts on a clean shirt. Wally emerges from the bathroom 
           still in jeans and a t-shirt. She flops onto the bed.

           Max watches her in the mirror as he buttons his shirt. She 
           looks at her phone, then looks away. Two seconds later, does 
           the same thing. Repeatedly. 

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on with that phone?

                                 WALLY
                        Nothing.

                                 MAX
                        That twitch is not nothing.

                                 WALLY
                        No, literally nothing. No response.

                                 MAX
                        From who?

                                 WALLY
                        Glenn. Are you getting good service 
                        here? I have full bars, but...

           Max grabs her phone and puts it in his pocket.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Dad! What are you doing?

                                 MAX
                        I would like you to focus on our 
                        time together tonight rather than 
                        your time not with your non-
                        boyfriend. Got it?

                                 WALLY
                        But I haven’t heard from him all 
                        day! When he finally texts, I wanna 
                        be able to talk to him.

           Max realizes she’s being slightly pathetic; she does not.
                                 MAX
                        You’re not going out dressed like 
                        that, are you?

                                 WALLY
                        What’s wrong with it?

                                 MAX
                        They won’t let you near a casino 
                        floor looking like that.

                                 WALLY
                        We’re not just getting dinner?

                                 MAX
                        I need you to look as close to 21 
                        as possible. Can you do that?

           Wally smiles mischievously, loving this mandate...

           INT. CASINO - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

           Max holds open the door as a glammed up Wally struts through. 
           Short dress, smokey eyes, blown-out hair, she’s succeeded at 
           aging herself up...and Max is uncomfortable with all of it.

                                 MAX
                        Where did you even get that dress? 
                        Did I pay for it?

                                 WALLY
                        No. I exchanged some stuff I got 
                        for my birthday.

                                 MAX
                        Like what?

                                 WALLY
                        Maybe the cardigan you gave me.

                                 MAX
                        I loved that cardigan. It was 
                        cashmere. You said you liked it.

                                 WALLY
                        I did. It was just too big and they 
                        didn’t have another size.

           Max appreciates the lie. Sort of. 

           They drop it as they reach THE CASINO FLOOR. Buzzing with 
           shiny chaotic excitement. Wally stares in gleeful awe. 
                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        What are we hitting first? I feel 
                        like you’d be good at blackjack.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, we’re not here to gamble.

           Wally furrows her brow: what has she gotten herself into?

           INT. CASINO - SLOTS - A LITTLE LATER

           Max and Wally walk among the slot machines. Wally stares 
           longingly at all the machines they walk by.

                                 MAX
                        Casinos exist to make money. For 
                        the casino owners. For every rare 
                        jackpot they pay out, do you know 
                        how many millions they take in? Are 
                        you listening to me?

                                 WALLY
                        Trying not to.

                                 MAX
                        The odds are stacked against the 
                        players. These machines are 
                        programmed with algorithms that -- 

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not an idiot. Everyone knows 
                        it’s unlikely you’ll win big. But 
                        look around. Everyone’s happy.

                                 MAX
                        It’s the adrenaline and the 
                        alcohol. Why do you think they give 
                        out free drinks?

                                 WALLY
                        The drinks are free?

                                 MAX
                        You’re missing the point. 

                                 WALLY
                        No, I think you are. Look at them.

           A YOUNG COUPLE at a CRAPS TABLE jump up and down excitedly.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        This is like the most exciting 
                        moment of their life.
                                 MAX
                        Until their luck turns, they lose 
                        everything, and wake up with upper 
                        thigh tattoos that say Veg-ASS.

                                 WALLY
                        What, did that happen to you?

                                 MAX
                        It was just an example. I need you 
                        to take this seriously, I’m trying 
                        to teach you something. 

                                 WALLY
                        I should have known when you said 
                        we were doing Vegas that something 
                        was up. A) It’s out of the way and 
                        B) you don’t like to have fun. But 
                        did we really come here just so you 
                        could lecture me?

                                 MAX
                        I know that you’ve been waiting to 
                        come here on your own so I thought 
                        I should show you it’s not --

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah, I got the message. Don’t come 
                        to Vegas, don’t enjoy life, and 
                        don’t ever do anything where the 
                        odds are stacked against you 
                        because you’re only ever gonna 
                        lose. That about cover it?

           Max gives her a look. Behind him, A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN starts 
           SHRIEKING excitedly. She’s won big. Wally watches, entranced.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        You’re cracked, Dad. I’m totally 
                        coming here for my 21st birthday. 

           Max looks around. She’s right, there’s a lot of happiness. 
           This is not going how he wanted. 

                                 MAX
                        Fine, you know what? Let’s see how 
                        fun it can be to lose some money.  

           INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The DEALER slides Max $50 in chips. Max and Wally are the 
           only ones at the table. 
                                 MAX
                        It’s a ten-dollar minimum so we’ve 
                        got five chances. 

                                 WALLY
                        Assuming we lose.

                                 MAX
                        Where do you want to start?

                                 WALLY
                        Um...put one on red.

                                 MAX
                        That it?

                                 WALLY
                        Yup. Feeling pretty good about it.

           The Dealer drops the ball and spins. Max and Wally watch, 
           enraptured. The ball lands --

                                 DEALER
                        15 Black.

                                 MAX
                        There went the cost of a movie 
                        ticket. Where to next?

                                 WALLY
                        Go red again. 

           Max puts a chip on red again. The Dealer spins. And...

                                 DEALER
                        2 Black.

                                 MAX
                        And now neither of us will be 
                        seeing Keanu Reeves’s next movie.

           Wally eyes the board. Hates losing. And being wrong.

                                 WALLY
                        One on black. And...one on even.

                                 MAX
                        Taking your bets up a notch.

                                 WALLY
                        They say scared money doesn’t win.

                                 MAX
                        You watch too much TV.
           He puts down the chips. The Dealer spins.

                                 WALLY
                        Come on, come on, come on...

           The ball goes around and around...and lands on 25. It’s RED. 
           Wally sighs dramatically. 

                                 DEALER
                        25 Red. Sorry. 

                                 MAX
                        This couldn’t be going better.

                                 WALLY
                        It’s your money.

                                 MAX
                        But I’m not upset thinking about 
                        the bottles of fancy Sephora nail 
                        polish you could have bought with 
                        the money you just lost.

           Wally thinks about this. UGH. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        One chip left. Where do I put it?

                                 WALLY
                        Whatever. You choose. This sucks.

           Max looks at the board. Puts it down on 29.

                                 MAX
                        Your favorite number.
                             (off her look)
                        You wouldn’t love any number as 
                        much as your birthday.

           He nods to the Dealer, who seems amused by the two of them. 
           She spins the wheel and drops in the ball. 

           Wally crosses her arms, annoyed as she watches it. Max 
           watches her out of the corner of his eye, proud of himself.

           The ball goes around and around...

           Finally it drops down onto the spinning wheel. Max and Wally 
           now both keep their eyes trained on it...

           And the ball falls into the 29 slot.

                                 WALLY
                        Oh my God, we won!
                                 MAX
                        Holy shit, we won.

                                 DEALER
                        29 Black. Nicely done.

           Max stares in disbelief as the dealer counts chips.

                                 MAX
                        What’s the payout on that?

                                 DEALER
                        35 to 1. Your night just got good.

           Wally shrieks and hugs Max, who can’t pretend he’s not just 
           as excited as she is.

                                 MAX
                        I just screwed up my entire plan. 

                                 WALLY
                        I know, isn’t it great?

                                 MAX
                        Let’s get out of here, we’ll go 
                        treat ourselves to a nice dessert.

                                 WALLY
                        Are you insane? We can’t leave now.

                                 MAX
                        Not knowing when to stop is how 
                        people lose everything.

                                 WALLY
                        Keep the fifty you started with, at 
                        worst we’ll end up even.

           Max considers this. As she’s giving him her best puppy dog 
           eyes, a COCKTAIL WAITRESS comes up to them.

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        Can I get you something to drink?

                                 WALLY
                        Whiskey soda for him, Long Island 
                        iced tea for me.

           Max shoots her a look. The Waitress sizes her up.

                                 COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        You’re 21, right?
                                 WALLY
                        Sure am.

           The waitress nods and walks away.

                                 MAX
                        You are not allowed drink a Long 
                        Island iced tea. Do you even know 
                        what’s in one?

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t know, iced tea?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Excuse me, miss, can I see your ID?

           Over the guy’s shoulder, Max sees the cocktail waitress. This 
           is her doing. Wally tries not to panic.

                                 WALLY
                        Uh...

                                 MAX
                        Did you leave it in the room again?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah. I don’t think I have it here.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        When’s your birthday?

                                 WALLY
                        May 29. 19...

           She can’t figure out the math.

                                 MAX
                        --91. Sorry, she’s just in from 
                        Russia. She’s an actress. Great on 
                        the American accent -- you should 
                        hear her Canadian -- but not fully 
                        fluent. Numbers muck her up.

           The guard is not buying a word of this. He stares at Wally. 

                                 WALLY
                        Da. Borscht. Nadia Comaneci.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I need to ask you to leave.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, we were just on our way.  
           He takes Wally’s arm, grabs his chips, and they walk away.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Nadia Comaneci isn’t even Russian.

                                 WALLY
                        I bet that’s the part where he 
                        caught onto us. 

                                 MAX
                        You had to try to get a drink.

                                 WALLY
                             (with a shrug)
                        Scared money doesn’t win. 

           EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

           Max and Wally walk away from the casino. 

                                 WALLY
                        Hey, can I have my phone back?

                                 MAX
                        Didn’t think you’d last this long. 

           He gives her the phone. She checks it, nothing. She tries to 
           hide her disappointment. Max says nothing, disappointed too.

                                 WALLY
                        Well...what now?

           EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Wally drives, maneuvering up and down the parking aisles. 
           Driving practice. As we watch the car we hear: 

                                 MAX
                        If that were a car you would have 
                        just torn off its back bumper.

                                 WALLY
                        Well it’s not a car, it’s a painted 
                        white line.

                                 MAX
                        You have to use your imagination.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m imagining you taking a vow of 
                        silence right now.
                                 MAX
                        Are you sure your lights are on?

           As their bickering continues, we go to -- 

           EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

           The Potters zoom along. An ‘80s SONG plays on the radio. 

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS

           Wally’s driving. Max quietly sings along to the song as he 
           looks out the window, not even conscious that he’s doing it. 
           Wally gives him a look, kind of amused, then...

                                 WALLY
                        Hey, what happened with your doctor 
                        the other day? Is it migraines?

                                 MAX
                        No, just -- stress headaches. The 
                        doctor says I’ll have fewer of them 
                        if you’re nicer to me.

                                 WALLY
                        Tell him good luck with that. 

           Wally’s phone buzzes in the cupholder. She tries to look --

                                 MAX
                        Don’t even think of trying to look 
                        at your phone and drive.

           Wally looks at the road. But the curiosity is killing her.

                                 WALLY
                        Is it from Glenn? Just look at the 
                        front screen, don’t read it. 

                                 MAX
                        New message from Glenn McGarry.

           Wally nods. Still curious. Debating her options.

                                 WALLY
                        Do you wanna make a pit stop? 

                                 MAX
                        We just did 20 minutes ago.

           She eyes the phone again. Can’t take it.
                                 WALLY
                        Okay, will you read it? If it looks 
                        like something you shouldn’t see 
                        then stop, but you know I haven’t 
                        heard from him in a day so I just 
                        wanna make sure he still has all 
                        his limbs and stuff.

                                 MAX
                        For the record, I’m opposed to this 
                        idea.

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t love it either. 

           Max reads the text, an intense face on. Wally panics.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Stop reading. This was a mistake, 
                        forget whatever you just saw.

                                 MAX
                        It’s fine. I think. It’s hard to 
                        decipher. A lot of abbreviations.

                                 WALLY
                        It’s a text. What do you want, MLA 
                        format and a bibliography?

           Max reads the text slowly as he deciphers it:

                                 MAX
                        Hey babe, sorry I missed -- that’s 
                        m-i-s-t -- you yesterday, was at 
                        the becah -- I think he means beach 
                        -- with Zac n Amy n my batt died.

                                 WALLY
                        He was there with Amy?

                                 MAX
                        Apparently so. The kid really can’t 
                        spell “missed”?

                                 WALLY
                        She’s his ex. Why would he go with 
                        her? And why would he tell me?

                                 MAX
                        Maybe it’s another Amy. 

                                 WALLY
                        There is no other Amy.
                                 MAX
                        There’s only one Amy?

                                 WALLY
                        Will you text him back?

                                 MAX
                        Come on, I don’t -- 

                                 WALLY
                        Please? Just, “Call you later.”

           Giving in, Max starts to type.

                                 MAX
                        Is that “you” with the traditional 
                        spelling or half-literate or --

                                 WALLY
                        Shit.

           Max looks up and sees what she sees: FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS.

                                 MAX
                        How fast are you going?

                                 WALLY
                        Um...95.

                                 MAX
                        Wally!

                                 WALLY
                        I was distracted!

                                 MAX
                        You should have been keeping your 
                        eye on the speedometer! If you 
                        can’t do that one simple thing --

           Wally tries to switch lanes so she can pull over, but A CAR 
           appears from her blind spot and HONKS. She SWERVES back.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Look before you change lanes!

                                 WALLY
                        I did look, I didn’t see him!

                                 MAX
                        You need to get over or this is 
                        going to become an actual chase.
                                 WALLY
                        I can’t, they won’t let me in!

           Max looks back. A CAR passes. And another. Then -- 

                                 MAX
                        You’re clear, go now.

           But Wally’s paralyzed by fear.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wally, go now!

                                 WALLY
                        Someone’s gonna sneak up again!

                                 MAX
                        I’m not going to let someone hit 
                        you. You’re still clear, go now.

           Wally scrunches her eyes closed and moves into the next lane.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Did you just close your eyes?!

                                 WALLY
                        I was too scared to look!

           Wally moves over to the shoulder, and as she slows...the 
           POLICE CAR drives right on by. Wally stops the car. 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        WHAT?! That wasn’t even for me? 

                                 MAX
                        Are you kidding me? You should be 
                        exuberant that it’s not about you. 

                                 WALLY
                        Except I almost just died for 
                        nothing! My heart’s gonna explode. 

           Max heaves out a sigh and unbuckles his seatbelt. 

                                 MAX
                        While your life is flashing before 
                        your eyes, hop out. I need you not 
                        behind the wheel right now.

           EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

           Max and Wally zoom through the desert, the lone car on this 
           particular stretch of road. THIS STARTS A MONTAGE...
           EXT. FREEWAY REST STOP - DAY

           There’s a giant map on the wall. Max points out where they 
           are -- somewhere in Arizona. But Wally’s not paying 
           attention, she’s furiously texting. Unhappy about something. 
           Max sighs and looks back at the map.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           Max and Wally eat. Nearby, a TODDLER keeps turning to look at 
           Wally. The MOTHER looks at Wally, smiles. Wally does too. The 
           woman turns back to her daughter, but Wally keeps watching. 
           And Max watches her. 

           EXT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Max and Wally talk as Max drives. Then, abruptly, she points 
           to a fire-and-brimstone looking billboard that says in big 
           letters “JUDGMENT DAY IS COMING: ARE YOU READY FOR THE END?”  

           While Wally seems to find it ridiculous, Max eyes it with an 
           inscrutable expression. Then Wally’s distracted by a text; 
           she reads it and frowns. 

           EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - SOMEWHERE NEAR EL PASO - EVENING

           The overlook shows mountains in the deserty distance.

           Max sits on a bench, eating a fast food burger. A few yards 
           away, Wally paces on the phone. WE END THE MONTAGE...

           ...and hear Wally’s conversation. As she talks, she chucks 
           small rocks over the ledge as far as she can throw them. 

                                 WALLY
                        He said they’re trying to be 
                        friends so it’s not awkward, but it 
                        sounded kinda sketchy. So...I maybe 
                        did something I shouldn’t have.

           WE INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. SCHOOL GYM - SAME

           We’re TIGHT ON Sandra. She’s in a cheer uniform.

                                 SANDRA
                        Did you break up with him?
                                 WALLY
                        How could I break up with him? 
                        We’re not officially together. 
                        Which was the whole point. I told 
                        him maybe we should be official.

                                 SANDRA
                        Oh boy.

                                 WALLY
                        Even my dad thinks it’s weird we’re 
                        not!

           She glances toward Max, who’s pretending to be oblivious as 
           he eats. But as soon as Wally turns away, he watches her.

                                 SANDRA
                        So I’m guessing he said no?

                                 WALLY
                        He’s not sure if he “can handle a 
                        relationship” but he’s gonna think 
                        about it. What does that mean?

                                 SANDRA
                        You know my mom’s rule. Boys are 
                        dumb. This is just him taking that 
                        to a ‘roided out level.

                                 WALLY
                        I guess...

                                 SANDRA
                        Bright side: you’re still together 
                        even if’s not official. He’ll come 
                        around. I mean we all know nobody 
                        gets their way more than you do.

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah. That’s true.

                                 SANDRA
                        I would love to talk you through 
                        this, but I actually have to go. 
                        I’m killing everyone’s arms.

           REVEAL Sandra is held up by CHEERLEADERS, the group’s flyer.

                                 WALLY
                        You’re hazing the new girls again?

                                 SANDRA
                        Hazing’s a strong word.
                                 WALLY
                        Well, enjoy. And thanks.

           She hangs up, sits with Max, and unwraps her burger. She sees 
           tomato on it and grimaces. Max grabs the tomato and eats it. 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        What would I do without you? 

                                 MAX
                        Know where we are right now?

                                 WALLY
                        Scenic overlook at mile marker x?

                                 MAX
                        That’s Mexico you’re looking at. 
                        We’re on the border of two worlds.
                             (beat)
                        Are you okay? With whatever’s --

                                 WALLY
                        I’m fine. You wouldn’t get it.

                                 MAX
                        Why not?

                                 WALLY
                        Maybe because you haven’t dated 
                        anyone in like sixteen years?

           Max hesitates. Then:

                                 MAX
                        That’s one version of history. 

                                 WALLY
                        Wait, what?

                                 MAX
                        Don’t talk with food in your mouth.

                                 WALLY
                        Who did you date?

                                 MAX
                        Just, you know. Women that I met.

                                 WALLY
                        Like who? When? 

                                 MAX
                        Like...I don’t know. Susan from the 
                        dry cleaner’s.
                                 WALLY
                        Who’s she?

                                 MAX
                        She was a woman I met at the dry 
                        cleaner’s. Named Susan.

                                 WALLY
                        How long did you date?

                                 MAX
                        Maybe a month? Turned out she had a 
                        doberman. That tells you everything 
                        you need to know about her.

                                 WALLY
                        This whole time you’ve been dating 
                        people and not telling me.

                                 MAX
                        You think those conversations would 
                        have gone well for either of us?

           Wally considers it. 

                                 WALLY
                        Was there anyone serious?

                                 MAX
                        No. You’d have known if there was. 
                        But I never wanted to...you know, 
                        risk messing anything up. With our 
                        life. That’s why I never told you.

                                 WALLY
                        Why are you telling me now?

                                 MAX
                        Because we’re on the border of two 
                        worlds, I guess.
                             (then)
                        You done? We’re almost to El Paso.

           He gathers up their trash and walks toward a trash can. Wally 
           watches. A new understanding of him. Maybe even respect.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

           Wally’s driving. Max leafs through her college booklets.

                                 MAX
                        You thinking big school or small 
                        school? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        I guess it will probably depend on 
                        what you decide you want to major 
                        in. Any progress made on that?
                             (off her silence)
                        Are you even listening to me?

                                 WALLY
                        Is the front of the car smoking?

           Max looks ahead: the front of the car is definitely smoking.

           EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON

           A one-strip tiny Texas town.

           EXT. SMALL TOWN MECHANIC - LATE AFTERNOON

           Max and a MECHANIC stand at the car. Wally sits in the shade.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Good news is, serpentine belt can 
                        be replaced. Bad news is, we don’t 
                        have any in stock. Rod’s on his way 
                        into town with a mess of parts now.

                                 MAX
                        How long will that take?

                                 MECHANIC
                        ‘Bout three hours.

                                 MAX
                        Is he stopping to attend a wedding 
                        or a bar mitzvah or something?

                                 MECHANIC
                        Long drive. 

                                 MAX
                        Okay. Fine. We’ll wait. 

                                 MECHANIC
                        Thing is, we’re closing in an hour.

                                 MAX
                        What is this business model? Is 
                        there another mechanic in town?

                                 MECHANIC
                        No sir, but there’s no need to get 
                        riled. I can replace it first thing 
                        in the morning.
                                 MAX
                        We need to be on the road tonight, 
                        we have to be somewhere tomorrow. 
                        Is it safe to drive?

                                 MECHANIC
                        Without the serpentine, overheating 
                        engine’s just the start of your 
                        troubles. No power steering, no --

                                 MAX
                        Can you stay open? I’ll pay extra. 
                        Double. Whatever it takes.

                                 MECHANIC
                        I’m afraid first thing in the 
                        morning’s the best I can do.

           Max’s stress level rises as he calculates what this means...

           INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Max is in the bathroom, washing his face. Wally’s on her bed.

                                 MAX
                        We need to be there when it starts. 
                        I don’t want to miss anyone.

                                 WALLY
                        Who are you so excited to see?

                                 MAX
                        No one you know.

                                 WALLY
                        Are you trying to rekindle some 
                        college romance? Because using your 
                        kid as tail bait is pretty sad. 
                        Even if I am charming and show off 
                        the best of your gene pool.

                                 MAX
                        This conversation is inappropriate.

                                 WALLY
                        Well, you’re being cagey. 

                                 MAX
                        You need to be up and ready to go 
                        at 8. We should call it a night.

                                 WALLY
                        I got it the first three times.
           INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Max closes the door and pops open his aspirin bottle. He 
           drops a few into his palm, stares at them for a moment. 

           He looks at his head in the mirror. Touches the back, the 
           vicinity of the tumor. Can’t feel anything weird. 

           With a sigh, he takes the aspirin.

           INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

           Max is asleep. Wally’s in her bed, face illuminated by her 
           laptop. She’s chatting with Glenn. She writes, “did you think 
           about it at all?” And then nervously awaits his response.

           Glenn writes back, “ya im just worried about startin school n 
           just being really busy w stuff.”

           This response does nothing to soothe Wally.

           Glenn: “but u no how i feel about u ;)”

           Wally: “yeah.”

           Glenn: “all good?”

           Wally: “yeah. of course.”

           Of course what she means is, not at all. 

           She hears VOICES outside the window and gets up to look. In 
           the parking lot, she sees a GROUP OF FRIENDS, late teens or 
           early 20s, standing around a truck. Drinking beer, laughing. 

           A GIRL kisses one of the guys on the cheek. He puts his arm 
           around her and points to the sky. They all look up. 

           Wally watches, curious. Jealous. She glances at Max, asleep.

           EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Wally walks toward the group of friends. The only girl, JEN, 
           notices her first. She gives Wally, who’s now awkwardly 
           adjacent to their circle, a friendly smile.

                                 WALLY
                        Hey. I, uh...saw you guys hanging 
                        out. Just wanted to...thought I’d 
                        come see what’s going on.

           RUSTY (20), a real good ole boy, holds out a beer.
                                 RUSTY
                        Want a drink? 

                                 WALLY
                        Um...yeah. Sure. Thanks.

                                 RUSTY
                        I’m Rusty.

                                 WALLY
                        Wally.

                                 RUSTY
                        That’s a new one. This is Jen, 
                        Hunter, and Q.

           Everyone says polite hellos. Wally takes a sip of the beer. 
           Tries to pretend it isn’t disgusting.

                                 HUNTER
                        There’s another one.

           Everyone looks up. Light streaks across the sky. A meteor.

                                 RUSTY
                        Reckon it’s about time we head out.
                             (to Wally)
                        Wanna watch the shootin’ stars? 
                        ‘Bout to be a whole show of ‘em. 

                                 WALLY
                        A meteor shower?

                                 RUSTY
                        Big one. You ain’t heard about it? 
                        Not a thing that happens much. 

           Wally glances toward the motel, hesitating. 

                                 JEN
                        Aw, I’m tired a being the only girl 
                        around. Come along. Bet it’s like 
                        nothin’ you ever seen.

           Wally looks up at the beautiful open sky.

           EXT. PICKUP TRUCK/COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           Wally rides in the truck bed with Rusty and Q. She just sips 
           her beer and looks out at the world. She catches Rusty’s eye.

                                 RUSTY
                        Almost there.
           Wally nods and looks up. Another meteor crosses the sky. And 
           another. And another. We come down off the sky -- 

           EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

           ...to the parked truck. Music playing. Everyone gathered 
           around, staring up. Wally’s on the truck bed next to Rusty.

                                 JEN
                        It’s even better than I thought 
                        it’d be. Whatcha think, Dubya?

                                 WALLY
                        It’s...magical. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Like nothin’ you ever seen?

                                 WALLY
                        You can’t see anything like this in 
                        LA. All the lights and smog...

                                 Q
                        That’s why Texas’s the greatest 
                        state God ever made.

                                 HUNTER
                        Amen to that.

           They all raise their beers in solidarity. Wally does too. 
           Everyone drinks -- Q chugs the beers he’s double-fisting.

           The song on the radio changes to a SLOW COUNTRY SONG.

                                 JEN
                        Hunter, it’s our song! 

                                 HUNTER
                        This ain’t our song.

                                 JEN
                        Is too. Dance with me, baby.

                                 HUNTER
                        Yes ma’am.

           The two rise and start a tipsy slow dance. Q lets out a huge 
           belch, then lies down on the ground, staring at the sky. 
           Wally’s endeared by all of it. Rusty notices her expression.

                                 RUSTY
                        I reckon you’ll remember this the 
                        rest of your life, Dubya.
                                 WALLY
                        Yeah, I reckon so too.

           They share a smile....and then Wally leans in for a kiss. 
           Rusty backs away.

                                 RUSTY
                        Whoa.

           Wally jumps off the truck, mortified. 

                                 WALLY
                        Oh my God, I’m -- I’m so sorry. 
                        That was -- I didn’t --

                                 RUSTY
                        It’s just that I got a girlfriend.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m an idiot.

                                 RUSTY
                             (with a smile)
                        Nah, I’m just real good-looking.

           Wally stares at the ground, completely embarrassed.

                                 RUSTY (CONT’D)
                        It’s my fault, I didn’t mean to 
                        make you think...

                                 WALLY
                        Let’s pretend it never happened?

                                 RUSTY
                        Alright. 

           Still awkward. Wally opens a beer and takes a long drink. 

                                 WALLY
                        Well...what’s your girlfriend like?

                                 RUSTY
                        Caroline’s the smartest, prettiest 
                        girl I ever met. She’s the only one 
                        of us to go off to college. It’s 
                        just a small place, but I’m so 
                        proud of her. She doesn’t know it 
                        yet but I’mma marry her one day.

                                 WALLY
                        How long did it take you to know 
                        you wanted to be her boyfriend?
                                 RUSTY
                        First time I met her, I guess. But 
                        I’m what they call an emotional 
                        jump-the-gunner. 

                                 WALLY
                        What do you mean?

                                 RUSTY
                        Told her I loved her by date three.
                             (smiling)
                        I like you. They all gimme hell for 
                        thinking she hung the damn moon. 

                                 WALLY
                        I wish more guys were like you.

           She hops back on the truck and lies back to watch the sky.

           INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           A BEEPING ALARM CLOCK wakes Max up. He turns it off.

                                 MAX
                        Am I showering first or are you 
                        showering first? Walls. Wake up.

           No response. He looks over -- and notices her empty bed.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Are you in the bathroom?

           Nothing. He gets up, opens the door, which opens to the 
           terrace/outdoor stairwell. Wally is nowhere. 

           Max grabs his phone and dials her. It goes to voicemail.

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        Hey it’s Wally, speak if you want.

                                 MAX
                        Hey. Where are you?

           EXT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Max heads downstairs, dialing again. Again, voicemail. 

           At the bottom of the stairs, there’s a sign for the POOL. Max 
           follows it. But when he reaches the pool...it’s empty.
           INT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Max bursts into the office. A MIDDLE-AGED BIKER COUPLE, 
           tatted up and grizzly, chat with the mid-20s RECEPTIONIST.

                                 BIKER WOMAN
                        You know any of ‘em?

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        They ain’t released the names yet.  

                                 BIKER MAN
                             (off Max’s look)
                        Some drunk kids ran off the road 
                        last night. All in the hospital.

                                 MAX
                        Wow. That’s awful. Have you by 
                        chance seen a teenage girl 
                        wandering around here? 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        No sir.

                                 MAX
                        Anywhere around here a teenager 
                        might wander off to? 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Don’t think so. But you know, a 
                        group of kids was hanging around 
                        last night. They all went out to a 
                        field to have some fun and watch 
                        the meteors.

                                 MAX
                        That sounds...exactly like the kind 
                        of thing she’d get herself into. Do 
                        you think they’d still be there? 

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Sorry, sir, I don’t know.

                                 MAX
                             (then, it hits him)
                        They couldn’t be the ones who ran 
                        off the road, could they?

           The receptionist shrugs, no idea. Max’s panic rises rapidly. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Where’s the field? Shit, nevermind, 
                        my car’s in the shop. This town 
                        doesn’t have taxis, does it?
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        No, sir.

                                 MAX
                        I have to call the police. Or the 
                        hospital. I have to -- 

                                 BIKER WOMAN
                        Lenny?

                                 BIKER MAN
                        I’m with ya, Betty.

                                 BIKER WOMAN
                        Boss, we’ll give you a lift.

           Max is out the door practically before she finishes speaking. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

           Lenny the biker roars down the road. Betty rides with Max, 
           his arms wrapped tightly around her. He’s wearing her helmet 
           and is, by the way, still wearing a t-shirt and pajama pants.

           EXT. FIELD - DAY

           Wally walks around holding her phone up -- the “trying to get 
           a signal” walk. The others search the ground for something.

                                 HUNTER
                        No idea where you mighta threw ‘em?

                                 Q
                        Nope. Why would you give ‘em to me?

           Any response is drowned out by the sound of the motorcycles. 
           Everyone looks at the bikers as they pull to a stop. Wally’s 
           utterly confused as Max takes off his helmet.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad?

                                 MAX
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 WALLY
                        I’ve been trying to call you but I 
                        can’t get a signal.

                                 MAX
                        Sneaking out in the middle of the 
                        night? With a bunch of strangers? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        Drinking? Did you even consider for 
                        a second what it would be like for 
                        me to wake up and find you weren’t 
                        there? Of course you didn’t, you 
                        never think of anyone but yourself! 
                        Do you have any idea how grounded 
                        you are when we get home?

                                 WALLY
                        We all fell asleep. I’m really, 
                        really sorry.

                                 MAX
                        What were you doing here? Who are 
                        these people?

                                 WALLY
                        There was this meteor shower...

                                 MAX
                        And you couldn’t see it from the 
                        motel? Come on, we’re going.

                                 RUSTY
                        Sir, honestly, she didn’t --

                                 MAX
                        Kid, I’m this close to reporting 
                        you for kidnapping, so just stop.

           Max shoves his helmet in Wally’s hands.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Put this on. Lenny, can you --

                                 LENNY
                        I got her.
                             (to Wally)
                        Hop on, Calamity Jane.

           The bizarreness of the biker situation now sinks in with 
           Wally as she climbs on behind him and Max gets behind Betty.

                                 WALLY
                        You know my dad...how?

                                 LENNY
                        You oughta not pull somethin’ like 
                        this again. Damn near killed him.

           Wally looks over at Max, who’s only now starting to regain 
           color. He rub his temples, a headache.  

           Before Wally can say anything, both bikers take off. 
           INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY

           Max and Wally eat silently, things between them still tense.

                                 MAX
                        Just so we’re clear, in no sliver 
                        of a universe are you now allowed 
                        to ride anyone’s motorcycle.

                                 WALLY
                        Who would I know that has one?

                                 MAX
                        Apparently I don’t know who you 
                        know or what kind of things you do.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad, I’m really sorry. I just...I 
                        wish you could have seen what I saw 
                        last night. The whole sky was full 
                        of shooting stars. I know it sounds 
                        dumb but...it was the most amazing 
                        thing I’ve ever seen. It made me 
                        feel like, really small, you know? 

           Max softens at her uncharacteristic earnestness.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Have you ever seen a big meteor 
                        shower like that?

                                 MAX
                        No. I haven’t.

                                 WALLY
                        One day, when me being an asshole 
                        is behind us and there’s gonna be 
                        another, we should go back to that 
                        field. Just because we can. I feel 
                        like getting to see a meteor shower 
                        in a place like that is something 
                        you should do before you die.

           The words hit. Max tries to ignore them. But can’t.

                                 MAX
                        I have to -- I’ll be right back. 

           INT. FAST FOOD JOINT - NEAR THE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Max yanks the men’s room door. It’s locked. He pulls a couple 
           more times, frustrated, then turns and heads for the exit -- 
           EXT. FAST FOOD JOINT - CONTINUOUS

           Max steps outside just as a BIG FAMILY walks in. He gets 
           caught in them, jostled around a bit. 

           Finally he makes it out, he can have a moment alone...except 
           there are people in an outdoor seating area, eating.  

           He keeps walking, increasingly anxious. He goes around the 
           side of the building. There’s no one in sight...

           So he can double over and heave. Just for a moment before he 
           straightens up and tries to get it all out. He paces back and 
           forth. Kicks an empty bottle. Lets out a:

                                 MAX
                        Fuck!

           He hears voices and looks over -- TWO BOYS, about 13, round 
           the opposite corner. They don’t see him and start to light up 
           cigarettes. A manic Max walks towards them. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey! What’s the matter with you? 
                        You shouldn’t be smoking, you’re 
                        just kids! Don’t you know this is 
                        bad for you? Give me those.

           Max grabs their cigarettes, throws them down. 

                                 BOY #1
                        Yo!

                                 MAX
                        Yo? Is that the best you got? Come 
                        on, tough guy, bring it!

           The boys glance at each other and quickly start walking away.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Yeah you better go! Go on! Next 
                        time I won’t be here to keep you 
                        out of trouble! I won’t be here to 
                        do anything! I won’t be here, you 
                        understand that? I won’t be here!

           Of course there’s no response -- the boys are long gone. 

           Max slumps against a dumpster, alone with this weight. 

           EXT. BANQUET HALL - EVENING

           A banner proclaims: “NEW ORLEANS UNIVERSITY CLASS OF 1987.”
           People are milling about, going in...there’s a lot of energy.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - BATHROOM - EVENING 

           But here, there’s stillness. Max eyes his tie in the mirror. 
           It looks perfectly tied. Not to him. He yanks it undone, 
           starts to tie it again.

           He finishes. Straightens his blazer. Examines himself...and 
           once more pulls apart the tie knot. 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - ANTECHAMBER - EVENING

           Max exits the bathroom, tie-less. He’s accosted by Wally, 
           who’s waiting next to a table of name tags.

                                 WALLY
                        I can’t decide if this is cheesy 
                        cheesy or funny cheesy. Thoughts?

           She holds their name tags up: one says “Max Potter,” the 
           other, “I’m With Max Potter” with an arrow pointing sideways. 

           Max takes his and glances at the table. He sees the “Dale 
           Sassoon” pair. So, they’re not here yet.

                                 MAX
                        I think we should get a drink.

           INT. BANQUET HALL - LATER

           It’s a big party in here. There’s a band -- middle-aged guys 
           who still want to be punk rockers -- on a stage to the side. 

           Max and Wally stand at the bar, waiting for their drinks.

                                 MAX
                        Don’t slouch. Stand up straight. 
                        And don’t cross your arms like 
                        that, you look defensive.

                                 WALLY
                        What is with the posture police?

                                 MAX
                        I just want people’s first 
                        impressions of you to be good.

                                 WALLY
                        What people? You have yet to say hi 
                        to anyone. Are you stress-sweating?
           The bartender hands them their drinks. Max takes a big swig.

                                 MAX
                        Okay. Listen. You’re going to meet 
                        someone tonight who --

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        If you don’t give me the biggest 
                        bear hug of your life right now, 
                        I’m going to cut off your arms and 
                        wrap them around myself in a very 
                        sad and pathetic way.

           Max turns to see GUY THORTON, a big charming gay guy who 
           lives to entertain. Max is thrilled to see him. They hug.

                                 MAX
                        How the hell are you, man?

                                 GUY
                        I’m -- pause button. Am I looking 
                        at Wallis Junior right now?

                                 MAX
                        This is Wally. Wally, this is Guy.

           Wally straightens up and uncrosses her arms.

                                 WALLY
                        Hi.

                                 GUY
                        You, mademoiselle, could not look 
                        more like Wallis Senior if you 
                        tried. Wallis Senior pre-romance 
                        with platinum bleach, that is.
                             (then)
                        Is it okay to say that? Or do we 
                        not speak her name?

                                 WALLY
                        It’s okay. As long as you think she 
                        was pretty.

                                 GUY
                        She was a solid 8 and a half, I’d 
                        give you at least an 8.7.

                                 WALLY
                        That’s it?

                                 GUY
                        Lighten up a little on the eyeliner 
                        and I might renegotiate to a 9.
                                 WALLY
                        I kind of hate-like you.

                                 GUY
                        I feel the same way. About myself, 
                        you I already love. Bravo, Maxwell, 
                        you managed not to ruin her.

                                 MAX
                        You wonder why I haven’t kept in 
                        touch.

                                 GUY
                        We must go find my husband. He 
                        wants to meet you. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re married?

                                 GUY
                        Alas, my balls have finally been 
                        chained. Unhear that, Junior.

                                 WALLY
                        Done.

                                 GUY
                        He’s that-a-way. Walk with me. 

           He leads the way across the room. 

                                 WALLY
                        Why were you so nervous for me to 
                        meet him? He’s cooler than you are.

           She hurries to catch up to Guy. Max scans the room, searching 
           for the person he’s really there for. 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - NEAR THE STAGE - A LITTLE LATER

           Max, Wally, Guy, and SAMUEL (hot, younger than Guy, with a 
           southern twang) stand around a table. Max looks at every 
           blonde woman who walks by.

                                 SAMUEL
                        This band is awful.

                                 GUY
                        They always were. It’s sad to see 
                        them so paunchy and still so off-
                        key. Potter, why aren’t you up 
                        there reliving your glory days?
                                 WALLY
                        What glory days?

                                 GUY
                        What glory days? Papa Bear here was 
                        one of the broodiest singers this 
                        side of the Mississippi.

                                 SAMUEL
                        What side? Aren’t we on the 
                        Mississippi?

                                 WALLY
                        You used to sing?

                                 MAX
                        We don’t need to talk about it.

                                 GUY
                        I desperately wanted him to go pro. 
                        All I ever asked of you, Maxwell, 
                        was to become a legend and 
                        orchestrate a meeting between me 
                        and Cher. You’re a terrible friend.

                                 WALLY
                        Were you really that good?

           Across the room, Max finally sees who he’s been looking for.

                                 MAX
                        Stay here. 

           He takes a deep breath and heads off. They all watch him. 

                                 GUY
                        His ass used to look better. Sorry, 
                        Junior. You can unhear that, too. 

           Wally keeps watching Max -- she can tell something’s up, but 
           doesn’t know what.

           Max moves through the crowd. His anxiety building. 

           He’s watching a good-looking, MONIED GUY talking to a BLONDE 
           WOMAN, whose back is to Max. She laughs. Intimate. Familiar.

           It’s Dale and Wallis. Max stops a few feet short of them, 
           just watching. He finally gathers his courage -- 

           When the woman turns, revealing she’s someone he doesn’t 
           recognize. This isn’t Wallis. He’s confused. Keeps watching. 
           The woman starts talking to other people in their vicinity.
           Definite false alarm. But before Max can retreat...Dale 
           catches his eye. They obviously recognize each other. Max 
           steels himself and walks over. The tension’s palpable. 

                                 MAX
                        Hi Dale.

                                 DALE
                        Max. Haven’t see you since...

                                 MAX
                        A week before Wallis left me?

                                 DALE
                        Right.

                                 MAX
                        Is she here? Where is she?

                                 DALE
                        Uh...wow. I just assumed you knew. 

                                 MAX
                        Knew what?

                                 DALE
                        Honey?

           Dale taps the blonde woman, pulls her from her conversation. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Max, I want you to meet my wife, 
                        Corinne. Max and I were roommates 
                        senior year. We ended up moving to 
                        LA together. 

                                 CORINNE
                        So nice to meet you! Tell me, is LA 
                        as bad as he says? He never wants 
                        to take a trip there!

           Max just stares at Corinne’s “I’m With Dale Sassoon” tag. If 
           she’s with him, Wallis isn’t here. 

                                 DALE
                        Max, you look like you need a 
                        drink. Hon, I’ll grab you another. 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - BAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Max and Dale reach the bar. 
                                 DALE
                        Gotta tell ya, ton of faces here I 
                        don’t remember. Did you see -- 

                                 MAX
                        Enough small talk. Now that we’re 
                        not going to ruin your wife’s image 
                        of you, where’s Wallis?

                                 DALE
                        We got divorced years ago. She left 
                        me too, man. 

                                 MAX
                        Some soulmates. 

                                 DALE
                        Well, you know her... 

                                 MAX
                        Not well enough, apparently. 

                                 DALE
                        Never satisfied for long. She met 
                        someone new.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve thought about you. Really 
                        regret what we did to you. We’re in 
                        the same boat, man. It’s fifteen 
                        years too late, but...I’m sorry.

                                 MAX
                        Did you have kids?

                                 DALE
                        No. 

                                 MAX
                        Then our boats aren’t even in the 
                        same marina.

                                 DALE
                        You’re right. Sorry. How is little 
                        Wallis?

                                 MAX
                        She goes by Wally. And don’t 
                        pretend you care. 

                                 DALE
                        Hey, I was just trying to...

                                 MAX
                        Where’s Wallis now? 
                                 DALE
                        Boca Raton. Married a judge.

                                 MAX
                        What’s his name?

                                 DALE
                        Henry Gower. Sounds like a prick, 
                        doesn’t he?

           Max just gives him a look. 

                                 DALE (CONT’D)
                        Let me buy you a drink. It’s the 
                        least I can do.

                                 MAX
                        It’s an open bar, asshole.

           He turns to walk away.

                                 DALE
                        You know, Max, I may be the bad guy 
                        here, but don’t pretend you were 
                        some innocent victim.

           Max turns back and pushes him. Caught off guard, Dale 
           stumbles back a step. It catches people’s attention. Max puts 
           his hands up -- no more -- and walks away. 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - A LITTLE LATER

           Max sits against the wall in a corner. Looking...totally 
           defeated. Across the room, he sees Wally with Guy, Samuel, 
           and a few others, all chatting. Guy says something, Wally 
           laughs. She looks happy.

           Max pulls out his phone and opens the internet browser. Types 
           in “Wallis and Henry Gower, Boca Raton.” 

           INT. BANQUET HALL - A LITTLE LATER

           Wally’s showing her phone to Guy and Samuel.

                                 GUY
                        I’d have been in love with him in 
                        high school too.

                                 SAMUEL
                        That hair.
                                 WALLY
                        I know. So why would I try to kiss 
                        another guy?

                                 GUY
                        Dollface, let me talk to you about 
                        something called C2H5OH.
                             (off her look)
                        Alcohol. Hold on, I’ll allow you a 
                        moment to revel in the realization 
                        that I’m both fabulous and a 
                        biomedical engineer. Moment over, 
                        the point is, everyone makes dumb 
                        decisions when drunk. Don’t beat 
                        yourself up about it. Unless you’ve 
                        been thinking about truck-boy.

                                 WALLY
                        I was pretending it didn’t happen 
                        until you dragged it out of me.

                                 SAMUEL
                        Here’s the real question: if cutie 
                        was with us, would he be showing us 
                        pictures of you?

           Wally thinks about it, unsure. She sees Max approaching.

                                 WALLY
                        Don’t tell my dad any of this.

                                 GUY
                        I am a chamber of secrets.
                             (as Max joins them)
                        So, Maxwell, Junior’s been catching 
                        us up on your trip. Your Vegas 
                        venture seems a far cry from your 
                        thigh tattoo days. 

                                 WALLY
                        Wait, Veg-Ass was real?! Dad! 
                        You’re never gonna live that down.

                                 MAX
                        Thanks, Guy. 

                                 GUY
                        Why on earth would you keep that 
                        deliciousness a secret?

                                 MAX
                        Wally, you do not have permission 
                        to get a tattoo.
                                 GUY
                        All hail, king of the drags. Now 
                        who’s ready to hit the dance floor?

                                 MAX
                        Actually, I think it might be time 
                        we start heading out.

                                 GUY
                        Don’t be intimidated by my gangnam.

                                 MAX
                        No it’s just, long drive tomorrow.

           Wally cocks her head: what’s going on?

           EXT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

           Max strides towards the parking lot. Wally follows, a couple 
           steps behind in her high heels she hasn’t quite mastered.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad, hold up.

           She stops, takes off her heels. 

                                 MAX
                        I said when you bought those you 
                        wouldn’t be able to walk in them.

                                 WALLY
                        No, hold up about everything. I 
                        wasn’t gonna make a scene but I 
                        need an explanation. I thought you 
                        wanted to hang out here for a day. 
                        Why are we going home tomorrow? 

                                 MAX
                        We’re not. We’re going to Florida.

                                 WALLY
                        What? No. The deal was you guilt me 
                        into leaving my life to come to 
                        your reunion with you. Your reunion 
                        which you said was really important 
                        and we drove for days to get to but 
                        that we’re leaving after a couple 
                        hours. What is going on? Guy wasn’t 
                        who you wanted me to meet, was he?

                                 MAX
                        No.
                                 WALLY
                        So? Who’s in Florida? I’m not going 
                        unless you tell me.

           Max knows he’s out of options. So...

                                 MAX
                        Your mother. I think it’s time for 
                        you to meet her.

           NOT what Wally was expecting.

                                 WALLY
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        Because...you’re at an age where I 
                        don’t have all the answers anymore. 
                        You’re becoming a woman.

                                 WALLY
                        Does she want to meet me?

                                 MAX
                        How could she not?

                                 WALLY
                        That’s not an answer. Does she know 
                        we’re coming?

                                 MAX
                        No.

                                 WALLY
                        But what if she --

                                 MAX
                        Do you want to meet her?

           Wally considers this. Something she’s never been allowed to 
           consider before.

                                 WALLY
                        I’ve always wanted to meet her.

                                 MAX
                        Well then, we’re going to Boca 
                        Raton. Come on, kiddo.

           He grabs her heels from her and puts his arm around her 
           shoulder. They start walking to the car.

                                 WALLY
                        Why did we come to the reunion?
                                 MAX
                        I thought she’d be here. Did you 
                        see the guy I was talking to?

                                 WALLY
                        The douchey Armani vibe guy?

                                 MAX
                        We moved to LA together. He 
                        introduced me to Wallis. And years 
                        later, she left me for him. But it 
                        turns out she left him too. Karma’s 
                        quite the bitch.

                                 WALLY
                        She left for that guy? That guy 
                        reeked of asshat! What does he have 
                        that you don’t have?

                                 MAX
                        Not much, apparently. 

           Wally thinks about all this. Doesn’t like it.  

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey, are you hungry? That food --

                                 WALLY
                        Totally sucked. I’m starving.

                                 MAX
                        Good. I know somewhere great.

           EXT. CAJUN RESTAURANT - PATIO - NIGHT

           This is all local color. Zydeco music plays, it’s raucous and 
           energetic. Max looks comfortable, enjoying it all.

           Wally, deep in thought, sucks on a straw in a cup of just 
           ice, making a slurpy sound. Max pulls the cup away from her.

                                 MAX
                        You know that drives me crazy.

                                 WALLY
                        Sorry. I wasn’t paying attention.

                                 MAX
                        I noticed. What’s up?

                                 WALLY
                        What was it like when I was born?
                                 MAX
                        There were a lot of bodily fluids.

                                 WALLY
                        With her. Was she happy?

                                 MAX
                        What kind of question is that? 

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t know. She left.

                                 MAX
                        It wasn’t because of you. 

           Wally doesn’t look sold.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me. Her leaving was not 
                        about you. It was my fault. And I 
                        never want to hear you thinking 
                        otherwise. Do you understand me?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah.

                                 MAX
                        Good. 

           A SERVER brings a platter of boiled crawfish and puts it down 
           between them. Wally looks disgusted.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        This looks great, thanks. 

                                 SERVER
                        Holler if you need anything else. 

                                 WALLY
                        You said they would be like shrimp.

                                 MAX
                        They are.

                                 WALLY
                        They have faces. 

           Max ties a disposable bib the server left around his neck.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gotta be kidding me.

           With a grin, Max twists off a crawfish’s tail and sucks its 
           head. Wally’s horrified. 
                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Gross! Did you just eat its brain?

                                 MAX
                        Not sure. Try one.

                                 WALLY
                        No way.  

                                 MAX
                        You said you were hungry.

                                 WALLY
                        Not anymore.

                                 MAX
                        You’re missing out.

           Max breaks into the tail for the meat. Wally grimaces. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wallis loved these things.

                                 WALLY
                        You were here with her? When?

                                 MAX
                        When we first got married. She 
                        wanted to do Mardi Gras. I showed 
                        her all my old haunts.

                                 WALLY
                        And she ate these?

                                 MAX
                        By the pound.

           She eyes the crawfish. It’s like they’re staring back at her.

                                 WALLY
                        What was she like back then?

                                 MAX
                        She was...adventurous. I bought her 
                        flying lessons once for her 
                        birthday. When she took off, I 
                        wasn’t sure she’d ever come down.

                                 WALLY
                        Will you buy me flying lessons?

                                 MAX
                        You are out of your pretty little 
                        mind, my dear.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                             (he keeps thinking)
                        Wallis was driven. And tough. And 
                        honestly, hard to get to know. But 
                        once she let you in, you were in. 
                             (hard to admit)
                        You’re a lot like her.

           Wally takes this in as she watches him crack open a tail. 

                                 WALLY
                        Maybe I’ll try one. But I don’t 
                        wanna touch it.

           Max hands her the meat from his. She eats it. He waits... 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        You’re right. It’s good.

                                 MAX
                        See? I know things. 

                                 WALLY
                        Will you open another for me?

                                 MAX
                        Nope, but I’ll show what to do.
                             (off her look)
                        You’ll never be able to eat them on 
                        your own if I don’t teach you how. 

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t think crawfish are gonna 
                        become a regular thing in my life. 

                                 MAX
                        Life is long. You never know. Bib 
                        up, sometimes they squirt.

           Reluctantly, Wally grabs one of the plastic bibs. 

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL - NIGHT

           The sign outside says “Welcome NOU Reunion.” 

           INT. MAX’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           As Max and Wally unbuckle, Wally notices a RED CONVERTIBLE, 
           top down, pulling in a couple spots down.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad. That’s him, isn’t it?
           She points to the other car -- as Dale and Corinne get out.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. That’s him. 

                                 WALLY
                        Ugh, he’s leaving the top of his 
                        midlife crisis car down? Everything 
                        about him oozes “tool.”

           They both watch as Dale and Corinne walk toward the hotel.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        We have to do something to him. We 
                        have to avenge ourselves in some 
                        small insignificant way.

                                 MAX
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea. 

                                 WALLY
                        He is the reason you don’t have a 
                        wife and I don’t have a mom. What 
                        if we never get this chance again?

                                 MAX
                        Point taken. What are you thinking?

                                 WALLY
                        Car, obviously.

                                 MAX
                        We’re not slashing his tires.

                                 WALLY
                        Of course we’re not slashing his 
                        tires, we’re not criminals. What’s 
                        something gross that you wouldn’t 
                        want to find in your car tomorrow?

                                 MAX
                        Shaving cream, eggs...

                                 WALLY
                        Have an original thought, Dad. 
                        What’s something that says us?

           Max thinks, watching Dale with his arm around Corinne.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I got it. Buckle back up.
           EXT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL PARKING LOT/EXT. DALE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Boiled crawfish bounce across the backseat of Dale’s car.

           Wally’s emptying a giant plastic bag of them. Max has another 
           bag he dumps in the front seats.

                                 MAX
                        It’s kind of shame to waste these.

                                 WALLY
                        This is the least wasteful thing 
                        we’ve ever done.

           They both empty their bags and step back to admire their 
           work. Pounds of bright red crawfish all over the car.

                                 MAX
                        He’s never getting the smell out. 

                                 WALLY
                        It still needs something.

                                 MAX
                        That’s about 8 pounds of crawfish, 
                        what more could it need?

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not sure. 

           They both think about it. 

                                 MAX
                        Do you have a marker, something to 
                        write with? 

           Wally digs in her purse.

                                 WALLY
                        No, but I can offer you...the 
                        lipstick you hate.

           She holds out the tube of lipstick. 

           EXT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL PARKING LOT/EXT. DALE’S CAR - MORNING

           The sun rises over Dale’s car...full of crawfish, with “SUCK 
           IT” written across the windshield in dark red lipstick.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Wally’s alone in the room, on Skype with Glenn.

                        Dude, that’s crazy. So when are you 
                        coming back?

                                 WALLY
                        I have no idea.

                        this cool party in Hermosa next 
                        week. We coulda gone.

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah. But I get to meet my mom...

                                 GLENN
                        You’re right, that trumps it. 
                             (off her silence)
                        What’s up, you seem bummed.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not, I’m just...

                                 GLENN
                        I know what’ll make things better 
                        for you. Or at least for me.

           Max steps out of the shower, towels off. 

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        I’m not doing a strip-tease!

           Max looks toward the door, eyes wide.

           INT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Back to Wally, who can’t tell if Glenn’s kidding or not.

                                 GLENN
                        You know you want to.

                                 WALLY
                        Are you confusing “you” and “I”?

                                 GLENN
                        Look, it’s easy. I’ll go first.

           Glenn slowly pulls off his shorts so he’s in only his boxers. 
           Thinks he’s really suave. 
                                 WALLY
                        You’re in this alone, McGarry. 

                                 GLENN
                        No fair. I’m bored. 

           INT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Max has his ear pressed up against the door, on the verge of 
           a total meltdown. Glenn’s talking, Max can’t hear him.

                                 MAX
                        Kid, I swear to God, I will come to 
                        your house and -- 

           He hears Wally murmur something. He pushes his ear against 
           the door as hard as he can.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You’re not that girl. Don’t be that 
                        girl.

                                 WALLY (O.S.)
                        Alright, you asked for it. 

                                 MAX
                        Oh dear God, Wally, don’t -- 

           Max squeezes his eyes shut and throws open the door --

           INT. NEW ORLEANS HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Wally, fully dressed, almost collides with Max on her way to 
           the bathroom. She gives him an annoyed look. 

                                 WALLY
                        Since when do you take so long to 
                        primp? I have to pee so bad.

           She moves past a confused but relieved Max into the bathroom.

           Max glances at her laptop. No sign of Skype, but her 
           wallpaper is a photo of Glenn. Max eyes him.

                                 MAX
                        I will mess you up, you little 
                        twat.

           The photo, predictably, says nothing. Max glares another 
           beat...then closes the computer on Glenn’s face.  
           EXT. FREEWAY ON-RAMP/INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Wally drives up the on-ramp. Max checks out the traffic.

                                 MAX
                        You’re doing good, just don’t stop. 

           Wally gets to the top, sees a break, and goes for it. It 
           seems fine -- until a PICKUP TRUCK comes up from nowhere, 
           HONKS AT HER -- scaring her into SWERVING onto the shoulder 
           as the truck glides into the empty next lane. 

                                 WALLY
                        Crap!

                                 MAX
                        You alright?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah.

           She moves back into the lane. All is well. Max eyes her. 
           Wants to say something. Finally...

                                 MAX
                        Hey, I want to talk to you about 
                        Glenn. I don’t think the way he 
                        talks to you is -- 

                                 WALLY
                        You know, everyone Guy introduced 
                        me to last night kept asking if you 
                        were still singing and whether you 
                        were more John Hiatt or Tom Petty 
                        these days and stuff like that.

                                 MAX
                        This is the one time you don’t want 
                        to talk about you?

                                 WALLY
                        I’m growing. 

                                 MAX
                        You’re deflecting.

                                 WALLY
                        Semantics. They said people paid to 
                        hear you. Is that true?

                                 MAX
                        Why is that so hard to believe?
                                 WALLY
                        Because I’ve never heard you sing.

                                 MAX
                        Yes you have.

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t mean bopping along to the 
                        radio or when you used to sing “My 
                        Wally Lies Over the Ocean” to put 
                        me to sleep. 

                                 MAX
                        Well, for a while I was really 
                        serious about music. I thought I 
                        could make a living off it.

                                 WALLY
                        Until one day you woke up thinking, 
                        my life would be so much cooler if 
                        I got a job where I wore loafers?

                                 MAX
                        Exactly. 

                                 WALLY
                        No, really.

                                 MAX
                        Really, you know I love a good 
                        Italian loafer. 

                                 WALLY
                        Dad.

                                 MAX
                        Singer-songwriter isn’t really a 
                        career you can bet on, so I went 
                        for a path that seemed livable.

                                 WALLY
                        So...you were a chicken.

                                 MAX
                        Hey.

                                 WALLY
                        Well you were, right?

                                 MAX
                        No. I was responsible. 
                             (off her look)
                        Maybe a responsible chicken. 
                                 WALLY
                        You could’ve still played for fun. 

                                 MAX
                        I tried for a while. It was like 
                        picking a scab.   

                                 WALLY
                        I feel like there’s this whole part 
                        of you I don’t know.

                                 MAX
                        You know the important parts. Loves 
                        loafers, always right... 

                                 WALLY
                        Will you sing something for me?

                                 MAX
                        No.

                                 WALLY
                        Come on.

                                 MAX
                        Not happening. 

                                 WALLY
                        Did...she think you were good?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, but...not good enough to make 
                        a go at it. She was a tough critic. 

           Wally furrows her brow as she thinks about this. They pass a 
           “WELCOME TO FLORIDA” sign.

           EXT. FLORIDA GAS STATION - EVENING

           Max “supervises” (leans against the car eating a bag of 
           chips) as a sullen Wally pumps gas. 

                                 MAX
                        Give it a good shake before pulling 
                        it out to make sure no gas drips.

                                 WALLY
                        I know.

                                 MAX
                        Watch the tone.

           Wally jams the gas nozzle back into its slot. 
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Groucho, what’s up? You’ve 
                        been in a mood all day. 

                                 WALLY
                        Nothing.

                                 MAX
                        Is it Glenn?

                                 WALLY
                        Why would you assume that?

                                 MAX
                        You haven’t texted much.  

                                 WALLY
                        He’s just busy.

                                 MAX
                        So what then?

                                 WALLY
                        Nothing.

                                 MAX
                        Wally. 

                                 WALLY
                        I wish I knew when we started this 
                        trip that I was gonna meet my mom. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not mad, I just...would have 
                        brought nicer clothes. It’s gonna 
                        be the first time I meet her. I 
                        really want her to like me.

           She looks at him and for the first time in maybe a long time, 
           he sees a nervous, vulnerable little girl.

           INT. CLOTHING BOUTIQUE - EVENING

           Max sits alone outside a dressing room. An EMPLOYEE comes by.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Just wanted to let you know, I 
                        really need to lock up here in 
                        about 15 minutes.
                                 MAX
                        Thanks. I really appreciate you 
                        letting us sneak in here like this.

           With a nod, the woman walks away.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Walls, come on. I thought you were 
                        going with the yellow dress. The 
                        yellow dress looked great.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m just trying on one more.

                                 MAX
                        We only have 15 minutes, so --

           Wally comes out of the dressing room. She’s wearing a simple 
           white sundress -- she looks young and lovely and girlish.

                                 WALLY
                        What do you think of this one?

           She twirls in a circle. Max is totally melting. 

                                 MAX
                        You look...

                                 WALLY
                        Too Anne of Green Gables?

                                 MAX
                        Just the right amount Anne of Green 
                        Gables.

                                 WALLY
                        So this one or the yellow one?

                                 MAX
                        Both. Keep this one on. There’s 
                        something I want to do tonight.

           INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           This place is a bit shabby but has a cool, old school vibe. A 
           jazz band plays, a few couples dance, most lounge and drink. 
           Max and Wally stand at the entrance, taking it in.

                                 WALLY
                        Awesome.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. Awesome.
                                 WALLY
                        Explain to me why we’re here? 

                                 MAX
                        Because every father should teach 
                        his daughter how to dance before 
                        her wedding day.

                                 WALLY
                        Pretty sure you’ve got tons of time 
                        before we need to worry about that.

                                 MAX
                        I’m worried my time will be up 
                        before I know it.

           Wally can sense something’s up. Isn’t sure what. 

                                 WALLY
                        Is this about her? Because it’s not 
                        like I’m gonna pick her over you or 
                        something. Even if she turns out to 
                        be like as cool as Idina Menzel or 
                        Hillary Clinton or someone, you’re 
                        still gonna be my favorite, Dad.

           Max tries to pretend he’s not tearing up. Wally notices and 
           is unsettled by it, looks away. He puts his hand out to her.

                                 MAX
                        Let’s dance, Walls.

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t really know what I’m doing.

                                 MAX
                        That’s why I’m here.

           He puts her hand on his shoulder, puts his on her waist. He 
           starts to dance. She watches their feet as they move.

                                 WALLY
                        Did I ever stand on your feet to 
                        dance as a little kid?

                                 MAX
                        No. I tried to get you to. You 
                        always chose to be difficult.

                                 WALLY
                        That doesn’t sound like me at all.

           Max tilts her chin so she’s looking up.
                                 MAX
                        Trust yourself.

           Wally works to be graceful without looking down.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        A good man will take you dancing.

                                 WALLY
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        You’re going to meet a lot of guys 
                        in your life. You’ll like some, 
                        you’ll hate a lot, you might love a 
                        few. But I don’t want you to marry 
                        someone unless he’s a good man.

                                 WALLY
                        Okay...

                                 MAX
                        And a good man will take you 
                        dancing. If you want him to. I’m 
                        not saying he needs to be Fred 
                        Astaire or part of the Moscow 
                        ballet company, but if you want to 
                        dance, he’ll jump at the 
                        opportunity to spin you a little. 
                        ‘Cause he’ll just want to make you 
                        happy. Are you listening to me?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah.

                                 MAX
                        With all those guys you meet -- and 
                        believe me, just the idea of that 
                        makes me need a beta blocker -- I 
                        don’t want you to ever want someone 
                        who doesn’t want you back. Because 
                        you’re special, kid. You’ve got a 
                        fire inside you. And life is going 
                        to pull some crappy moves to try to 
                        put it out. But if that happens, I 
                        want the guy next to you to be 
                        striking a match on his boot to 
                        help you light it again. I don’t 
                        want you next to a guy who’s 
                        looking the other way or didn’t 
                        show up with his boots on. Will you 
                        promise me that?

           Wally’s now the one tearing up. But she gets out:
                                 WALLY
                        Yeah, I promise. 

                                 MAX
                        Alright. Good then. That’s all I 
                        wanted to say. A good man’ll take 
                        you dancing. 

           And with that, he twirls her. She’s not quite sure what she’s 
           supposed to do, but she makes it work.

           We watch them dancing for a little while, a shroud of sadness 
           over Max...because he knows it’s the only father-daughter 
           dance he’s ever going to get.

           EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

           Wally and Max walk down the sidewalk toward their parked car. 
           Quiet, each lost in their own thoughts. It’s peaceful.

           Until Wally’s phone rings. She digs it out of her bag.

                                 WALLY
                             (answering)
                        Hey Glenn.

           Max sighs to himself. He’s gotten nowhere with her.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Not much. Just walking. What about 
                        you, what’d you do today?
                             (she listens, then)
                        I’m glad you called because there’s 
                        something I want to tell you. Next 
                        time when you think of calling me 
                        when you get bored of everything 
                        else, don’t. In fact, you can 
                        pretty much stop calling me at all. 
                        Maybe I just needed to get away 
                        from you making my heart race to 
                        see that you don’t actually make me 
                        feel special. Maybe you just have 
                        really impressive pheromones, I 
                        don’t know. But I guess what I’m 
                        saying is I’ve realized you kind of 
                        suck. So have a good night. Babe.

           She hangs up, calmly, and puts the phone back in her purse.

           Max says nothing, just silently hands her the keys as they 
           reach the car. As she walks around to the driver’s side, he 
           allows relief to take over his whole face.
           INT. MAX’S CAR/EXT. WALLIS GOWER’S HOUSE - DAY

           Max and Wally sit parked in the car, staring at WALLIS 
           GOWER’S HOUSE. It’s gorgeous. One of many on a perfectly 
           manicured, these-people-got-money kind of block.

           They’re both nervous as hell. 

                                 WALLY
                        We’re really getting out this time.

                                 MAX
                        Whenever you’re ready.

           Wally unlocks the door...then locks it again.

                                 WALLY
                        Still not ready. 

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t imagine the house being so 
                        nice and...

                                 WALLY
                        Scary.

                                 MAX
                        Yeah.

                                 WALLY
                        Dad, I can’t do this.

                                 MAX
                        Yes, you can. You’re a doer. You 
                        face things. I’ve always admired 
                        that about you. 

                                 WALLY
                        Not this time.

                                 MAX
                        Walls. It’s going to be fine.

                                 WALLY
                        No, we can’t be like, “ding-dong, 
                        hi ex-wife, look who’s here, the 
                        baby you left behind, like her 
                        dress?” I can’t just show up on her 
                        doorstep unannounced. It’s too 
                        cliche. You have to go first and 
                        prep her, then come get me.

                                 MAX
                        I think you’re --
                                 WALLY
                        Please. I don’t wanna surprise her.

           Max stares at the house another beat, then leans over and 
           kisses the top of her head.

                                 MAX
                        See if you can keep from, what did 
                        you call it? “Stress-sweating” 
                        through that dress while you wait. 

           EXT. WALLIS GOWER’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Max stands at the door. Gathering himself.

           He rings the doorbell. After a few moments, WALLIS GOWER (mid-
           40s) answers. She looks a lot like Wally but more done-up and 
           put together. She seems surprised and worried to see Max.

                                 WALLIS
                        Max.

                                 MAX
                        Hi.

                                 WALLIS
                        What are you doing here?

                                 MAX
                        I was in the neighborhood.

                                 WALLIS
                        My neighborhood?

                                 MAX
                        Maybe neighborhood’s a stretch.

                                 WALLIS
                        How did you find me?

                                 MAX
                        I ran into your ex-husband. He 
                        sends his regards. Actually that’s 
                        a lie, I don’t know why I said 
                        that. It’s a thing you say, right?

                                 WALLIS
                        You haven’t said why you’re here.

                                 MAX
                        Do you think I’d come looking for 
                        you after fifteen years of radio 
                        silence if it weren’t important?
                                 WALLIS
                        No, I guess not. 

           He waits for her to invite him in. Wallis hesitates.

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        You know, why don’t we go to the 
                        porch to talk. My housekeepers’s 
                        here. We can go around the back. 

           Wallis starts to walk around the back of the house. Max eyes 
           the door -- because this is a little weird -- but follows. As 
           they walk around, he casually glances at Wally in the car.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Wally’s in the driver’s seat, pressed against the window. She 
           watches anxiously until Wallis and Max are out of sight.

           Then she lifts up one of her arms and checks out her armpit. 
           There’s definitely sweat forming on the dress.

                                 WALLY
                        Shit.

           She glances in the back -- there’s a box of tissues. She 
           grabs a couple and starts stuffing them in her armpits.

           EXT. WALLIS GOWER’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - A LITTLE LATER

           Max and Wallis sit across from each other. There’s a WIND 
           CHIME hanging above them that Max watches as it jingles.

                                 WALLIS
                        It’s inoperable?

                                 MAX
                        Might as well be.

                                 WALLIS
                        I’m so sorry. I mean that. You 
                        shouldn’t have to go through this.   

                                 MAX
                        I’ve had that thought. You know, I 
                        figured at some point you’d get 
                        over the wind chime thing. 

                                 WALLIS
                        What’s there to get over?
                                 MAX
                        I don’t know. Nothing, I guess.
                             (beat)
                        I assume you know why I’m here.

           Wallis says nothing, but of course she does.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You’re her only family.

                                 WALLIS
                        How is there no one else? 

                                 MAX
                        Once bitten, and all that.

           She just gives him a look. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        We’re not here to talk about me. 
                        We’re here to talk about our 
                        daughter. Who needs her mom now. 

                                 WALLIS
                        But I’m not her mom. I put that 
                        piece of myself to rest years ago.

                                 MAX
                        Well, wake it back up. She’s a 
                        great kid. She’s smart, funny...she 
                        got your love of makeup and my 
                        snort when she laughs too hard.

                                 WALLIS
                        I hate that snort.

                                 MAX
                        I know. But you’ll love her.

           Wallis thinks about it, starts to soften...

                                 WALLIS
                        She’s a lipstick girl?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, of all the genes you passed 
                        down, it had to be that one?
                             (beat)
                        I’m not asking you to drop 
                        everything and join the PTA. She 
                        just wants to meet her mom.

           Wallis darkens again.
                                 WALLIS
                        I’m sorry about everything that’s 
                        happening, but...I can’t.

                                 MAX
                        Is it because of Henry? 

                                 WALLIS
                        No.

                                 MAX
                        So he knows she exists.

                                 WALLIS
                        Max.

                                 MAX
                        I know nothing about this is ideal. 
                        Trust me that I know that. But 
                        she’s your daughter.

                                 WALLIS
                        She stopped being my daughter the 
                        day you answered her birthday card 
                        with papers to give up custody.

                                 MAX
                        Don’t punish her for what I did.

                                 WALLIS
                        I’m not punishing anyone. I just 
                        have a new life now. And I can’t 
                        risk complicating it.

                                 MAX
                        So. She gets that from you.

                                 WALLIS
                        What?

                                 MAX
                        I ride her all the time for only 
                        thinking about herself. But that’s 
                        your M.O., isn’t it? You ever find 
                        that “real happiness” you were 
                        looking for? 

                                 WALLIS
                        Stop. You don’t have the right to --

                                 MAX
                        Did you hate your brief stint at 
                        motherhood that much?
           At that moment, the back door opens and Wallis’s SON (about 
           8) comes out. He looks at them, then yells back in the house:

                                 WALLIS’S SON
                        Found her, McKayla! Mom, Justin 
                        called and said his mom said we 
                        could go swim, can we?

           Max stares in speechless disbelief as Wallis’s daughter 
           MCKAYLA (5) also runs out. She looks like a mini-Wallis. 
           Which means she bears a lot of resemblance to Wally, too. 

                                 WALLIS
                        I’ll take you in a little while.

           He runs back in the house. McKayla stays. 

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        Princess, go back in with Brayden.

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I’m hungry.

                                 WALLIS
                        Tell Marta I said you can have a 
                        snack. She’ll make you something. 

                                 MCKAYLA
                        I want you to make it. 

                                 WALLIS
                        Mommy can’t right now. Ask Marta.

           McKayla starts crying. Wallis pulls McKayla to her.

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        Shhh, Mickey, don’t do that. 
                             (to Max)
                        I’m truly sorry about everything. 
                        But I’m their mom now. They’re my 
                        happiness. I have to go.

           She stands up, taking McKayla’s hand. Upset, Max rises too. 
           He puts his hands over McKayla’s ears. Mother and daughter 
           look equally confused.

                                 MAX
                        You should know that you leaving 
                        was the best thing that ever 
                        happened to me. Because I got all 
                        of Wally for 15 solid years. So I 
                        guess what I’m saying is thanks for 
                        being such a...
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                             (he eyes McKayla)
                        Just, thanks.

           He lets go of McKayla and gives her a friendly pat on the 
           head. Wallis now covers McKayla’s ears. 

                                 WALLIS
                        Well then, shouldn’t you be 
                        thanking the bar slut who started 
                        it all? Or is she harder to find, 
                        since you didn’t know her name?

                                 MAX
                        It wasn’t the same thing.

                                 WALLIS
                        You’re right, it wasn’t. At least I 
                        cheated for love.

           She lets go of McKayla’s ears.

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go find your brother, baby.

           She goes inside with McKayla. 

           Max is left with just his guilt and that damn wind chime.

           ...which he yanks down and throws as far as he can into the 
           yard. He turns and sees a HOUSEKEEPER watching him from the 
           bay window right behind him.  

                                 MAX
                        You going to do something about it?

           Startled, she drops the curtain and disappears. Max slumps 
           back down in a chair -- how is he going to tell Wally?

           INT. MAX’S CAR - DAY

           Wally has the A/C blasting with her arms up so it blows right 
           at her armpits. She sees Max emerge from the house.

           EXT. MAX’S CAR/EXT. WALLIS GOWER’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Wally gets out, pulling tissues out of her dress.

                                 WALLY
                        What’s she like? What did you say? 
                        What did she say? Are we going in?
                                 MAX
                        Little glitch in the plan, kiddo.

                                 WALLY
                        She doesn’t want to meet me.

           She looks so sad, it breaks Max’s heart. And so...

                                 MAX
                        No, she does. She just has friends 
                        over right now and can’t get away. 
                        We’re coming back. Tomorrow. 

                                 WALLY
                        Oh. Okay. That...sucks. But thank 
                        God I didn’t stain my dress. 

           Max says nothing. He’s letting the lie he just told sink in.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        So what are we gonna do today then?
                             (off his shrug)
                        You wanna finally get in your 
                        father-daughter beach time?

           EXT. PATH TO BEACH - DAY

           Max and Wally walk down a long path. Max is in his own head.

                                 WALLY
                        Sandra claims the Atlantic is way 
                        different than the Pacific. 
                        Although the only time she was here 
                        was her grandma’s funeral in like 
                        third grade, so I’m not sure how 
                        much I believe her.
                             (off his silence)
                        Okay, I’m out of bullshit to ramble 
                        about, what happened when you 
                        talked to her? I am dying, here.

                                 MAX
                        I told you what happened.

                                 WALLY
                        You gave me the Great Illustrated 
                        Classics mega abridged version. So, 
                        you’re at the door, ding-dong. You 
                        go around the back -- why?

                                 MAX
                        She didn’t want to disturb the 
                        others. 
                                 WALLY
                        Who were they?

                                 MAX
                        The painters. They were inside. 

                                 WALLY
                        Wait. Before you said friends.

                                 MAX
                        When?

                                 WALLY
                        When we were at the car, you said 
                        she had friends over.

                                 MAX
                        Oh, I misspoke. She’s getting a 
                        “butter cream” living room.

           Wally nods. She half-believes this, but then...

                                 WALLY
                        Why are you lying to me?

                                 MAX
                        I’m not.

                                 WALLY
                        There was no painter’s van there. 

                                 MAX
                        They were just some young guys from 
                        the neighborhood, it wasn’t a 
                        professional operation. Why are you 
                        hung up on this?

                                 WALLY
                        Because I’m not stupid. A couple 
                        with a house that nice and a lawn 
                        that manicured and a Porsche that 
                        waxed in the driveway does not hire 
                        some kids from the neighborhood to 
                        paint their house. 

           As Max racks his brain -- 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I thought you weren’t gonna lie to 
                        me anymore, Dad! I thought we were 
                        in this together.

                                 MAX
                        We are, of course we are.
                                 WALLY
                        So what aren’t you telling me?

           She stares at him hard, all worked up. He can’t say anything. 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I was right. She doesn’t want to 
                        meet me, does she? Don’t lie.

                                 MAX
                             (defeated)
                        She has two kids. She says she 
                        can’t be your mom too. Come here.

           He tries to hug her, but she pulls away and keeps walking. 
           Completely heartbroken. Willing herself not to cry.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wally, stop, come on, let’s talk 
                        about this.

           A few steps ahead of Max, Wally walks onto THE BEACH...

           And sees a NAKED COUPLE sunbathing. She looks the other way -- 
           a NAKED OLD WOMAN gets out of the water. Everywhere she 
           looks, EVERYONE IS NAKED. 

                                 WALLY
                        What is wrong with you, you brought 
                        us to a freakin’ nude beach?

           Max eyes go wide as he sees what she sees.

                                 MAX
                        I didn’t know it was a nude beach. 
                        I just GPSed the nearest one. 

                                 WALLY
                        Really killer parenting, Dad.

           Wally turns to go back -- but a NAKED JOGGER stretches behind 
           them. He gives her a wave. Mortified, she turns back around.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe this is happening.

                                 MAX
                        You can never tell anyone that I 
                        brought you here.

                                 WALLY
                        I would die before I’d tell anyone 
                        about this. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALLY (CONT'D)
                        Now will you let me know when the 
                        naked lunger is gone so I can get 
                        out of here without being further 
                        scarred by this day?

           Max glances at the jogger, just as uncomfortable as she is.

           A NAKED STONER approaches. Wally and Max avert their gaze.

                                 NAKED STONER
                        You looking to buy?

           Max looks up. Wally might implode.

                                 MAX
                        To buy...?

                                 NAKED STONER
                        Moon cabbage.

                                 MAX
                        Excuse me?

                                 WALLY
                        Weed, Dad!

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, I know it’s weed, Wally, 
                        although I don’t like that you do.
                             (to the Stoner)
                        We’re not interested.

                                 NAKED STONER
                        No worries. First-timers?

                                 MAX
                        We’re no-timers, actually.

                                 NAKED STONER
                        Don’t be nervous, let it all hang 
                        out, bro.  

           The guy eyes Wally up and down with a grin.

                                 NAKED STONER (CONT’D)
                        You too, little lady. 

           Wally looks up. Max throws his hand over her eyes.

                           WALLY
                                                           MAX
           Dad!
                                              We’re leaving.

           He keeps her hand over her eyes and pivots her around. She 
           pulls and tugs at his hand.
                                 WALLY
                        Stop it, stop touching me, just 
                        stop!

                                 MAX
                        Wally, calm down.

                                 WALLY
                        No, I don’t wanna calm down!

           She manages to pull his hand away. 

                                 MAX
                        Jesus, I think you scratched me.

                                 WALLY
                        Did you think I wouldn’t figure out 
                        Wallis didn’t wanna see me? Or were 
                        you gonna lie again tomorrow, and 
                        the next day, and the next day?

                                 MAX
                        I clearly didn’t have a plan, I 
                        just didn’t want to see you sad.

                                 WALLY
                        Well that worked out perfect.

           She wipes away a rogue tear.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        How old are her replacement kids?

                                 MAX
                        They’re not replacements.

                                 WALLY
                        Maybe you don’t know the definition 
                        of the word.

                                 MAX
                        Her son is maybe 7. Daughter’s 
                        about 5.

                                 WALLY
                        What are their names?

                                 MAX
                        Brayden and McKayla.

                                 WALLY
                        Those are the dumbest names ever.
                                 MAX
                        She was just overwhelmed with 
                        everything I told her. She’ll come 
                        around when -- 

                                 WALLY
                        I really don’t wanna talk about it, 
                        can we please go?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah, we can go. 

           They start back up the beach path. Max tries to put his arm 
           around her but she shrugs it off. 

           EXT. FLORIDA HOTEL ROOM - BALCONY - THE NEXT MORNING

           Max sits on a small balcony attached to the hotel room.

           He’s got coffee and his bottle of aspirin. He’s staring out 
           blankly at the parking lot that is his view, just trying to 
           figure things out. 

           It doesn’t seem to be going well. 

           He hears a loud THUD from inside the room.

                                 MAX
                        Walls? You alright?

           INT. FLORIDA HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Max comes in to find Wally with both their suitcases packed 
           and ready to roll.

                                 MAX
                        What’s going on?

                                 WALLY
                        I’m ready to go home.

                                 MAX
                        We’re not leaving.

           Wally opens the door and rolls out with both their suitcases. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Hey, stop!

           Wally keeps going down the hall. Max races to get shoes on.
           INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Wally jams on the elevator “door close” button, but Max 
           slides in before they do. 

                                 MAX
                        When I tell you to stop, you stop.
                             (grabbing the bags)
                        We’re going back to the room.

                                 WALLY
                        I’m not gonna stay somewhere where 
                        there’s nothing for me.

                                 MAX
                        Wally, if I have to drag you, I 
                        will do it. 

           The doors close. Max hits the “doors open” button, it’s too 
           late, the elevator’s descending.

                                 WALLY
                        The universe is on my side. We 
                        should go home.  

                                 MAX
                        We’re going back to Wallis.

           The elevator opens on the first floor. An ELDERLY COUPLE 
           tries to enter. Max jams the button to close the doors.

                                 ELDERLY MAN
                        Going up? 

                                 MAX
                        Sorry, we’re full. 

                                 WALLY
                        No, come in, we’re getting off.

           She tries to go, Max blocks her. The doors close. Max pulls 
           the elevator stop button -- a RINGING starts.  

                                 MAX
                        We’re not going home until you meet 
                        her. Things are complicated, but 
                        deep down she wants to meet you. 

                                 WALLY
                        Then why didn’t she ever try to? I 
                        wish you had never put this idea in 
                        my head. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WALLY (CONT'D)
                        You should have just let me keep my 
                        fantasy version of her, that 
                        somewhere out there was a woman who 
                        regretted abandoning me and wished 
                        she could have me back. But you 
                        didn’t, you ruined everything. I 
                        want to go home.

                                 MAX
                        We can’t. You have to meet her.

                                 WALLY
                        I thought I wasn’t supposed to want 
                        someone who doesn’t want me back.  

                                 MAX
                        This is different.

                                 WALLY
                        Why?

                                 MAX
                        Because you need her.

                                 WALLY
                        I never have before. What is going 
                        on? Are you still in love with her?

                                 MAX
                        No. Not even close.

                                 WALLY
                        So what then? Why are you doing 
                        this to me?

           They stare each other down. Max slams his hand against the 
           wall, knows he has to tell her. She jumps. Finally:

                                 MAX
                        I’m a dead man walking, Wally. 

           Wally freezes. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I have a tumor in my head that’s 
                        going to kill me within a year. And 
                        if they try to take it out, they 
                        could kill me on the table. So you 
                        need her because I won’t be around. 

           Wally can’t breathe. Her eyes well up. She turns away from 
           him and jams on the panel, trying to get the doors to open.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wally, stop. Talk to me. 

           Instead of releasing the emergency stop button, Wally 
           accidentally hits the FIRE ALARM button. An ALARM BLARES.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Shit, what did you do?

           She keeps jamming on buttons, the doors open. She runs out --

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Max follows Wally into the lobby. The fire alarm BLARES 
           everywhere -- throngs of guests and employees are gathering, 
           concerned. Wally pushes through them with Max on her heels. 

           A HOTEL EMPLOYEE blocks Max:

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Did you hit the alarm?

                                 MAX
                        Get out of my way, I need to -- 

                                 HOTEL EMPLOYEE
                        Do you have an emergency? The fire 
                        department’s on the way now, if you 
                        press that button and there’s no 
                        emergency, you can be fined for --

                                 MAX
                        Yes I have a fucking emergency, get 
                        out of my way!

           He pushes the guy out of his way and runs out. 

           EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Max scans the parking lot -- sees Wally getting into their 
           car. He runs over, reaches it as he hears the engine start. 
           He yanks open the passenger door and gets in. 

                                 MAX
                        Turn the car off.

           Wally throws the car in reverse and zooms out of the spot. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Wally, stop.
           Ignoring him, Wally speeds down the aisle to the street 
           intersection. With barely a glance, she turns out into the 
           road. Another car HONKS.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I said stop! Pull over. You 
                        shouldn’t be driving right now.

           The light ahead turns yellow. Wally speeds up to make it 
           through. It turns red as she crosses the intersection. Max 
           scrambles to pull his seatbelt on.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You’ve made your point, you’re 
                        upset, I get it. Now pull over.

           Wally accelerates, zooms into a lane that turns into a 
           freeway on-ramp. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Do not get on this freeway, Wally, 
                        do not --

           She speeds onto the winding ramp. Max grips the door.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What did I just say? 

           Wally reaches the top of the ramp, shoots one quick glance in 
           her side mirror, and merges with traffic seamlessly.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going? Talk to me!

                                 WALLY
                        You don’t want to congratulate me 
                        for my perfect merge?

                                 MAX
                        No, I want you to talk to me.

                                 WALLY
                        You’re an asshole. I hate you. 

                                 MAX
                        For what?

                                 WALLY
                        For what?! For so many things! You 
                        find out that you’re -- 
                             (can’t say it)

                                 WALLY (CONT'D)
                        That you have a tumor, and instead 
                        of telling me, you try to pawn me 
                        off on a woman who doesn’t even 
                        want me? Do you realize how screwed 
                        up that is?

           Wally speeds up and passes the car in front of her.

                                 MAX
                        Stop driving like a maniac, you’re 
                        going to get a ticket! I’m not 
                        pawning you off. I just wanted you 
                        to meet her. You’re going to need 
                        her one day, she’s your family.

                                 WALLY
                        No, my only family is abandoning me 
                        so I guess I should start learning 
                        all the lyrics to “Annie.”

                                 MAX
                        I’m not --

                                 WALLY
                        But I guess I shouldn’t be 
                        surprised you’re giving up, right? 
                        That’s what you always do. Don’t 
                        bet on yourself, don’t believe you 
                        can win...at least you’re gonna 
                        leave me with a clear philosophy. 

                                 MAX
                        I’m not trying to leave you with 
                        that. I’m not trying to leave you!

           She zooms into the exit lane and takes the exit. 

                                 WALLY
                        Then why wouldn’t you let them try 
                        to take the tumor out?

                                 MAX
                        You don’t get it, the chances of 
                        surviving this surgery --

                                 WALLY
                        You’re not given chances, you have 
                        to take them.

                                 MAX
                        You can’t beat this by being glib!

           Wally makes a hard turn at the bottom of the ramp, barely 
           braking. She’s on more of a back road. Empty. She floors it.
                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Slow down! How many more times do 
                        you need me to say it?

                                 WALLY
                        I dunno, I guess we’ll see.

                                 MAX
                        What point is this proving?

                                 WALLY
                        I don’t have one, I just feel like 
                        doing something insane right now, 
                        does that bother you?

                                 MAX
                        Jesus, slow down!

           Just ahead: RAILROAD TRACKS. Completely empty.

                                 WALLY
                        Okay. Fine.

           Wally slams on the brakes...stopping right on the tracks.  

                                 MAX
                        Move the car. Move the car! I’m not 
                        kidding.

                                 WALLY
                        And I’m not listening.

           She pulls the keys out of the ignition. He tries to grab them 
           from her. She drops them down her dress so he can’t get them. 

                                 MAX
                        If you don’t move this car --

                                 WALLY
                        You do know that any threat you 
                        could possibly make in this moment 
                        means nothing to me.

           Max realizes she has a point.

                                 MAX
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 WALLY
                        That you’re not going to die.

                                 MAX
                        You told me not to lie to you. 
                                 WALLY
                        Why does it have to be a lie? Why 
                        can you not, for one half-second of 
                        your life, consider the possibility 
                        that you could come out on top?

                                 MAX
                        You’re going to get us killed.

                                 WALLY
                        So what? You’re dying anyway and 
                        you’re totally okay with it so I 
                        don’t see the problem.

                                 MAX
                        Grow up, Wally! Of course I don’t 
                        want to die, but I don’t get to 
                        control it.

                                 WALLY
                        Yes you do! If you do nothing you 
                        definitely die and if you do 
                        something you potentially live! How 
                        is that not a clear choice?

           He just looks at her, sad. Her bravado finally falls apart -- 
           she starts crying.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want you for one year, Dad. 
                        I want you for my whole life.

                                 MAX
                        Walls...

                                 WALLY
                        What about all the important things 
                        we’re supposed to do together? 
                        Don’t you wanna see what other 
                        gross foods you can teach me to 
                        eat? Don’t you wanna be around to 
                        yell at me when I turn 21 and get a 
                        drunken tattoo in Vegas? Don’t you 
                        wanna see how many ways I can come 
                        up with to try to bully you into 
                        singing for me? I thought we were 
                        gonna go back to that stupid field 
                        in Texas to watch a meteor shower, 
                        I thought we were gonna do all 
                        those things together, Dad. Don’t 
                        you want to?

                                 MAX
                        You have no idea, kid.  
                                 WALLY
                        We don’t get to unless you’re 
                        willing to take a chance, Dad. 
                        Please. I’d bet on you.   

           Max stares at her. Even through her mess of tears, she’s 
           never looked more stubborn.

                                 MAX
                        Okay.

                                 WALLY
                        Okay?

                                 MAX
                        I’ll tell them they’re not allowed 
                        to kill me on the table. And if 
                        they do they have to answer to 
                        you...and there’s no way they come 
                        out of that fight alive. 

           Wally wipes snot on her sleeve.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Don’t do that. We have tissues.

                                 WALLY
                        I used them all earlier.

                                 MAX
                        I promise you we will do all those 
                        things together. Now will you 
                        please move the car before you get 
                        us killed?

                                 WALLY
                        I was never gonna let us get hit by 
                        something, I’m not suicidal.

           She reaches into her dress for the keys...and comes up empty. 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Where’d they go?

                                 MAX
                        You’re joking, right?

           As she searches, the arms of the RAILROAD CROSSING GATES 
           start to descend. Max sees this and panics.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        If we don’t move this car -- 
                                 WALLY
                        They’re somewhere in my -- 

           Max opens his door.

           EXT. MAX’S CAR/EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS

           Max rushes out of the car and runs around to her side. He now 
           HEARS A TRAIN in the distance. He throws open her door.

                                 MAX
                        Get out. They’ll fall.

           Wally gets out. Nothing falls. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        What the hell did you do with them? 
                        Shake a little.

                                 WALLY
                        Shake a little?

                                 MAX
                        Do not question me right now, you 
                        need to shake and shimmy and do 
                        whatever it takes for them to fall 
                        out.

                                 WALLY
                        This wouldn’t be happening if you 
                        let me put cool keychains on them 
                        like I wanted to.

                                 MAX
                        Heavy keychains weigh down the 
                        ignition and we don’t have time to 
                        argue about this. Now shake.

           Wally awkwardly shimmies. Nothing happens. She does it 
           harder. Not even a sound. Except the train getting closer.

                                 WALLY
                        They’re not on me!

           Max rushes past her to the driver’s seat. As he looks all 
           around the seat, Wally sees...

           THE TRAIN in the distance, coming up pretty quickly. 

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        Dad.
                                 MAX
                        I can see them, how the hell did 
                        you get them to fall between the 
                        seat and the console?

                                 WALLY
                        Dad.

                                 MAX
                        My hand is too big, I can’t get in 
                        there.

                                 WALLY
                        DAD!

           Max finally turns around and sees what she sees.

                                 MAX
                        Shit shit shit! Get in there, your 
                        hand is smaller!

           He jumps out of the way and Wally goes in, thrusting her hand 
           in the gap between the seat and console. 

                                 WALLY
                        I can feel them...

                                 MAX
                        You need to do more than feel them.

           Max looks back and forth between her and the oncoming train, 
           about ready to stroke out, when -- 

                                 WALLY
                        Got ‘em!

           She pulls her hand up with the keys. Max grabs them from her 
           and they both run into the car.

           INT. MAX’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Max starts the engine and throws the car into drive -- 

                                 MAX
                        I can’t believe I’m doing this.

           He closes his eyes --

           And accelerates. He SMASHES through the gate arm and barrels 
           onto the road. As the broken gate arm falls off the hood, 
           clearing their vision --
                                 WALLY
                        Dad, there’s a -- 

           Max sees A SQUIRREL --

           And SLAMS on the brakes, swerving to avoid it --  

           But there’s ANOTHER CAR turning down the street, so he 
           overcompensates and swerves the other way -- 

           Sending him straight into a STOP SIGN, that he hits just hard 
           enough to bend the pole forward a little.

           The car stops. Max and Wally look freaked out of their minds.

                                 MAX
                        Are you okay?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah. 

           The train passes behind them.

           And then there’s silence as they both try to normalize their 
           breathing. Finally, after a few moments...

                                 MAX
                        You are beyond grounded. You’re not 
                        getting your license til you’re 40.

                                 WALLY
                        Wanna bet?

                                 MAX
                        Yeah. I think I do. 

           Wally smiles to herself. Those words mean a lot.  

           INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

           This place is cheesy and trashy and fun as hell. Max watches 
           a DRUNK GIRL on a small stage belt out some ballad. Badly.

           Wally comes up, putting away her phone. She sits with Max.  

                                 WALLY
                        Sandra saw Glenn at Jessica’s 
                        birthday and he wanted to know if I 
                        was into someone else, or if he 
                        actually asked me to be his 
                        girlfriend, if I’d say yes. 
                                 MAX
                             (hesitantly)
                        And would you?

                                 WALLY
                        Yeah.

           Max seems disappointed.

                                 WALLY (CONT’D)
                        If he accidentally switched bodies 
                        with someone with a better 
                        personality. As is? I don’t think 
                        he’d ever take me dancing.  

                                 MAX
                        That’s my girl.

                                 WALLY
                        These fries are not good enough to 
                        warrant this ear torture. How is 
                        this not giving you a headache?

                                 MAX
                        Not enjoying Krystal’s Bon Jovi?

                                 WALLY
                        We could be in Mississippi by now. 
                        The sooner we get back, the less 
                        chance you have to chicken out.

                                 MAX
                        I’m not going to chicken out. We’ll 
                        be on the road first thing in the 
                        morning when we get the car back.

                                 WALLY
                        We hit a stop sign, the car’s fine. 
                        You didn’t need to get it checked 
                        out.

                                 MAX
                        It must really suck for you that 
                        I’m in charge.

                                 WALLY
                        Can we at least go somewhere that 
                        doesn’t have...this? 

           The Drunk Girl belts out her final notes. Her drunk friends 
           shriek and clap for her.

                                 MAX
                        That would defeat the purpose.
                                 WALLY
                        You know I have sensitive eardrums.

                                 CHEESY DJ
                        And next up, we’ve got Max. Come on 
                        up, man, show us a thing or two.

                                 WALLY
                        Wait, really?

                                 MAX
                        You’ve lit a fire in me, kid.

                                 WALLY
                        Good, now we match. 

           Excited, Wally moves to the edge of the stage where the drunk 
           girls were congregated. Max grabs the mic from the DJ.

                                 CHEESY DJ
                        Let’s hear your Frank, Max.

           The music for Sinatra’s “I Get A Kick Out Of You” starts.

                                 MAX
                        I get no kick from champagne! Mere 
                        alcohol doesn’t thrill me at all, 
                        so tell me why should it be true... 
                        That I get a kick out of you?

           He winks at Wally. She smiles wide. Because he’s amazing. 
           He’s got presence and style and a great voice. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        Some like the bop-type refrain... 
                        I’m sure that if I heard even one 
                        riff, it would bore me terrifically 
                        too...Yet I get a kick out of you.

           Wally claps and cheers him on. The rest of the bar patrons 
           seem to be enjoying it as well. 

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I get a kick every time I see you 
                        standing there before me...I get a 
                        kick though it’s clear to me you 
                        obviously don’t adore me. I get no 
                        kick in a plane...Flying too high 
                        with some gal in the sky is my idea 
                        of nothing to do...Yet I get a kick 
                        out of you...

           During the interlude, Max dances. Works the crowd. Is goofy 
           and owns it. A giddy Wally can’t take her eyes off him. 
                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        In that moment, I knew there was no 
                        way my dad was dying. He was coming 
                        alive. And watching him transform 
                        right before my eyes, my heart 
                        couldn’t have been fuller of pride 
                        or love. 

           We start to hear WALLY’S HEARTBEAT POUNDING in her ears. 

                                 MAX
                        I get a kick every time I see you 
                        standing there before me...

           From Wally’s POV, eyes locked on Max, things start to blur.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        I get a kick though it’s clear to 
                        me you obviously do not adore me...

           Max is grinning and singing right to Wally, but the sound of 
           his voice fades to her as her HEART POUNDS louder and louder.

           Her vision’s going blurrier. She blinks, tries to focus. All 
           she can see is his face. Her HEARTBEAT SLOWS, everything else 
           looks and sounds warped, the last thing she sees is Max’s 
           smiling face as everything goes fuzzy and we -- 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        I said you weren’t gonna like the 
                        way my story ends.

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           It’s a funeral. We see Sandra and her PARENTS. Guy and 
           Samuel. Glenn. A bunch of teenagers. And then...Max. 

           It’s Wally’s funeral.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Remember when I used to think that 
                        when my heart was racing or my 
                        breathing was weird or I passed 
                        out, it was because I was so in 
                        love with Glenn McGarry? 

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Wally plays goalie. Someone kicks the ball straight at her. 
           IN SLOW-MOTION, it flies, hits her square in the chest.
                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Meet hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 
                        It means the lining of my heart 
                        walls was thick and evidently my 
                        heart could stop at any moment.

           Glenn kisses her. She starts to pass out. 

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        It’s mostly asymptomatic. I had a 
                        few warning signs. But how was I 
                        supposed to know back then that 
                        Glenn McGarry wasn’t actually 
                        making my heart leap?

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT

           Wally’s casket is lowered into the ground. One by one people 
           say their final words, toss their flowers down on it.  

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Dying at 16? Obviously that could 
                        have gone better for me. But do you 
                        know how much more it would have 
                        sucked if I’d gone out a week 
                        earlier?

           Max is the last one left. He’s a shell of a man. He stares 
           down at the grave for a long time.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Because at least before I died, I 
                        did figure out who I wanted to be. 
                        My father’s daughter. And this way, 
                        I got the chance to become her.
                             (beat)
                        You might think that’s cheesy, but 
                        come on, are you seriously gonna 
                        judge a dead girl?

           Finally, Max tosses his flower. But a gust of wind blows it 
           back in his face. That’s weird. It’s not windy. He tries 
           again. The same thing happens. 

           He looks up to the sky, to Wally, somewhere out there. 

                                 MAX
                        You always get your way, don’t you, 
                        Walls.

           Predictably, there’s no response. Regardless, Max kisses the 
           flower and sticks it in his lapel. 
                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Maybe you’re not sold on my story 
                        being okay. Whatever, that’s up to 
                        you. But I want you to look at my 
                        dad. He’s only in the middle of his 
                        story. 

           INT. POTTER HOUSE - WALLY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           An unkempt Max lies on Wally’s bed. He stares blankly. You 
           get the feeling he’s been there a long time.

           A NEWSCAST playing from the TV he’s paying no attention to 
           tells us it’s OCTOBER.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Things are gonna be hard for him 
                        for a while, I’m not gonna lie. 

           The DOORBELL rings. Max glances apathetically in the 
           direction of the hallway. Doesn’t move.

           The DOORBELL rings again. Max forces himself to get up.

           INT./EXT. POTTER HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Max opens the door -- and finds himself face to face with 
           Wallis. He just stares, waits for her to speak.

                                 WALLIS
                        I was in the neighborhood.

                                 MAX
                        What do you want?

                                 WALLIS
                        How are you doing?

                                 MAX
                        I’m not in the mood to talk.

                                 WALLIS
                        I was here for a meeting, I’m 
                        flying home on the red-eye, but I 
                        just wanted to check on you. You 
                        don’t look good. Are you eating?

                                 MAX
                        Haven’t had much of an appetite.

                                 WALLIS
                        She would have wanted you to... 
                                 MAX
                        Don’t tell me what she would have 
                        wanted.

                                 WALLIS
                        I just can’t imagine someone who 
                        loved you would want you to be 
                        miserable for...the time you have 
                        left.

           He soaks in the words, an unreadable expression on his face.

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll always regret not meeting her 
                        when you gave me the chance.

           Still nothing from Max.

                                 WALLIS (CONT’D)
                        Alright, well...goodbye, Max. 
                        Please take care of yourself.

           She walks away. Max watches her go, then:

                                 MAX
                        Wallis!

           Wallis turns around. He holds up a finger -- wait a sec -- 
           and disappears into the house. 

           He comes back a few moments later with his wallet in hand.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        You know she learned all the words 
                        to Biggie’s “10 Crack Commandments” 
                        when she was 12? I didn’t approve 
                        of it, but I was impressed by it. 
                        She wouldn’t watch Casablanca but 
                        owned six of The Land Before Time 
                        movies. Six of them. She was 
                        grossed out by tomatoes, went 
                        through an inexplicable two-year 
                        Keanu Reeves phase and would never 
                        admit it, but was bored by anyone 
                        who let her win arguments.
                             (beat)
                        You should regret not meeting her. 

           He pulls WALLY’S SCHOOL PHOTO from his wallet and hands it to 
           her.

                                 MAX (CONT’D)
                        From now on, take the chances you 
                        get. 
           Finally, his expression is clear: unwavering determination.

           INT. HOSPITAL - DR. LIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Max sits across from Dr. Lin.

                                 DR. LIN
                        I just want to one more time talk 
                        you through the associated risks --

                                 MAX
                        Scared money doesn’t win.

           INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           A SURGICAL TEAM operates on Max’s head.

                                 DR. LIN
                        He said if he doesn’t survive this, 
                        we’ll all be haunted by the ghost 
                        of an angry 16-year-old girl.

                                 SURGEON
                        Huh. Well, I’ve got two teenage 
                        daughters at home so I don’t need 
                        another driving me crazy. Let’s 
                        make sure we get these edges.

           As they continue their work, blood spurts unexpectedly.

                                 SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        I need suction.

           MONITORS BEEP, the surgeon works furiously to find the bleed.

                                 SURGEON (CONT’D)
                        I can’t see anything, more suction!

           As the team goes into frenzy mode -- 

                                 DR. LIN
                        Don’t go there, Max, stay out of 
                        the light! 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Light streams in from outside. Max groggily opens his eyes, 
           blinking at the brightness.

                                 GUY
                        How you feeling, boy-o?
           Max looks up, sees a disheveled Guy sitting next to him. 
           Samuel sleeps, draped across several chairs. 

                                 MAX
                        Am I dead?

                                 GUY
                        Does your afterlife really involve 
                        me going two days without a shower 
                        and Prince Charming here drooling 
                        on a plastic seat?

           Max lets out a sigh of relief. 

                                 GUY (CONT’D)
                        Now they have to radiate you and 
                        keep checking your head every few 
                        months. But for now you’re fine. 
                        Although don’t have too many happy 
                        thoughts all at once, you might pop 
                        your stitches. 

           Max looks at a framed photo of him and Wally next to his bed -
           - a self-portrait from the crawfish place. He’s grateful. 
           Sad. Alive. 

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        This’ll really be where my dad’s 
                        story takes an upward turn. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           It’s a beautiful summer day. Max adjusts a bright wreath he’s 
           hanging on Wally’s headstone. When he steps back, we see a 
           small note card on the wreath reads, “I didn’t lie to you.”

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        Because I’m not the only one who 
                        discovered him on our road trip.

           Max stands for a moment, just thinking. 

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Max takes a seat behind a microphone with his guitar. He 
           looks out at everyone. They’re talking, drinking, doing other 
           things. This isn’t to make a living...this is just for him.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        He rediscovered himself.

           He starts to play “HARD-HEADED WOMAN” by Cat Stevens.
                                 MAX
                        I’m looking for a hard-headed woman
                        One who will take me for myself
                        And if I find my hard-headed woman
                        I won’t need nobody else, no, no, 
                        no...

           Someone comes and sits at a table right in front of him. He 
           looks down as he continues to sing...it’s good old Annie. Max 
           is surprised to see her. She eyes him, curiously, then starts 
           to scribble something on a coaster.   

           She holds it up: “I thought you didn’t sing.” She cocks an 
           eyebrow, a little smug. Max smiles and keeps playing...

           EXT. TEXAS FIELD - NIGHT

           A clear, starry sky. A meteor streaks across it.

           We’re at that old Texas field. The same crew from before is 
           watching this meteor shower -- Hunter and Jen, Q, Rusty and a 
           WOMAN with a TODDLER. They’re all a few years older.

           They see headlights and look in the direction they’re coming 
           from. A CAR stops...and Max, Guy, and Samuel get out.

                                 GUY
                        I was secretly hoping that when you 
                        said “a field in the middle of 
                        nowhere,” it was the name of a hip 
                        and trendy club.

                                 MAX
                        Sorry to disappoint. 

                                 SAMUEL
                        You didn’t say there would be cute 
                        boys in stranglers.

                                 GUY
                        Rein it in, Samuel.

           Max eyes the Texas friends, who still watch them curiously.

                                 MAX
                        Hi.

                                 RUSTY
                        Evening.

                                 MAX
                        You probably don’t remember me. 
                        It’s better that you don’t. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAX (CONT'D)
                        We heard there was going to be a 
                        meteor shower and wanted to come 
                        see it. Mind if we join?

                                 RUSTY
                        It’s everyone’s sky. Beer?

           He offers them what’s left of a six-pack. Max takes them.

                                 MAX
                        Thanks. 

                                 JEN
                        Look, now they’re really comin’.

           Everyone looks up. 

                                 RUSTY
                        Ain’t that somethin’, Caroline?

           A meteor streaks across the sky, followed closely by another, 
           and another. Everyone oohs and aahs.

           Max doesn’t blink, can’t take his eyes away from the light 
           searing through the darkness.

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        What I’m saying is, my dad’s 
                        story’s gonna be a good and long 
                        one.

                                 RUSTY
                        Y’all ever seen anything like it?

           A speechless Max shakes his head. 

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        And with time, I think you’re gonna 
                        really like his story, too.

           Max watches one meteor that seems brighter and bigger than 
           the rest. As we watch him, his face glowing with awe, we...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           There’s a few seconds of silence. Then, OVER BLACK:

                                 WALLY (V.O.)
                        See, Dad? I know it’s not all about 
                        me.

           And with that, we’ve reached...

                                         THE END.
