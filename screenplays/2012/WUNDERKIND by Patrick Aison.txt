           TITLE CARD: NORDHAUSEN, GERMANY 1944

           NAZI OFFICERS crowd around a tin shed in an open field. 

           Using binoculars they watch a TECHNICIAN run from the base of 
           a SIXTY-FOOT ROCKET to a blast shelter nearby. 

                                 VOICE OVER RADIO (O.S.)
                        Four. Three. Two. One. Ignition.

           A giant rush of flame licks out from beneath the rocket as it 
           slowly rises and arcs up into the night sky. 

           Illuminated by the rocket’s blast, a smile creeps across the 
           face of KARL DREXLER, 40, a tall man with an arrogant face. 

           Drexler lowers his binoculars and nudges the man next to him, 
           S.S. OFFICER FRANZ FOLTERN, 50, with the face of a thug. A 
           scar runs across his left eye. 

                                 FRANZ FOLTERN
                        Merry Christmas, Mr. Churchill.

           The Nazis laugh -- all but one. JULIUS HEINRICH, 23, he is 
           the only man not dressed in uniform. Heinrich is way younger 
           than the others. 

           He watches the rocket intently with no expression then lowers 
           his field glasses and taps his watch as he counts.

                                 HEINRICH
                        Twenty-two, three, four. Now.

           He points up to the rocket. It glides through the sky. 
           Heinrich cocks his head to the side, Drexler smiles. 

           Suddenly the rocket EXPLODES IN A GIANT FIREBALL.

           The OFFICERS cringe, Heinrich smirks.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Very good, it made it into the 
                        third stage by three seconds.

           Drexler is furious, he clenches his jaw.

           Heinrich signals to an AIDE, who pulls up in a VOLKSWAGON
           JEEP and whisks him away.

           Drexler grabs his hat and smacks a JUNIOR OFFICER with it.
                                 DREXLER
                        Goddamnit! 

           The other officers watch in fear as Drexler accosts the man.

                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        Why is the altitude gauge still 
                        failing? 

           Foltern grabs Drexler’s arm and leads him out of the shed.

                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        Elevation, it’s a simple fucking
                        principle!
                              (to Foltern)
                        And who is this child to tell me 
                        how to do my job? I have socks that 
                        are older than him.

           Drexler throws his hat in the dirt and stomps on it.

                                 FRANZ FOLTERN
                        The Fuhrer sent Herr Heinrich, 
                        however young, to bring your camp 
                        up to speed. I think we ought to 
                        trust him. Or do you disagree with 
                        his choice?

           Drexler looks into Foltern’s grizzled face and regains his 
           composure.

                                 DREXLER
                        No, of course not. Thank you, 
                        Franz.

           Foltern stares Drexler in the eye for a beat then walks away. 

           Drexler picks up his hat and dusts it off.

           EXT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, RAIL YARD - DAY

           A FREIGHT TRAIN grinds to a halt and TWO NAZI SOLDIERS open 
           the doors. 

           As the TIRED MEN fall out of the train they peer up into the 
           night sky.

           A thin line of flame trails a rocket as it climbs then 
           suddenly EXPLODES.

           A STRAGGLER trips in the mud. A SOLDIER kicks him. When he 
           doesn’t rise the soldier lifts him back on the train.
                                 NAZI SERGEANT
                        Line up now, quickly! Men who have 
                        experience with machinery here, men 
                        who have experience with books 
                        here. 

           ARIEL BRAUER, 23, stout and handsome with a warm face, looks 
           back at the boxcar. 

           Ari watches as JACOB STONE, 40s, steps off the train. Jacob 
           surveys the scene calmly. 

           He pulls off his reading glasses and drops them in the mud.

                                 NAZI SERGEANT (cont’d)
                        Books here! Machinery here!

           Jacob gets in the machinery line. Ari follows him.

           FOLTERN walks between the two lines examining the men. He 
           nods to the sergeant.

                                 NAZI SERGEANT (cont’d)
                        Book men, back on the train!

           Ari watches as the confused men climb back onto the train, 
           one BOOK MAN stops halfway up.

                                 BOOK MAN
                        I have both. I’m an accountant but 
                        I was raised on a farm.

           Foltern approaches with a crooked grin.

                                 FRANZ FOLTERN
                        They need all the accountants they 
                        can get at the next stop. 

           He grabs the man’s face and shoves him back into the train. 
           TWO SOLDIERS bolt the door shut.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, PRISONERS’ BARRACKS - DAY 

           Ari pulls his striped laborer's uniform over his head. The 
           dirty fabric chafes the fresh serial number tattooed on his 
           forearm.

                                 JACOB (O.S.)
                        When you’re on the assembly line, 
                        put packing grease on it.

           Ari looks at him with curiosity. Jacob is filthy from a shift 
           in the plant.
           Jacob shows Ari his forearm, it’s smeared with grease.

           He takes Ari’s arm and looks at the serial number. 777429.

                                 JACOB (cont’d)
                        777. You know chemistry?

                                 ARI
                        My family ran a brewery.

                                 JACOB
                        400 level, you went to University?

           Ari nods.

                                 JACOB (cont’d)
                        They’ll put you in charge of a 
                        crew.

           Ari looks at the number on his arm.

                                 JACOB (cont’d)
                        Hungry?

                                 ARI
                        Eh, I could maybe make room for 
                        something small.

           Jacob cracks a tiny smile. He hands Ari a bread crust from 
           inside his uniform and Ari wolfs it down.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY

           TITLE CARD: 6 MONTHS LATER

           The hangar is filled with machinery. JEWISH PRISONERS toil to 
           assemble engine components under the watchful eye of NAZI 
           TECHNICIANS. 

           Looking exhausted, Ari checks a gauge on a tank marked 
           FLAMMABLE and turns a valve, releasing pressure with a HISS.

           Jacob approaches holding a clipboard and the two exchange a 
           knowing glance.

           Jacob looks at a PRISONER seated a few feet away attaching a  
           vane to a rocket. Next to him is a bucket of rivets. 

           Jacob signals to him with a slight nod.

           The prisoner intentionally pinches his hand in the riveter 
           and SCREAMS out in pain. 
           He deliberately kicks the bucket of rivets, scattering the 
           metal pieces all over the floor.

           A TECHNICIAN and THREE SOLDIERS quickly surround the man. The 
           technician slaps the man across the face, grabs a soldier’s 
           club and beats him.

           Checking that the Nazis are distracted, Jacob reaches into 
           his pants and removes a bottle of blue liquid. 

           He opens a fuel tank and pours in the contents of the bottle.

           The Nazis finish abusing the prisoner and he scrambles on the 
           floor picking up the rivets.

           Jacob bends down to help the man grab a rivet from under the 
           tank. When he rises, Julius Heinrich is standing in front of 
           him along with TWO SOLDIERS. 

           Jacob lowers his eyes. Heinrich reaches his hand down the 
           front of Jacob’s pants and removes the empty bottle.  He 
           drops it on the floor. It shatters. 

           Heinrich pulls a pistol from his suit jacket and shoots Jacob 
           in the temple, killing him instantly.

                                 HEINRICH
                        If the next launch fails, I’ll kill 
                        every one of you.

           Heinrich exits without another word.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, PRISONERS’ BARRACKS - NIGHT

           The crowded room is filled with silent expectation. TWO MEN 
           struggle to hold Ari so that he can peer through a crack in 
           the roof. 

                                 NERVOUS PRISONER
                        Has it gone yet?

           An OLD PRISONER on a top bunk near Ari SHUSHES him. 

                                 NERVOUS PRISONER (cont’d)
                        He can’t kill us all, who will work 
                        the plant for him? He needs us. 

           Ari looks down at the man -- that’s bullshit and you know it.

           The nervous prisoner stares at the floor and MUMBLES.

           ARI’S POV: THROUGH THE CRACK HE WATCHES THE ROCKET TEAR 
           THROUGH THE NIGHT SKY AND DISAPPEAR OVER THE HORIZON.
           Ari gestures and the men lower him. The nervous prisoner 
           stands in front of him.

                                 NERVOUS PRISONER (cont’d)
                        Did it work? Did it fly?

           Ari nods to him. The nervous prisoner drops to his knees and 
           starts davening.

                                 ARI
                        When you’re done thanking him I 
                        hope you beg his forgiveness. 

           He pushes the prisoner aside and climbs into his own bunk.

           INT. PRISONERS’ BARRACKS, NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY - NIGHT

           Ari lays awake staring up. The men are all sleeping.  

           Suddenly a LOUD LAUGH rumbles in from outside. The men stir.

           The door bursts open and FRANZ FOLTERN enters with a NAZI 
           OFFICER carrying a SOMETHING HEAVY wrapped in a sheet. 
           Foltern is beside himself with laughter.

                                 FRANZ FOLTERN
                        A little thank you gift, my Hebrew 
                        friends. 

           The officer whips off the sheet revealing a half eaten 
           roasted hog, the apple still in its mouth.

           Foltern and the officer exit the barracks in hysterics.

           The prisoners slowly climb out of their racks and surround 
           the pork staring down at it. 

           In the front of the circle, the Old Prisoner looks at Ari and 
           then addresses the others.

                                 OLD PRISONER
                        No one touches it! We won’t give 
                        them the satisfaction.

           The men slowly nod, some grumble but all back away.

           Ari tears a hunk of meat off and stuffs it in his mouth. He 
           pulls the apple and tosses it to the old man.

                                 ARI
                        Fuck them, I’m hungry.
           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, OFFICERS’ MESS HALL - NIGHT

           The Nazis sit around a long table covered with a feast. 
           Heinrich is at one end, Dr. Drexler at the other. 

                                 YOUNG OFFICER
                        ... for them it’s cannibalism!

           The table erupts with laughter. Heinrich only smiles 
           politely.

                                 DREXLER
                        Congratulations, your plant is 
                        running at full efficiency.

           The officers all raise their glasses. Heinrich doesn’t have a  
           drink in front of him.

                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        Have some champagne, sir. You’re 
                        old enough to drink, aren’t you?

           The table goes silent as all eyes are on Heinrich. 

           Finally he cracks a wide smile. He signals for the young 
           officer to pour him a glass.

                                 HEINRICH
                        Here’s to your plant, Doctor. May 
                        the rest of the Fuhrer's efforts go 
                        as well.

           The officers all CHEER and guzzle champagne. 

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        I’d like to take a photograph on 
                        this momentous occasion. 

           Heinrich stands and holds up a shiny new CAMERA.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        A present from my fiancee. 

           He gestures for all the officers to crowd together at the far 
           end of the table around Dr. Drexler.

                                 DREXLER
                        She must be very in love, to give 
                        such an expensive gift. I never 
                        knew what happiness was until I got 
                        married. And then it was too late!

           Big laughs all around. 
                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        Everybody smile for the nice girl.

           The Nazis grin for the camera and the bulb flashes.

           EXT. OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           TITLE CARD: BRAZIL 1973

           A RED PICK-UP TRUCK is parked next to a barbed wire fence on 
           a long stretch of empty road surrounded by ranch land.

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           In his scarred hand, the driver grips a worn copy of the 
           photograph of the Nazi dinner at Nordhausen.

           The hand belongs to Ariel Brauer, now in his 50's, a lion of 
           a man, his appearance forged by a life of war. 

           His Nordhausen serial number, 777429, is still legible on his 
           forearm. Ari is wearing a cowboy hat and a pair of coveralls 
           crusted with red dirt.

           CLOSE ON PHOTO: The arrogant smiles of the Nazi officers.

           Ari tosses the photo on the seat next to him. He shakes a 
           smoke out of a soft pack and lights it. 

           He grabs a pair of binoculars and gazes at the gate of a 
           ranch a mile south of where he’s parked.

                                 WALKIE TALKIE (V.O.)
                              (Hebrew / subtitles)
                        First position, check in.

           Ari flicks a long ash off the end of his cigarette.

                                 WALKIE TALKIE (V.O.)
                              (Hebrew / subtitles)
                        First position, check in. Repeat, 
                        first position, check in.

           He sets the binoculars down, reaches under the seat slowly 
           and picks up the walkie. 

                                 ARI
                        Sargeant Noar, we have two rules 
                        for the radio. One, always use 
                        English, there’s only one military 
                        in the world that speaks Hebrew. 
                        And two, never use the radio. 
           Ari switches the walkie off and puts it back under the seat. 
           He picks up the field glasses and settles in for the wait.

           INT. WAITING ROOM, SHERIFF’S OFFICE, RURAL BRAZIL - DAY

           The kind of place where disputes over livestock are settled. 
           The only thing that isn’t covered in a layer of dirt is the 
           MIDDLE-AGED SECRETARY.

           AGENT SAMUEL BRAUER, 27, waits on a bench. Sam is handsome 
           and athletic but modest, he has the kind of disarming smile 
           that might even win over the lady at the DMV, but he’s not 
           having any luck with this one. 

           Sam looks over at the secretary who’s leafing through a 
           Brazilian tabloid and deliberately ignoring him. 

           He opens a MANILA ENVELOPE and withdraws a copy of the same 
           Nordhausen photo. His copy is marked: CONFIDENTIAL - PROPERTY 
           OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY.

           On this print all the Nazis have the word DECEASED stamped 
           over their faces except for one: Franz Foltern.

           He pulls out ANOTHER PHOTO, this one in color. It shows a 
           white-haired man getting out of a new Mercedes. The man has a 
           deep scar running through his left eye -- it’s FRANZ FOLTERN, 
           30 years later.

                                 SAM
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Do you expect he’ll be much longer, 
                        Miss? It’s been an hour.

           The secretary doesn’t take her eyes off her magazine.

                                 SECRETARY
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        He’s in a very important meeting.

           Sam gets up and puts his sunglasses on.

                                 SAM
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Please tell him I’ll be back in a 
                        few hours.

           She nods and Sam exits.

           EXT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE, RURAL BRAZIL - DAY

           Sam looks at the brand new CORVETTE STINGRAY parked next to 
           the office. The shiny sports car looks out of place in the 
           dusty lot.
           Sam walks around the old one story building and stands by an 
           open window.

           He tucks the manila envelope into his waistband, grabs the 
           ledge and jumps up through the window.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE, RURAL BRAZIL - CONTINUOUS

           Sam lands on his feet with a LOUD THUMP.

           The LOCAL SHERIFF, 40’s, takes no shit, has his cowboy boots 
           up on his desk and is leafing through a CATALOGUE OF CAR 
           STEREOS. He is unfazed by Sam’s abrupt entrance. 

                                 SAM
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        I need to talk to you.

           The secretary charges in, stumbling on her high heels.

           Sam looks at the stereo catalogue.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        I realize you’re a busy guy but 
                        this is urgent.

           Moving as little as possible the sheriff lowers the stereo 
           catalogue and waves the secretary out.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Sit please.

                                 SAM
                        You speak English.

           The sheriff smiles, showing some gold rimmed teeth.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Better than you speak Portuguese. 

           Sam sits. He pulls out the recent photo of Foltern.

                                 SAM
                        I’m looking for this man.

           The sheriff lowers his boots off the desk, leans forward and 
           takes a quick glance at the photo.

                                 SHERIFF
                        I’ve never seen him before.
                                 SAM
                        He’s German. Does vehicle import 
                        and export. Maybe you ought to take 
                        another look at the photo to be 
                        sure. 

           The sheriff’s self-satisfied smiles grows.

                                 SHERIFF
                        I am sure.

                                 SAM
                        He’s been renting land in your 
                        county for two years. Keeps his 
                        cars on it while he’s waiting for 
                        them to clear customs. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Many people rent land in my county. 
                        It is not as small as you might 
                        think.

                                 SAM
                        No, it’s quite large. In fact this 
                        particular man hasn’t left your 
                        county in over 18 months. But he’s 
                        going to in about an hour.

                                 SHERIFF
                        And?

                                 SAM
                        I need to ask him some questions. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        What kind of questions?

                                 SAM
                        He can help me find another man 
                        I’ve been looking for, for even 
                        longer.

                                 SHERIFF
                        What do you want from me?

                                 SAM
                        When I come into another man’s 
                        jurisdiction, snatch up one of his 
                        citizens, throw a sack over his 
                        head and drag back with me I like 
                        to notify the local authorities. 

           The sheriff’s eyes narrow.
                                 SHERIFF
                        And why would I let you do this?

           Sam gets up and walks to the window behind the sheriff’s 
           desk. The sheriff watches with annoyed curiosity as Sam 
           crowds his personal space.

           Sam flips open the blinds. He looks at the Corvette.

                                 SAM
                        Thing about this guy is, turns out 
                        some of his cars have been, let’s 
                        say, borrowed long term without 
                        permission.

           An uneasy look flashes across the sheriff’s face.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Your vette come with the stock 
                        stereo?

           Sam reaches over the sheriff, grabs the car stereo catalogue 
           off the desk and leafs through it.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        G.M, can’t make a radio for shit, 
                        can they? 

           Sam places a FAT KNOT of hundred dollar bills on the desk.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        What do you say you give me a hand 
                        with my German friend and I’ll get 
                        you a new one? And of course, no 
                        need to check the VIN on the 
                        Stingray.

           The sheriff looks at the money for a beat. 

                                 SHERIFF
                        Let me see your photo again.

                                 SAM
                        Take a look at this one, it’s even 
                        better.

           Sam hands him ANOTHER PHOTO. In it the sheriff stands in 
           front of the Corvette as Foltern hands him the keys. 

           The sheriff’s eyes dart from the photo to Sam. His smug look 
           falls from his face. 
           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Ari listens to Samba music on the truck’s radio and watches 
           the ranch driveway through his binoculars.

           Suddenly A NEW MERCEDES SEDAN barrels down the ranch 
           driveway, a dust cloud filling the sky in its wake.

           Ari’s face lights up. He turns up the music and puts the 
           truck in gear.

           INT. CORVETTE - OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           The old two-lane highway is very narrow and bordered on both 
           sides by fences that come right up the side of the asphalt.

           The sheriff drives, Sam rides shotgun. They’re going 1000 
           miles an hour and Sam is watching the road intently.

           The sheriff opens his window, slaps a flashing light on the 
           roof of the Stingray and winks at Sam.

                                 SHERIFF
                        It’s a great car.

           Sam nods and points out the windshield. The sheriff puts his 
           eyes back on the road just in time to swerve around a STATION 
           WAGON from the 50’s.

                                 SHERIFF (cont’d)
                        What time did you say was his 
                        flight?

                                 SAM
                        Noon. But I can’t take him at the 
                        airport. 

           The sheriff looks at the clock in the dash. It’s 11:30.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Not a problem.

           He guns the engine and passes an OLD JEEP.

                                 SHERIFF (cont’d)
                        Why didn’t you just show me the 
                        photograph? You knew I would be 
                        forced to help.

                                 SAM
                        That would have been rude.

           The sheriff shows his gold teeth again.
           They come up behind a CONVOY OF FARM TRUCKS HAULING BANANAS 
           and the sheriff steers into the opposing lane to pass. 

           The Stingray jets past a BANANA TRUCK and Sam grips the door 
           handle tight.

                                 SHERIFF
                        The German, he was a Nazi?

                                 SAM
                        That’s right.

           The Corvette is almost past the LEAD TRUCK from the convoy 
           when a BUS approaches head on. At the last second the sheriff 
           relents and swerves back into their lane behind the truck.

                                 SHERIFF
                        And you just want to question him? 
                        I won’t let you kill him, not for 
                        any amount of money. I don’t care 
                        how the CIA thinks it works down 
                        here.

           The sheriff dips back into the opposing lane and guns it past 
           the FINAL BANANA TRUCK.

           Sam pries his eyes from the road and looks at the sheriff.

                                 SAM
                        I need him alive, I’m looking for 
                        his old boss.

           EXT. OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Ari’s red pick-up cruises on the old two-lane black-top.

           Up ahead the clean new Mercedes sedan motors along.

           Ahead of them is a LONG CONVOY OF CATTLE TRUCKS.

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Ari watches the Mercedes pull up to the rear bumper of the 
           last CATTLE TRUCK in the convoy. Its brake lights flicker.

                                 ARI
                        You don’t have the balls.

           The Mercedes swerves out into the opposing traffic lane and 
           passes the truck.

           Ari shrugs appreciatively. He grips the wheel with both hands 
           and puts the pedal to the metal.
           EXT. OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           The Mercedes works its way to the front of the convoy, 
           speeding past the CATTLE TRUCKS one at a time, dipping back 
           into the lane as it overtakes each of them.

           Ari stays one truck distance behind the Mercedes as he fights 
           through the convoy.

           INT. FOLTERN’S MERCEDES, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY

           The DRIVER of the sedan is a YOUNG DARK-SKINNED BRAZILIAN. 
           FRANZ FOLTERN is in the seat next to him. An OLD WHITE WOMAN 
           dozes in the backseat.

           The driver pulls out beside the FRONT TRUCK of the convoy. 

           He looks out the side window past Foltern in the passenger 
           seat and into the BLOODSHOT EYES OF A BULL staring out of the 
           cattle carrier. 

           Foltern smacks his arm and the driver looks out the 
           windshield just in time to pull back behind the LEAD TRUCK 
           and avoid colliding with an APPROACHING CAR.

           Foltern gives the driver a stern look.

           As the driver pulls back into his lane, Ari gets in front of 
           the truck the Mercedes just passed and pulls up behind 
           Foltern’s car. 

           INT. CORVETTE - OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           The sheriff looks at Sam checking his watch.

                                 SHERIFF
                        This is the only road to the 
                        airport. Relax, we’ll make it.

           Sam nods. Coming at them on the opposite side of the road is 
           the CONVOY OF CATTLE TRUCKS.

           When the Corvette is two hundred yards from the grille of the 
           LEAD TRUCK in the cattle convoy the Mercedes swerves out into 
           their lane and passes.

           Sam whips his head around and looks back at the Mercedes.

                                 SAM
                        That’s him!

           The sheriff taps his brakes. 
                                 SHERIFF
                        I know.

           Suddenly Ari’s red pick-up swerves out into their lane.

           Ari’s pick-up is twenty feet in front of the sheriff’s 
           Stingray, and they are both going over 90 miles an hour.

           Sam and Ari lock eyes. A smile flashes across Ari’s face. 

           They are going to collide.

           At the last second Ari clears the lead truck, jerks back into 
           his own lane and misses the sheriff’s bumper by inches.

           The lead truck blares its AIR HORN.

           The sheriff swerves off the side of the pavement, smashing 
           the side of the Corvette into a fence.

                                 SHERIFF (cont’d)
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        MOTHERFUCKER!

           The sheriff grinds the Corvette off the fence but before he 
           can turn around, the convoy of banana trucks he just passed 
           has to pass him. 

           The sheriff waits in silent rage.

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Ari looks in the rearview mirror and chuckles.

           He cranks the stereo up so loud that the drum beats make the 
           rearview mirror shake.

           He spots a helicopter floating above the vast stretches of 
           ranch land before him. 

           Ari reaches under the seat, grabs his walkie and turns it on.

           He guns the engine and pulls up behind the Mercedes.

           INT. CORVETTE - OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           As the last banana truck passes, the sheriff flips a bitch 
           and floors it.

                                 SAM
                        You’d better hurry if you don’t 
                        want Foltern to be killed now.
                                 SHERIFF
                        The man in the truck?

                                 SAM
                        Yes.

                                 SHERIFF
                        You know him?

                                 SAM
                        Unfortunately.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Does he work for your agency?

                                 SAM
                        He works for Mossad.

           The sheriff glances at Sam confused.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Israeli.

                                 SHERIFF
                        You are sure, you only saw him for 
                        a moment?

           Sam pulls an automatic PISTOL from his waistband.

                                 SAM
                        He’s my father.

           The sheriff looks at Sam, then at the pistol in his hand.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        We don’t get along.

           INT. FOLTERN’S MERCEDES, OLD INTERSTATE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY

           Ari speeds forward and pulls up next to the Mercedes.

           The driver smiles at Ari when he hears the music blaring out 
           of the pick-up. Ari smiles back.

           Foltern gives his driver a disapproving look.

           Maintaining the same speed as the Mercedes, Ari gestures at 
           the driver to roll down his window.

           Nervously checking the road ahead for oncoming traffic, the 
           driver rolls down the window.

           He is confused when Ari continues to gesture, pointing 
           downward.
                                 DRIVER
                              (yelling)
                        Que?

           Ari pulls out an UZI SUBMACHINEGUN and aims it at the 
           Mercedes.

           The terrified driver ducks his head and Ari fires into the 
           Mercedes, riddling the old white man with bullets.

           In the backseat the old woman wakes SCREAMING.

           The Mercedes swerves off the road and crashes into a barbed 
           wire fence.

           The driver gets out of the sedan and runs.

           Ari slams on his brakes, reverses back to the Mercedes and 
           calmly gets out of the pick-up.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Ari drops the clip out of the Uzi and reloads. He walks over 
           to the driver’s side door and reaches in.

           As Ari grabs Foltern by the shirt collar, the old woman slaps 
           him. 

           He grabs her wrist and deftly cinches a short length of cord 
           around it. He jerks her forward and binds the other end of 
           the cord around the front seat’s headrest.

                                 ARI
                              (German / subtitles)
                        I’m not here for you, sweetheart. 

           She backs off whimpering and Ari drags Foltern out onto the 
           dirt and knocks the sunglasses off his face. 

           Ari takes a fresh copy of the Nordhausen photo and pins it to 
           Foltern’s shirt.

           CLOSE ON PHOTO: Franz Foltern’s face has been circled.

           Foltern looks up at Ari and coughs blood into his white 
           beard.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                              (German / subtitles)
                        Good to see you again, Franz.

           Ari fires a single round into Foltern’s forehead and walks 
           back to his truck.
           From inside the pick-up the walkie-talkie is calling out.

                                 WALKIE TALKIE (O.S.)
                        Police vehicle inbound! Police 
                        vehicle quarter kilometer!

           Ari looks at the road and sees the sheriff’s Corvette bearing 
           down on him with its light flashing.

           He hops back into the truck smiling.

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY

           He puts the truck in gear and rams the barbed wire fence that 
           separates the old highway from the ranch that surrounds it. 

           Ari looks out the window and sees the sheriff’s Corvette 
           getting closer. 

           Ari’s truck is stuck on the fence. He grinds into reverse and 
           backs off.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           The sheriff arrives and jumps out of the car, pointing his 
           revolver at Ari from behind his door.

           Sam bolts out of the Stingray and runs over to Foltern.

           Ari slams the truck back into the fence, stretching the wires 
           tight and breaking through.

           The sheriff fires and shatters the truck’s rear window. 

           Ari revs the engine. A cloud of dust sprays up from behind 
           the pick-up as it bounds over a small hill moving away from 
           the highway.

           The sheriff jumps back into his Corvette.

           As Ari pulls away from him, the sheriff fires another shot --
           this one explodes the driver’s side mirror on the truck. 

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, BRAZILIAN RANCH LAND - DAY

           Ari looks in the rearview mirror and smiles at the sight of 
           sheriff taking aim at him while driving. 

           EXT. BRAZILIAN RANCH LAND - DAY

           The sheriff is keeping up, but his Stingray is taking a hell 
           of a beating to do it.

           The sheriff takes another shot. It hits Ari’s back tire. 
           The truck fish-tails, sending a wave of red dirt over the 
           windshield of the sheriff’s car.

           INT. TOYOTA PICK-UP, BRAZILIAN RANCH LAND - DAY

           Ari works to maintain control of the pick-up. A steep hill 
           approaches and he guns the engine.

           The truck sails up over the hill -- but just beyond it is a 
           larger hill. The front end of the pick-up slams into the 
           second hill, jerking Ari forward into his seat belt.

           EXT. BRAZILIAN RANCH LAND - DAY

           Ari snaps off his seat belt and hits the ground running. 

           He moves like a man half his age as he disappears over the 
           top of the hill, holding onto his hat.

           The sheriff drives after him but the second hill is too steep 
           for the Corvette and it slides sideways.

           He climbs out and chases Ari on foot.

           The sheriff is just about to reach the crest of the hill when 
           a HELICOPTER lifts up over the edge so close that the wash 
           from the blades forces him to the ground.

           INT. HELICOPTER OVER BRAZILIAN RANCH LAND - DAY 

           Ari smiles at the sheriff as the helicopter pulls away. 

           The furious sheriff takes aim with his tiny revolver and 
           fires a shot in vain at the helicopter.

           Laughing, Ari dusts himself off as he’s helped into a seat by 
           an ISRAELI SOLDIER in civilian clothes.

           Ari slumps down in his seat, pulls his cowboy hat down over 
           his eyes and settles in for the ride.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Sam stares down at Foltern’s lifeless body. A pool of dark 
           blood seeps into the chalky dirt around the corpse. 

                                 SAM
                        Fuck!

           Sam pulls the photo Ari pinned to Foltern off and pockets it.

           EXT. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, LANGLEY, VA - NIGHT

           Establishing shot of the LANGLEY BUILDING. It’s pouring.
           INT. OFFICE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - NIGHT

           In the small back office SENIOR AGENT JACK HOYT, 50’s, and 
           AGENT PHIL LINDEN, 40’s, sit on opposite sides of a desk. 
           These men are as government-issue as the furniture in the 
           room.

           On the desk a newspaper headline reads: NAZI OFFICER FOUND 
           HIDING IN BRAZIL, ASSASSINATED.

           KARL DREXLER, now in his early 70’s, paces while watching the 
           rain hit the one tiny window. Drexler is spry for his age, 
           he’s taken good care of himself. 

                                 LINDEN
                        Dr. Drexler, relax. They all think 
                        you’re dead. They think you’ve been 
                        dead for thirty years. 

                                 DREXLER
                        This is what you said after Schultz 
                        was assassinated.

                                 LINDEN
                        It was true then too. No one is 
                        looking for you.

                                 DREXLER
                        You have a man in your own agency 
                        searching for me.

           Linden shoots a quick glance at Hoyt.

                                 LINDEN
                        Brauer? He’s not looking for you, 
                        he’s looking for your old boss at 
                        Nordhausen, Heinrich.

                                 DREXLER
                        Heinrich was never my commander!

                                 HOYT
                        Of course not Doctor. And 
                        considering that Heinrich is dead, 
                        he’s not going find him either. 

           Drexler stops pacing for a fraction of a beat, then 
           continues.

                                 LINDEN
                        The point is no one’s even looking 
                        for you. We don’t even know if this 
                        thing in Brazil was related to the 
                        others.
                                 DREXLER
                        I’m not a fool.

                                 HOYT
                        Dr. Drexler, rest assured the 
                        United States’ll do everything in 
                        its power to guarantee your safety. 
                        We’ve been looking after you for 
                        thirty years and we’ve never once 
                        had an incident where your safety 
                        was compromised. 

                                 LINDEN
                        Karl, you need to relax. The hours 
                        you’ve been putting in on the 
                        strategic defense initiative are 
                        catching up with you. Why don’t you 
                        take a few days off?

                                 HOYT
                        That’s a good idea. We can bring 
                        you up to Boston to see your 
                        daughter again.

           Drexler stops pacing and smiles at Hoyt.

                                 DREXLER
                        Clever of you to play into my 
                        sentimentality for my daughter. 
                        Don’t worry about what I’m 
                        thinking, worry about your job.

           Drexler turns and abruptly exits the room. Linden leans back 
           in his chair and looks at Hoyt.

                                 LINDEN
                        That went well.

                                 HOYT
                        He’ll calm down. He gets spooked 
                        every time they get one.

                                 LINDEN
                        You think we need to move him 
                        again?

                                 HOYT
                        Won’t be necessary.

                                 LINDEN
                        Hope not, that was five years ago 
                        and I’m still getting over it.
                                 HOYT
                        Nobody’s looking for him. We gave 
                        them a body for christsake.

                                 LINDEN
                        How the hell did he know about Sam 
                        Brauer?

                                 HOYT
                        I found that interesting as well. 
                        It doesn’t matter now anyway.

                                 LINDEN
                        I hope not. He called from the 
                        airport, pissed as hell. His father 
                        beat him to Foltern by five 
                        minutes.

           Hoyt picks up the paper and looks at the photo of Foltern 
           dead in Brazil.

                                 HOYT
                        That’s perfect.

           EXT. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, LANGLEY, VA - NIGHT

           Rain pours down as Sam climbs out of a TAXI and walks toward 
           the lobby. The taxi starts to pull away from the building.

                                 DREXLER (O.S.)
                        Hold the taxi please!

           Sam steps back into the rain and stops the cab. He opens the 
           door for Drexler, who climbs in and slams the door. 

           Sam looks in at Drexler, Drexler locks eyes with him then 
           looks abruptly away. The taxi pulls out of the parking lot. 

           It is quickly trailed by an UNMARKED SEDAN carrying TWO 
           AGENTS. 

           Sam watches the cars go then continues on into the building 
           with a curious look on his face.

           INT. OFFICE, CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY - NIGHT

           A SECRETARY leads Sam into the office Drexler just left.

           Linden greets him with nod, Hoyt doesn’t even look up from 
           his paperwork.
                                 LINDEN
                        It’s good to see you Sam but you 
                        didn’t have to fly all the way back 
                        to just to debrief.

           Sam drops his C.I.A. ID card, his pistol and the Nordhausen
           file onto the desk in front of Linden.

                                 SAM
                        I’m done.

                                 LINDEN
                        Just wait a minute.

                                 SAM
                        Nope, I’m done waiting for you. 

                                 LINDEN
                        What does that mean?

           Sam tries not to lose his temper but fails.

                                 SAM
                        For three months I waited for a 
                        green light to move on Foltern! 
                        Three fucking months only to get 
                        beaten to him by five minutes!

                                 LINDEN
                        Calm down, you know how it works. 
                        We gotta pursue every diplomatic 
                        recourse available.

                                 SAM
                        Well, while you were pursuing 
                        fucking recourse, the Israelis got 
                        the hit.

                                 LINDEN
                        You didn’t want a hit. If all you’d 
                        wanted to do was to kill the fucker
                        it wouldn’t of been a problem.

                                 SAM
                        Do you hear yourself talk?

                                 LINDEN
                        Fuck you. Climb off your high 
                        horse, you make it sound like you 
                        were asking for the easiest thing 
                        in the world. 
                                 SAM
                        I wanted to arrest a known war 
                        criminal.

                                 LINDEN 
                        In a foreign fucking country!

                                 SAM
                        But it’s alright for me to kill him 
                        in a foreign country?

                                 LINDEN
                        What is this, student council? It’s 
                        not about right and wrong, it’s 
                        about getting it done.

           Sam turns to Hoyt.

                                 SAM
                        And what about justice?

                                 HOYT
                        You work for the C.I.A., Sam. 
                        Justice Department is a few miles 
                        down the parkway. 

           Sam nods slowly then turns to the door.

                                 LINDEN
                        What about your Wunderkind?

           Sam walks back to the desk, flips opens the file and grabs 
           the Nordhausen photo. 

           There’s a “DECEASED” stamp on every face now.

                                 SAM
                        Foltern was the last lead. Thanks 
                        to you, any chance I had of finding 
                        Heinrich died with him.

           Sam tosses the photo at him and walks out.

           Linden follows him to the door and locks it. He faces Hoyt 
           with big smile.

                                 LINDEN
                        I’m impressed. 

           Hoyt gives him a smug nod and returns to his paperwork.

                                 LINDEN (cont’d)
                        You think he’ll keep looking 
                        freelance?
                                 HOYT
                        Nope, he’s done.

           EXT. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, LANGLEY, VA - NIGHT

           Sam walks out of the building. He stops and looks back at the 
           rain falling on the CIA seal.

           EXT. KARL DREXLER’S DRIVEWAY, BETHESDA, MD - NIGHT

           DAVIS and SAMPSON, the agents who trailed Drexler from 
           Langley, sip coffee in their unmarked sedan parked in 
           Drexler’s driveway. 

           A LOUD CRASHING SOUND comes out of the closed garage.

           Both agents stare at the garage door.

                                 DREXLER (O.S.)
                        SCREAMING CURSES IN GERMAN.

           Another HUGE CRASHING SOUND.

           Davis eyes the rain splashing down on the windshield.

                                 SAMPSON
                        I got us the coffee, amigo.

                                 DAVIS
                        Shit.

           He climbs out of the car and walks to the front door.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Agent Davis enters the creepy old house slowly.

                                 DAVIS
                        Dr. Drexler?

                                 DREXLER (O.S.)
                        LOUD GERMAN CURSING.

           Agent Davis opens the interior door to the garage.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Dressed in pajamas, Karl Drexler stands on a stool trying to 
           reach a metal box at the top of a shelving unit. Several 
           other boxes lay smashed open on the ground.

                                 DAVIS
                        Dr. Drexler?
           Drexler jumps in fright when he hears Davis.

                                 DREXLER
                        Schiezen! You don’t knock? You’re 
                        going to give me heart failure.

                                 DAVIS
                        Sorry, Doctor.

                                 DREXLER
                        I’ve told you, no shoes inside!

           Davis looks down at his dripping shoes and slides them off. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Sorry, Doctor.

           Drexler returns to trying to pull the box down.

                                 DAVIS (cont’d)
                        Can I give you a hand, sir?

                                 DREXLER
                        I’m fine, I am not a cripple.

           He strains and the stool almost tips.

                                 DAVIS
                        Sir, let me get it for you. Please.

           Drexler looks at him. He reluctantly climbs off the stool, 
           refusing a hand down from Davis.

           Agent Davis steps up onto the stool and reaches for the box. 
           He gets a hold and lifts, but the box is bound to the shelf 
           with wires he cannot see.

                                 DAVIS (cont’d)
                        Whatcha got in here, Doctor?

           He looks down at Drexler. Drexler is holding an electrical 
           cable. He presses the exposed wire end to the metal stool. 

           The wire runs into the circuit box on the wall.

           Davis convulses as the voltage pours through his body. He 
           falls off the stool with a THUD.

           Drexler pulls Davis’ gun from his holster. He reaches into 
           the agent’s jacket and fishes out a silencer.

           Drexler screws the silencer onto the pistol then shoots the 
           agent in the heart.
           EXT. KARL DREXLER’S DRIVEWAY, BETHESDA, MD - NIGHT

           Agent Sampson is surprised to see Drexler open the front 
           door. He rolls his window down.

           Drexler waves for him to come into the house.

                                 DREXLER
                        Can you give us a hand please?

           Sampson reluctantly puts his coffee down and climbs out of 
           the sedan.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           The instant Agent Sampson steps inside, Drexler shoots him in 
           the temple spraying the front door with blood.

           Drexler pulls the agent’s corpse inside and peeks out. He 
           takes off his pajama top -- revealing a shirt and tie 
           underneath, and uses it to wipe blood off the door before 
           shutting it.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Drexler drags Agent Sampson’s body down the steps.

           At the bottom Agent Davis lies next to MRS. DREXLER’S DEAD 
           BODY. Her throat has been slit ear to ear.

           Karl Drexler calmly covers the three bodies with a tarp and 
           heads up the stairs.

           EXT. PORCH, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE, SILVER SPRING MD - NIGHT

           Sam waits in the pouring rain. He rings the bell again then 
           reaches down behind a planter and finds a key.

           Before he can use it, JUDITH BRAUER, 50’s and still very 
           beautiful, opens the door. She is shocked to see Sam. 

           She gives him a huge hug and kisses his cheek. Then she 
           shoves him away. Judith has a slight Israeli accent.

                                 JUDITH
                        You could have at least called.

           She hugs him again.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        You’re soaked. Come in, there’s 
                        some of your old clothes upstairs.
           INT. DINING ROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam dries his hair with a towel. He’s wearing a well-worn 
           sweatsuit with JEFFERSON H.S. TIGERS printed on the front.

           He looks at the wall above the fireplace. It’s COVERED WITH 
           FAMILY PHOTOS, mostly of him and his mom.

           Sam picks up a FRAMED PHOTO OF ARI RECEIVING AN ISRAELI MEDAL 
           taken years back. He shakes his head and puts it back.

           Judith enters carrying a plate of leftovers and two coffees. 

                                 JUDITH
                        They still fit.

           Sam looks down at the sweatsuit. 

           As she puts the plate on the table we see that she has a Nazi 
           serial number tattooed on her forearm. Sam sits.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        If I had known you were coming I 
                        might have cooked.

                                 SAM
                        This is fine. Thank you.

                                 JUDITH
                        It’ll have to be. 

           Judith sips coffee apprehensively and watches Sam eating.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        I half expected to see you. 

           Judith glances at the NEWSPAPER on a chair by the door. 

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        So?

                                 SAM
                        So what?

                                 JUDITH
                        So why are you here? To the best of 
                        my knowledge you haven’t even been 
                        in the United States in two years, 
                        let alone visiting your mother.

           Sam stops eating and looks up at her.

                                 SAM
                        I quit.
           A happy look of surprise falls across Judith’s face.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I knew you’d be happy.

                                 JUDITH
                        If you’re not, why’d you do it?

                                 SAM
                        I didn’t really have a choice.

                                 JUDITH
                        There’s always a choice.

                                 SAM
                        Not always.

                                 JUDITH
                        Always.

           Sam gives her a look. 

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        OK then, explain it to me.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t worry about it.

           Judith digs in her purse and pulls out a pack of smokes.

                                 JUDITH
                        God knows, the last thing I want is 
                        for you to go back to them. But you 
                        show up at my house after two years 
                        with something on your mind, I’d be 
                        a shitty mother if I didn’t find 
                        out what you’ve been doing all this 
                        time.

           Sam smiles at his mother despite himself. 

           INT. OFFICE, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE, SILVER SPRING, MD - NIGHT

           PROFESSIONAL CAMERAS and LIGHTING EQUIPMENT fill her 
           cluttered home office. Judith grabs a loupe from the top of a 
           stack of photos and uses it to view the Nordhausen photo. 

                                 JUDITH
                        And this has something to do with  
                        what I saw in the paper about your 
                        father?
                                 SAM
                        They didn’t use his name in the 
                        article.

                                 JUDITH
                        I’ve known the man long enough to 
                        recognize his work. Were you there?

           Sam nods.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        The paper said there was a shoot-
                        out, he didn’t shoot at you did he? 
                        I’ll kill him.

                                 SAM
                        No. He shot this man.

           Sam points to the image of Foltern in the Nordhausen photo.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        The sheriff shot at him, but he got 
                        out in a helicopter.

                                 JUDITH
                        You sound sad the sheriff missed. 

           Sam shrugs. Judith lights a cigarette and chuckles softly.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        The apple doesn’t fall far from the 
                        tree, does it?

                                 SAM
                        What does that mean?

           Judith exhales smoke and waves the question off.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Why do you still keep a picture of 
                        him downstairs?

                                 JUDITH
                        The one with the medal?

                                 SAM
                        Yeah. 

                                 JUDITH
                        I was proud of him.

                                 SAM
                        How can you be proud of anything he 
                        does?
                                 JUDITH
                        I went through a lot with your 
                        father.

                                 SAM
                        Until he left.

           Judith is silent for a beat.

                                 JUDITH
                        Work has always been his priority, 
                        I knew it when I married him. Some 
                        people are that way, even if they 
                        don’t like it themselves.

                                 SAM
                        He likes it just fine.

                                 JUDITH
                        This coming from you, who I haven’t 
                        seen in two years? 

                                 SAM
                        Don’t compare me to him.

                                 JUDITH
                        That comparison would be so off? I 
                        moved us 6000 miles away and what 
                        happens? Instead of my son growing 
                        up in Israel chasing ghouls and 
                        ghosts, he’s in Virginia doing it.

           Judith looks at Sam and sees him closing off. She puts her 
           hand on his arm and gestures to the photo.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        All right, enough. Please? Tell me 
                        what I’m looking at?

           Sam looks at her for a beat. He turns the desk lamp so that 
           it shines on the photo and shifts his tone.

                                 SAM
                        These are the officers that ran 
                        your camp. 

                                 JUDITH
                        My camp?

                                 SAM
                        Nordhausen.

           Judith looks at the photo again and shivers.
                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I’m sorry. Maybe we shouldn’t.

           Sam reaches for the photo. Judith waves him away.

                                 JUDITH
                        I can handle a photograph. 

                                 SAM
                        Actually, what I’m interested in 
                        isn’t in the photo, it’s the man 
                        who took it. The camp commandant.

           Judith places the photo on the desk and looks at Sam.

                                 JUDITH
                        Hitler’s wunderkind.

                                 SAM
                        That’s right. Julius Heinrich. Born 
                        in Munich in 1920. A child genius, 
                        at twenty-two he had earned a Ph.D.

                                 JUDITH
                        So young.

                                 SAM
                        Very young. In 1944 Heinrich went 
                        to Nordhausen as Hitler’s special 
                        envoy. He took over the rocket 
                        works and increased production by 
                        over 500%. But, he left no paper 
                        trail -- no photographs and no 
                        records.
                              (beat)
                        He knew.

           Judith looks at the photo again.

                                 JUDITH
                        Knew?
                              (beat)
                        That they were going to lose?

           Sam’s face lights up.

                                 SAM
                        Exactly. And that there were going 
                        to be repercussions.

                                 JUDITH
                        War crimes.
                                 SAM
                        Right. No record, no files, no 
                        photographs. No evidence.

                                 JUDITH
                        They told me he burned the camp to 
                        the ground with himself inside.

                                 SAM
                        That’s what we and the Russians 
                        claim. But we both stole every bit 
                        of technology we could and took as 
                        many Nazi scientists as possible to 
                        boot. No one wants anyone asking 
                        questions. The truth is there’s no 
                        physical evidence of his death. 

                                 JUDITH
                        So what do you think happened?

                                 SAM
                        I think a psychopathic genius who 
                        planned for what he saw as the 
                        inevitable Nazi defeat didn’t stake 
                        his life on them winning.

                                 JUDITH
                        So?

                                 SAM
                        So, Heinrich’s not the type of man 
                        who just gives up.

                                 JUDITH
                        You think he escaped?

                                 SAM
                        Assumed a new identity.

                                 JUDITH
                        And disappeared by himself?

                                 SAM
                        I’m guessing he had help.

                                 JUDITH
                        From one of these men?

                                 SAM
                        Most likely. But there’s no one to 
                        ask, they’re all dead.

           Judith stares at the photo. She lights another cigarette with 
           the first.
                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        How can you still smoke so much?

                                 JUDITH
                        Maybe if you stopped chasing ghosts 
                        and made me some grandchildren I’d 
                        quit.

           She grabs an ashtray.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        Have you ever thought it might be 
                        best to leave the past in the past? 

                                 SAM
                        How could you of all people say 
                        that?

                                 JUDITH
                        Never forget, but move on. The war 
                        is over, we won.

                                 SAM
                        You have all those family photos 
                        downstairs and not one of them is 
                        from before I was born. This man 
                        should face the consequences of his 
                        actions.

                                 JUDITH
                        If he’s still alive he has to live 
                        each day knowing what he did.
                              (beat)
                        The best revenge is living well.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t want revenge. That’s the 
                        difference between me and my 
                        father, I want justice.

                                 JUDITH
                        Sam, I lost my family, my youth and 
                        even my husband to them. I’m just 
                        happy to not lose my son.

           She gets up and kisses Sam on the top of his head.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        You’re a young man. Live in your 
                        time now, not in my past.

           Judith exits the office. 
           EXT. JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE, SILVER SPRING, MD - LATE NIGHT

           Sam sits on the porch steps. The rain has stopped and he 
           looks up at the bright moon in the clear sky.

           He looks down at the Nordhausen photo in his lap. 

           Sam tears the photo in half, then in half again.

           He gets up and as he walks to the front door HEADLIGHTS swing 
           into the driveway.

           Sam walks to the driver’s side window of the car, an unmarked 
           GOVERNMENT SEDAN.

           Agent Linden smiles wide at Sam from behind the wheel, Agent 
           Hoyt sits next to him with a blank expression on his face.

                                 LINDEN
                        Evening, Sam. You’re up late.

                                 SAM
                        What are you doing here?

                                 LINDEN
                        This is your last known address in 
                        D.C.

                                 SAM
                        Why are you here?

                                 LINDEN
                        Hop on in. It’s cold out there.

           Sam doesn’t move.

                                 LINDEN (cont’d)
                        We got a bit of a situation and 
                        could use your expertise. Climb in.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t work for you anymore.

                                 LINDEN
                        You talking about your little 
                        outburst today? Pressures of the 
                        job, don’t worry about it.

           Linden holds out Sam’s gun and C.I.A. ID.

                                 SAM
                        I’m not worried about it.
           Sam looks at the gun and ID without taking either, then over 
           to Hoyt who stares straight ahead.

                                 LINDEN
                        Come on, hop in.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll call you tomorrow.

           Hoyt looks at Sam for the first time. He grabs Sam’s gun from 
           Linden, cocks it and points it out the window at Sam.

                                 HOYT
                        You think I drove here in the 
                        middle of the night for you to call 
                        me in the morning? Get in the 
                        fucking car before I shoot you with 
                        your own goddamn gun.

           Sam smiles at Hoyt’s anger.

                                 SAM
                        It is kinda chilly out here.

           INT. UNMARKED SEDAN ON STREET, SILVER SPRING MD - NIGHT

           Sam sits in the back, Linden pulls out of the driveway and 
           drives fast.

           Linden eyes Sam’s sweatsuit in the rearview mirror.

                                 LINDEN
                        Nice outfit.

           Sam looks down at the sweatsuit.

                                 SAM
                        Why am I in this car?

                                 LINDEN
                        We’ve got a bit of information you 
                        might find interesting. An asset of 
                        ours broke contact.

           Hoyt hands a recent photo of Karl Drexler to Sam.

                                 SAM
                        I saw this man yesterday at 
                        Langley.

           Linden looks at Hoyt and smirks, Hoyt looks away.

                                 LINDEN
                        It’s possible, we had a meeting.
                                 SAM
                        Who is he?

                                 LINDEN
                        Karl Drexler. Formerly of the 
                        Nordhausen rocket facility, 
                        currently of the United States 
                        Defense Department. At eleven 
                        o’clock, Dr. Drexler killed his 
                        wife and two members of his 
                        security team and took off running.

           Linden sees Sam’s shocked look in the rearview and grins. 
           Hoyt’s face shows his annoyance at Linden’s fun.

                                 SAM
                        Karl Drexler is alive?

                                 LINDEN
                        That’s what I’m telling you.

                                 SAM
                        He worked for you?

                                 LINDEN
                        Until four hours ago, he worked for 
                        us all.

                                 SAM
                        What about his remains, the dental 
                        match.

                                 LINDEN
                        It’s not hard to get a dental match 
                        if you got the man to give you a 
                        mold of his teeth.

                                 SAM
                        And you let him get away?

                                 LINDEN
                        We didn’t expect a 72 year-old 
                        Ph.D. to kill two armed field 
                        agents.

                                 SAM
                        He’s a trained S.S. officer.

                                 LINDEN
                        Apparently with a good memory.

           Sam glares at the photo of Drexler.
                                 SAM
                        You had me run around in fucking
                        circles all this time when you 
                        could have let me question him 
                        about Heinrich.

                                 LINDEN 
                        Our hands were tied. Do you know 
                        who Karl Drexler is?

                                 SAM
                        He’s a Nazi you harbored for thirty 
                        years and now you want my help to 
                        clean it up.

                                 LINDEN 
                        When Dr. Drexler first came to the 
                        agency he spoke of another man who 
                        he was working with. Another 
                        officer from Nordhausen. 

                                 HOYT
                        We have reason to believe that 
                        Drexler may have been in contact 
                        with Heinrich, your Wunderkind. 

                                 LINDEN 
                        He may be looking for him again, 
                        now that he’s out in the cold.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck you. You’re baiting me.

           Hoyt turns and faces Sam over the seat. He’s furious.

                                 HOYT
                        Drexler’s not just some rocket 
                        scientist, he’s the rocket 
                        scientist. The master architect of 
                        the United States nuclear missile 
                        arsenal. Your ‘justice for all’ 
                        bullshit takes a back seat to 
                        nuclear winter, son. Be a fucking
                        professional. This is the best lead 
                        you could ever hope for.

           Sam stares at Hoyt for a beat.

                                 SAM
                        I’m bringing him in alive. I’m not 
                        burying it for you.

           Hoyt turns around. Sam sits back and looks at the picture of 
           Drexler. 
           Linden smiles and passes Sam his pistol and his ID. 

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Where are we headed?

                                 LINDEN
                        You’re going to be working with an 
                        outside expert.

           Sam stares at Linden’s eyes in the rearview mirror.

                                 HOYT
                        The Israelis have agreed to loan 
                        him out. He’s the best there is. 
                        I’m not taking any chances.

                                 SAM
                        I should have fucking known.

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT, DIPLOMAT’S LOUNGE - NIGHT

           Ari relaxes with a glass of scotch. He takes off his linen 
           sport coat and sets it next to him on the leather couch.

           Sam and the agents enter. The DOOR GUARD gives Sam’s worn 
           sweatsuit a look which Sam ignores. 

           Ari’s face lights up when he sees Sam. He sets his drink down 
           and stands up.

           Hoyt shakes hands with an ISRAELI DIPLOMAT. They walk to a 
           table in the back and the diplomat hands over some papers.

                                 ARI
                        Hello, Samuel. 

           He reaches to give his son a hug, Sam just sits down across 
           from him. Ari forces a smile.

                                 LINDEN
                        I’ll be back in just a moment. 

           Linden joins Agent Hoyt. Ari sits and sips his drink.

                                 ARI
                        There was a girl at the bar a 
                        moment ago. I prefer not to drink 
                        alone, but it’s better than no 
                        drink at all.

           Sam looks at Ari’s luggage. The tags from the Rio de Janeiro 
           airport are still on the bags.
                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        You’re looking well, very fit.

           Ari points to Sam’s sweatsuit then puts his hand on his own 
           round belly.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        I’ve failed to take as good care of 
                        myself. How is your Mother?

                                 SAM
                        They brief you on the plane?

           Ari takes a sip and forces another smile.

                                 ARI
                        They briefed me.

                                 SAM
                        Good. I think the best place to 
                        start is his office, what level of 
                        clearance are they giving you?

                                 ARI
                        I assume full clearance, or what 
                        would be the point. And I agree, 
                        about the office.

           Linden and Hoyt join them along with the Israeli diplomat.

                                 ISRAELI DIPLOMAT
                        The papers are in order. Good luck.
                              (Hebrew / subtitles)
                        Watch your back with these people.

           Ari looks at Sam and sees that he understood.

                                 ARI
                        Thank you.

                                 LINDEN
                        The hotel’s downtown. We’ll catch 
                        up in the morning and you two can 
                        start at Drexler’s house.

           Ari downs the remainder of his scotch and looks at his watch.

                                 ARI
                        Why not go now? Every minute we 
                        waste is one he uses.

                                 LINDEN
                        OK. I’ll have the car take us there 
                        directly.
                                 SAM
                        We’d like to see his office, at the 
                        D.O.D.

           Linden looks at Hoyt who hesitates, then nods agreement.

                                 ARI
                              (to Sam)
                        I’ll ride with you.

           Sam looks at his father then shrugs and heads for the door.

           INT. SAM’S PICK-UP TRUCK, D.C. STREET - NIGHT

           The two ride in silence on the near empty street.

                                 ARI
                        I haven’t been here in four years, 
                        the city is still wild at night?

                                 SAM
                        Five.

           Ari looks at his son.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I graduated Annapolis five years 
                        ago.

                                 ARI
                        Right, sorry. Mind if I smoke?

                                 SAM
                        Yes, I do.

           Ari shakes a Marlboro out of a soft pack. Sam looks at the 
           serial number tattooed on Ari’s forearm as he lights his cig. 
           Sam rolls down his window. 

                                 ARI
                        I wish we had the chance to talk in 
                        Brazil, but under the circumstance, 
                        you understand I had to leave.

           Ari looks at Sam for a reaction, Sam gives him none. 

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        You don’t like what I did? You 
                        think Foltern deserved better?

           Sam thinks before responding. When he does he keeps his eyes 
           on the road.
                                 SAM
                        I think there are other people 
                        beside Foltern.

                                 ARI
                        I don’t follow.

                                 SAM
                        Executing an old man on the side of 
                        the road in Brazil may feel good to 
                        you, it might even make me happy. 
                        But dragging him kicking and 
                        screaming into the light of day is 
                        a less selfish goal. 

           Sam pulls the truck into the Department of Defense lot and 
           parks it next to where Hoyt and Linden wait.

           Ari looks at his son. He crushes out his cigarette and gets 
           out of the truck.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - NIGHT

           A TEAM OF FEDERAL POLICE guard the door.

           As Sam and Ari enter the large office A MAN IN BLUE COVERALLS 
           wheels a huge stack of files out past them.

           Sam looks around the recently emptied office. Dust marks on 
           the desk show where objects have been removed.

           Ari opens Drexler’s closet. A long row of identical suits 
           hang in their plastic dry cleaning wrappers.

                                 ARI
                        Meticulous.

                                 LINDEN
                        He hated the meetings. Kept those 
                        at his office for when he needed 
                        them.

                                 SAM
                        Meetings?

                                 LINDEN
                        Subcommittee on Defense.

                                 SAM
                        Karl Drexler went before Congress?

           Hoyt throws Linden a dirty look.
                                 LINDEN
                        If you need anything else contact 
                        me and we’ll try to get you 
                        clearance.

                                 SAM
                        Try?

                                 HOYT
                        We will do what we can. Drexler was 
                        working on multiple projects, all 
                        with elevated security ratings.

           Sam opens a file cabinet, it’s empty.

                                 SAM
                        It’s going to be a lot harder to 
                        find your man with my hands tied 
                        behind my back.

                                 LINDEN
                        We’ve got to work with the 
                        realities of the situation.

                                 SAM
                        The situation is he’s hiding. If 
                        you help him, it’s harder. 

           Ari is enjoying the argument.

                                 HOYT
                        I’m giving you access that you’ve 
                        been wanting for years and you’re 
                        asking for more. You can’t have it.

                                 LINDEN
                        We’ll be back at seven. Call if you 
                        need anything.

           He hands Sam his card. Sam opens another drawer in Drexler’s 
           desk. This one’s empty too.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - LATER

           The federal cop dozes in his chair at the door. He wakes up, 
           looks into the room, then nods off again.

           Sam sits at the desk leafing through papers. Ari paces.

                                 ARI
                        There are three ways for him to 
                        successfully exit so suddenly.

           Snapped out of his daze, Sam looks up at Ari. 
                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        One, he improvised. Two, he had 
                        everything ready and on standby. Or 
                        three, he had a plan in the 
                        waiting.

           He opens the closet and gestures to the identical suits.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        This man did not like to improvise. 
                        Having everything prepared was his 
                        first choice, but that’s expensive 
                        and very difficult to sustain 
                        undetected for several decades. So 
                        that leaves the contingency plan.

                                 SAM
                        Something he needed some time to 
                        spin-up.

           Ari smiles and his son.

                                 ARI
                        Exactly. 

           Sam picks up Drexler’s office calendar.

                                 SAM
                        But everything he did was routine. 
                        Everything was scheduled. 

           Sam flips to the front of the calendar and reads. He gets up.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I know someone we can ask.

           EXT. HOUSE, URBAN D.C. - EARLY MORNING

           Sam and Ari sip coffee out of to-go cups. Sam RINGS THE 
           BUZZER.

           Sam RINGS again. The LOCK CLICKS, the door swings open and a 
           HUGE MAN points a shotgun into Sam’s face.

           Ari yanks Sam out of the way and reaches for his pistol.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN (O.S.)
                        Harold! Put that damn thing away.

           HARRIET MORGAN, 50’s, curlers in her hair, rushes to the door 
           and grabs the shotgun from Harold. She looks at Sam and Ari.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN (cont’d)
                        You from the agency?
                                 SAM
                        Yes ma’am.

           Sam shows her his ID.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Damn it, Harold, where are your 
                        glasses? Who comes robbin’ a place 
                        and rings the damn bell!
                              (to Sam and Ari)
                        Come in. You hungry?

           Harold walks back into the bedroom scratching his ass through 
           his jockey shorts.

           INT. HARRIET MORGAN’S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

           Ari and Sam sit in the breakfast nook. 

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        I’m sorry again about Harold. We 
                        had a break-in last month.

                                 SAM
                        No problem.

           Harriet serves them scrambled eggs and bacon and sits down 
           with a coffee.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        It’s strange. You work for a man 
                        for twenty years and then he just 
                        up and disappears. Even at the 
                        Department of Defense it’s strange.

           Sam does not eat. He watches as Ari loudly chews his bacon.

                                 SAM
                        I know you’ve been debriefed but 
                        can you think of anything he did 
                        that was out of the ordinary? Any 
                        variation in the routine?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        That man lived on routine. Never 
                        did anything that wasn’t scheduled.

           Some egg falls from Ari’s mouth to the table. He scoops it 
           onto his fork with his thumb and eats it. Harriet enjoys his 
           gusto, Sam does not.

                                 SAM
                        He didn’t call anyone?
                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        No one that wasn’t routine.

                                 SAM
                        Nothing weird?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Honey, you said routine, not weird. 
                        Everything he did was weird. You 
                        see that closet?

           Harriet pulls a cigarette out of the pack. Ari watches.

                                 ARI
                        Do you mind? I ran out.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Be my guest.

           Ari bums one, lights it and smokes as he eats.

                                 ARI
                        Within the routine, was there 
                        anything he did infrequently?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        How infrequently?

                                 ARI
                              (mouth full of eggs)
                        Once every six months, once a year?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Not really.

           She takes a long drag of her cigarette and thinks.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN (cont’d)
                        Well, the bank.

                                 SAM
                        The bank?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        He did that once a year.

                                 SAM
                        What’s that?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Once a year he’d get a call from 
                        his bank. 

           Sam opens Drexler’s file.
                                 SAM
                        Bethesda Mutual?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        The other one.

                                 SAM
                        What other one?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Alexandria Savings and Loan.

                                 Sam 
                        He lived in Bethesda.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        He moved to Bethesda.

                                 SAM
                        When?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN

                                 SAM
                        And he kept a bank account in 
                        Alexandria?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        He was loyal.

                                 SAM
                        What was the call about?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Reminder to pay his bill.

                                 SAM
                        Bill for what?

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        Don’t know.

                                 ARI
                        Why not mail a bill?

                                 SAM
                        If he asked them not to. 

           Sam looks at the clock on the kitchen wall. It’s six-thirty. 
           He pulls on his sweatshirt and gets up.

           Ari looks at him and takes another bite of eggs. Sam watches 
           impatiently. Finally Ari gets up.
                                 ARI
                        Thank you for the breakfast. Very 
                        delicious.

                                 HARRIET MORGAN
                        You want a smoke for the road?

                                 ARI
                        You are too kind.

           EXT. SAM’S PICK-UP, ALEXANDRIA S&L PARKING LOT - DAWN

           Sam’s truck is the only car in the bank’s lot. Ari is asleep 
           with his face on the side window. A cigarette smolders in his 
           hand. Sam watches his father with distaste.

                                 SAM
                        Can you roll down the window.

           Ari drowsily turns to Sam.

                                 ARI
                        It’s cold out there.

           Sam stares at him. Ari rolls down the window, hacks up a 
           smoker’s loogie and spits.

                                 SAM
                        It’s impolite to smoke and eat.

           Ari has to think for a second before he understands what the 
           fuck Sam is talking about. He sits up and looks at his son.

                                 ARI
                        I don’t think she cared.

                                 SAM
                        It’s still impolite.

                                 ARI
                        Why are you worried about my 
                        manners? You give a shit what 
                        people think of me? Of your Father?

                                 SAM
                        It’s just rude.

                                 ARI
                        There are only so many things you 
                        can concern yourself with in life,  
                        Samuel. Try to pick important ones.

           A BMW SEDAN pulls into the lot and parks.
           The UPTIGHT BANK MANAGER, nervously gets out of the BMW and 
           walks toward Sam’s truck. 

           Sam opens his door.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Can I help you gentlemen?

           Sam fishes out his CIA ID CARD and shows it to him. The bank 
           manager eyes Sam’s sweatsuit.

                                 SAM
                        Can we talk inside?

           INT. ALEXANDRIA SAVINGS AND LOAN - DAY 

           Ari and Sam wait in the lobby. The bank manager comes out of 
           a door from the rear of the bank and hands Agent Linden’s 
           business card back to Sam. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        You understand I had to check. I 
                        woke him up. He told me to help you 
                        in any way I can but my hands are 
                        really tied without a warrant.

                                 SAM
                        I understand.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I thought the CIA didn’t have 
                        operations within the United 
                        States’ borders?

                                 SAM
                        We’re working in conjunction with 
                        the justice department on this.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I see. Well I’m sure that it won’t 
                        be difficult to obtain a warrant 
                        then.

                                 SAM
                        We’re in a bit of a rush. Maybe you 
                        could answer some questions for me, 
                        until the warrant comes through?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Frankly, I would prefer not to.

           Ari takes a half step closer to the manager.
                                 SAM
                        How about just some simple ones?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I can try, but I can’t tell you 
                        anything that could make the bank 
                        liable.

                                 SAM 
                        Did Karl Drexler maintain an 
                        account here?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        It’s a matter of public record that 
                        he did.

                                 SAM
                        Great. Did he make any changes to 
                        his account in the recent past?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        We take the privacy of our clients 
                        very seriously. I apologize, but I 
                        can’t answer a question of that 
                        nature without appropriate 
                        documentation releasing the bank 
                        from liability.

                                 SAM
                        Can you tell us what type of 
                        account he had?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I’m afraid I won’t do that either.

           Ari steps in again, he is uncomfortably close.

                                 SAM
                        What type of account would have a 
                        yearly bill?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        If you’d like I can give you a 
                        table of bank fees.

           Ari has moved so close to the man he can smell his breath.

                                 ARI
                        Please, just tell us.

           The manager backs away a half step and bumps into the wall.
                                 BANK MANAGER
                        None of our accounts are billed 
                        annually.
                              (beat)
                        Well, the fee for a safety deposit 
                        box could generate an annual bill.

                                 SAM
                        But you could pay that in advance.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Actually, the bank has a policy 
                        against pre-paying for deposit 
                        boxes. If we cease to offer that 
                        service we wish to avoid the 
                        obligation of maintaining a box.

                                 SAM
                        Did Karl Drexler have a safety 
                        deposit box?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        If he did, that would be 
                        confidential.

           Ari draws a .45 and slams the barrel into the bank manager’s 
           forehead. This startles Sam almost as much as it does the 
           manager.

                                 SAM
                        What are you doing?

           The manager looks to Sam for help.

                                 ARI
                        I need you to take us to his 
                        deposit box. If you say no I will 
                        shoot you in the knee. It will 
                        hurt. If you say no a second time 
                        I’ll shoot you in the other knee 
                        and you may not walk again.

                                 SAM
                        Calm down!

                                 ARI
                        I’m very calm.

           Ari racks a round into the chamber and shoves the gun into 
           the managers’ knee.
                                 ARI (cont’d)
                              (to manager)
                        I will calmly shoot you in the 
                        knee. I do not work for the CIA. 
                        I’m not even American. Three 
                        seconds. Three, two...

           The manager looks to Sam for help, Sam shrugs.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        OK. OK. OK. OK.

           INT. BANK VAULT - DAY 

           Ari holds the gun to the bank manager’s back as he nervously 
           fumbles with the master key and opens the safety deposit box. 

           In it is all of DREXLER’S IDENTIFICATION; his D.O.D. ID, his 
           DRIVER’S LICENSE. The box also contains EMPTY PAPER BANDS 
           that once held $10,000 in hundred dollar bills. Lots of them.

                                 SAM
                        Shit.

           Ari pushes the manager away and looks in the box.

                                 ARI
                        Fuck!

           Sam grabs a handful of money bands and counts them.

                                 SAM
                        He’s got about five hundred 
                        thousand with him.

                                 ARI
                        We go back to the office and keep 
                        looking. Start over. Mizdayen! 

           Sam shows the money band to the terrified manager.

                                 SAM
                        Are they all from the same bank?

           The manager hesitates and Ari glares at him.

                                 ARI
                        This is not a secret, answer the 
                        question!

           Sam hands him some more bands.
                                 BANK MANAGER
                        These do appear to be from one 
                        institution.

                                 SAM
                        Who puts the band on? The mint or 
                        the bank?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        These were put on by a bank.

                                 SAM
                        How can you tell?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        It’s numbered. Coded.

                                 SAM
                        What bank?

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I don’t know.

                                 ARI
                        I want you to know.

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        I don’t know the codes by heart! 
                        There is a book in my office.

           INT. BANK MANAGER’S OFFICE - DAY 

           The manager slowly leafs through the book. Sam paces. Ari 
           glares. The manager shakes his head and puts the book down. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        It’s not in the Northeast. 

           Ari cocks the hammer on his 45. The manager grabs another 
           book and skims it, his hands shaking. Ari smiles at Sam who 
           ignores him.

                                 BANK MANAGER (cont’d)
                        Wait. Here it is, Florida.

                                 ARI
                        Where in Florida?

           The manager nervously turns a page.-

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Gold Coast Trust. Miami Beach.
                                 ARI
                        Gary Leck.

                                 SAM
                        Who?

                                 ARI
                        Import-Exporter. I tracked him 
                        assisting a Gestapo Officer in 
                        Miami a few years ago.

           Sam grabs the phone off the manager’s desk and dials.

           Sitting under the no smoking sign, Ari lights up. The bank 
           manager watches Ari. 

                                 BANK MANAGER
                        Could you spare one?

           Ari smiles warmly and shakes a smoke out of the pack for him.

                                 SAM
                              (into telephone)
                        I need a jet to Miami. 

           He looks over at the smoking, trembling bank manager.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        And you’re gonna need to send a 
                        follow-up to the bank. 

           INT. SAM’S PICK UP TRUCK, BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

           As they climb back into Sam’s truck TWO AGENCY SUITS speak 
           calmly to the bank manager. Sam shuts the door and glares at 
           his father. 

           Ari waves off his look.

                                 ARI
                        I’m not a meter maid. Bankers like 
                        him all over Europe grow rich on 
                        money stolen from us. I have no 
                        patience for his technicalities.

                                 SAM
                        They’re not technicalities, they’re 
                        laws.

                                 ARI
                        The man we’re looking for drank the 
                        blood of our people and when he was 
                        done, your government gave him a 
                        napkin to wipe his fucking chin.
           Sam fires up the truck and pulls out of the lot.

                                 SAM
                        Around here people have rights, you 
                        don’t get to pick and choose who 
                        they apply to.

           Ari scoffs.

                                 ARI
                        I’m not an American, Samuel, I’m a 
                        Jew.

                                 SAM
                        Well I’m both.

                                 ARI
                        Yes. I hope you never have to chose 
                        one over the other.

           INT. KARL DREXLER’S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

           Agent Hoyt leafs through a file then slides it into a slot in 
           an large industrial SHREDDER. 

           Agent Linden enters carrying breakfast in a bag.

                                 LINDEN
                        They’re going to beat us to Miami.

                                 HOYT 
                        That’s all right. The Israeli will 
                        make it work.

           Linden hands Hoyt an egg sandwich and starts in on his.

                                 LINDEN
                        He pissed off that bank manager 
                        pretty good.

           Hoyt shrugs -- so what?

           He grabs a file off the desk at random and pushes it into the 
           shredder.

           INT. GULFSTREAM JET - DAY 

           Alone on a chartered jet, Ari and Sam settle into their 
           seats.

           Finally out of his sweatsuit, Sam undoes the button on the 
           cuff of his just-purchased shirt and rolls up his sleeve. 
                                 SAM
                        I don’t think of Miami Beach as a 
                        great spot for Nazis. A wolf in 
                        sheep’s clothing, I guess.

                                 ARI
                        You’re not in an office anymore. 
                              (Hebrew / subtitles)
                        Years of jerking off does not make 
                        you a good fuck.
                              (English)
                        You understand the meaning?

           Sam nods, unamused. 

                                 SAM
                        Don’t worry, I’m ready.

                                 ARI
                        I hope so.

           A pretty STEWARDESS brings Ari a glass of scotch then hands 
           Sam a newspaper and a glass of water. 

                                 SAM
                        On second thought, you have a can 
                        of Bud for me?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        Of course. Would you like a glass?

                                 SAM
                        No, thank you.

           She gently reaches behind Sam’s neck, pulls the PAPER TAG 
           from the shirt’s collar and hands it to him.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        I like your new shirt.

           She gives him a smile and heads back to the galley.

                                 SAM
                        I’m not the little boy you left 
                        behind.

           Ari looks at Sam then lays back and folds his pillow in half.

                                 ARI
                        I see that. 
                              (quietly sarcastic)
                        You’re a grown man who needs to 
                        impress papa.
                                 SAM
                        Excuse me?

                                 ARI
                              (Hebrew / subtitles)
                        Nevermind.

           Ari turns on his side and closes his eyes. 

           The stewardess returns with Sam’s beer. He sips it and stares 
           out the window.

           INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Sam uses a payphone. Ari smokes and watches an ELDERLY JEWISH 
           COUPLE walking through the terminal.

           Sam hangs up and joins Ari.

                                 SAM
                        Leck has a house near Liberty 
                        Square on 60th. 

           INT. RENTED SEDAN ON MIAMI STREET - NIGHT

           Ari smokes in the passenger seat while Sam drives. 

                                 ARI
                        The stewardess was pretty.

           Sam looks up from the map he’s holding against the steering 
           wheel to glance at Ari.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Did you fuck her?

                                 SAM
                        Excuse me?

                                 ARI
                        You were out of your seat.

                                 SAM
                        I was using the head.

                                 ARI
                        You were gone for a while. Being 
                        nervous upsets your stomach?

                                 SAM
                        I’m not nervous.

           Ari nods -- whatever you say.
                                 ARI
                        She liked you. You saw, no?

                                 SAM
                        The fact that I didn’t fuck the 
                        stewardess on the company-chartered 
                        plane or that I took a shit while 
                        we were flying does not mean I’m 
                        nervous about the mission.

           Sam looks at the map and makes a sudden turn through a yellow 
           light.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        And if you think I do what I do for 
                        a living to impress you, or anyone 
                        else for that matter, I’d like to 
                        point out that I didn’t want you on 
                        this job, I’ve repeatedly asked 
                        them to pull you off, and I don’t 
                        exactly go out of my way to keep in 
                        touch when I’m not being forced to 
                        fucking work with you! 

           Sam glances at Ari to see if his words had an impact. They 
           did. Ari fumbles for a cigarette.

                                 ARI
                        Feel better?

           Sam roughly hands Ari the map.

                                 SAM
                        A little. How about we stop with 
                        the family therapy and you navigate 
                        so we can catch this scumbag and go 
                        back to not speaking to each other 
                        for years at a time.

           Ari folds the map and tucks it into the center console.

                                 ARI
                        Make a left at the third light.

           INT. RENTED SEDAN IN FRONT OF GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam and Ari drive slowly past the Spanish mansion where a 
           uniformed SECURITY GUARD paces in the circular driveway.

           EXT. GARY LECK’S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Ari walks the sidewalk in front of the mansion, an unlit 
           cigarette dangling from his lip.  
           He waves to the guard.

                                 ARI
                        Got a light?

           The guard nods and Ari walks up the driveway to him.

           As the guard reaches into his pocket Ari whips out a SLAPJACK
           and slams it against the guard’s skull, knocking him out.

           Ari rolls him over, pulls the HANDCUFFS off the guard’s belt 
           and cuffs him.

           Sam pulls the rented car into the driveway with the lights 
           off. 

           He pops the truck and gets out. 

           Ari pulls the keys off the guard’s belt then roughly drags 
           him to the trunk.

                                 SAM
                        Take it easy.

           Ari flips the guard back over and tears open his shirt. The 
           guy’s chest is covered in NEO-NAZI TATTOOS.

           Sam grabs the guard under the arms and helps Ari throw him 
           into the trunk, hard.

           EXT. GARY LECK’S BACK YARD - NIGHT

           A door in the wall behind the tennis court slowly opens.

           Ari peeks in, then enters carrying his silenced .45.

           Sam follows after him.

           They move slowly and quietly through the expansive yard.

           Ari tries the guard’s keys in the back door.

           He finds the right one, nods to Sam and then opens the door 
           very slowly.

           INT. BILLIARD ROOM, GARY LECK’S MANSION - NIGHT

           The interior of Leck’s house shows off his extreme wealth.

           Ari and Sam creep through silent house.

           They reach a long hall. Ari signals for them to split up. Sam 
           nods and move in opposite directions.
           INT. LIVING ROOM, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam moves past a hanging tapestry.

           He pauses to listen -- the muffled SOUNDS OF A COUPLE HAVING 
           SEX enter the room

           INT. KITCHEN, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ari looks around the cavernous kitchen.

           He opens the pantry door and explores the shelves.

           INT. HALLWAY, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam moves toward an open door at the far end of the hall.

           INT. PANTRY, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ari pulls on a shelf and a wall of canned food swings out 
           revealing a HIDDEN STAIRCASE.

           INT. OFFICE, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           On the huge PARTNERS DESK in the ornate office an AFRICAN-
           AMERICAN COUPLE is having pornographic sex. They’re very 
           young and very high.   

           GARY LECK, 60s, wearing a white tennis outfit, sits at the 
           desk watching with rapt interest.

           A GRIZZLED SECURITY GUARD, late 40’s, suit and tie, stands 
           behind Leck watching as well.

                                 GARY LECK
                        Harder, please.

           The sound of Sam cocking his pistol gets their attention.

           The couple stops fucking and stares at Sam in the doorway.

                                 MALE SEX PERFORMER
                        You didn’t say nothing about no 
                        guns.

           The guard slowly reaches into his jacket. Sam gets a step 
           closer and aims at the guard’s chest.

                                 SAM
                        Keep your hands out of that jacket 
                        unless you want some holes in it.

           Sam gestures down and the guard slowly lowers himself onto 
           the Persian rug.
           The naked guy on the desk starts to get up, blocking Sam’s 
           angle on Leck and the Guard.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Lay down, dummy!

           He does as told, pressing himself against the naked girl.

                                 GARY LECK
                        I don’t know where he is.

                                 SAM
                        Oh? Where who is? Stand up! 

           Leck doesn’t move. 

                                 GUARD
                        Who are you? I want to see a badge.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck you!
                              (to Leck)
                        You, Stan Smith, get the fuck up 
                        now.

           The guard puts his hand on Leck’s leg -- ‘stay put’.

           Leck shoots a glance to the door at the back of the office. 
           He makes a slight move toward it then thinks better of it.

           Sam takes a step closer. 

           Unbeknownst to Sam, a second, YOUNGER GUARD moves into the 
           room silently, pointing a shotgun at the back of Sam’s head.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I said get up.

           Sam spots the girl’s eyes looking behind him and he turns.

           His cheek presses into the barrel of the younger guard’s gun.

                                 GUARD
                        Shoot him.

           Confusion crosses the younger guard’s face. 

                                 GUARD (cont’d)
                        Shoot him now!

                                 ARI (O.S.)
                        Do not!

           Startled, the younger guard turns back to the door and fires.
           Ari is crouched on the floor half hidden behind the door 
           frame.

           He returns fire killing the younger guard instantly.

           The couple on the desk bolt up and run for the back door. 

           The older guard jumps up, pulls his pistol and fires.

           Sam dives down behind the desk.

           Leck runs to the back door where the naked couple struggle to 
           get it open. 

           He shoves them aside, opens it and runs out into the back 
           yard.

           The guard crawls around the huge desk toward Sam who in turn 
           crawls after him, circling the desk.

           Ari runs out the back door after Leck.

           The guard fires at Sam’s foot -- missing, he shatters the 
           base of Leck’s chair.

           Sam whips around and fires back, but the guard dips back 
           behind his corner of the desk.

           EXT. GARY LECK’S BACK YARD - NIGHT

           Leck runs across his palatial back yard. All that tennis has 
           paid off, he moves fast for a man his age.

           Behind him, Ari, winded, struggles to keep up. 

           Leck cuts through the tennis court moving toward the rear 
           gate where Sam and Ari entered. 

           Ari is way back, Leck is gonna make it.

           Ari drops to one knee, aims his pistol carefully and fires. 

           INT. OFFICE, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam ejects the unfinished magazine out of his pistol and 
           slips in a fully loaded one.

           He takes a deep breath, starts to inch forward around the 
           desk, then stops. 

           Sam listens for a beat. Suddenly he swings his arm up so that 
           his pistol is flat on the desk and fires four quick shots.

           He pulls his arm down and waits.
           The guard’s body rolls off the desk and hits the carpet with 
           a THUD.

           Sam stands up and kicks the gun out of the guard’s hand.

           EXT. GARY LECK’S TENNIS COURT - NIGHT

           Leck is hung up on the net. Blood runs from the hole in the 
           back of his skull into a pool that spreads on the freshly 
           painted clay court.

           Ari pulls Leck’s body off the net.

                                 SAM (O.S.)
                        What the fuck did you do!

           Sam bends down to check Leck’s pulse. Ari laughs at this.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        What’s fucking funny?

                                 ARI
                        The hole through his brain will 
                        stop his pulse.

           Sam is thoroughly disgusted.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Were you planning to interrogate 
                        him?

                                 SAM
                        That would get us farther than 
                        shooting him in the fucking back.

                                 ARI
                        A man like this has a team of 
                        lawyers. He’s not talking to you.

                                 SAM
                        Right, so fucking kill him!

                                 ARI
                        In your world of attorneys and due 
                        process there has to be some point 
                        where push comes to shove, no? Or 
                        did you talk that guard into 
                        handing over his pistol?

           Sam stands up and yells into Ari’s face.
                                 SAM
                              (screaming)
                        I don’t give a fuck how goddamn
                        tough you are and how I’m a some 
                        fucking pussy desk worker, you 
                        asshole! You just killed our last 
                        fucking lead! 

           Ari takes a step back and wipes some spittle off his cheek.

           He smiles and calmly gestures for Sam to follow him.

                                 ARI
                        Come.

           INT. PANTRY, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ari leads Sam down the hidden staircase. 

           INT. BASEMENT CHAMBER, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The dark room is furnished with a cot, a desk and chair and 
           some bookshelves. 

           Sam looks at the cot, it has been used recently.

           Old NAZI PARTY PHOTOGRAPHS hang framed on the walls. 

           Leaning against the wall by the desk is a life size OIL 
           PAINTING OF HITLER.

           Ari moves the painting revealing a SAFE. He bends down and 
           begins to work the combination.

                                 ARI
                        With proper safe etiquette, you 
                        chose a random combination and 
                        memorize it. Half the time these 
                        schmucks use Hitler’s birthday.   

           The safe opens with a CLINK. Ari stands up. 

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        The idiot saved us three hours of 
                        safe cracking.

           Sam reaches into the safe and eagerly pulls out several 
           folders.

           He looks up at Ari who winks then drops the oil painting over 
           the chair so the back rips through the canvas.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Maybe another lead, no?
           Sam gives his father a small smile.

           INT. LIVING ROOM, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A team of UNIFORMED CLEAN-UP MEN swarm through the house.

           Agent Hoyt and Agent Linden sit on Leck’s couch with Sam 
           leafing through a file from the safe.

           Sam hands Hoyt a PHOTOGRAPH OF RINALDO SANTOS, 50’s, a 
           greaseball.

                                 SAM
                        Drexler doesn’t want to travel 
                        south with that much cash so they 
                        funnel it down to this guy who keep 
                        the locals out of it. 

           Sam hands Hoyt a PHOTO OF SANTOS WITH A TEENAGE BOY.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Santos is having a homosexual 
                        affair, probably arranged by Leck. 
                        Drexler trades him the negatives in 
                        return for safe transfer of the 
                        cash and some connections.

                                 AGENT LINDEN
                        What’s our time frame?

                                 SAM
                        Immediate.

                                 AGENT HOYT
                        You have a contact point?

                                 SAM
                        Niteroi, just outside of Rio. 

           Linden looks to Hoyt.

                                 AGENT LINDEN
                        If they know he’s left the country, 
                        the Soviets will be looking for 
                        Drexler.

                                 SAM
                        I can handle that.

           Linden gives him a look -- oh yeah?

                                 AGENT LINDEN
                        How’s our friend working out? He 
                        sure doesn’t mind making a mess.
           Sam looks at them, trying to get a read on Hoyt.

                                 SAM
                        It’s not the way I operate, but it 
                        has its advantages. That said, I 
                        don’t think I’ll need him anymore.

                                 AGENT LINDEN
                        No? He got us everything we have so 
                        far.

                                 SAM
                        I could have acquired the same 
                        information without violating the 
                        charter.

           Hoyt laughs.

                                 AGENT HOYT
                        Without violating the charter? How 
                        long you think that’d take? 
                        Drexler’d be dead of old age.
                              (beat)
                        We’ll get you to Rio by dawn. Both 
                        of you.

           INT. PANTRY STAIRWAY, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Sam walks down the secret stairs as a CLEAN-UP MAN walks up 
           carrying the framed Nazi party photos.

           INT.  BASEMENT CHAMBER, GARY LECK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Ari stands by a bookshelf holding a bible and a NOTE in his 
           hands. When Sam opens the door it surprises Ari and for a 
           tiny instant he moves as if to conceal the note and bible, 
           but then he doesn’t.

                                 SAM
                        We’re on a flight to Rio in an 
                        hour. 

           Sam looks at the note in Ari’s hands.

                                 ARI
                        You know the S.S. trick? 

           Ari opens the bible and shows Sam the note, a YELLOWED PIECE 
           OF PAPER FOLDED IN HALF. 

                                 SAM
                        Yes, emergency communication!

           Ari looks at his son with pride.
                                 ARI
                        You have done your research.

                                 SAM
                        I didn’t know they used the bible.

                                 ARI
                        Smart, no? There is a bible in 
                        almost every home. Himmler’s
                        favorite passage, Jeremiah 48:10.
                              (reading)
                        Let him be cursed who does the 
                        Lord's work halfheartedly; let him 
                        be cursed who keeps back his sword 
                        from blood. 

           Sam removes the folded piece of paper and examines it. 
           There’s something written on the back. Sam reads it aloud.

           CLOSE ON NOTE AS SAM READS.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        We keep our truce? If you ask her, 
                        you will see I never told them. - 
                        K.D.

           Sam unfolds the piece of paper -- a TELEGRAM dated June 5, 

           CLOSE ON TELEGRAM AS SAM READS IT ALOUD.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                        What bad fortune to have crossed 
                        paths. Be assured, no matter what 
                        they forgive or guarantee, if you 
                        tell them I WILL FIND YOU! Good 
                        luck in the new world. - J.H.

           Sam looks up at Ari -- holy fucking shit!

                                 SAM
                        It’s him! J.H. is Julius Heinrich! 
                        Karl Drexler is attempting to make 
                        contact with the Wunderkind!

                                 ARI
                        And you wanted to go to Brazil 
                        without me.

           The thrilled look on Sam’s face flickers to embarrassment at 
           his father’s words, but when Ari smiles Sam looks back at the 
           telegram in his hands; he’s overwhelmed at the discovery.
           INT. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           Sam and Ari are seated in first class. Sam holds the yellowed 
           telegram staring at it. Ari sips a scotch.

                                 ARI
                        Does it feel good to be right after 
                        all this time?

                                 SAM
                        It’ll feel good when I get him.

                                 ARI
                        I am impressed, Samuel. 

           Sam looks at his father. For the first time he smiles at him.

                                 SAM
                        Sometime in June of 1968 Heinrich 
                        came across Drexler by chance and 
                        sent him this to warn him off 
                        telling his handlers.

                                 ARI
                        Apparently it worked.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe. I want to know who the woman 
                        is Drexler refers to?

           Sam flips the telegram over and reads aloud.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        If you ask her, you will see I 
                        never told them.

                                 ARI
                        She may be of key importance.

                                 SAM
                        And why does Drexler think Heinrich 
                        would go to the house in Miami?

           Ari shrugs.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        I’d like to ask Gary Leck.

                                 ARI
                        I know. I am sorry.
                                 SAM
                        Don’t be sorry, just do me a favor, 
                        when we find Drexler, let me take 
                        him before you kill everyone in 
                        site.

                                 ARI
                        Samuel, I am proud of you. Even if 
                        you hate me, I am. And I will do 
                        what I can to keep him alive, but 
                        remember it is not only me.

           Ari extinguishes his cigarette, reclines his seat and closes 
           his eyes. Sam folds the telegram and closes his eyes as well.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t hate you.

           Ari cracks an eye and looks at his son.

           INT. TERMINAL, RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT, BRAZIL - DAWN

           Sam and Ari move through the terminal with other tired 
           PASSENGERS. 

                                 SAM
                        I need a minute.

           He points to the men’s room. Ari nods and follows him in.

           Concealed behind a bank of pay phones LEONID KAMKOV, 30’s, a 
           Soviet civil servant in disco clothes, watches them enter the 
           bathroom. He drops a coin into a pay phone.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM, RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT, BRAZIL - DAWN

           Ari finishes at a urinal and walks to the sink to wash his 
           hands. 

           He looks at the basket of hand-towels next to the sink. Next 
           to the basket is a tray of assorted colognes and a half-full 
           tip jar. Ari suddenly tenses. He scans the men’s room.

           Ari looks under the toilet stalls. Two sets of feet indicate 
           that two stalls next to each other are occupied.

           With the sink still running, Ari grabs a large bottle of 
           cologne and quietly steps over to the first stall door. 

           Ari kicks in the door, scaring the hell out of Sam who is 
           sitting on the toilet with his pants around his knees. 

           Ari looks surprised to see Sam, he immediately yanks him off 
           the toilet.
                                 SAM
                        What the fuck!

           Suddenly the divider between the two stalls drops and a MAN 
           WITH A GREASY BANDANA COVERING HIS FACE lurches at Sam 
           swinging a thin hooked knife.

           He rakes the blade down Sam’s back as Sam leaps out of the 
           stall scrambling to pull his pants up.

           Ari smashes the bottle of cologne across the assassin’s face 
           and kicks the man back into the stall.

           The assassin falls back and sits on the toilet swinging the 
           knife at Ari to back him off while he regains his composure 
           and blinks the cologne out of his eyes.

           Sam whips off his jacket, steps into the stall and throws his 
           jacket over the hand in which the assassin holds the knife.

           Sam jerks up on the jacket pulling the man off balance and at 
           the same time slams his fist into the side of the man’s head.

           The assassin is stunned but for only a brief instant. He 
           grits his teeth and shoves the knife up -- the tip of the 
           sharp blade pops through Sam’s jacket.

           Crammed into the small space of the stall, Sam and the 
           assassin strain against each other’s power, Sam shoving down 
           on the knife hand, the man inching it up to Sam’s throat. 

           Ari steps over Sam into the stall, flicks his zippo and 
           presses the flame into the man’s hair.

           The cologne that drenches the assassin’s head ignites. The 
           man screams, drops the knife and swings around to douse his 
           face in the toilet.

           Ari rears up and kicks the man in the base of his skull with 
           all his might.

           The assassin instantly goes limp and collapses. Ari snaps his 
           zippo shut and stands up breathing hard. 

           Sam stares down at the man lying in a pile by the toilet.

                                 ARI
                        Are you alright?

           Sam remembers the cut on his back. He feels for it and brings 
           back a bloody hand.

                                 SAM
                        I’m fine.
           Ari turns him to look. The gash is not small. 

                                 ARI
                        I will suture it at the hotel.

                                 SAM
                        How’d you know?

           Ari opens the janitor’s closet. The BATHROOM ATTENDANT falls 
           out, his throat slit. 

                                 ARI
                        They never leave the tip jar 
                        unattended.

           Sam looks at the tip jar by the sink.

           Ari smiles. He walks to the sink and washes the sweat off his 
           face. He is spent.

           Sam bends down and examines the dead man. 

                                 SAM
                        Not Russian.

                                 ARI
                        Contract. 

                                 SAM
                        We need to move on now.

                                 ARI
                        I agree.

           Ari takes off his jacket and puts it on Sam covering his 
           bloody back.

           EXT. RIO DE JANEIRO AIRPORT, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Sam and Ari get into a TAXI.

           Wearing oversized aviator sunglasses, LEONID KAMKOV steps out 
           of the terminal and watches their cab drive away.

           INT. TAXI ON COASTAL STREET, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL - DAY 

           Sam leans back on his cut and winces. The blood is beginning 
           to seep through Ari’s jacket.

                                 SAM
                        Did you make the man in the 
                        aviators?
                                 ARI
                        Yes.

                                 SAM
                        He was by the men’s room when we 
                        went in.

                                 ARI
                        Working with our friend no doubt.

                                 SAM
                        Should we circle back and see what 
                        he knows?

                                 ARI
                        No, we need to fix you up. And I’m 
                        surprised you would propose that. 

                                 SAM
                        Why? I’m still operational.

                                 ARI
                        It’s not that. He’s K.G.B. Any 
                        question we ask would likely tell 
                        him more than we could get from 
                        him. We couldn’t leave him alive.
                              (beat)
                        Samuel, always listen for the 
                        answer that comes in the form of a 
                        question. 

           Sam stares out the window as they drive past a beach.

                                 SAM
                        Odd that the Russians hired a 
                        contract killer, no?

                                 ARI
                        What do you think I am to your 
                        agency?

           Sam looks at his father. Ari lights a cigarette.

           INT. RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY 

           The apartment is decorated like Leonid was dressed, very 
           flashy and extremely tacky. If the Kremlin knew how their 
           money was being spent there would be hell to pay.

           A loud KNOCK sounds on the door and IVAN YERMALOV, 250 pounds 
           of muscle, answers it. He has to remove a heavy crossbar to 
           open the door. Ivan’s hands are bloody and it’s not his 
           blood.
           Leonid enters holding a six-pack in each hand and smiling.

                                 IVAN
                        You never want to work.

                                 LEONID
                        I’ll drink yours if you’d like to 
                        keep complaining.

           Ivan grabs a beer.

                                 IVAN
                        How is the Israeli?

                                 LEONID
                        He is as good as I said.

                                 IVAN
                        Did our man get the American?

                                 LEONID
                        Nope.

                                 IVAN
                        The locals are worthless.

                                 LEONID
                        Any information from your friend?

           Ivan’s face jumps like he just remembered something and 
           rushes into the bathroom. Leonid follows.

           INT. RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

           A system of ROPES and PULLEYS has been set up above the tub. 
           A BOUND and BLEEDING BRAZILIAN MAN hangs by his feet upside-
           down, with his head under the bloody water.

           Ivan grabs a rope and hauls him up. The man coughs out a 
           mouthful of blood and takes the biggest breath he can hold.

                                 IVAN
                        Where is he?

                                 BRAZILIAN MAN
                        Please lord Jesus, I don’t know! 

           Ivan punches the man in the gut. He retches and coughs.

                                 BRAZILIAN MAN (cont’d)
                        Please, I am not lying! Please!

           The man is sobbing. Leonid doesn’t like to watch it.
                                 LEONID
                        I don’t think he’s lying.

           Ivan looks at the man for a beat then shrugs and begins to 
           lower him.

                                 BRAZILIAN MAN
                        Thank you. I speak the truth, I 
                        swear it. Praise Jesus. Thank you.

           Ivan keeps lowering him until his body is submerged. A look 
           of abject terror fills the man’s face and he begins to writhe 
           trying to get air. Ivan is loving it.

           Leonid looks at Ivan and leaves the bathroom disgusted. Ivan 
           laughs.

                                 IVAN
                        You’re burying this one.

           Smiling Ivan turns on the tap in the tub.

           INT. RIO HILTON - DAY 

           Sam sits on the edge of a table with his shirt off. Ari sews 
           up the knife slash on his back.

           The cut runs parallel to Sam’s spine for over a foot. It’s 
           held shut by black sutures. 

           Ari dabs blood off the wound with gauze and pushes the needle 
           through Sam’s skin for the final stitch. Sam doesn’t flinch.

           Ari steps back and admires his work. 

           Sam hands him a roll of duct tape.

                                 ARI
                        It’s some of my best, Samuel, 
                        they’ll hold.

                                 SAM
                        All the same, I don’t plan on 
                        babying it.

           Ari begrudgingly tears off a length of tape and presses it on 
           the wound over the stitches.

           Sam stretches, testing the tape then walks over to his bed.

           Laid out neatly on the bedspread is a BRAND-NEW-IN-THE-BOX 
           .45 AUTOMATIC, several magazines, and a cleaning kit. 

           Sam loads a clip.
           Ari starts in on a tray of room service.

                                 ARI
                        The food here is excellent and I 
                        ordered too much. Please eat some. 
                        You need your strength.

                                 SAM
                        I’m alright, thanks.

           Sam carefully unpacks the pistol. He deftly field-strips the 
           weapon. Using the cleaning kit he oils the parts.

           He quickly reassembles the gun, slaps in a full magazine and 
           racks the slide. 

           He drops out the magazine, racks the slide again, ejects the 
           round, replaces the round in the magazine and starts over. 

           Ari pushes away his food and lights a smoke, watching.

                                 ARI
                        There is nothing to be nervous 
                        about. Your training will serve you 
                        and I’ll be with you.

                                 SAM
                        I’m not nervous, I’m familiarizing 
                        myself with the weapon. 

                                 ARI
                        A .45 is what you carried in 
                        Florida, no?

                                 SAM
                        Not this one.

                                 ARI
                        Ah, I see.

           Sam repeats the drill then opens his neatly packed shaving 
           kit. He pulls out an old fashioned safety razor and removes 
           the blade.

           Sam makes a tiny incision in the waistband of his underwear, 
           and slides the razor into the band by his hip.

                                 SAM
                        May I?

           He takes Ari’s cigarette and melts the edge of the elastic 
           band sealing the blade inside. Ari finds this quite amusing.

           Sam gets up and begins to dress.
                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        How soon ‘til you’re ready? I’d 
                        like to be in Niteroi by sundown.

           Ari tears open the box to his new .45, shoves the pistol in 
           his waistband, dumps a handful of bullets into his pocket, 
           takes one last bite of dinner and grabs his hat.

                                 ARI
                        Let’s go.

           Sam looks at him for a beat. Ari points to Sam’s hidden razor 
           blade.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        I have my electric razor if I need 
                        an emergency shave.

           Sam grabs a dinner roll off the tray and they head out.

           INT. PICK-UP TRUCK ON STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - DUSK

           Sam drives. Ari smokes. No one talks. 

           The sunlight is almost gone as Sam cuts the lights and parks 
           on a narrow street with the truck facing down a steep grade.

           Ari opens the glove box and hands Sam a pair of brand new 
           binoculars, then pulls a set for himself.

           They gaze at the large villa at the base of the hill. It’s 
           the nicest house on the block with a huge swimming pool.

                                 SAM
                        I’d like to have been here an hour 
                        ago.

                                 ARI
                        Don’t worry. Like rats, they wait 
                        for dark.

                                 SAM
                        Even still.

                                 ARI
                        I asked you if I could drive.

                                 SAM
                        What does that mean?

                                 ARI
                        Nevermind.
                                 SAM
                        What?

           Sam puts his binoculars aside and looks at his father. Ari 
           does not take his attention off the house.

                                 ARI
                        You are an excellent driver, very 
                        safe.

                                 SAM
                        You don’t think so?

                                 ARI
                        I do think so, that is why I said 
                        it.

                                 SAM
                        So what is it?

                                 ARI
                        Nothing.

                                 SAM
                        Say it.

           Ari looks at Sam.

                                 ARI
                        Did you notice the cars passing us?

                                 SAM
                        Yes. They drive like shit down 
                        here.

                                 ARI
                        Did you notice that every car 
                        passed us? 

                                 SAM
                        Not every car.

                                 ARI
                        The old woman on the moped? The 
                        cripple?

                                 SAM
                        She wasn’t crippled.

                                 ARI
                        But she had a cane, yes?
                                 SAM
                        Would you rather have been stopped 
                        by the police?

                                 ARI
                        You’re a curious person, Samuel. 

                                 SAM
                        What does that mean?

                                 ARI
                        You’re in a foreign country to kill 
                        a man, yet you’re concerned with a 
                        speeding ticket.

                                 SAM
                        Right, why be careful? If we get 
                        pulled over, fuck it, just slit the 
                        cop’s throat. And I’m not here to 
                        kill, I’m here to arrest.

                                 ARI
                        Arrest? At best the Brazilians 
                        would view it as an abduction.

                                 SAM
                        All the more reason to use caution. 
                        There’s a time and place for 
                        everything.

                                 ARI
                        Correct. I believe the time...

           Ari goes silent and points out the window. Sam looks.

           THROUGH BINOCULARS:

           The lights come on in the pool behind the villa. A HANDSOME 
           YOUNG POOL BOY runs out naked and dives into the blue water. 

           RINALDO SANTOS follows him. Santos has sweated through his 
           oversized linen suit and he is angrily gesticulating at the 
           pool boy to get out of the water. 

           The pool boy is being coy. Santos chases him from one edge of 
           the pool to another trying to coax him out.

           Sam turns to Ari.

                                 SAM
                        Is he stalling for time? 

           Ari drops his binoculars and pulls his gun. 
                                 ARI
                        Shit, yes. 

           Sam and Ari jump out of the truck.

           EXT. STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam and Ari run toward the house.

           Sam is well ahead of his father. Just as he is about to cross 
           the street to the villa, a SILVER MERCEDES pulls into the 
           driveway and cuts its lights.

           Sam ducks in between two parked cars. He reaches out and 
           grabs Ari as he passes and yanks him in. 

                                 ARI
                        What are you doing? It’s him!

           He grips his father’s shirt tightly.

                                 SAM
                        Look right.

           Outraged, Ari careful peers out. He calms when he spots the 
           HALF-DOZEN UNIFORMED POLICEMEN concealed in the hedges of the 
           house to the right of the villa.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        And left.

           The yard of the house on the other side also has SEVERAL 
           UNIFORMED MEN lying in wait. 

           They are all watching Drexler as he gets out of the Mercedes 
           and stretches.

                                 ARI
                        Shit!

                                 SAM
                        Who are they?

                                 ARI
                        Our bad luck. This is what the boy 
                        was stalling for. They’re here for 
                        Santos, but if Drexler spots them 
                        he’ll run.

           EXT. SANTOS VILLA, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Drexler reaches back into the car and grabs an envelope. He 
           closes the door and walks to the front of the house.
           Just before he rings the bell he stops, slaps the side of his 
           head “oops!” and returns to the Mercedes. 

           He gets back in and bends down. 

           EXT. STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

                                 SAM
                        What the fuck’s he doing?

           Ari doesn’t respond, he just watches.

           Everybody waits.

           EXT. SANTOS VILLA, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Finally a POLICEMAN steps out of the shadows towards the 
           Mercedes. At that exact moment the reverse lights come on and 
           Drexler guns the car backward, peeling out of the driveway.

           EXT. STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           The Policeman runs towards him. 

           Drexler slams the back of the Mercedes into the car parked in 
           front of the two cars that Sam and Ari are hiding between. 

           The chain reaction smashes the parked cars together. Sam 
           leaps out but Ari is too slow. His left leg is crushed 
           between the cars’ bumpers.

           Ari stifles a scream and Sam rushes around to him.

           Drexler pulls a pistol and shoots the Policeman in the chest.

           The other policeman fire at Drexler’s Mercedes. 

           Stray bullets slam into the cars Ari is stuck between. 

           Drexler guns the engine and pulls away, freeing Ari. Sam 
           drags Ari out of the line of fire behind a parked van.

                                 ARI
                        Go!

           Sam quickly attends to Ari’s leg.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        What are you doing? Get him!

                                 SAM
                        I have to stop the bleeding.

           Ari’s injury is bad, the bone juts out slightly.
           Sam pulls off his shirt and slides out his belt. He carefully 
           packs the shirt around the leg and works the belt to keep 
           pressure on the gushing wound.

           In the street Drexler’s Mercedes has stalled from the hail of 
           bullets into the engine block. Smoke pours from the hood. 

           Drexler grabs the dead policeman’s rifle and takes cover 
           behind the Mercedes. From there he is exchanging fire with 
           the police. The old man is a good shot and two of the less 
           concealed policeman drop.

           Suddenly a GARBAGE TRUCK rounds the corner. The DRIVER sees 
           the firefight and locks his brakes -- too late, he smashes 
           into the Mercedes, wedging his truck in the narrow street.

           The shooting stops and the police begin to yell orders.

           Sam peers around the van and sees the police slowly moving 
           toward the truck.

           INT. GARBAGE TRUCK, STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           The terrified driver hides on the floorboard.

           Drexler opens the passenger side door of the cab and climbs 
           in crouching. He presses his pistol to the driver’s head.

                                 DREXLER
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Drive!

           Shaking, the driver gets up behind the wheel and puts the 
           truck into reverse. He grinds back off the Mercedes. 

                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        Forward!

           The driver’s eyes go wide but he obeys, putting the truck in 
           drive he moves towards the policemen.

           EXT. BEHIND PARKED VAN, NITEROI, BRAZIL - DUSK

           Ari uses his elbows to drag himself to where he can see the 
           street from between two cars.

                                 ARI
                        Samuel!

           He turns to his father. Ari pulls a grenade out of his jacket 
           and rolls it to Sam. Sam is surprised to see a grenade.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Throw it into the truck!
           Sam looks at him, then at the grenade.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        It has a long fuse, pull the pin 
                        now, when he passes, throw it in 
                        the cab.

           Sam looks back into the street. The police are backing away 
           from the truck. All that can be seen of Drexler is his hand 
           holding the pistol to the temple of the terrified truck 
           driver. 

           Sam watches. The truck is now right next to where he is 
           hidden, he could easily toss the grenade into the cab.

           Sam locks eyes with the terrified truck driver, sweat pours 
           down the man’s brow.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Throw it!

           Sam stares.

           The truck passes him and pushes up against the bumper of an 
           empty POLICE CAR that blocks the tight street. The car is no 
           match for the heavy truck, which shoves it out of the way and 
           continues down the street.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        What are you doing?

           From behind, the policemen shoot at the truck’s tires. One 
           goes flat but it still moves forward, its speed increasing.

                                 SAM
                        They’ve got him.

           Ari lets out a sigh and collapses.

                                 ARI
                        No. They do not. 

           INT. GARBAGE TRUCK, STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           As the truck clears the intersection, Drexler fires a round 
           into the driver’s head and pushes his body out the door. 

           He guns the engine, speeds down the block a hundred yards, 
           then jerks the wheel, slamming the truck diagonally into the 
           parked cars so that it is blocking the entire street.

           EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK, STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Drexler quickly climbs out of the cab.
           He unscrews the cap to the truck’s gas tank, stuffs his 
           handkerchief halfway in, lights it and runs down the street.

           EXT. STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           The policeman slowly move toward the truck from behind.

           A policeman spots the burning gas tank, shouts a warning and 
           they all back away.

           The tank blows, engulfing the cab in flames.

           A BRAVE POLICEMAN walks around the truck, climbs onto a 
           parked car and peers into the cab.

           He shouts down to his companions and they scan the street. 

           Drexler is long gone.

           EXT. BEHIND PARKED VAN, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Sam watches the policeman return from the truck empty handed.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck.

           He looks over to the villa and sees Santos being led out in 
           cuffs. After Santos, the pool boy exits smiling.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Fuck!

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam sits with his head in his hands, his eyes closed.

           Using a cane Ari hobbles into the room his ankle encased in a 
           sturdy cast.

                                 ARI
                        Your concern better be for the 
                        mission and not me. I’ve fought 
                        wars with worse than this. 

           Ari taps the cast with his cane and Sam manages a smile.

                                 SAM
                        You’re OK?

                                 ARI
                        No. I’m old, fat and slow.
                                 SAM
                        I got us a room. We can figure out 
                        where to begin again tomorrow.

                                 ARI
                        No, there’s only one thing to do 
                        now.

           INT. TERMAS BAR, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT  

           The bar is loud, fun and full of RIDICULOUSLY ATTRACTIVE 
           BRAZILIAN WOMEN, some working, some partying.

           Ari shakes a pain pill out of bottle and downs it with a sip 
           of scotch. Across the table Sam sips a beer. Several empties 
           clutter their table.

                                 ARI
                        A Brazilian woman can take my mind 
                        off anything.

           Sam nods and takes a sip of his beer. 

                                 SAM
                        How the fuck are we gonna find him 
                        now.

                                 ARI
                        Ah-ah-ah, we don’t think of the 
                        mission any more tonight.

                                 SAM
                        Without Santos we got nothing.

                                 ARI
                        I have been doing this for many 
                        years. There’s always something. 
                        Clear your head for now. 

           A BEAUTIFUL WAITRESS, 18, sets the next round on their table.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Thank you, sweetheart.

           Ari slips money into her tight back pocket and pats her butt. 
           She kisses him gently on the lips and walks back to the bar.

                                 SAM
                        I think she likes you.

                                 ARI
                        No, they just know me here. 
                        Besides, she’s too old for me.
           Ari winks at his son and takes a gulp of his fresh drink.

           A group of CUTE LOCAL GIRLS near them are celebrating a 
           birthday and the BIRTHDAY GIRL keeps looking over at Sam.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Enjoy it while you can, Samuel, the 
                        mind may sharpen but the body does 
                        not.

           Ari takes a sip and leans in close to Sam.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        When I was your age and it was hard 
                        I couldn’t even bend it. Now, if it 
                        gets hard at all, I can bend it in 
                        half.

           Sam smiles and sips his beer.

                                 SAM
                        Maybe you’re getting stronger.

           Ari laughs. Sam shakes his head.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        Thanks for the hard-on quality 
                        update, I was wondering.

                                 ARI
                        Fuck you, without my hard-ons you 
                        wouldn’t exist. 

           The birthday girl is clearly making eyes at Sam. He smiles 
           politely then returns his attention to Ari.

                                 SAM
                        This is a good bar.

                                 ARI
                        If you like this, there is a place 
                        in Sao Paulo I have to take you to.

                                 SAM
                        Sao Paulo?

                                 ARI
                        Yes. I think we go there tomorrow.

                                 SAM
                        What’s in Sao Paulo?

           Ari sips his scotch.
                                 ARI
                        It’s a beautiful city. And filled 
                        with Germans.

           Sam looks at Ari trying to read more from his face. Ari waves 
           his finger at Sam.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Ah, no! This is my fault. We do not 
                        talk about work tonight!

           Ari finishes his scotch and slams the glass on the table.

           Birthday Girl and her REDHEAD FRIEND get up and begin to 
           dance to the loud music. 

           They wave at Sam and he waves back. Ari turns to see them 
           then looks at his son.

           The girls gesture for Sam to join them. He smiles, downs his 
           beer and begins to slide out of the his booth. 

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Aha. So you’re not made entirely of 
                        stone after all! 

                                 SAM
                        Only the important part.

           Sam puts his empty bottle on the table and leans down to Ari.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        One work question: what’s with the 
                        fucking hand grenade?

                                 ARI
                        Well, some people feel safer with a 
                        razor blade in their underpants, 
                        others prefer a grenade. 

           Sam laughs. Ari waves Sam away.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Go now. The best revenge is living 
                        well. And I promise Drexler will be 
                        just as dead when I kill him next 
                        week.

           Sam joins the girls on the dance floor.

           Ari lights a cigarette. He hefts his heavy cast up onto the 
           seat next to him and closes his eyes.
           INT. V-2 ROCKET ASSEMBLY LINE, NORDHAUSEN, GERMANY 1944 - DAY 

           Young Ari walks the line at the plant, clipboard in hand. 

           He watches a NEW PRISONER slide two pieces of rocket engine 
           together. When they don’t fit the man shoves them roughly. 

           Ari smacks him with the clipboard.

                                 ARI
                        Gentle. Always gentle.

           The prisoner glares up at him with pure rage.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Would you rather be slapped by me 
                        or shot by him?

           The prisoner eyes the NAZI standing guard and returns to his 
           work. He carefully slides the two pieces together, they fit. 

           INT. NORDHAUSEN V-2 ROCKET ASSEMBLY LINE - CONTINUOUS

           High above the assembly line on a walkway, Julius Heinrich 
           watches Ari’s interaction with the new prisoner.

           He points to Ari and signals to a S.S. OFFICER.

                                 HEINRICH
                        Bring that one to my office.

           INT. JULIUS HEINRICH’S OFFICE, NORDHAUSEN - DAY 

           Heinrich sits at a huge oak desk smoking and reading Ari’s 
           file. In front of him is a LARGE PLATTER OF FRESH FOOD. 

           There is a knock at the door. 

                                 HEINRICH
                        Enter.

           The S.S. Officer pushes Ari in and shuts the door.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Sit. Please.

           Ari slowly sits. Heinrich pushes the platter toward him.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Eat.

           Ari doesn’t move. Heinrich takes a deep drag of his 
           cigarette.
                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Either I’ve made a miscalculation, 
                        or you’re not a man that will take 
                        stupid pride over survival. Eat.

           Ari reaches for an apple and takes a bite. Heinrich pours a 
           glass of water and slides it to Ari.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        I have a proposal.

           Ari nods. He devours the apple and starts in on some bread.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        You men are not as easily replaced 
                        as some might think. I need an 
                        ally.

           Ari looks up from stuffing his face.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        I won’t ask you to inform on 
                        anyone, I assume you wouldn’t do it 
                        anyway. What I need is a friend and 
                        the way to make friends is through 
                        kind deeds.

           Ari is shoving raspberries into his mouth. He looks up at 
           Heinrich who opens his file.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        You’re married, yes?

           Ari nods.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        I can bring your wife here.

           Ari drops a handful of berries.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        And after her, any family members 
                        and friends we can find. You have 
                        no children?

           Ari shakes his head.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Good. I can’t help children. I want 
                        to help you, but I need someone to 
                        help me. Are you that man?

           Ari peers into Heinrich’s eyes, he peers back. Ari’s eyes 
           fall to the platter of food on the table. He stares.
           He grabs a loaf of bread, stuffs it into his pants, stands up 
           and nods.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Excellent. This will work well.

           He stands and extends his hand to Ari. Ari waits a beat, then 
           shakes it. 

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, PRISONERS’ BARRACKS - NIGHT 

           Ari shuffles into the barracks along with the rest of the 
           PRISONERS. He’s a broken man and knows it.

           Ari stops in front of the bunk belonging to the new prisoner 
           who he smacked earlier in the day. Ari tosses the loaf of 
           bread to him and continues up to his bunk.

           The man devours the untouched loaf.

           INT. TERMAS BAR, BRAZIL, 1973 - NIGHT  

           Ari sits with his eyes closed. Sam returns to the table.

                                 SAM
                        You OK?

           Ari cracks one eye and looks at his son.

                                 ARI
                        I’m gonna to turn in.

                                 SAM
                        That’s probably a good idea. You 
                        need help to your room?

           Ari looks at Birthday Girl waiting for Sam by the dance 
           floor. He stands and drains the remainder of his scotch. 

                                 ARI
                        No. Do you need help with her?

                                 SAM
                        I think I got it.

                                 ARI
                        Good boy.

           Ari pinches Sam’s cheek and makes his way out of the bar.

           Sam returns to Birthday Girl, she kisses him and pulls him 
           back onto the dance floor.
           INT. TERMAS BAR, ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ari peers back into the bar and sees Sam dancing. He waves to 
           Birthday Girl’s Redhead Friend at the bar. She glances over 
           to Sam, sees that he’s not looking and approaches Ari.

           Ari hands her two hundred dollar bills and quickly exits.

           INT. SAM’S HOTEL ROOM, NITEROI BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           The door swings open filling the dark room with light and 
           Birthday Girl pulls Sam in kissing him passionately.

           Sam kicks the door shut and they tumble to the bed.

           She pulls Sam’s shirt off and then her own. She straddles him 
           and kisses his neck. She runs her hand over the tape on his 
           back and stops.

           She turns him to look at his back, then looks up at him with 
           a curious expression.

                                 SAM
                        It’s fine.

           She peers into his eyes then kisses him deeply. 

           Things get hot fast.

           Suddenly she stops.

                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL
                        A espera um minuto, a bíblia.

           Sam does not understand.

                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL (cont’d)
                        A bíblia. A bíblia!

           She turns on the light.

                                 SAM
                        What?

           She grabs the cross hanging between her breasts. 

                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL
                        Não em lugar com uma bíblia!

           Sam still has no idea. She grabs the copy of the bible off 
           the night stand, opens the front door and places it outside.

           She locks the door and returns to the bed.
                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL (cont’d)
                              (thick accent)
                        No with bible right there.

           She shoves Sam back on the bed and kisses his chest, slowly 
           working her way down. Sam is enjoying himself.

           Suddenly he sits bolt upright. He turns on the light and 
           searches for his shirt. He finds it and heads for the door.

                                 BIRTHDAY GIRL (cont’d)
                        O que são fazendo?

                                 SAM
                        I’m sorry. Happy birthday.

           EXT. ARI’S HOTEL ROOM, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Sam slips on his shirt and pounds on Ari’s door. He paces and 
           knocks again. 

                                 SAM
                        Wake up. It’s me.

                                 ARI (V.O.)
                        (through door)
                        What time is it? 

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know, late. Let me in.

                                 ARI (V.O.)
                        It’s open.

           EXT. ARI’S HOTEL ROOM, NITEROI, BRAZIL - CONTINUOUS

           Sam enters. Ari is in bed curled up under the covers.

                                 SAM
                        You sleep with the door unlocked?

           Ari shifts in bed and the sound of a PUMP SHOTGUN RACKING A 
           SHELL INTO THE CHAMBER comes from under the covers.

                                 ARI
                        Better than a hotel lock.

                                 SAM
                        The bible.

                                 ARI
                        What about it? 
                                 SAM
                        Santos’ villa. We have to check the 
                        bible for a note from Heinrich.

           Ari thinks for a beat.

                                 ARI
                        Drexler won’t return there.

                                 SAM
                        He has to. It’s the last known 
                        point of contact.

           Again Ari thinks before responding.

                                 ARI
                        They could have a contingency.

                                 SAM
                        Regardless. We have to check.

                                 ARI
                        OK. Yes. Is there urgency?

                                 SAM
                        Are you drunk? Of course.

                                 ARI
                        Yes, OK. We’ll go. Give me a minute 
                        to get dressed. 

                                 SAM
                        You can’t go with that foot.

                                 ARI
                        I’m coming.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll be back in a half hour.

                                 ARI
                        Fuck you! I’m coming.

                                 SAM
                        You’ll be an operational liability.

                                 ARI
                              (angry)
                        Samuel, you don’t have to call me 
                        papa or give me hugs, but remember 
                        this: I wiped shit off your ass 
                        when you weren’t capable of doing 
                        it yourself! I’m coming. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ARI (cont'd)
                        I’ll be in the lobby in five 
                        minutes. Now get out of my room.

           Sam hesitates then exits. 

           Ari rubs his eyes. He tosses back the covers revealing that 
           he is FULLY DRESSED including a boot on his good foot.

           He sits on the edge of the bed and lights a cigarette. 

           EXT. HOTEL LOBBY, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam paces. A VALET pulls up and hands him the keys.

           Sam looks at the keys in his hand.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck it.

           He climbs into the truck and drives off.

           EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Leonid crouches behind a parked car across the street from 
           the Villa. 

           A FAT POLICEMAN sits at the front door dozing in the heat.

           Leonid turns and gives a hand signal. Ivan pops out of the 
           shadow of a neighboring house and creeps toward the villa.

           EXT. HOTEL LOBBY, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Ari walks out of the lobby. He stops and looks at the valet.

                                 ARI
                        He left?

                                 VALET
                        Yes sir.

           Ari stands motionless for a beat.

           He pulls a knot of cash from his pocket, peels off $1000 and 
           holds it out to the valet.

                                 ARI
                        May I buy your car?

           EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK ON STREET, NITEROI, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Sam is parked on the street overlooking Santos’ villa. 

           He looks at the villa and the policeman asleep out front.
           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Ivan and Leonid are crouched on the floor of the huge master 
           bedroom. 

           Ivan points to the bookshelf on the other side of the room 
           and they crawl towards it moving silently on the shag carpet.

           EXT. SIDE WALL, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam slowly creeps along pressed to the side of the villa. He 
           startles a bird and it flies up, RUSTLING THE LEAVES.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT 

           Ivan and Leonid hear the BIRD RUSTLING THE LEAVES and freeze. 

           They listen for a moment to the silence.  Ivan shrugs it off 
           and they continue on.

           Leonid shines a flashlight on the bookshelf and Ivan 
           searches. He locates the bible and pulls it off the shelf.

           Leonid moves in closer as Ivan opens the book. 

           He finds THE NOTE, pulls it out and unfolds it. Before we can 
           see what it says A THUD sounds from inside the bathroom and 
           they both turn towards it. 

           Leonid shuts off the flashlight and waits.

           INT. BATHROOM, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam crouches on the tile floor beneath the window.

           He turns on a dim red flashlight, clenches it in his teeth 
           and crawls to the door.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - CONTINUOUS

           Crawling, Sam pushes open the door and enters the bedroom. 

           As his head clears the door frame, Ivan kicks him in the 
           face.

           Sam leaps to his feet and pulls the bathroom door shut but 
           Ivan sticks his arm in blocking it from closing.

           Sam pushes the door back open, then slams it on Ivan’s arm 
           with renewed effort. Ivan SHOUTS IN PAIN.
           EXT. SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           The dozing policeman jumps to his feet, pulls his pistol from 
           its holster and enters the house.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM, SANTOS’ VILLA, BRAZIL - NIGHT

           Sam kicks the bathroom door back open into Ivan. Ivan 
           stumbles backwards and Sam smashes his fist into Ivan’s face. 

           Continuing to gain ground, Sam delivers a swift kick to 
           Ivan’s shin sending him to one knee. As he falls, Sam strikes 
           him on the side of his head with the butt of his flashlight.

           Ivan drops but manages to kick Sam’s feet out from under him.

           Sam lands on top of Ivan, trading blows to the face. 

           Suddenly, Leonid pulls a pillowcase over Sam’s head from 
           behind. Ivan grabs Sam’s covered head and delivers a series 
           of powerful head butts until Sam goes limp.

           Ivan rolls Sam off of him, leaps to his feet pulling a 
           revolver and fires three shots into the bedroom door.

           The door swings open and the fat policeman drops into the 
           room, dead.

           Ivan rubs the side of his head and wobbles slightly.

                                 IVAN
                        Leave the cop. Take him.

           INT. BATHROOM, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY

           Sam comes to with his head in ice water. Ivan hauls him up.

           Sam is bound with rope, hanging upside-down above the tub in 
           Ivan’s makeshift torture chamber wearing only his underwear.

                                 IVAN
                        Where is meeting?

           Ivan punches him in the gut. Leonid watches apprehensively.

                                 IVAN (cont’d)
                        Where is meeting?

           No response. Ivan lowers him into the freezing water. 

           And waits.

           And waits.
           Sam begins to writhe and Ivan hauls him out. 

                                 LEONID
                        You know where they are meeting in 
                        Sao Paulo?

           Sam is still. He looks into Leonid’s eyes.

           Ivan grabs Sam’s ears and yanks them like he’s trying to pull 
           them off of his head.

                                 IVAN
                        You no hear him? Where meeting in 
                        Sao Paulo?

           He drops Sam into the tub, banging Sam’s head on the bottom.

           He hauls Sam up so his mouth is just above the water line and 
           when Sam goes to take in a breath, he drops him back in.

           Sam chokes.  

           Finally he lifts Sam out. 

                                 IVAN (cont’d)
                        Where meeting?

           Ivan spins Sam so that he is facing his back. He reaches up 
           and tears the duct tape off of Sam’s wound. Several of the 
           stitches pop out.

           Sam’s muscles tense from the pain but he makes no sound.

                                 IVAN (cont’d)
                        Where is meeting?

           Again Ivan pulls on his ears. Sam jerks his head back and 
           forth but it’s no use. Ivan laughs.

                                 LEONID
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        You realize it is possible that he 
                        didn’t tell him?

                                 IVAN
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Don’t speak! Even in Russian.

                                 LEONID
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Don’t be stupid. You think he 
                        speaks Russian?
                                 IVAN
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Shut up! Get out. Now!

           Ivan shoves Leonid out of the bathroom. He boxes Sam in the 
           kidneys again, turns off the light and exits, leaving Sam 
           alone in the dark.

           INT. HALLWAY, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY 

           Ivan is furious, he grabs Leonid’s shirt and yells at him.

                                 IVAN
                        Idiot! Not in front of the subject.

                                 LEONID
                        Why? It doesn’t matter. All I’m 
                        saying is maybe he doesn’t know.

           INT. BATHROOM, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        How could he not know? 

           Sam listens to them arguing outside the door. He strains 
           against the ropes reaching for the elastic of his underwear.

           INT. HALLWAY, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY 

           Ivan is red with rage. Leonid calmly explains.

                                 LEONID
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        It is possible he doesn’t.

                                 IVAN 
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        He knows.

                                 LEONID 
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Why did he come back if he knows?

           Ivan looks at him for a beat.

           INT. BATHROOM, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY

           Sam is straining with all his might. The effort is making him 
           swing, which in turn makes the ropes tighter.
                                 LEONID (O.S.)
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        You are so quick to torture him to 
                        death. Maybe you are asking the 
                        wrong questions.

                                 IVAN (O.S.)
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        I will not have you questioning me!

           We hear the sound of Ivan SLAPPING Leonid.

           Sam’s hand reaches his waist. He squeezes the razor blade out 
           of his waistband bloodying his fingers. 

           He frantically hacks at the rope that binds his wrists. 

           INT. HALLWAY, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY 

           Leonid stares at his feet.

                                 IVAN
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Stay out. I will be the judge of 
                        what he knows and does not know.

           Ivan heads back into the bathroom. Leonid sulks off to the 
           kitchen.

           INT. BATHROOM, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY

           Ivan flips on the light and sees Sam standing by the tub. Sam 
           instantly slashes the razor across Ivan’s face.

           Ivan gets into a fighting stance and smiles -- his bottom lip 
           falls off!

           Ivan’s hand instinctively goes to his mouth. 

           Sam leaps at him and drives his shoulder into Ivan’s stomach, 
           knocking the wind out of him and bringing him down. Ivan’s 
           head smacks hard on the tile floor.

           Moving with frightening speed, Sam rolls Ivan over, drives 
           his knee into the back of his rib cage, grabs a fistful of 
           hair and yanks Ivan’s head back, exposing his neck.

           Sam slides the razor blade up under Ivan’s jaw and drags it 
           across his neck slitting Ivan’s throat.

           He hauls Ivan over the edge of the tub and shoves him under 
           the ice water. A massive amount of blood and air gurgle out 
           of Ivan’s neck. 
           Ivan is still. Sam stands up on shaky legs and vomits.

           He takes a deep breath, grabs the revolver out of Ivan’s 
           pants and heads out the door.

           INT. KITCHEN, RUSSIAN SAFE HOUSE, RIO - DAY 

           Leonid sits at the table drinking a beer and watching LOUD 
           BRAZILIAN TV. When he sees Sam he drops the beer and bolts 
           for a shotgun leaning on the wall by the fridge.

           Sam fires two shots at Leonid and he collapses on the floor. 

           Sam steps over him and grabs the shotgun.

           He turns Leonid over and presses the barrel of the shotgun 
           into his teeth. 

                                 SAM
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        Where’s the note?

           Leonid coughs up blood and smiles.

                                 LEONID
                              (Russian / subtitles)
                        You do speak Russian.

                                 SAM
                        Not well. Where’s the note?

           Leonid winces in pain and slides himself back away from Sam.

                                 LEONID
                        You didn’t know, did you?

                                 SAM
                        Where’s the note?

                                 LEONID
                        You didn’t know.

                                 SAM
                        Where’s the fucking note?

           Leonid points to an open OFFICE SAFE next to the couch.

           Sam reaches into the safe and removes the bible from Santos’ 
           villa. He pulls out the SMALL FOLDED NOTE.

           CLOSE ON NOTE: SAO PAULO, 2PM TOMORROW. - J.H.

           Sam sits on the couch and stares at the small piece of paper 
           in his hand. 
                                 LEONID
                        He is your father but you did not 
                        know that he was Heinrich. 

           Leonid manages to prop himself up against a wall. Blood runs 
           out of his nose and down his shirt.

                                 SAM
                        Did you see him place the note?

                                 LEONID
                        Yes. He went into the villa a half-
                        hour before you came. We waited, 
                        then went in. You surprised us.

           Sam gets up and walks over to Leonid. He bends down and 
           gently opens Leonid’s shirt. 

           Leonid has a bullet hole in his chest and one in his side. 
           Blood trickles from both.

           Leonid is wearing a gold necklace with a Star of David 
           pendant. Sam looks at it for a beat then begins to treat the 
           wounds.

           Leonid gestures for Sam to back away. 

                                 LEONID (cont’d)
                        Pointless. Get me a cigarette.

           Sam grabs a pack off the table, puts one in Leonid’s mouth 
           and lights it.

           He points to the star pendant.

                                 SAM
                        I thought you weren’t allowed to 
                        have that?

                                 LEONID
                        I’m not. But Moscow is 14,000 
                        kilometers away.

           Sam nods.

                                 LEONID (cont’d)
                        He is really your father?

           Sam looks him in the eyes but says nothing.

                                 LEONID (cont’d)
                        But you did not know.

           Sam walks back to the safe and removes SEVERAL FILES.
           He opens one and leafs through it. The file contains A 
           PHOTOGRAPH OF SAM. 

           He closes it and grabs the rest of the files out of the safe. 

           Leonid has a coughing fit and blood froths out of his nose.

                                 LEONID (cont’d)
                        He didn’t even tell his own son.

           Sam scans the files furiously, taking in all the information.

                                 SAM
                        How could he get this past Mossad?

           Leonid cracks a small grin, there’s blood between his teeth.

                                 LEONID
                        He was there before there was a 
                        Mossad. And besides, no one looks 
                        for something they don’t want to 
                        find. He’s their great hero. He 
                        brought them the heads of dozens of 
                        Nazis.

           Sam snaps out his shock.

                                 SAM
                        Where are my clothes?

           Leonid stares at Sam with glassy eyes. He’s fading out.

                                 LEONID
                        What about the wife?
                              (beat)
                        Your mother?

           A look of stunned shock comes over Sam’s face.

           The cigarette falls from Leonid’s mouth and lays on his 
           stomach, burning his flesh.  

           Sam picks up the cigarette, crushes it out and closes 
           Leonid’s lifeless eyes.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON CITY STREET, RIO - DAY 

           Sam’s bloody face and clothes draw looks from PASSERS BY. He 
           listens to the PHONE RINGING THROUGH THE RECEIVER.

           INT. BEDROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The TELEPHONE wakes Judith up. She answers half asleep.
                                 JUDITH
                        Hello?

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        What’s your name?

                                 JUDITH
                        Sam? Is that you?

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        Your real name.

                                 JUDITH
                        Sam? What time is it?

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        What’s your real name, mom?

                                 JUDITH
                        Oh my God.

           Judith sits up in bed and turns on the bedside lamp.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                        Sam, where are you?

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        I want to know your real name.

                                 JUDITH
                        How could he tell you? He swore to 
                        me he would never tell you!

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        He didn’t. What’s your name?

           Judith slowly lights a cigarette. Her hand is trembling.

                                 JUDITH
                        Heidi. My old name was Heidi.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON CITY STREET, RIO - DAY 

           Sam’s jaw clenches at the sound of her words.

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        Where are you? Can you come here?
                                 SAM
                        I’m in Brazil.

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        Is he in Brazil?

                                 SAM
                        I don’t know where my father is 
                        now.

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        Not your father, Dr. Drexler.

                                 SAM
                        What? What did you just say?

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        That’s who you are looking for 
                        isn’t it?

                                 SAM
                        What the fuck is happening?

           INT. BEDROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                 JUDITH
                        I’m sorry Sam. I really am.

                                 SAM
                              (through phone)
                        What the fuck do you know about 
                        Karl Drexler?

           Judith takes a deep drag off her cigarette.

                                 JUDITH
                        It’s coincidence that I know 
                        anything about him at all. 

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON CITY STREET, RIO - DAY 

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        His daughter went to Annapolis with 
                        you.

           Sam drops the receiver. He digs in his pocket and pulls out 
           the telegram from Gary Leck’s basement.

           Holding the telegram, Sam picks up the dangling receiver.
                                 SAM
                        June fifth, nineteen-fucking-sixty-
                        eight. He saw him at my fucking
                        graduation! 

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        Yes. After your father scared him 
                        with that telegram Drexler found 
                        me. Found us. He persuaded me to 
                        meet with him.

           Sam leans his forehead on the wall of the phone booth.

                                 JUDITH (cont’d)
                              (through phone)
                        He asked me to convince your father 
                        not to ruin it for all of us. 

                                 SAM
                        Good God.

           Judith begins to cry.

                                 JUDITH
                              (through phone)
                        I’m sorry Sam. I was afraid. I am 
                        still afraid. 

           Sam stands up upright in the booth.

                                 SAM
                        Where did you meet him?

                                 SAM
                        Because Dr. Drexler’s a creature of 
                        habit.

           INT. BEDROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judith lights a second cigarette with the butt of the first.

                                 JUDITH
                        Don’t. Sam, come home. You’re not 
                        like them. Let it be and come home.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON CITY STREET, RIO - DAY 

           Sam swallows hard. He is trembling.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t do that. Don't use your 
                        Jewish mother bullshit. You're not 
                        even Jewish. 
                              (beat)
                        I’m not even Jewish.

           INT. BEDROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judith is crying hard.

                                 JUDITH
                        You are Jewish. I made sure of 
                        that. Being Jewish is not about 
                        what’s in your veins, it’s about 
                        what’s in your head.

                                 SAM 
                              (through phone)
                        Did you kill them? Did you help him 
                        kill the real Brauers? 

           Judith is silent. She drops her cigarette into the carpet and 
           crushes it. 

                                 JUDITH
                        Hold on a second, honey, I need an 
                        ashtray.

           She reaches under the mattress and pulls out a revolver.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH ON CITY STREET, RIO - DAY 

           Sam hears the LOUD CLICK OF THE REVOLVER COCKING.

                                 SAM
                        Mom?
                                 JUDITH 
                              (through phone)
                        I love you, Samuel. Just because 
                        our lives were a lie doesn't mean 
                        yours is.

           The SOUND OF A GUNSHOT crashes through the phone.

                                 SAM
                        Mom? MOM!

           Sam slams the phone. He holds his head in his hands and 
           collapses in the phone booth.

           INT. OLD DATSUN TWO-SEATER ON HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY

           Ari steers the valet’s car through the morning traffic.

           He lights a smoke and stares at his own eyes in the rearview 
           mirror.

           INT. OFFICER’S QUARTERS, NORDHAUSEN FACILITY, 1945 - DAY

           Heinrich paces, smoking. ARTILLERY SHELLS EXPLODE nearby 
           knocking a picture off the wall. 

           A SQUAD OF NAZI SOLDIERS stand before him changing into 
           prisoners’ uniforms. Beside them is a pile of Nazi uniforms 
           and rifles.

           The SQUAD LEADER approaches Heinrich nervously.

                                 SQUAD LEADER
                        Sir, we could keep our weapons and 
                        say we took them off dead soldiers.

                                 HEINRICH 
                        You have blue eyes, blond hair and 
                        are two meters tall. It’s 
                        suspicious enough.

           The man stares at him anxiously.

                                 HEINRICH (cont’d)
                        Fine then. Bring me one.

           Relieved, he obeys retrieving a machine gun off the pile.

           Heinrich takes the weapon, cocks it and fires into the man’s 
           chest. He drops and the others stare in fear.

           Heinrich fires into the group slaughtering all of the men.
           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, MACHINE ROOM - DAY 

           Heinrich loads the soldier’s uniforms and several boxes of 
           files into a blast furnace and slams the metal door shut.

           He walks the room cranking every valve up to its maximum.

           Behind him a glass meter shatters and flames spray from a 
           pipe on the wall.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, OFFICE - DAY 

           A YOUNG WOMAN, who resembles A VERY YOUNG, GAUNT JUDITH 
           BRAUER, waits in the barren office. 

           She closes the door then pulls the wax paper off a sandwich 
           and begins to eat it ravenously. 

           On the empty desk in front of her is an automatic pistol. She 
           stares at it while chewing.

           The door opens and Heinrich enters. Startled, she moves to 
           conceal the sandwich but he sees it and gives her a 
           disapproving look.

                                 HEINRICH
                        I’ve told you, only enough to stay 
                        alive. We have to look exactly like 
                        them.

                                 YOUNG JUDITH
                        Yes. But I’m eating for two.

           Heinrich stares at her -- holy shit! 

           A smile forms on his face. He hugs her and kisses her 
           forehead then steps back.

                                 HEINRICH
                        We have to do it now.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY 

           Young Judith and Heinrich stand in front of a metal door. She 
           watches as he searches through a full key ring.

           Heinrich finds the correct key. He looks at her.

           She looks at the pistol in her trembling hand.

           Heinrich points to Judith’s belly.

                                 HEINRICH
                        For him.
           She nods and Heinrich unlocks the door.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, STORE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Young Ari sits on the floor hugging his YOUNG WIFE. Their 
           eyes stare out at Judith and Heinrich void of all expression.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY 

           Young Judith fires two shots into the storeroom. 

           We hear TWO BODIES COLLAPSING TO THE FLOOR.

           She lowers the pistol and Heinrich takes it from her.

           INT. NORDHAUSEN ROCKET FACILITY, INFIRMARY - DAY

           Heinrich sits at a table naked from the waist up, he is 
           deathly gaunt. He finishes tattooing the last digit of Ari’s 
           serial number on his forearm. 

           He slips on the shirt of Ari’s tattered uniform. 

           Seated across from him Judith is also wearing a prisoner’s 
           uniform.

           She is oblivious to the beads of blood that seep out of the 
           fresh tattoo on her forearm. Heinrich wipes it for her.

                                 HEINRICH
                        One more task. Then we go.

           Heinrich pulls a pair of medical scissors out of his pocket, 
           stands up and drops his pants. Judith’s face goes white. 

           INT. OLD DATSUN TWO-SEATER ON HIGHWAY, BRAZIL - DAY

           Ari pulls his hand out of his pants. He crushes out his 
           cigarette and looks at the tattoo on his arm. 

           He takes the exit for Sao Paulo and lights another smoke.

           ESTABLISHING SHOT: UNITED STATES EMBASSY, RIO - DAY

           INT. C.I.A OFFICE, U.S. EMBASSY, RIO - DAY 

           Agent Hoyt sits at the desk reading the Russian file. Linden 
           reads over his shoulder. 

           Sam paces, still wearing his bloody and ragged clothes.
                                 LINDEN
                        God damn!

           Hoyt passes the file to Linden and looks up at Sam.

                                 LINDEN (cont’d)
                        So Drexler managed to get a message 
                        to the Soviets tellin’ them who Ari 
                        Brauer really was. They dug up 
                        Heinrich’s old dental records and 
                        checked ‘em against Ari’s.

           Hoyt pulls PHOTOSTATS OF TWO SETS OF DENTAL X-RAYS from the 
           file. He lays them over each other, they are identical.

                                 HOYT
                        It is a solid cover. 

                                 LINDEN
                        I’ll say. Impressive setup. He 
                        brought everyone that could ID the 
                        real Brauer to the camp and had 
                        them killed. Then he assumed the 
                        identity of Brauer as a survivor 
                        and starting killing all the Nazis 
                        that could ID him as Heinrich. 
                        Shit, he was only one away from it 
                        working. 

           Linden and Hoyt look at the files nodding in appreciation of 
           Ari’s duplicity.

                                 SAM
                        Too bad you couldn’t figure an 
                        angle to use it for yourselves.

           Hoyt looks up at him, just slightly embarrassed.

                                 HOYT
                        What do you need for Drexler?

                                 SAM
                        A jet to Sao Paulo. It has to have 
                        diplomatic clearance. It has to 
                        wait for me and take off for 
                        American soil without questions 
                        when I board with two prisoners, 
                        and it has to be ready an hour ago.

                                 LINDEN
                              (sarcastic)
                        Anything else?
                                 SAM
                        Yeah, some new clothes.

                                 HOYT
                        You know where the meeting is?

                                 SAM
                        I know when it is.

           Hoyt grabs the note from the file and looks at it.

           CLOSE ON NOTE: SAO PAULO, 2PM TOMORROW. - J.H.

                                 LINDEN
                        Sao Paulo’s a big town.

                                 SAM
                        I know where Dr. Drexler is.

                                 HOYT
                        Where?

           Sam looks at him without responding.

                                 LINDEN
                        You’re asking for an awful lot to 
                        go on trust.

                                 SAM
                        We do it my way exactly or I don’t 
                        do it.

           Hoyt and Sam lock eyes for a beat. Hoyt looks away.

                                 HOYT
                        The plane will be ready in a half 
                        hour.
                              (to Linden)
                        Give him what you’re wearing.

           Linden winces then begins to undress.

           INT. LOBBY, SAO PAULO FOUR SEASONS, BRAZIL - DAY

           The wall clock by the elevators reads 1:20.

           An elevator opens and Dr. Drexler walks out and over to the 
           concierge.
           He grabs a copy of the WASHINGTON POST and reads it as he 
           exits the hotel.

           EXT. SAO PAULO FOUR SEASONS, BRAZIL - DAY

           The DOORMAN signals to a waiting TAXI. It pulls up and 
           Drexler gets in.

           INT. BACK SEAT OF TAXI, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - DAY

           A Plexiglas partition separates the driver from backseat. 

           Drexler scans the newspaper without looking up. 

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Destination, sir?

                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Port of Santos.

           INT. FRONT SEAT OF TAXI, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - DAY

           The driver, wearing a cap and sunglasses, puts the cab in 
           gear and pulls out onto the busy street.

           The DRIVER IS SAM.

           He looks in the rearview mirror at Drexler who is still 
           reading the paper.

                                 SAM
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        East or west side of the port? 

           Drexler is engrossed in what he’s reading.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                              (Portuguese / subtitles)
                        Sir?

           Drexler responds without putting down the newspaper.

                                 DREXLER
                        I’m not going to the port. 

           Drexler slides open the partition and tosses a PISTOL onto 
           the front seat next to Sam.
                                 DREXLER (cont’d)
                        If you drive to the embassy I’ll 
                        tell you where your father expects 
                        to meet me and you can do as you 
                        please.

           INT. BACK SEAT OF TAXI, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - DAY

           Drexler folds the paper and puts it in his lap.

                                 DREXLER
                        An old woman and two intelligence 
                        agents were murdered in Virginia 
                        three days ago and it still hasn’t 
                        been in the paper. Do you wonder 
                        why? You think they want me in an 
                        open courtroom?

           Sam looks at Drexler in the rearview.

                                 SAM
                        I don’t give a fuck about them. I’m 
                        going to put you in a courtroom.

                                 DREXLER
                        And let your father go? I knew him 
                        when he was an insolent little shit
                        just like you. Now drive us to the 
                        embassy, this is above your...

           The rear WINDOW SPLINTERS as a bullet zips through it.

           Drexler clutches the side of his neck. Blood seeps through 
           his fingers.

           A HAND GRENADE is tossed through the window. It lands in 
           Drexler’s lap, then rolls onto the floor between his feet.

           EXT. BUSY STREET, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL

           Ari, riding in the passenger seat of the CAR next the taxi 
           signals for his DRIVER to go. 

           As they pull forward he sees Sam behind the wheel of the taxi 
           and a look of shock flashes onto his face.

                                 ARI
                              (to his driver)
                        Stop!

           The driver shakes his head -- hell no!

           Ari opens his door and rolls out as his car speeds away.
           INT. FRONT SEAT OF TAXI, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - DAY

           Sam jams on the brakes, slamming himself into the steering 
           wheel. 

           He climbs out and back to Drexler’s door.

           INT/EXT. BACK SEAT OF TAXI, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL - DAY

           Drexler gasps, gushing blood as Sam pulls his hand away from 
           his neck. Sam does not see the grenade at Drexler’s feet.

           Ari wraps his arms around Sam’s waist and hauls him to the 
           ground just as THE GRENADE EXPLODES spraying shards of glass 
           and metal out of the open door.

           EXT. BUSY STREET, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL

           Stunned and moving very slowly Sam blinks and looks at Ari.

           Honking TRAFFIC BLAZES PAST THEM on the crowded street.

           Ari examines Sam for damage. Blood runs out of Sam’s ear but 
           other than a few cuts and scrapes on his face he looks fine.

           Ari smiles and gets up. Sam lays flat on the ground and 
           stares up at his father. 

                                 ARI
                        Goodbye, Samuel.

           Moving like he’s stuck in glue, Sam waves for Ari to come 
           closer.

           Ari takes a step toward Sam and bends down. 

           Sam lurches at Ari and grabs his broken ankle. He jerks the 
           cast and Ari drops to the ground.

           Ari screams out in pain. Sam yanks the cast back and forth.

           Ari uses his good foot to kick Sam in the face but Sam won’t 
           let go.

           Ari draws his pistol and presses the barrel into Sam’s teeth. 
           Sam freezes.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Enough!

           AN EIGHTEEN WHEELER BLOWS PAST THEM BLARING ITS AIRHORN.

           Sam lets go and Ari scoots back, keeping the pistol on Sam.
           Ari moves himself back some more and slowly gets to his feet. 
           Sweat pours down his face. 

           He tucks his pistol into his waistband and takes a step back 
           from Sam.

           A car blazes past them.

           Sam, fumbling, pulls his gun and aims at Ari who smiles.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        You won’t shoot me. Do you know 
                        why? 

           Ari thumps himself in his chest with his thumb.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        Because of how I raised you!

           Ari turns and limps away.

           Sam lowers his pistol. He works to get to his feet -- but he 
           just can not do it.

           Ari turns back to face his son.

                                 ARI (cont’d)
                        You always thought I left because 
                        you weren’t important to me. Can 
                        you not see that it was the exact 
                        opposite reason?

           Ari glances down the road, an OVERSIZED SEMI TRUCK is 
           barreling toward them. 

                                 SAM
                        Every single piece of your life is 
                        some kind of self-serving lie.

           Ari stops and stares at Sam. He limps back to his son. 

                                 ARI
                        Why did you ever think you were not 
                        good enough for me when it’s so 
                        obviously the other way around?

           Ari bends down and touches Sam’s cheek. 

           He drops his pistol into Sam’s lap, smiles and steps in front 
           of the semi truck.

           40 TONS OF METAL SLAM INTO 180 POUNDS OF MAN. 

           Smoke pours out of the truck’s brakes as it skids to a halt.
           Sam turns to look at the stopped truck, tries to force 
           himself to his feet and collapses face down on the asphalt.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

           A PRETTY AFRICAN-AMERICAN NURSE opens the blinds and bright 
           sunlight fills the sterile room.

           Laying in a hospital bed Sam cracks his eyes and squints.

                                 NURSE
                        Good morning.

           Sam looks at her confused.

                                 NURSE (cont’d)
                        I’ll tell them you’re up.

           She exits.

           Sam opens and closes his jaw, wincing. He rubs his temples.

           Agent Linden enters the room, followed by Hoyt.

                                 LINDEN
                        How’re you feelin’?

                                 SAM
                        Where am I?

                                 LINDEN
                        Walter Reed. Got you out as quickly 
                        as possible.

                                 SAM
                        How long have I been here?

                                 LINDEN
                        Sixteen hours.

           Sam swings his legs over the side of the bed. 

                                 LINDEN (cont’d)
                        Take it easy, buddy, you got 
                        yourself a grade three concussion.

                                 SAM
                        Where are my clothes?

           Sam gets up and walks toward the dresser. His legs falter and 
           Hoyt catches him before he crashes to the floor.

           Hoyt and Linden help Sam back to the bed.
                                 HOYT
                        We’ve already been to your 
                        mother’s.

           Sam looks deeply troubled.

                                 SAM
                        The plot she has in Elisavetgrad, 
                        she can’t be buried there.

           Hoyt doesn’t get it.

                                 SAM (cont’d)
                        She can not be buried in a Jewish 
                        cemetery.

                                 HOYT
                        Buried?

                                 LINDEN
                              (to Hoyt)
                        I told you we should have opened 
                        it.

           Sam looks up, confused. Hoyt hands him an envelope. 

           Sam looks at it for a beat then tears it open.

           CLOSE ON NOTE AS SAM READS.

                                 JUDITH (V.O.)
                        I am sorry, Samuel. I am a 
                        murderer, a liar and a coward. But 
                        also a survivor. I hate myself for 
                        what I’ve done, but I’m not ready 
                        to die. Always remember what I told 
                        you - just because our lives were a 
                        lie doesn’t mean yours is. Goodbye.

           INT. BEDROOM, JUDITH BRAUER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Judith sits holding the phone. Tears run down her face.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                              (through phone)
                        Did you kill them? Did you help him 
                        kill the real Brauers? 

           Judith stops crying. She gathers her resolve.

                                 JUDITH
                        Hold on a second, honey, I need an 
                        ashtray.
           Judith reaches under the mattress and pulls out a revolver. 
           She holds it to her temple right by the receiver and cocks 
           the hammer.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                              (from phone receiver)
                        Mom?

           The pistol is quivering in her hand. 

           Suddenly she pulls the pistol and the receiver away from her 
           head and fires into her pillow.

                                 SAM  (V.O.)
                              (from phone receiver)
                        Mom? Mom!

           Judith sits on the bed listening to Sam and sobbing silently. 
           She turns on a lamp, reaches under the bed and opens a safe. 

           She pulls out a pair of passports and a stack of cash.

           She leaves the phone laying on the bed and exits the room.

           CLOSE ON RECEIVER.

                                 SAM (V.O.)
                              (from phone receiver)
                        Mom? MOM!

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 

           Sam looks at Judith’s note in his hands.

           He lays back in the hospital bed and stares out the sunny 
           window.

                                      THE END
