           EXT./INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - EARLY EVENING

           Inside an old but classy downtown building, a LAUNCH PARTY is 
           being held for THE DAILY SHOPPER - one of the few newspapers 
           lucky/dumb enough to make the transition online.

           As the punch pours, buzzed CO-WORKERS are just beginning to 
           cross into that gray area where pretending to like each other 
           actually seems possible for an hour or two.

           In walks ERIC SCOTT, 27.  He’s clean-cut and well dressed in 
           a peacoat, pressed slacks, and shiny shoes.  

           By his side is ABBY, late 20’s.  She’s beautiful. 

           Her makeup is understated and she carries her lithe frame 
           with grace.  

                                 ERIC
                             How’s my tie?

                                 ABBY
                        For the millionth time, babe, it 
                        looks great.  Don’t be nervous.  If 
                        there really is a column opening 
                        up, I’m sure you’ll get your 
                        chance.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re the best, you know that?

           Abby smiles sweetly and goes in for a reassuring kiss.

           Just before their lips meet, Eric spots his boss, AVERY 
           BULLOCK, out of the corner of his eye and pulls away.

           Bullock is a handsome Black man whose modern glasses are in 
           perfect synch with his precisely groomed mustache.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        There he is!  Let’s make a good 
                        impression and then we can leave.

           Eric hooks his arm through Abby’s as they make their way 
           through the crowd like a couple of Kennedys.

                                 LOUD VOICE (O.S.)
                        WHO’S READY TO GET FUUUUUUCKED UP?!

           Eric, Abby, and a group of people around them, stop in their 
           tracks.  All turn to look at:

           A sloppily-dressed man grabbing a CHAMPAGNE GLASS from a 
           MORBIDLY OBESE SERVER.
           He downs it in one gulp and delivers a flirtatious SLAP to 
           the Server’s GIANT ASS.

                                 ERIC/ABBY
                             (shocked)
                        Sam?!

           SAM is Eric’s IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHER.  He wears a wrinkled 
           polo shirt.  His long, unkempt hair reaches his shoulders.    

                                 SAM
                        Eric!  Come here, you old herpes 
                        spreader!

           Sam gets Eric in a head-lock.  Eric frees himself and then 
           smoothes his now-disheveled hair.

                                 ERIC
                        What’re you doing here?!

                                 SAM
                        Chill out, bro.  Mom told me about 
                        it.  

                                 ERIC
                        Why would she do that?!

                                 SAM
                        That’s what you get for calling her 
                        everyday.

                                 ERIC
                        But she lives in Arizona.  And so 
                        do you!

                                 SAM
                        Not anymore.  She kicked me out.  I 
                        live eight blocks away now.  Always 
                        nice to be close to family.  And 
                        since Mom cut me loose, here I am.

                                 ERIC
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 SAM
                             (genuinely perplexed)
                        I just did.

           Eric and Abby CRINGE.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Jeeze, Ab.  I haven’t seen you in, 
                        what, two years?
                                 ABBY
                             (almost in shock)
                        Since Meemaw and Peepaw’s
                        anniversary party...

                                 SAM
                        Oh, right.  How’s her hip?

           Abby looks down at the floor.

                                 ABBY
                        It’s, um, better...

                                 SAM
                        Great!  Still doing the nurse 
                        thing? 

                                 ABBY
                        Yes, Sam.  I’m still doing the 
                        “nurse thing”.

           Eric dances on his tip toes as he impatiently looks over 
           Sam’s shoulder at Bullock.

           Sam turns to grab two BEERS from a nearby table; he isn’t 
           sharing.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you wanna take it easy?

                                 SAM 
                             (buzzing)
                        Might as well stock up while it’s 
                        free.  

                                 ERIC
                        Are you having money problems 
                        again?

                                 SAM
                        No bro, I brought my truck with me.

           Eric surreptitiously guides Sam toward the door hoping he 
           won’t notice until they’re outside.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re still mowing lawns?

                                 SAM
                        Among other things.

                                 ERIC
                        Hey, that’s great.  We can catch up 
                        later.
           Sam suddenly spins away from Eric.

                                 SAM
                        Sure thing. I’m gonna go see if 
                        that fat waitress reloaded her tray 
                        yet.

           Eric looks annoyed as Sam frolics away.  Just then, KINGSHUK 
           MUKERJEE, 30’s, Eric’s office “bestie”, approaches.

           A jaded, Americanized Indian man, think Aziz Ansari, he’s 
           short with a dark beard and bad hair cut.  He’s more than a 
           little drunk.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Eric!  My man!  Abby you look so 
                        young and innocent.

                                 ABBY
                        Uh, thanks, King.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry, bud, we’ll grab a drink in a 
                        second.  I need to talk to Bullock.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Gotta wait.  He’s about to pop the 
                        cherry on this party.  Let’s go 
                        watch it bleed.

                                 ERIC
                        Two minutes.  We’ll be right---

           As if on cue, Bullock CLINKS his glass with a spoon.

           Eric STAMPS HIS FOOT upset that he’s just missed his opening.

                                 BULLOCK
                             (effortlessly cool)
                        Glad to see everyone is enjoying 
                        themselves.

           This gets a good LAUGH from the crowd; whether real or 
           forced, Avery soaks it up.

                                 BULLOCK (CONT'D)
                        I just wanted to welcome you all to 
                        our Launch Party.  The Shopper is 
                        finally ready to join the 21st 
                        Century as a state-of-the-art 
                        online publication.  
                             (beat)
                        Mary, can you bring the champagne 
                        over? 
           MARY, from Accounts Payable, glides over carrying the 
           champagne.  Looking like Jessica Rabbit (only with bigger 
           boobs and a less husky voice), she walks over practically 
           titty-fucking the BOTTLE.

                                 KINGSHUK
                             (mumbling to Eric)
                        Slutty Mary can’t be street legal. 

           Eric elbows him in the ribs.

                                 KINGSHUK (CONT’D)
                        I’m just saying I’d do anything to 
                        let her float my ass down the 
                        Ganges.

           Slutty Mary struggles to UNCORK the champagne.  Kingshuk 
           rushes to her aid.

                                 KINGSHUK (CONT’D)
                        Here, Mary, let me help you.

           She pulls on the cork again while he grips the bottle firmly.

                                 KINGSHUK (CONT’D)
                        Ah, just like that.  Use both 
                        hands.

           Everyone in the room gets wet watching her jerk off the 
           bottle.

           The champagne POPS and shoots everywhere. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Okay, people.  Eat, drink, and be 
                        merry!

           CUE MUSIC: “PARTY ROCK ANTHEM” - by LMFAO

           The party kicks into high gear.

                                 ABBY
                        That was surreal.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        I know!  Wasn’t it amazing?! 

                                 ERIC
                        Now’s my chance; I’m gonna go talk 
                        to Bullock.

           Eric finishes his drink.
                                 ABBY
                        Good luck, babe.  He has to be in a 
                        good mood after that show.  

           Abby watches Eric sidle up to Bullock.  She retreats into the 
           background and leans against a closed OFFICE DOOR.

                                 ERIC
                             (meekly)
                        Here, let me get that for you, Mr. 
                        Bullock.

           Eric tries to wipe some champagne fizz from Bullock’s coat.

                                 BULLOCK
                             (annoyed)
                        What is it, Eric?

                                 ERIC
                        I just wanted to ask you about the 
                        open column everyone keeps talking 
                        about.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Right, I’ll be making the 
                        announcement soon.

                                 ERIC
                        Do you already have anyone in mind?

                                 BULLOCK
                        I have a short list, but nothing is 
                        set in stone yet.

                                 ER
                             (perking up)
                        Well, in that case I just wanted to 
                        mention...

           Suddenly, Abby feels a THUMP against the door behind her.  

           It THUMPS again.

           Perplexed, she turns around and slowly opens the door when...

           She’s taken out by a SWEATY, NAKED CANNONBALL!

           Sam and the Morbidly Obese Server, locked in the throws of 
           passion, roll right into the middle of the party taking Abby 
           along with them!

           Eric looks catatonic.  Bullock can’t believe his eyes.

           Everyone stares at the HUMAN CENTIPEDE writhing on the floor.
           The awkward silence is broken by the Morbidly Obese Server’s 
           CATERWAULING and the muffled cries of Abby choking on flab.

           Mid-pump, Sam scans the room still inside the cumming Server.

                                 SAM
                        So...shots?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Eric and Abby lie together in bed.  Both are in pajamas.

                                 ABBY
                        I will never be able to get the 
                        image of Sam’s b-hole out of my 
                        head for as long as I live.

                                 ERIC
                        I thought we agreed not to talk 
                        about it.  Living in Repression-
                        ville is how I survived my 
                        childhood with him.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, baby.  I can’t even imagine.

           Eric begins to look a little guilty.

                                 ERIC
                        Well, it wasn’t all bad.  You’ve 
                        got to understand.  It was never 
                        easy for Sam growing up either.  I 
                        set a pretty high standard...

           FLASHBACK: INT. 2ND GRADE CLASSROOM - 19 YEARS AGO - DAY

           Little Eric and Little Sam, both 8, are each handed back a 
           spelling test.  Little Eric beams as he holds his paper up.  
           A GOLD STAR sticker shines brightly on it.  

           Sam looks at his own test.  It’s covered in RED MARKS.  A 
           CLOUD WITH A FROWNY FACE sticker stares back at him.  
           Little Sam puts his head down on his desk as Little Eric runs 
           around giving high fives.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. ERIC AND SAM’S CHILDHOOD HOME - 10 YEARS AGO - DAY

           Eric and Sam, now 17, nervously crack open their college 
           admission letters.  Eric starts jumping up and down, barely 
           able to contain himself.  Eric and Sam’s MOM and DAD join in 
           on the dance, as Sam lets his admission letter drop to the 
           floor.

           Written in BOLD RED LETTERS are the words: “We regret to 
           inform you...”.

                        God, it must’ve been cold there in 
                        my shadow...

                                 ABBY
                        Are you serious?  You guys are a 
                        minute apart!

                                 ERIC
                        For a twin, that’s nearly an 
                        eternity.

                        Anyway, can we get off of Sam now?  
                        Let’s talk about something else.

           Eric rolls over onto his side.  Abby snuggles up next to him.  
           She’s clearly Big Spoon in this relationship.

                                 ABBY
                             (calming down)
                        Alright.

                        Let’s talk about...it.

                                 ERIC
                        What’s “it”?

           Abby leans over Eric’s shoulder so that her mouth is closer 
           to his ear.
                                 ABBY
                        You know...

           Eric’s eyes start to flutter.  He’s sleepy.

                                 ERIC
                        I really don’t...

                                 ABBY
                        We’ve been together for three 
                        years, babe.  Don’t you think it’s 
                        time?

           Eric’s eyes SNAP open in horrified apprehension. He remains 
           still and tries to appear nonchalant.

                                 ERIC
                        Time for what?

                                 ABBY
                        To make it official, Eric.

                        Isn’t it time we got married?

           Eric rolls over with lightening speed to face her.  He’s 
           stunned.

                                 ERIC
                        Baby, sweetheart.
                             (beat)
                        Do you think we’re ready for that? 
                        I still need time to focus on my 
                        career if I’m going to make the 
                        jump from copy editing to writing.

                                 ABBY
                        Eric, is it really that hard to 
                        write and make a marriage work?  
                        Ernest Hemingway did it.

                                 ERIC
                        Hemingway was married four times 
                        and eventually killed himself...I
                        just don’t think rushing into 
                        marriage is the next step for us.

                                 ABBY
                        Well?  What is the next step?

           She doesn’t wait for Eric to answer.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Don’t you love me?  Haven’t we been 
                        through everything?

                        You’re just afraid of change and I 
                        understand that, but I’m going to 
                        be brave enough for the both of us.

           Eric tries to get a word in edge wise.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        You’ll love being a husband.  
                        You’ll see.

                             (weakly)
                        I’ll think about it, babe.  I 
                        promise.

           Abby turns off the bedside lamp, closes her eyes, and nestles 
           into him.  Eric stares at the ceiling...

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE NEXT DAY

           Bullock stands before Eric, Kingshuk, and the rest of the 
           STAFFERS.

           Before the meeting kicks into gear, Eric and Kingshuk talk in 
           hushed tones.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        She popped the question?!

                             (embarrassed)
                        Not technically, but the subject 
                        was broached.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Broached??  No dude, you broach
                        anal sex.  You broach the idea of 
                        feeling up your cousin that one 
                        time. This is way worse.

                                 ERIC
                        I know...

                                 KINGSHUK
                        You’re fucked, man.  No vaseline
                        fucked.  What did you tell her?

                                 ERIC
                        I said I wanted to focus on my 
                        career.
           Kingshuk nearly chokes on his Purple Vitamin Water.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        This is The Daily Shopper, bro.  
                        This isn’t a career, it’s a step or 
                        two above a paid internship.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s what you make of it.  Baby 
                        steps then I’m a hop, skip, and a 
                        jump from the Wall Street Journal.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Oh, E, man...  You’re not even 
                        close to Ladies Home Journal.

           Eric sinks into his chair.  Bullock is finally ready to 
           begin.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Okay, people.  As you all seem to 
                        know by now, we have a column 
                        opening up.   

           An insecure STAFFER pipes up.

                                 STAFFER
                        Who’s being let go?

                             (uncomfortably)
                        Perkins.

                                 STAFFER
                        What for?

                                 BULLOCK
                        On the advice of Counsel, I’m not 
                        really at liberty to speak on that.  
                        Let’s just say he was “abusing his 
                        sources”.

           No one knows what to say to that.

                                 BULLOCK (CONT’D)
                        Moving on.  The opening is in Human 
                        Interest.  
                             (beat)
                        I’ve selected three of you to take 
                        a shot at replacing him.  I want 
                        samples from Tina, John, and...

           Eric looks confident.
                                 BULLOCK (CONT'D)
                        Elizabeth.

           Eric’s bubble bursts.

                                 ERIC
                             (whisper-yelling to 
                              Kingshuk)
                        I’m not getting a shot?

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Relax, duder.  It’s not meant to 
                        be.

                                 ERIC
                        No way.  I can’t miss this one.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        So go get in Bullock’s face.  
                        You’re so money you don’t even know 
                        it.

           The other chosen writers look pleased.  

           Eric doesn’t listen as Bullock dismisses the meeting.  He 
           watches the boss as he heads out of the conference room.

           Now or never. 

           Go time.

           Eric and Kingshuk follow Bullock out the door.

                                 ERIC
                             (to Bullock’s back)
                        Excuse me, sir?

                                 BULLOCK
                             (turning around)
                        What is it, Eric?  Any more naked 
                        relatives for you to throw in my 
                        face?

           Kingshuk stifles a laugh.

                                 ERIC
                             (embarrassed)
                        No, no. It’s just...I...I want a 
                        shot at replacing Perkins.
                             (beat)
                        I’m ready for a column of my own.
                                 BULLOCK
                        You’re bothering me about this 
                        again? I chose the others based on 
                        seniority.

                                 ERIC
                        That might be true, sir, but I know 
                        I can handle it.  

           Bullock doesn’t look convinced.  Kingshuk pipes up.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Come on, Mr. Bullock.  Give him a 
                        chance.  If you don’t like his 
                        stuff then fire him.  Win-win.

           Eric laughs nervously before stepping in front of Kingshuk.

                                 ERIC
                        Well---

                             (intrigued)
                        What do you say, Eric? Would you be 
                        willing to bet your job on it?

                                 ERIC
                        Uhh...

           Kingshuk elbows Eric in the back.  

           He bites the bullet.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                             (owning it)
                        Yes. If you don’t like my work then 
                        you can fire me.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Alright. You have till next week to 
                        wow me.

                        Or you’re out on your ass.

           He turns and leaves without waiting for a reply.

           EXT./INT. HOSPITAL - CAFETERIA - SAME

           Abby and her best friend JESS, 20’s, athletic and blonde 
           (both in NURSE’S SCRUBS) are finishing their lunch in the 
           hospital cafeteria.

           Over GREEN JELL-O:

                                 ABBY
                        I just need to find a way to make 
                        him commit.

                                 JESS
                        Have you tried licking his gooch?

                                 ABBY
                        I don’t even know what that means.

                                 JESS
                        Your loss.

                        You’ve gotta turn up the heat.
                                 ABBY
                        What do you mean?

                                 JESS
                        The reason any man doesn’t want to 
                        get married to the girl he’s with 
                        is because he’s afraid of missing 
                        out on someone better.

                                 ABBY
                        You think he can do better than me?

                                 JESS
                        Of course not, sweetie.  I mean you 
                        need to show him he can’t do 
                        better.

                                 ABBY
                        How do I do that?

                                 JESS
                        You’ve gotta show him what he’d be 
                        missing out on if he lets you go.  
                        Morning sex, hot candle 
                        wax...swallowing. If he thinks 
                        he’ll be getting this kind of play 
                        on the reg, you can start picking 
                        out china patterns right now.

           Abby gives this some serious thought.

           her spoon like nobody’s business.

           EXT. RUN-DOWN APARTMENT COMPLEX - AFTERNOON

           Eric comes upon Sam’s new place.  There’s a group of UNDERAGE 
           KIDS standing at Sam’s rusty, wrought-iron screen door.

           As Eric moves closer, a curious look crosses his face when he 
           sees Sam, half naked, handing something to the kids in 
           exchange for money before they scamper off.
                                 ERIC
                        What was that all about?

                                 SAM
                             (covering)
                        Just buying some Girl Scout 
                        cookies.

                                 ERIC
                             (confused)
                        But those were boys.

           Eric is about to call bullshit when suddenly loud BARKING is 
           heard.

           A tough looking ENGLISH BULLDOG stands behind Sam, all 
           business.  This is BUTCH.

           Sam, in nothing but a pair of stained boxer shorts, turns to 
           calm the dog.

                                 SAM
                        Easy, Butch.

           The dog instantly softens.  A lover in a fighter’s body.

           Sam opens the screen door for Eric.  Butch eyes him warily.

                                 ERIC
                        Shouldn’t you be at work?

                                 SAM 
                        I cleared my appointments today.  
                        Couldn’t get my truck to start.

           Sam indicates the rusted-out Toyota Tacoma parked across the 
           street.

           The words “GREEN GRASS GARDENING” are sloppily painted on the 
           door in bright white lettering.

           The BED is full of rakes, shovels, and hoses.  An ancient 
           LAWN MOWER hangs partially over the tail gate.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Come on in.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           MOVING BOXES are scattered everywhere.  Clothes lay rumpled 
           along the floor.  Dishes fill the sink.  Food containers 
           cover every surface.
                                 ERIC
                        Nice place; it’s so you.

           Sam grabs a pair of sweatpants from the floor and pulls them 
           on.  Butch playfully grabs at a pant leg.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Well?  What’s the emergency?  You 
                        don’t look like you’re in trouble.

                                 SAM
                        Dude, I just banged a chick that 
                        looks exactly like Taylor Swift.  I 
                        need a second opinion.

                                 ERIC
                             (impatient)
                        That’s why you called me over 
                        here??

                                 SAM
                             (whispering)
                        Just take a look.

           Eric peeks over Sam’s shoulder and into his bedroom where he 
           sees a PASSED-OUT CHICK sleeping one off.

           She actually does look like Taylor Swift...if she were a 
           forty year old ash tray.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you serious?  She looks like a 
                        fly-girl.

                                 SAM
                        Relax, she’s not a keeper.
                             (beat)
                        Press-on nails are a bitch in the 
                        sack.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t need this right now.  I 
                        just found out I’m getting a shot 
                        at my own column.

           Sam searches for something throughout the piles of discarded 
           debris.

                                 SAM
                             (sarcastic)
                        Sweet!  
           Sam feigns excitement for yet another of Eric’s gross over-
           achievements.  He finds what he was looking for: his BONG.  
           It’s covered in white and green SCORPIONS.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        What’re you gonna write about, bro? 

           Sam pulls a BAG OF WEED out from under a couch cushion.

           He opens it, grabs some herb, packs his bowl, and tokes up.

                                 ERIC
                             (uneasily)
                        I have no idea.  I can’t focus on 
                        that yet.  
                        But that’s not why I came over...

                                 SAM
                             (mock-quizzically)
                        Why?

                                 ERIC
                        Abby asked me when I’m going to 
                        propose to her.

           Sam puts down his bong; Butch looks up from chewing a sock.

                                 SAM
                        Shut.  Up.  When?

                                 ERIC
                        Last night!  I tried to tell her 
                        that I wasn’t there yet.  But she 
                        seems ready enough for the both of 
                        us.

           Sam takes another hit.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Are you even listening to me or are 
                        you just gonna get high?!

                                 SAM
                        It helps me think! You should try 
                        it.

                                 ERIC
                        No way, dude.  They test at work.

                                 SAM

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I hope Abby realizes same-sex 
                        marriages are only legal in a few 
                        states because she’s marrying a 
                        pussy.

           Eric stares ahead.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m gonna have to end this.

                                 SAM
                             (amazed)
                        You mean you’re gonna dump her ass?  
                        For realsies?

                                 ERIC
                        What choice do I have?  I’m 27.  
                        I’m not ready for marriage.  My 
                        career’s just getting serious; I 
                        have a shot at my own column.  I 
                        can’t be distracted trying to start 
                        a family.  

           Sam coughs violently and blows out a huge PLUME of smoke.

                                 SAM
                        Amen. You’re about to start pulling 
                        down mega money and I’ll be right 
                        there to borrow cash.  We don’t 
                        need your hypothetical kids there

                             (not listening)
                        She keeps telling me to juggle 
                        both, but I know it’s one or the 
                        other.  I’ve never half-assed
                        anything in my life; it’s career or 
                        marriage. Not both.  Not now.

                                 SAM
                        This is exactly why you should 
                        never date a girl for more than two 
                        months.  Abby’s hot, but looks 
                        fade.  After 35 you’ll have nothing 
                        left to appreciate but her mind.  
                        What’s that shit worth?

           Sam fires up the bong again.  
                                 ERIC
                        How do you do it?  How do you break 
                        up with a girl so obviously and 
                        completely without coming off as 
                        the asshole?

                                 SAM
                        You can’t.  You’re always gonna be 
                        the asshole.  Every guy needs to 
                        understand this before he gets 
                        seriously involved.

                                 SAM
                        All it takes is three words: 
                        “Bitch, we’re through”.  
                             (beat)
                        Tweet it to her.

                                 ERIC
                        You’re not helping.

                                 SAM
                        Fine, so facebook her.

                        break up with her by proxy...

                        Dude, it’s not hard.

           Sam straightens his posture, pulls his long hair back, and 
           does his best impression of Eric.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        “Abby, I love you, but it’s over.”

           Eric’s eyes goes wide.

                                 ERIC
                        Holy shit!

                                 SAM
                             (shaking his hair down)
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        You can break up with her for me!
                                 SAM
                             (giggling)
                        Are you serious, dude?

                                 ERIC
                        Why not?  You just pretend to be me 
                        and dump Abby!

                                 SAM
                        Fuck you, that’s not how it works.

                                 ERIC
                        Why not?  You're a douchebag.  This 
                        is your thing!  You tell her so I 
                        don't have to.  
                             (beat)
                        I need you to be my doppelganger!

                                 SAM
                        Won’t she be able to tell us apart 
                        when she sees my junk?

                                 ERIC
                        We’re identical twins.  And why 
                        would she see your junk?

                                 SAM
                        I’m just trying to be thorough.  My 
                        dick is bigger.  

           Eric rolls his eyes as Sam briefly considers the idea. 

                                 ERIC
                        Come on, it’s perfect!  Abby’s only 
                        met you a few times; she barely 
                        knows you.  She'd never be able to 
                        figure it out!

                                 SAM
                        What’s in it for me?

                                 ERIC
                        Um, your brother’s happiness?

                                 SAM
                        If I wasn’t so high right now, I’d 
                        punch you square in the balls.

           Eric thinks, desperately trying to come up with something, 
           anything, to convince Sam.

                                 ERIC
                        I’ve got it!  Mary from my office.  
                        You saw her at the party.
                                 SAM
                        I saw a lot of things at the party.

                                 ERIC
                             (fighting a dry heave)
                        Believe me, we all did.  She’s the 
                        leggy blonde with the really big, 
                        you know...

           Eric awkwardly holds both hands out in front of him.  Like 
           he’s carrying two INVISIBLE BEACH BALLS.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, right!  The bombshell with the 
                        rocking tots.

                                 ERIC
                        We call her Slutty Mary for a 
                        reason.  Do this for me and I’ll 
                        make sure you find out why.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t play with my emotions right 
                        now, brother.

                                 ERIC 
                        I’m not.  Dump Abby for me, and 
                        I’ll set you up with her.

           Sam mulls the proposal.

                                 SAM
                        Do you think Mary’s good with her 
                        pinky?

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing.

           A broad GRIN crosses Sam’s face. 

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I’ll do it, bro.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Eric saunters up to his front door.  He places a hand on the 
           door knob and pauses before he enters.
           He takes a deep SIGH and then walks inside.

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Eric’s somber frown is quickly replaced with surprise as he 
           sees Abby and Jess sitting together on the couch.

           The girls are giggling as they flip through the pages of 
           several issues of BRIDE MAGAZINE.

           A bottle of wine stands opened next to a plate of cheese and 
           crackers. Each girl takes turns pointing at different 
           articles and pictures.

                                 JESS
                             (pointing at Bride 
                              Magazine)
                        Honey, this one is amazing!

                                 ABBY
                        You don’t think it’s too much?  I 
                        don’t want to look like Lady Gaga 
                        coming down the aisle.

                                 JESS
                        You didn’t suddenly grow a penis 
                        did you?  Shoulder accessories are 
                        totally in now.  You could pull it 
                        off for sure.

           Eric’s eyebrow raises at the overheard conversation.

                                 ERIC
                        Hi, babe.  Sup, Jess.

           Both girls’ eyes flit up to the source of the new voice.  If 
           they knew Eric was in the room before he spoke they don’t 
           show it.

                                 ABBY
                        Babe, you have to check these out!

                                 ERIC
                        C’mon, Abby.  I spend my whole day 
                        editing copy.  The last thing I 
                        wanna do when I come home is read.

                                 JESS
                        Speaking of.  How’s work coming, 
                        Eric?  Does anyone even read the 
                        paper anymore?

           Abby stifles a little giggle.
           Eric enters the kitchen.  From inside:

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Work is fine, Jess.  Thanks.
                             (to Abby)
                        The new column officially opened 
                        up, Ab.  Bullock is taking samples 
                        to see who gets it.  This could be 
                        it.

           Eric grabs a beer from the fridge.

                                 ABBY
                        Eric!  That’s great!  Don’t go 
                        getting too big, you know I want 
                        you all to myself.  

           Eric cringes at that.  He walks back into the living room, 
           holding the beer.

                                 JESS
                        What’re you gonna write about?

                                 ERIC
                             (flustered)
                        I’m not exactly sure yet.

                                 ABBY 
                             (eyeing the beer)
                        Babe, what did I tell you about 
                        cutting back on the beer?  Here, 
                        have a glass of red.

           Abby leans forward from the couch and pours a glass for Eric.

           Eric looks to his beer then to Abby.  He takes the wine glass 
           not wanting to fight this battle.

                                 JESS
                        Here’s an article you might find 
                        interesting, Eric.
                             (she indicates Bride 
                              Magazine)
                        Beach ceremonies are the new trend.  
                        It says here leading Wedding 
                        Experts recommend getting married 
                        in front of ocean tides.  They help

                        wedding sound?  
                             (beat)
                        Abby loves it.
           Eric chokes on his drink.  He wipes some wine from his chin 
           as he stalls for an answer.

                                 ERIC
                             (looking at Abby)
                        Abby...likes the beach?  

                                 ABBY
                             (looking at Jess)
                        I’m not completely sold...but, it’s 
                        definitely a great idea.  
                             (to Jess)
                        I just know my mom is gonna freak 
                        about me not getting married in a 
                        church.

                                 JESS
                             (to Abby)
                        Churches are so out, Ab.  That’s 
                        where people hold funerals.  You 
                        don’t wanna get married in a 
                        funeral parlor do you?

                                 ERIC
                             (quietly)
                        Aren’t we rushing this?

                                 JESS
                        There’s no such thing as rushing, 
                        Eric.  You and Abby aren’t getting 
                        any younger.  And you’re great 
                        together. 

                                 ABBY
                        She’s right, babe.  It’ll all work 
                        out.  You’ll see.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s just...I...we should...

           Abby’s smile starts to crack at Eric’s obvious hesitation.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Why don’t we go out to dinner 
                        tomorrow night to talk about it?  

                                 ABBY
                             (warming up)
                        You mean like a date?

                                 ERIC
                        Just like before we moved in 
                        together.
                                 JESS
                        Oh my God.  You guys are so 
                        cute...in a Leave it to Beaver kind 
                        of way, but still.

                                 ERIC
                             (ignoring Jess)
                        I’ll meet you at Friday’s right 
                        after work.  Okay, babe?

           Abby clasps her hands together under her chin barely able to 
           contain her excitement.

           Eric takes a long sip of his wine.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna hit the sack early.  
                        Night, babe.  Good seeing you, 
                        Jess.

           Eric toasts the girls with his wine and turns for the 
           bedroom.

           Abby and Jess hug each other like school girls as they giggle 
           uncontrollably.  

                                 JESS
                        You better hang onto that one, Ab.  
                        He’s not exciting, but he’s a sure 
                        thing.

           Abby toasts to that.  She takes a sip from her glass.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        And I bet he’s hung.

           Abby chokes on her wine.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM

           Eric flops down onto the bed with another heavy sigh.  He 
           sets the wine glass down on the night stand and pulls out his 
           iPhone.

           He sends a text to Sam as he stares into space with a blank 
           look on his face.
           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Sam is still chilling on the couch.  He’s vibing out to the 
           music blasting from his headphones.  Butch is passed out on 
           the rug SNORING.  Loudly.

           It looks like Sam hasn’t moved all day.

           His iPhone vibrates next to him.  He picks it up and reads 
           the message.

           C/U of iPhone text message from Eric.

           “Operation: Switcheroo begins.  Come over tmw 12:30 for 
           prep.”

           Sam laughs to himself as he tosses his phone aside.  He 
           reaches over and grabs his bong.

                                 SAM
                             (sparking up)
                        Showtime, eh boy?

           Butch continues snoring.

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

           Eric paces through the living room.  He checks the time on 
           his iPhone, the microwave, and the cable box.

           With a huff, he unlocks his phone ready to make a call.

           KNOCK. KNOCK.

           Eric rushes to the door and swings it open.  He doesn’t let 
           Sam in before he starts yelling.

                                 ERIC
                        Where the hell have you been?!  I 
                        told you 12:30!

                                 SAM
                        Chill out, fascist.  I wanted 
                        breakfast.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s the afternoon!

                                 SAM
                        To you maybe.
                                 ERIC
                        If you’re gonna do this you have to 
                        be on time for things!  

                                 SAM
                        If you want me to do this you 
                        better get off my back.  

           Eric grabs Sam by the collar and yanks him inside quickly.

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM

           Eric and Sam stand shoulder to shoulder in front of the 
           bathroom mirror.

           Their differences stand out starkly upon inspection.

                                 ERIC
                             (looking at Sam’s 
                              reflection in the mirror)
                        You’re gonna have to shave.

                                 SAM
                             (looking at Eric’s 
                              reflection in the mirror)
                        That’s asking a lot.

           Eric ignores Sam’s protests.

                                 ERIC
                        And the hair too, man.  It’s gotta 
                        go.

                                 SAM
                        The source of my power?  Are you 
                        kidding?

                                 ERIC
                        Relax.  It’ll grow back.  Let’s go.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. SUPERCUTS - MINUTES LATER

           Eric leads the hesitant Sam into the hair salon.

           Sam pauses as he takes in the scene of men and women getting 
           their hair cut.

           He absentmindedly touches his hair as the STYLISTS continue 
           to cut, style, and clip.
                                 SAM
                             (whispering to himself)
                        For Slutty Mary...

           Eric shoots Sam a side-long glance before he approaches the 
           counter.

           A cute, HIPSTER STYLIST stands before a computer.

                                 HIPSTER STYLIST
                        Name?

                                 SAM
                        Sa---

           Eric elbows Sam in the side.

                                 ERIC
                        His name is Eric.
                             (to Sam)
                        Get into character, man.

           Sam recovers from Eric’s attack.

                                 SAM
                        Yeah, that’s right.  My name is 
                        Eric.  I’m an uptight jackhole in 
                        need of a trim.  I want my hair 
                        exactly like his.

           Eric tries to hide his embarrassment.

           The Hipster Stylist flirtatiously giggles.  She’s digging Sam 
           and his style.

                                 HIPSTER STYLIST
                        Are you sure?  It looks good the 
                        way it is.

           Sam smiles triumphantly at Eric.  The Hipster Stylist leads 
           the guys to an open chair.  Sam takes a seat.

           CUE MUSIC: “THAT’S WHAT I WANT” - by The Flying Lizards

           Eric stands over her shoulder.

           He tells her what to cut and where.  He’s overbearingly 
           telling her how to do her job.

           After a few snips and a quick buzz Sam now looks more like 
           Eric than ever.

           Sam’s chin beard is the only way to tell the two apart.
           Eric seems satisfied, and, strangely, Sam seems to be taken 
           with himself in the mirror.

           The Hipster Stylist leans over Sam’s shoulder.

                                 HIPSTER STYLIST (CONT'D)
                             (touching Sam’s new hair)
                        You pull this off better than your 
                        brother.

                                 ERIC
                             (insulted)
                        I’m standing right here!

           EXT./INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           Eric tosses a duffle bag on top of the pile of clothes that 
           still covers Sam’s couch.

                                 ERIC
                        I brought you an outfit for 
                        tonight.  You have to meet her at 
                        Friday’s.  I already told her I’m 
                        coming straight from work so she 
                        doesn’t expect you at home.  And 
                        switch iPhones with me in case she 
                        calls.

           Sam and Eric simultaneously toss their phones to each other.  
           They catch them at the same time.  

           Sam then goes over to the duffle bag and starts rifling 
           through it.

           He pulls something out and holds it up to Eric in disgust.

                                 SAM
                        Are you serious?  A sweater-vest?

                                 ERIC
                        What’s wrong with it?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing as long as you don’t make 
                        me wear a...

           Sam trails off as he’s shocked to see his worst fear come 
           true...

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (holding up a...)
                        Skinny tie.
                                 ERIC
                        No good?  That’s a nice outfit.

                                 SAM
                        For a neutered Express Model.  I 
                        wanna wear my flip-flops.

           Butch is seen energetically chewing Sam’s raggedy Rainbows.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t wear flip-flops.  I don’t 
                        like how they make your toes dirty.  

                                 SAM
                        How is it we share DNA?  

                                 ERIC
                        Just focus, we have to talk about 
                        the plan.

                                 SAM
                        What plan?  I wear your goon suit, 
                        dump your bitch, and get some free 
                        dinner.  In that order.

                                 ERIC
                             (sarcastically)
                        Nice.
                             (beat)
                        Just do me a favor and don’t call 
                        her a bitch to her face.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll try to hold back, but if she 
                        deserves it I’m gonna let loose.

           Eric sighs.

           Sam throws on the sweater vest and goes over to wrap an arm 
           around his brother’s shoulder.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (with a roguish smile)
                        Don’t worry.  It’s me.

           EXT./INT. TGI FRIDAY'S - NIGHT

           Sam sits alone in a BOOTH at the bustling sports bar.

           Street signs, Fat Heads, album jackets, and various other doo-
           dads adorn the walls in this chain restaurant.
           Sam looks uncomfortable in his new outfit.  He’s recently 
           shaved and looks more like Eric than ever.  He unconsciously 
           runs his fingers through his hair, only to realize it’s no 
           longer there.

           The importance of the task before him finally hits home.  Sam 
           looks a little nervous, his confident veneer begins to fade 
           slightly. 

                                 ABBY (O.S.)
                        Sorry I’m late, babe.  Yoga class 
                        ran long.

           Sam reacts to Abby’s voice.  He contorts his face into an 
           approximation of Eric’s grin as he waits for Abby to approach 
           the table.

           The pressure is on.  As she gets closer, Sam springs out of 
           the booth and grabs Abby’s face with both hands.  He plants 
           an intimate kiss on her surprised lips.  

           Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        What’s gotten into you, Eric?

                                 SAM
                        I’m just...
                             (beat)
                        Excited to see you.

                                 ABBY
                        Even after me being late?  What a 
                        sweetheart you are.

           Sam lets Abby slide into the booth before he sits on the 
           opposite side.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?  You always sit on 
                        the same side of the booth as me.

                                 SAM
                        Really? Ummm, I just...wanted to 
                        see all of your pretty face instead 
                        of just half of it.

           Abby melts a little.

           A WAITRESS approaches the table.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I start you guys off with 
                        something to nibble on?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WAITRESS (CONT'D)
                        We have some great shrimp scampi 
                        from the Jack Daniels menu. 

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, no thank you.  He’s allergic to 
                        shellfish.  We’ll just start with a 
                        couple of Merlots.

           Sam audibly CLEARS his throat.

                                 SAM
                             (to the Waitress)
                        You know what, we’ll take two Blue 
                        Moons instead.
                             (off Abby’s look)
                        Oh, with oranges, please.

           Abby lets out a little SIGH.

                                 ABBY
                        Baby.  More beer?  We’re wine 
                        drinkers now, remember?

           The Waitress looks confused.

                                 SAM
                        Trust me on this, Ab.  Live a 
                        little.

           Abby, recalling her talk with Jess, reluctantly caves as Sam 
           motions the Waitress away.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        So anyway, how was yoga?

                                 ABBY
                             (moving on)
                        You never ask me about class.  It 
                        was great.  Old Mrs. Siderman
                        slipped a disc.  That’s why I was 
                        held up.  It took six of the 
                        students to help her into the 
                        ambulance.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, that Mrs. Siderman.

                                 ABBY
                             (puzzled)
                        I don’t think I’ve mentioned her 
                        before.
                                 SAM
                             (covering)
                        Oh, sure you have.  Mrs. Siderman.  
                        The older youngish woman.  With the 
                        back problem.

                                 ABBY
                        I guess.

           Abby flips through the menu.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                             (eyes down)
                        I’m almost afraid to ask, but how’s 
                        your brother?  Is he getting 
                        settled in?

                                 SAM
                        He’s fine.  His bachelor pad is 
                        really coming along.

                                 ABBY
                        Really? Don’t tell me we have to 
                        visit.  He’s such a rude, filthy, 
                        man-baby.  

                                 SAM
                             (defensive)
                        Well, I bet Sam’s happy he’s not a 
                        stuck-up, workaholic like I am.

                                 ABBY
                        Don’t be so hard on yourself, babe.  
                        If Sam took a page out of your 
                        book, he’d be much better off. 

                                 SAM
                        Sam is a Lone Wolf.  He takes what 
                        he wants, when he wants.  People 
                        shouldn’t try to change him, 
                        princess.

                                 ABBY
                        Princess? That’s a new one.

                                 SAM
                             (recovering)
                        Sorry, I had a beer before you got 
                        here.  The bubbles must be going 
                        straight to my head.  You know what 
                        a lightweight I am.
                                 ABBY
                        I think it’s cute when you’re 
                        buzzed.

           Abby reaches across the table, puts her hand on Sam’s.

           Just then, the Waitress arrives and drops off their drinks.

                                 WAITRESS
                        I’ll give you guys a couple minutes 
                        to decide.

           Sam grabs his glass with gusto.  Abby stares warily at her 
           own.

                                 SAM
                        Come on.  Always good to try new 
                        things.

           He GUZZLES half his glass.  Seeing how much he seems to enjoy 
           it, Abby lets her guard down a bit and does the same.  

                                 ABBY
                        Ohmigod, that’s soooo good!

                                 SAM
                        What’d I tell you?

           They raise their glasses in a toast. CLINK.

           Abby takes another small SIP while Sam CHUGS the rest of his 
           beer in one gulp.

           They put their glasses down.  Abby looks into his eyes.

                                 ABBY
                        I love you.

                                 SAM
                             (unsure)
                        I love you, too.

           Sam suddenly looks like he’s trying to hold something back.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        BURRRRPPP!

           It’s oddly cute; Abby can’t help but giggle.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Eric sits alone on Sam’s couch.  He’s cleared the pile of 
           clothes and folded them in a neat stack.

           He’s got his feet up on Sam’s coffee table while he digs into 
           a bucket of ice cream.  He watches NBC NIGHTLY NEWS.

           Butch comes along and starts CHEWING on the remote.  The 
           channel changes from Brian Williams to THE SHAHS OF SUNSET on 
           Bravo.

                                 ERIC
                        Bad dog!

           There’s a loud KNOCK at the door.  Eric freezes.  The KNOCK 
           comes again.

           He struggles to mute the TV, but unfamiliar with Sam’s P.O.S. 
           set-up, he accidentally CRANKS the volume up instead.

           Eric is a deer in headlights.

                                 VOICE AT THE DOOR
                        Open the fuck up, Sam!  I hear your 
                        ass in there!

           Wit no choice, Eric cracks the door open to find a scary 
           looking MEXICAN MAN wearing sunglasses at night.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                        ‘Bout time, vato.  Lemme get an 
                        eighth.

           Eric looks confused.

                                 ERIC
                        Uh, an eighth of what?

           The Mexican Man POUNDS the doorframe.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                        Mota, man!  Rapido!

           Eric looks like he’s about to shit his pants.

                                 ERIC
                             (to himself)
                        He’s a drug dealer?!

           The Mexican Man is not pleased.
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                             (fighting off panic)
                        Uh, uno momento, por favor!

           Eric runs back inside to find weed, any weed, to sell the 
           guy.  

           He looks everywhere with no luck.  Praying to find even just 
           a nug, he goes over to the hall closet and opens it.

           Inside is a MINI-GROW HOUSE: U/V LIGHTS, HYDROPONICS, and POT 
           PLANTS are crammed inside floor to ceiling!

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god!

           Sweating bullets, he grabs a handful of weed, waaaaaaaay more 
           than an eighth, and takes it out to the man.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                             (unsure)
                        Is this enough?

           The Mexican Man stifles a laugh.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                        Yeah, yeah, that’s enough.  Gimme
                        it.

           The Mexican Man pushes his way into the apartment and starts 
           packing Sam’s bong.

           He takes THREE FAT RIPS then hands the bong to Eric.

                                 MEXICAN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Hit this.

                                 ERIC
                        Oh, I don’t smoke.

                                 MEXICAN MAN
                             (pissed)
                        Don’t be such a puta.

           Again, the Mexican Man shoves the bong at Eric.  Wanting to 
           avoid trouble, he relents and awkwardly places his lips on 
           the bong still in the Mexican Man’s hands.  

                                 MEXICAN MAN (CONT’D)
                        Suck, cabron!

           Eric inhales before pulling back and BELCHING out a fat rip 
           of smoke.  He coughs uncontrollably; his eyes are watering.
           Laughing, the Mexican Man rises and drops some CRUMPLED 
           TWENTIES on the coffee table before bolting.

           Eric slams the door after him and slides down to the ground 
           with his back against it.  His heart pounds a mile a minute.

                                 ERIC
                        I feel wiggly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. TGI FRIDAY'S - LATER

           Empty BEER MUGS line the table.

                                 ABBY 
                             (buzzed)
                        We haven’t had this much fun since 
                        our first date.

                                 SAM
                             (buzzed)
                        That’s pretty sad.

                                 ABBY
                        Shut up, you know what I mean.

           Abby plays with Sam’s hand; he looks at it and grins.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Eric has passed out in front of the TV. 

           An involuntary spasm wakes him up from his slumber.  He rubs 
           his eyes as he tries to sort out where he is. 

           Eric leans forward and grabs Sam’s phone to check the time.

                                 ERIC
                             (to himself)
                        Where the hell are they?

           Eric almost dials Sam before he stops and thinks better of 
           it.

           With a few thumb flicks Eric accidentally brings up a video 
           on Sam’s phone.

           The sound of moaning women from a porno fills the room as the 
           light from the video illuminates Eric’s now smiling face.
           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Sam and Abby BURST into the bedroom locked in a fevered storm 
           of kissing lips and roaming hands.

                                 SAM
                             (grabbing Abby’s hand)
                        You know what, we, uh, should, um, 
                        probably just get some sleep. We 
                        both have work tomorrow.

                                 ABBY
                             (confused)
                        What’s wrong, Eric?  You’ve never 
                        turned down sex before.

                                 SAM
                        I know, I, wait, really?
                             (beat)
                        I mean, it’s late and I have a 
                        really bad headache.
                             (trying to look 
                              convincing)
                        Yeah, must’ve had too much to 
                        drink.

           Sam gently pushes Abby aside, kicks off his pants, and plops 
           down into bed.  He climbs under the covers.

           Abby, disappointed, looks at Sam.  She gives up, but then 
           cracks a wry smile, and glides toward the bed.

           She lies next to Sam and places her head on his chest.

                                 ABBY
                        I know a great cure for a 
                        headache...

                                 SAM
                        Sleep?

           Abby answers by diving her head under the sheets.

           Sam's eyes cross as Abby locks onto his man-region.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (after a moment)
                        Holy shit!  Stop!

           Abby’s head pops out from under the covers.

                                 ABBY
                        What’s wrong?!  Too much teeth?
                                 SAM
                        No, no.  Nothing like that.

                                 ABBY
                             (eager)
                        Good!

           Abby tries to get back to work.  Sam violently SQUIRMS trying 
           to get away from her.  He involuntarily JERKS his knee upward 
           when:

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Ow, my nose!

           Abby leaps out of bed and runs to the bathroom.  Her nose is 
           a mess.

                                 SAM
                        Ah, you bleedin’??

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Sam and Abby, sobered up, stand before the bathroom mirror.

           Abby examines her tender nose.  She has rolled-up TOILET 
           PAPER WADS stuffed up each nostril.

                                 ABBY
                        I think the bleeding stopped.  
                        You’re lucky you didn’t break it.

           She pulls the wads out of her nose, and flushes them down the 
           toilet.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Since when do you not like my blow-
                        joys?

                                 SAM
                        Blowjoys?

                                 ABBY
                        Huh?

                                 SAM
                        Nothing.  Sorry.  I guess I just 
                        wasn’t in the mood for a...blowjoy.

                                 ABBY 
                             (still poking her nose)
                        Well next time just tap me on the 
                        shoulder or something.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABBY  (CONT'D)
                        I’m gonna take an aspirin.  Brush 
                        your teeth and then come to bed.

           Sam stares down Eric’s TOOTHBRUSH sitting in a cup next to 
           the faucet.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        What’s wrong?  Aren’t you gonna
                        brush?

                                 SAM
                             (stalling)
                        Uh, I think just mouth wash 
                        tonight.

                                 ABBY
                             (shaking an empty bottle 
                              of Scope)
                        Oh, shoot.  I forgot to pick some 
                        up.  I’ll get more tomorrow.  Just 
                        brush and come cuddle.

           Abby picks up Eric’s toothbrush and offers it to Sam.

           Sam relents and takes hold of it. Abby pops her pill.

           Sam gives the toothbrush a look of death.  Right now, he and 
           it are the only two things in the room.

           Abby finishes her nightly routine and looks up to see Sam 
           still psyched out.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                             (puzzled)
                        What is it?  Did it fall in the 
                        toilet or something?

           Abby continues to stare at Sam staring at the toothbrush.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                             (impatiently)
                        Brush your teeth already!

                                 SAM
                        Okay, mom!

           Abby reacts with mock indignation.

           Sam musters his courage and barely hides his disgust as he 
           angrily shoves his brother’s toothbrush into his mouth.

           Abby seems satisfied and finally leaves the bathroom for bed.
           Sam kicks the door closed behind her and violently spits out 
           the toothbrush.

           He rinses his mouth out vociferously.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           The sun shines into the room through the slightly opened 
           window slats.

           Sam is fast asleep and SNORING up a storm.  He’s half covered 
           by the blanket.  His BARE ASS is exposed to the world.

           A hand SLAPS down HARD on his right cheek.  Sam awakens with 
           a start.

           He rolls over and looks at his attacker with one eye closed.

                                 ERIC
                        Why are you naked in my bed?!

                                 SAM
                             (groggily)
                        Good morning to you too, sunshine.

           Sam rubs his reddened butt cheek as he rolls over.  He’s 
           sporting massive morning wood.  He’s pitching a tent through 
           the bed sheet, and proud of it.

                                 ERIC
                             (disgusted)
                        What did you do?!

                                 SAM 
                        Where’s Abby?

                                 ERIC
                        At work.  Like I’m supposed to be!  
                        What the hell happened here?!

           Sam sits up in bed.  He rubs the sleep out of his eyes.

                                 SAM
                        Nothing happened!

                                 ERIC
                        Liar!

           Eric lunges across the bed and tackles Sam.
           Sam does his best to naked scissor kick his brother off of 
           him.

                                 SAM
                        Would you relax?!  We didn’t do 
                        anything. 

           Eric is relieved.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        She just tried to blow me.

                                 ERIC
                        She gave you a blowjoy?

                                 SAM
                        I can’t believe you people call it 
                        that...

                                 ERIC
                        Is that a yes or a no??

                                 SAM
                        It’s a no!
                             (beat)
                        She barely got it wet.

                                 ERIC
                             (pouncing)
                        I’ll kill you!

                                 SAM
                        Dude, collateral damage!  I stopped 
                        her!  Now get the fuck off me!

           Sam SHOVES Eric to the floor and he lands with a thud.

                                 ERIC
                        What did she say when you dumped 
                        her?

                                 SAM
                        That’s just it.  I never got the 
                        chance.  

           Eric is beside himself.  He can’t believe what he’s hearing.  
           He stands before Sam, mouth agape.  Waiting.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I tried to bring it up, but she 
                        kept interrupting and ordering 
                        beers.
                                 ERIC
                        Abby doesn’t drink beer.

                                 SAM
                        Last night she did.
                             (beat)
                        Anyway, before I knew it she had me 
                        drunk and seduced.

                                 ERIC
                        What a nightmare.  You know I was 
                        almost killed last night.

           Sam looks confused.  Suddenly, it dawns on him.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck.  Tuesday.  I forgot about 
                        Hector.

                                 ERIC
                        Why are you growing pot?!

                                 SAM
                        You sound just like Mom when she 
                        kicked me out!  Being a gardener 
                        doesn’t cover all my expenses!  

                                 ERIC
                        What expenses?!

                                 SAM
                             (ignoring the dig)
                        You better not have fucked this up 
                        for me.  I’m building a new client 
                        base and my profit margins are 
                        razor thin as it is.

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t worry, I’m sure Hector will 
                        be back.

           An iPhone CHIRPS.

                                 SAM 
                        Was that yours or mine?

                                 ERIC
                        I think it was mine.  It’s on the 
                        night stand.

           Sam looks over and grabs the phone.  He reads the text 
           without handing the phone over.
                                 SAM
                        It’s from Abby.

                                 ERIC
                        What does it say?

                        “Hey baby cakes, wished I could’ve

                                 ERIC
                        For real?

                                 SAM
                        Dude, this is perfect.  Let me 
                        finish the job.  Trust me.

                                 ERIC
                        Trust you?  You turned my office 
                        party into an orgy, tried to get a 
                        blowjoy from Abby, and had me sell 
                        drugs to a gangbanger!

                                 SAM
                        Well, sure, it sounds bad if you 
                        say it like that.

                        in hot coworker boobies.

           Eric hurls Sam back into bed and opens his closet doors.

                                 ERIC
                        Fine. What are we gonna wear?

           Eric parks Sam’s truck next to Sam who parks Eric’s Prius.  
           Sam gets out dressed for his day of work as Eric.

           Eric wears a HOODIE and AVIATOR GLASSES trying to hide his 
           face.
                                 SAM
                        You know you look like the

                        My cubicle is in the middle of the 
                        fourth floor.  I’ve got pictures of 
                        mom and pop in it so you should be 
                        able to find it.

           Eric shoves a briefcase into Sam’s chest and tugs at his 
           brother’s collar to make sure his tie is on straight.

                                 ERIC
                        Just sit at my desk, don’t answer 
                        my phone, and wait for Abby to show 
                        up.

                        He was at the party.  He’s a little 
                        taller than us, handsome, and...you
                        know.

           Eric waves a hand over his face.

           Sam gives him a blank look.

                        Just get in there and avoid him at 
                        all costs.

           Eric hustles Sam to the front door of the building and SHOVES 
           him into the lobby.

           Sam presses the elevator call button and doesn’t have to wait 
           long before a set of doors opens with a DING.

           Kingshuk stands in the waiting elevator next to an old Black 
           guy in WORK OVERALLS. 

           Sam steps into the elevator.

                        been high once in my life.  And 
                        only because my brother made me.  I

                        again.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        The fuck I care if you smoke.  

                                 SAM
                        Wow, really, Mr. Bullock?

           Kingshuk looks at Sam weirdly.

                                 BLACK GUY
                        Why you keep callin’ me Bullock?
                        I’m Otis. 
                             (beat)
                        The janitor.

           OTIS holds up a MOP and SLOP BUCKET.

           DING.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        You really are high.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - ERIC’S CUBICLE

           Sam wanders past cubicle after cubicle trying to nonchalantly 
           look inside each one.

           He finally comes upon Eric’s and recognizes a photo of his 
           parents sitting next to the computer monitor.  He tosses the 
           briefcase on the floor and sits down.
           Sam boots up the computer and starts adjusting Eric’s chair.

           He jerks up and down.

                                 SAM
                             (sotto)
                        How can someone sit like this all 
                        day?

           He unlocks the back of the chair and reclines lazily.

           After drumming on Eric’s desktop for a few seconds, Sam pulls 
           out Eric’s iPhone.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (sotto)
                        A few hours to lunch.  Better get 
                        to work.

           Sam slides his finger across the iPhone and starts playing 
           ANGRY BIRDS.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT

           Eric, still looking like the Unabomber, enters Sam’s 
           apartment. 

           He notices Butch’s water and food bowls are empty; he fills 
           them before being interrupted by another ominous KNOCK at the 
           door.

           Eric crosses himself, pulls down his hood and opens the door 
           to find an OLD, SURLY VIETNAMESE MAN waiting there.

                                 ERIC
                        Look, buddy.  I know why you’re 
                        here.  I don’t have any today. 

                                 VIETNAMESE MAN
                        What you mean you no have today?  
                        You say today!  I come today!

                                 ERIC
                        I’m all out, man.  Come back next 
                        week.

           Eric tries to close the door.
                                 VIETNAMESE MAN
                        I no come back next week!  You say 
                        today!  I here today!  If you don’t 
                        give to me now we have trouble.

                                 ERIC
                             (shrugging)
                        Fine.  Wait here.

           Eric goes back inside, opens the closet, and grabs another 
           handful of weed.  He heads back to the front door where he 
           shoves it in the man’s hands.

                                 VIETNAMESE MAN
                        What this?  You selling drug in my 
                        building?!

                                 ERIC
                        Shit.  Your building?

                                 VIETNAMESE MAN
                        Your deposit check bounce, ass 
                        hole.  And you try pay me in drug?

           Eric thinks quickly.  He slaps the weed out of the man’s 
           hands.

                                 ERIC
                        No, no.  I’m sorry 
                        that’s...uh...oregano.  I thought 
                        you were asking to uh...borrow
                        some?

           He pulls out his wallet and empties it of the cash inside.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Take this!  I’ll get the rest for 
                        you tomorrow.  Please!

           The Vietnamese man counts out the money; he appears satisfied 
           yet still dubious.

                                 VIETNAMESE MAN
                        Tomorrow, motha-fucka or you out on 
                        your ass.

           The Vietnamese man turns and leaves.

                                 ERIC

           INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - ERIC’S CUBICLE - DAY

           Sam takes a break from Angry Birds; he cruises ESPN Fantasy 
           Basketball rankings when a VOICE calls him from behind.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Aren’t we busy today?

           Sam turns around slowly and comes face to tits with Slutty 
           Mary.

           He stands up to greet her and then grabs a THREE-RING BINDER 
           to hide the newly-forming boner in his pants.

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        Can you fuck me like a naughty 
                        school girl?

                                 SAM
                        What’d you say??

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        I said can you sign your expense 
                        report for me?

                                 SAM
                        Oh, sure.  That’s what I thought 
                        you said.

           Sam signs the report; his eyes still on Mary’s cleavage.

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        Thanks!  How’re things with Abby?

           She chews on her pen.  Sam is having trouble concentrating.

                                 SAM
                        Oh, you know...  Things are going 
                        great.

           More chewing.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        I feel like I’m getting to know her 
                        all over again.

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        Oh, that’s great!  Well, I’ll see 
                        you around the office.

                                 SAM
                        Sure thing.  Uh, where’s your 
                        cubicle at?
                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        Where it always is, silly.  By the 
                        way, you can just ask “Where’s your 
                        cubicle”?

                                 SAM
                        Huh?

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        You don’t need to say “Where’s your 
                        cubicle at?”  You never end a 
                        sentence with a preposition.  But 
                        look at me, telling a writer about 
                        grammar.  Can you imagine?

           She drags the pen out of her mouth and walks away.  She’s a 
           few feet out of Eric’s cubicle before she’s stopped by a 
           swooning Kingshuk.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Anything for me to sign?

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                             (aloof)
                        No, Kingshuk, you’re all taken care 
                        of.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        But, are you?

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                             (confused)
                        I’m fine.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Yes, you are.

           Slutty Mary floats away leaving Kingshuk behind to stare.  
           He’s suddenly very aroused...

           He turns and runs to the bathroom.

           INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - ELEVATOR BAY - CONTINUOUS

           Abby steps off from the elevators with a PICNIC BASKET in 
           hand.  She walks down to Eric’s cubicle to find Sam.

                                 ABBY
                        Hey, babe!  Ready to go?

           She holds up the picnic basket cutely.
                                 SAM
                             (somewhat nervous)
                        Oh, you know it.

           They walk arm and arm down the hall.  They’re about to pass 
           the Men’s Room.

           Suddenly, a coquettish look crosses Abby’s face.  She stops 
           them in front of the door and lays the picnic basket down on 
           the floor in front of it.

           She turns into Sam.

                                 ABBY
                        I have a really naughty idea that 
                        could get us into a lot of trouble.

           Sam opens his mouth to reply when she devours him in a deep 
           kiss.

           Sam’s knees go weak as Abby drags him into the Men’s Room.

           INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Abby and Sam stumble into the bathroom.

                                 ABBY
                        Errrriccc...  You started my engine 
                        last night and didn’t drive me 
                        home...

           Abby tries her best dirty talk; she sucks at it, but A for 
           effort.

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        I have such a..boner..for you.

           Abby pulls Sam to the last stall and FLINGS THE DOOR OPEN to 
           find Kingshuk furiously masturbating.

                                 KINGSHUK
                             (mid-stroke)
                        Hey, man, what the hell!

                                 ABBY
                        OH MY GOD!

           Kingshuk tries to cover his junk, but he’s already reached 
           the Event Horizon...

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Unnnnhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!
           Kingshuk uncontrollably FIRES OFF A SIX-ROPER.  

           INT. OFFICES OF THE DAILY SHOPPER - ELEVATOR BAY - CONTINUOUS

           Sam and Abby run out of the bathroom like it’s on fire.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m so embarrassed.  I just saw 
                        Kingshuk’s O face for God’s sake!
                        I can’t believe people do that at 
                        work!

                                 SAM
                        You mean you don’t?

           Abby is still shell-shocked.  Sam feels badly for her.  

           He scoops up the picnic basket and warmly wraps an arm around 
           her as they walk out.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, sweetie, come on.  Let’s get 
                        out of here and forget all about 
                        that masturbating Indian.

           LATER

           Sam holds the door of the building open for Abby.

           She steps through with a smile and almost walks right into 
           Bullock. 

           He’s holding a coffee and throws up a hand to protect Abby 
           from a spill.

                                 BULLOCK
                             (charming)
                        Hello, what have we here?

           Sam follows Abby through the door.  He looks nervous at the 
           prospect of embarrassing another Black man.

                                 BULLOCK (CONT'D)
                        Scott, this your girlfriend?

                                 SAM
                        She sure is.

           Bullock is waiting to be introduced.  An awkward pause passes 
           and Bullock gives Sam a look of contempt.
                                 BULLOCK
                        Pardon your boyfriend’s rudeness.  
                        My name is Avery Bullock.  I’m 
                        Eric’s editor.
                             (to Sam)
                        What’s the matter with you, Scott?  
                        Too afraid to introduce this 
                        beautiful young woman to your boss?

                                 SAM
                             (relieved)
                        Oh, so you’re the boss.

           Another awkward look from Bullock.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (backpedaling)
                        I’m just kidding, Mr. Bullock.  Of 
                        course I hesitated introducing you 
                        to Abby.  I don’t need that kind of 
                        competition.

           Sam gives Bullock an old-boy pat on the shoulder.

           Bullock looks at his shoulder where Sam touched him.  This 
           isn’t going well.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Anyway, I better be getting back 
                        upstairs.  Nice meeting you, Abby.

           Bullock brushes past Sam and heads for inside.

           Sam breathes a sigh of relief before Bullock catches himself 
           and turns around.

                                 BULLOCK (CONT'D)
                        Remember, I want your sample piece 
                        on my desk next week.  Don’t think 
                        I’ve forgotten our little deal.

                                 SAM
                             (flustered)
                        Of course, sir.  You would never 
                        forget anything, sir.  

           Another quizzical expression from Bullock before he heads 
           back into the building.  Sam leads Abby away at a brisk pace.

           EXT./INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

           Eric sits in Sam’s living room.  He’s pulled the coffee table 
           right up to the couch and has set up a little work station.
           He’s got his laptop out and is sitting before an empty Word 
           document.

           A single sentence has been written at the top of the page.

           “UNTITLED ARTICLE” by Eric Scott

                                 ERIC
                        Come on.  Think.  Write what you 
                        know...

           His eyes drift from the LAPTOP to Sam’s BONG.

           His face says “fuck it”.

           He grabs it and looks for a LIGHTER.  He shoves his hand down 
           between the cushions and pulls out...a WAD OF TWIX WRAPPERS.  
           Disgusted, he continues digging and finds an ORANGE BIC.

           He takes a few hits while SPUTTERING and COUGHING loudly.

           He’s by no means a pro, but he’s getting the hang of it.

           Eureka.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                             (leaning forward to type)
                        How about, “Analyzing the effects 
                        of marijuana on the professional 
                        male?”

           Eric GIGGLES to himself.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        No, that sucks.

           He snaps the laptop shut and then heads to kitchen where he 
           opens the refrigerator door.

           Eric takes a second to inspect its contents.

           Having made up his mind, he throws himself halfway inside it 
           and SCOOPS EVERY PIECE OF FOOD INTO BOTH OF HIS ARMS.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Snack mountain!

           EXT. PARK - LATER

           Abby and Sam come to a scenic park for their picnic.  The 
           place is PACKED.  A GIANT SIGN out front reads:

           SPRINGTIME FUNFAIR
                                 ABBY
                        Oh, shoot.  I wanted someplace 
                        quiet.  We can find another spot, 
                        babe.

                                 SAM
                             (with childlike glee)
                        And miss the funfair?  Are you 
                        mental?

                                 ABBY
                        What about lunch?

           Already running off, he GRABS her hand and YANKS her behind 
           him.

                                 SAM
                        We can have it later!

           CUE MUSIC: “I’M A BELIEVER” - by The Monkees

           CUE MONTAGE OF SAM AND ABBY AT THE FUNFAIR:

           --Sam and Abby at a WATERGUN BOOTH squirting INFLATABLE CLOWN 
           HEADS.  A LITTLE BOY comes up next to them to join in the 
           fun.

           The little guy is good.  Sam just gets pissed off.  He goes 
           in for the kill until he notices Abby looking at him.

           Sam softens and lets the kid win.

           Abby melts.

           --Sam and Abby at a GUESS YOUR WEIGHT BOOTH.  Sam goes first, 
           Abby runs away when it’s her turn.

           --Sam and Abby at a DART GAME.  Sam squints one eye and pokes 
           out his tongue while he takes aim at a target.  He lets the 
           dart fly just as a vicious-looking CARNIE walks right into 
           its path.

           The dart STICKS into the Carnie’s head without him noticing.  
           Abby puts her hands over her mouth and rushes to help, but 
           Sam drags her away bodily.

           --Sam and Abby at the PETTING ZOO.  Sam holds a handful of 
           feed in front of a large, surly GOAT.  He taunts the goat by 
           taking the feed away every time it gets close.

           Pissed, the goat lowers its head and CHARGES Sam chasing him 
           around the pen until he slips on a PILE OF PIG SHIT. 

           He lands square on his ass.  Abby can’t help but laugh.

           EXT. PARK - PICNIC TIME

           Abby finds an uncrowded clearing underneath a tall tree.

                                 ABBY
                        That was amazing! 

           Sam HOBBLES behind her with an ICE PACK over his dick.

                                 SAM
                        I know!

           Sam unrolls the classic checkered blanket in mid-air as he 
           lays it gently on the ground.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, shoot, babe.  Don’t you have to 
                        get back to the office soon?

                                 SAM
                        Nah, the place won’t fall apart 
                        without me.  

                                 ABBY
                             (amazed)
                        Wow, are you sure?

                                 SAM
                        You’re more important than work.

           Abby does a double take.

           They sit down on the blanket.  Abby leans over and pulls out 
           a GIANT SUB and starts plating all of the sides.

           She pulls out a salad, some fancy chips, various dips, and 
           even a thermos of soup.

           Sam is knocked out by the spread.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (touched)
                        This is incredible.  Really.  I’m 
                        having the best time.  I love it.

                                 ABBY
                             (playfully)
                        Is that all you love?
           Sam seems to think for a moment.

                                 SAM
                        No.  I love the soup, too.

           She punches him playfully in the arm.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        And, of course, you.  The bringer 
                        of soup.

           Abby leans over and kisses Sam warmly on the cheek.  She goes 
           back to unpacking the napkins and cutlery.

           Sam touches a hand to his cheek where Abby kissed him.  He 
           seems lost in thought as he stares off into space.

                                 ABBY
                        Something wrong, honey?

                                 SAM
                        No, nothing.  I was just thinking 
                        about you.  That’s all.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh, yeah?  What were you thinking?

                                 SAM
                        How I’m going to repay you for 
                        today.

           Without another word Sam leans over the food and embraces 
           her.  They kiss deeply.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Sam walks in after his lunch date with Abby.

           Eric sits up from the couch to follow him.  He brushes CHIPS 
           AHOY! crumbs off of his chest.

                                 ERIC
                        What’re you doing home so early?

                                 SAM
                        You took a Sick Day.

                                 ERIC
                        Good thinking.  I have a million of 
                        them.  How’d it go?  Was she upset?
                                 SAM
                        Don’t get mad.

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t say that.  I’m gonna get mad 
                        anyway and we both know it.

           Sam walks over and puts both his hands on Eric’s shoulders.

                                 SAM
                        I was on the green, but I couldn’t 
                        sink the putt.

                                 ERIC
                        Speak English!

                                 SAM
                        I mismanaged the shot clock.  When 
                        the time came to drop the bomb, we 
                        were already back at your office.

                                 ERIC
                        Where are you getting these 
                        metaphors from?

                                 SAM
                        Listen to me.  She would’ve caused 
                        a massive scene.  I know how 
                        important your job is to you. I 
                        couldn’t risk messing that up.

                             (softening)
                        I’m oddly touched.  
                             (hardening)
                        But when is this gonna end?!  I’m 
                        going nuts over here!

                        I’m gonna do it tonight, I promise.  
                        I’ll pretend to make her dinner to 
                        soften the blow.  Let me get a 
                        couple of Two Buck Chuck’s in her 
                        and you’re golden.

           Eric knows he’s at the mercy of Sam.

                                 ERIC
                        Fine, tonight’s the night.  This is 
                        your last chance.  Promise me you 
                        won’t mess up again. 

           Eric fails to notice the sheen of sweat forming on Sam’s 
           forehead.
                                 ERIC (CONT’D)

                                 ERIC
                        Okay.  Don’t be too hard on her.
                             (beat)
                        And give me back my cell.

           Sam and Eric switch iPhones.

           Sam packs his overnight bag.

           He grabs his deodorant and then his toothbrush.  

           He holds the toothbrush up to the mirror and kisses it like a 
           diamond.

                                 SAM
                        Sorry I cheated on you, baby.

           Meanwhile, Abby and Jess work out with JEAN-PAUL; a Black, 
           muscle-bound personal trainer wearing skin-tight Under Armour
           gear.

                                 JEAN-PAUL
                        Aight, girls.  Squats.  Time to 
                        blast those quads.

                                 ABBY
                        Again?  We started with those.

           Jess punches Abby in the arm.

                                 JESS
                        Shut up, Abby!
                             (to Jean-Paul, 
                              seductively)
                        Like this, Jean-Paul?

           Jess cuts loose and uses a hand to tease her hair.  She 
           proceeds to drop it like it’s hot.
           Jean-Paul licks his lips; the two never break eye contact.

           Abby’s text-book squats look as bored as she does.

                             (breaking the intimacy)

                        Huh?  Oh, right.  Tell me about 
                        your little picnic.

                        It was better than I could’ve 
                        hoped.  We went to the fair.

           Abby shudders.

                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                        Don’t be shy, girl.

                                 JESS
                        Don’t be such a prude, Ab.  Jean-
                        Paul, I’m feeling a little tight.

           Jean-Paul moves behind Jess and presses up against her.  They 
           squat together.  It’s weird.
                                 JEAN-PAUL
                        You gotta work yo’ back, feel the 
                        burn.

                                 ABBY
                        Trust me, Jean-Paul.  She’s feeling 
                        something.

                                 JESS
                        He’s just showing me proper form.

           She and Jean-Paul bend deeper.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (grunt)
                        Maybe if you got in on this,
                             (grunt)
                        Eric would propose sooner.

                                 ABBY
                        Wow.  Good advice. I’m gonna go 
                        shower, Eric and I are having 
                        dinner tonight.  Besides, this 
                        looks more like a one on one 
                        session anyway.

           Jess shrugs as Abby leaves and goes for another squat with 
           Jean-Paul playing back-up.  Between lunges:

                                 JEAN-PAUL
                        Let her go, girl.  You deserve my 
                        full attention.

           Yes she does.

           EXT./INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The living room is dark.  A weak glow emanates from the 
           dining room.

           Keys scratch at the front door.  Sam rushes to plate the last 
           of some BOSTON MARKET TAKE-OUT.  

           He frantically stuffs the evidence into the trash as Abby 
           pushes through the doorway holding her oversized gym bag.

           She strains her eyes trying to see through the darkness.

                                 ABBY
                             (to the room)
                        Babe?

           CUE MUSIC: “RETURN TO ME” - by Dean Martin
           At first, she’s shocked by the music, but a smile soon 
           crosses her face as she dumps her gym bag to the floor.

           She’s curious and excited.  She tiptoes towards the glowing 
           light in the dining room.

           As soon as she turns the corner, Abby’s face goes slack in 
           surprise.

           Sam sits at the table.  Two places have been set.  Candles 
           are lit.  Wine has been poured.

                                 SAM
                        Hey.

                                 ABBY
                             (stunned)
                        Hey, you.

           Sam hops out of his chair and walks over to Abby.  

           He’s wearing a tie with a nice jacket.  He’s clean-shaven and 
           looks like a million bucks.

           Sam’s attire is in stark contrast to Abby’s gym clothes.

           He places a hand gently on her shoulder and leads her to her 
           chair.

           Abby is nearly overcome with emotion.

           Sam pulls out Abby’s seat for her.  He’s a perfect gentleman.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        You did all this for me?

                                 SAM
                        Of course I did.  You deserve it 
                        all and more.

           Abby is doing her best not to cry.

           He takes the lid off of her dish.

                                 ABBY
                        Babe, you cooked?

                                 SAM
                        I even pan-seared the chicken.

                                 ABBY
                        I’ve never seen you make this.
                                 SAM
                        Old family recipe.

           He gives her a playful wink.

           Sam and Abby unroll their napkins.  Sam tucks his into his 
           shirt as Abby lays hers on her lap.

                                 ABBY
                             (laughing)
                        When did you start doing that, 
                        baby?

                                 SAM
                             (curious)
                        Doing what?

                                 ABBY
                        Your napkin.  You tucked it into 
                        your shirt.  Just like a little 
                        boy.  You never do that.

           Sam’s eyes flash in a moment of panic.  He regains his 
           composure quickly and snaps the napkin from his neck down to 
           his pants.

                                 SAM
                        I love this shirt, I wanted to be 
                        careful.

           Abby chews a bite of macaroni. She smiles and caresses Sam’s 
           chin as she eats.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        These last couple days have been 
                        the best of my life, Abby.

           Abby can’t take anymore.  She leaps out of her seat and into 
           Sam’s lap.

           Sam is shocked, but ready.  He cradles Abby in his arms.  

           She stares into his eyes for a few moments.  The two share a 
           passionate, wordless exchange.  Abby bites her lower lip.  We 
           know where this is going...

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The bedroom door is kicked open.  Sam and Abby are at it 
           again.  

           Abby tries to take Sam’s tie off over his head, but she 
           accidentally hooks it on his nose.
           Eyes watering, Sam takes over and undoes his tie, shirt, and 
           pants.

           He doesn’t wait for Abby; he shreds her clothes off for her.  

           The two dive into bed for the main event.  It’s mind-blowing.

           When it’s over, Sam holds Abby post-coital.  They each look 
           happier than we’ve ever seen them.

                                 ABBY
                        What a perfect night.

                                 SAM
                        I wish every night could be like 
                        this.

                                 ABBY
                        What do you mean?

                                 SAM
                        Abby, I have to tell you something.  
                        I’m... I’m...

                                 ABBY
                             (interrupting)
                        Ready?

                                 SAM
                        Ready for what?

                                 ABBY
                        What we talked about the other 
                        night...getting married.
                             (beat)
                        Something’s changed in you.
                             (beat)
                        You’re different somehow.

                                 SAM
                        I know what it is.  I’ve been 
                        looking for a happiness of my own.
                             (beat)
                        And I think I’ve found it.

                                 ABBY
                             (giddy)
                        So let’s get married!

           Abby’s happiness is contagious.  Sam is swept up into the 
           moment and once again forgets his brotherly duty.

                                 SAM
                        Yes.  Let’s do it!  I love you!
           Sam rolls on top of her and they get right back to it.

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Abby has her laptop open in front of her.

           It’s late.  The lights are off.

           Sam SNORES in bed next to her.

           Abby has a childlike smile on her face watching him sleep.  
           She turns, and from over her shoulder, we see as she logs 
           into facebook...

           EXT./INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Sam’s living room is brightly lit by the early morning sun.

           Eric’s iPhone buzzes intermittently on the coffee table.

           It looks like Eric has passed out on the couch again.  The TV 
           is still on.  Billy Mays shouts annoyingly from beyond the 
           grave about the wonders of the Jupiter Jack.

           The random buzzes of his iPhone finally rouse Eric from his 
           weed-induced slumber.

           He lazily pulls himself up from the couch.  He smacks his 
           lips, rubs his eyes, and looks around the apartment.

           With one eye closed, he looks towards his vibrating iPhone.

           He yawns and leans forward to grab it.

           Suddenly, Eric’s closed eye SNAPS open.  He struggle to 
           focus.

           He’s shocked by what he sees.

           42 TEXT MESSAGES

           37 MISSED CALLS

           29 VOICEMAILS

                                 ERIC
                        Whaaa?  Is Obama okay?

           With a frantic slide of his finger, Eric opens his text 
           messages.  Words from the screen LEAP out at him.

           “CONGRATULATIONS”.
           “ABOUT TIME”.

           “HERE COMES THE BRIDE”.

           “NO MORE SINGLE LIFE”.

           “FINALLY BOUGHT THE COW, HUH?”.

           “YOUR LIFE IS OVER”.

           Eric begins sweating hardcore.  Shaking his head, he checks 
           his voicemails.  Putting the phone on speaker, random voices 
           SHOUT OUT:

           “We knew you could do it...”  “We’re just so happy...”  “So 
           happy for you”

           Kingshuk’s voice can be heard screaming, “Why? Why?!”

           The room begins to spin.  He looks at his phone completely 
           dumbfounded. What’s going on?

           Eric clicks open his facebook app and starts to cruise 
           through the live feed.

           His eyes dart from left to right reading as fast as he can.

           Finally, he stops at a recent update.  He GASPS hard enough 
           to burst his lungs.  His eyes bug out of his head as he sees 
           Abby’s STATUS UPDATE.

           “ABBY CARMICHAEL is now ENGAGED!!!! <3 <3 <3.”

           A Hitchcockian Zoom focuses in on Eric, BONECHILLING music 
           ramps up.

                                                             SMASH CUT:

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

                                 ERIC (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!

           EXT./INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Sam is still in bed sleeping like a baby.  A note, weighted 
           down by a FRESH MUFFIN, has been left next to him on Abby’s 
           pillow.

           Love you, babe.  See you after work. -Ab

           Sam’s iPhone is on the nightstand.
           It starts to buzz.  The buzzing stops, but then starts again 
           almost immediately.

           Sam is starting to wake up.  He rolls over and sees the 
           muffin.

           With a smile, Sam reaches over lazily and grabs the muffin.  
           He takes a bite before reading the note.

           The iPhone continues to buzz behind him.  Sam is more 
           interested in the muffin.

           He reads the note with a mouthful of his treat.  He finishes 
           then gives it a kiss before laying it back on the bed.

           Sam swallows and then lets out a sigh of satisfaction.  It’s 
           impossible to tell whether he’s happier about the muffin or 
           the note.

           Again, his iPhone buzzes.

           Sam looks as if he’s noticed it for the first time.  He rolls 
           over again and grabs it.

           He looks at the Caller ID.

                                 SAM
                             (to himself)
                        What do you want, bro?

           He takes a moment to prepare himself then answers the phone.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Hell---

           Sam’s voice is ridiculously hoarse from sleep.  He coughs to 
           clear his throat.  It has no effect.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                             (still hoarse)
                        Hello?

                                 ERIC
                        What did you do?!?!

           Eric’s voice can be heard through the iPhone a mile away.

                                 SAM
                        Wh...what are you talking about?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m getting married!

           Sam’s closed eye suddenly snaps open.
                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Abby changed her Relationship 
                        Status to Engaged last night!  
                        What’s going on?!

           Sam looks around the room.  He’s worried.  His head is 
           swimming.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        My phone exploded with wellwishers!  
                        I’m getting congratulations and 
                        happy thoughts from people I 
                        haven’t even spoken to since 
                        college!

           Sam is speechless.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        What’s this girl’s problem?  She 
                        can’t handle a breakup or what?!

                                 SAM
                        I...I wouldn’t say that.

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean?  You dumped her 
                        and she takes that to mean there’s 
                        a wedding coming?

                                 SAM
                        Eric.  Listen.  I probably 
                        should’ve told you this earlier, 
                        but...
                             (sigh)
                        There is a wedding coming.

                                 ERIC
                             (scared)
                        What...what do you mean?

                                 SAM
                        It’s just that.  You see, she...

                                 ERIC
                             (calmly, but barely 
                              controlled)
                        Sam.  What have you done?

           Sam taps his iPhone against his forehead struggling with his 
           impromptu confession.
                                 SAM
                        Abby kinda, sorta proposed to me.  
                        I mean to you.  I mean she did when 
                        I was pretending to be you.

                                 ERIC
                             (long pause)
                        I’m confused.  What am I not 
                        getting here?  

                                 SAM
                        She asked you to get married and 
                        you said yes.

           Eric’s side of the phone goes dead silent.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (meekly optimistic)
                        Hugs?

           Eric’s voice is so loud that Sam has to move the phone away 
           from his ear.

                                 ERIC
                        You’ve lost your mind!  And so have 
                        I for letting you do this!  This 
                        whole thing is a huge cluster fuck!  
                        I’m going to the hospital to find 
                        her right now.  I’m gonna end it 
                        myself, like I should have from day 
                        one!

                                 SAM
                        You can’t!

           Eric hangs up the phone.

           Sam pauses for the briefest of moments as he contemplates his 
           next move.

           In a blur, he leaps out of bed and throws on whatever clothes 
           he can find.  He’s out of the bedroom door in seconds flat.

           INT. SAM’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Eric rushes to get dressed just as fast as Sam did.  He puts 
           his pants on backwards, and almost trips over his own legs.

                                 ERIC
                        Ow!

           He’s seething mad.  He grabs a set of car keys off of Sam’s 
           counter and lunges for the door.
           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Eric runs like a bat out of hell towards Sam’s gardening 
           truck.

           He struggles to get the keys into the door and then tries to 
           get the rusted door to open.

           Click!

           Eric jumps inside and bangs his head on the door frame before 
           he gets in.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you fucking kidding me?!

           He jams the keys into the ignition.

           The engine struggles to turn over.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Start, you piece of trash!

           As if on command, the truck sputters to life.

           Eric pulls away from the curb and into traffic without 
           bothering to check his mirrors.

           Horns blare as he cuts off a line of cars.

           He speeds away leaving a trail of fuming exhaust.

           EXT. ERIC AND ABBY’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Sam races down the steps of Eric’s apartment building towards 
           Eric’s Prius parked on the curb.

           Sam pats his pockets down looking for the keys.

           His eyes look aimlessly as he tries to find the remote.  
           Finally, his eyes light up.

           He clicks the remote’s button and the car unlocks.  He dives 
           behind the wheel with the keys still in hand.

                                 SAM 
                        Where’s the ignition?

           His hands roam frantically across every surface of the car.

           Eyes squinted, he looks desperately for where to insert the 
           key.  He sees nothing until finally...
           START BUTTON

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Are you fucking kidding me?!

           He pushes the start button.  Its indicator light turns 
           yellow.  The radio starts.

           He jams his foot down and guns the accelerator.

           Nothing.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        What’s the hold up?  Go!

           The car looks as if it’s on.  Sam obviously hasn’t had any 
           experience driving a hybrid.

           He pushes buttons, turns dials, depresses pedals.  The 
           headlights FLASH, the horn HONKS, the windshield wipers MOVE.

           Frustrated, he slams on the breaks and pushes the start 
           button once more.

           The Prius rumbles to life.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        More efficient my ass!

           Sam looks to the navigation display and presses the pre-set 
           button marked ABBY’S WORK.

           He guns the Prius away from the curb without checking his 
           mirrors.

           HORNS blare as he cuts off traffic behind him.

           EXT. HOSPITAL - STAFF PARKING LOT - DAY - LATER

           Sam’s gardening truck turns into the parking lot just as 
           Eric’s Prius enters from across the way.

           The two cars slow as each driver spots the other.

           CUE MUSIC: “THE GOOD, THE BAD, & THE UGLY” - by Ennio
           Morricone

           The guys eye each other from across the parking lot.

           They’ve each noticed a single open space.

           The truck’s engine REVS.
           The Prius’ engine remains silent, but not from a lack of 
           trying.

           Eric slams his foot down on the accelerator.

           Sam slams his foot down on the accelerator.

           The two cars, one lacking horsepower, the other advanced in 
           age, roll lazily towards the open space.

           They each reach the space simultaneously.  Each twin manages 
           to get only a front portion of his vehicle into it.

           It’s a stalemate.  The brothers leap out of their cars.

           Eric manages to gain a few inches in front of Sam before Sam 
           jumps into the air and lands on Eric in a mighty tackle. 

                                 SAM/ERIC
                        What are you doing?!

           The guys lie on the asphalt breathing heavily.

                                 SAM
                        You can’t do this!

                                 ERIC
                        Do what?  Dump my own girlfriend?  
                        Why the hell not?!

                                 SAM
                        Eric, she loves me!

                                 ERIC
                        She loves me, you fucking idiot!

                                 SAM
                        She said you’ve changed the last 
                        few days!  That she loves what 
                        you’ve become.  Come on man, she 
                        loves you for what she sees in me.  

                                 ERIC
                        Nobody has ever seen anything in 
                        you!  You’re a drugged out, loser 
                        waste of human life.  You always
                        have been and you always will be!

                                 SAM
                        Fuck you.  Fuck you for saying 
                        that.  I’m tired of playing second 
                        fiddle!  Who the hell made you cock 
                        of the walk, you dick!
                                 ERIC
                        My college degree for starters!

                                 SAM
                        I knew you were gonna throw that up 
                        in my face!

                                 ERIC
                        This is just another example of 
                        your laziness.  You’re trying to 
                        skip all the hard work it takes to 
                        build a relationship and fast 
                        forward to the happy ending.  It 
                        doesn’t work that way!

           They step to each other.

                                 SAM
                        And you’d know all about that, 
                        wouldn’t you?  All you care about 
                        is work!

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t get pissed off at me because 
                        you have no future.

                                 SAM
                        Fuck your mother!

                                 ERIC
                        She’s your mother, too!

                                 SAM
                        Same difference!

                                 ERIC
                        That’s exactly what I’m talking 
                        about, you’re not smart enough to 
                        pull this off!

                                 SAM
                        Eric, I’m warning you.  Get the 
                        fuck out of my face before I deck 
                        you.

           Shit just got real.  The brothers look like they’re about to 
           come to blows.

           Suddenly, Eric’s iPhone CHIRPS.  He has an incoming text from 
           Abby.

           “Celebration dinner tonight @ Alessandro's w/ the fam bam - 
           6pm.  Sry couldn’t wait to tell! XOXO"
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        What was that?

                                 ERIC
                             (pocketing the phone)
                        None of your god-damned business, 
                        Second Place!

           Sam, loathing that label since childhood, hauls off and 
           shoves Eric into the gardening truck.

           Staring daggers of death into Sam, Eric busts out Sam’s 
           keyring and KEYS the shit out of the truck!

           Sam, too incensed to move, watches as Eric jumps into his 
           Prius and inexplicably gets the hybrid to PEEL out of the 
           parking lot.

           Calming down, Sam finger-combs his hair and heads into the 
           building.

           Before he gets out of the lot, he notices an EMPTY SPACE near 
           the front.

           It’s marked A. CARMICHAEL.

           Abby isn’t here.

           Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ERIC AND ABBY’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Sam pulls his truck up to the curb outside of Eric’s 
           building.  He parks and runs to the apartment hoping to find 
           Abby. 

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

                                 SAM
                        Ab?  Are you here?

           No answer.  He checks the living room and then the bathroom.

           The apartment is empty.

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Sam tries to calm down.  He looks at himself in the MIRROR.
                                 SAM
                        Now or never, big guy.  You have to 
                        come clean.

           Sam takes a deep breath.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Abby.  I’m not who you think I am.

           He slaps his forehead with his open palm in frustration.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Abby.  There’s something you should 
                        know.

           Again, he shakes his head.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Abby.  Eric forced me to trick you 
                        and I didn’t mean to, but now I 
                        love you and please don’t leave me.
                             (beat)
                        Okay, that’s the one. 

           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Sam walks back to the kitchen and, needing to relax, goes to 
           the fridge for a beer.

           He grabs one, pops the top, and then closes the fridge.  He 
           notices a NOTE stuck to the front of it with a “NUMBER ONE 
           NURSE” magnet.

           He reads it:

           “Stopped by for a change of clothes.  Already texted you, but 
           just double checking.  My parents are going to meet us there.  
           Remember, Alessandro’s at 6.  Can’t wait to celebrate!  So 
           excited!! XOXO”

           Worried, Sam checks his watch.

                                 SAM
                             (sotto)
                        Shit.  I’ll be there, babe.

           He looks down at his shabby outfit.  Not liking what he sees, 
           he tosses the beer in the sink and kicks off his flip flops 
           before bolting for Eric’s closet.
           INT. ERIC AND ABBY’S BEDROOM - CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Sam tears through Eric’s closet.  Items of clothing fly 
           through the air.

           Sam finds only WRINKLED DRESS SHIRTS.  He spots an IRON and 
           IRONING BOARD in the back of the closet and clumsily drags 
           both out.

           He does his best to iron the shirt and returns for a TIE.

           He grabs the first one he can find and throws it around his 
           neck ten different ways straining to get it on.

                                 SAM
                        You’ve seen him do it a thousand 
                        times.

           Sam fiddles hopelessly with the knot.

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Loop it, swoop it, then...presto!

           Sam’s eternal struggle is interrupted by SMOKE rising behind 
           him.  The shirt is on fire!

                                 SAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh man, I am fucked in the ass.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ALESSANDRO'S RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Eric paces just outside the restaurant.  Seemingly hesitant 
           over what he’s about to do, his eyes glaze over as he 
           pictures the worst.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DREAM SEQUENCE - EVENING

           Sam stands at a table laden with lobsters, suckling pigs, 
           etc.  He’s wearing an expensive tuxedo, complete with top hat 
           for some reason.

           Sam raises a champagne flute to the room.

                                 SAM
                        Friends, family.  Thank you for 
                        joining Abby and I on this oh so 
                        precious of nights.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        You’re presence here is the 
                        greatest wedding gift of all.  

           The crowd cheers.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I, Eric Scott, and not my sloppy, 
                        lazy brother Sam, pledge my eternal 
                        and undying love to my new bride 
                        Abby Carmichael!

           Sam vigorously pumps the hand of Abby’s DAD, also wearing a 
           fancy tux, in a manly handshake.

           Abby looks on and smiles through happy tears with her hands 
           clasped in front of her face.  Sam dips Abby’s MOM and plants 
           one on her face.  

           To the happy couple!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. ALESSANDRO'S RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Eric snaps back to reality.

                                 ERIC
                        No fucking way!!

           Just then, Abby and her family appear from around the corner.

           DENISE, Abby’s mother, 60’s, is a reserved, high-society 
           type.  She wears a pearl necklace and a gaudy broach on the 
           left lapel of her rigid Chanel suit.  

           ARTHUR, Abby’s father, also 60’s, is taller than Eric and 
           bald on top with a rim of Captain Picard hair.  He wears 
           ridiculously thick-framed black reading glasses and an old-
           man cardigan.

           Abby’s sister, HOLLY, early 30’s, pretty with brunette hair, 
           stands next to her husband, PETER, 30’s, a stock-broker, Ivy 
           League football type.  The guy has “douche” written all over 
           him.

                                 ABBY
                        Hey babe!

           She and Eric embrace; Abby gives him a quick kiss.
                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        I’m so excited!  I know its silly, 
                        but I feel like I haven’t seen you 
                        in days.
                             (beat)
                        Say hi to everyone.

           Abby indicates her family.

                                 ERIC
                        How are you, Arthur, Denise?

           Eric shakes Arthur’s hand and then gives Denise a polite kiss 
           on the cheek.

           Holly stands on her tip toes and wraps her arms around Eric 
           in an excited hug.

                                 HOLLY
                        I can’t believe you guys are 
                        getting married!  It’s about time!

           Peter doesn’t move to acknowledge Eric.  He stays where he 
           is.

                                 PETER
                        Congrats on ending your life, 
                        Scott.

                                 ERIC
                             (unsure)
                        Thanks, guys.

           Arthur extends a hand toward the restaurant’s front door.

                                 ARTHUR
                        They’re not gonna hold our 
                        reservation forever.

           Arthur leads the group into the restaurant.

           INT. ALESSANDRO'S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           The group steps through the door to the lobby.  It’s a classy 
           joint. The lighting is gentle, but not dark.

           Each table is topped with a tasteful FLOWER bouquet.  

           The place is packed.  WAITERS dart here and there pulling out 
           seats, pouring wine, lighting crème brûlées. 

           Arthur heads over to the MAITRE D’.
                                 ERIC 
                             (to Peter)
                        So, how have you been, Peter?

                                 PETER
                             (smarmy)
                        I’ve been great.  Never better, 
                        actually.  I’ve been able to make a 
                        killing in the worst economic times 
                        of our lives.  Bull market’s been 
                        my bitch.

                        What about you?  Still writing 
                        obituaries for a living?

                                 ERIC
                             (insulted)
                        Something like that.

                                 PETER
                        When was the last time we saw you?

                                 ERIC
                        Had to have been a couple years 
                        ago.

                                 PETER
                        When was it, Abby?  Two or three 
                        Christmases ago?  You remember, 
                        that loser brother of his ruining 
                        brunch?  Who knew mimosas could get 
                        you that drunk?

                                 HOLLY
                        Go easy, Peter.  He’s still Eric’s 
                        brother.

                                 DENISE
                        Shouldn’t we have invited him?

                                 ERIC
                             (quickly)
                        Oh, no...no.  He wouldn’t mind.  
                        Besides, tonight’s a couples’ thing 
                        right guys?

                                 DENISE
                        I guess you’re right.  

           Arthur returns and starts to lead the group away.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Come on guys, our table’s ready.
           Eric wraps his arm around Abby’s shoulder and escorts her 
           along.

                                 ERIC
                        Abby, I need to talk you about 
                        something.

                                 ABBY
                             (distracted)
                        Sure, babe.  After dinner?

           INT. ALLESANDRO’S RESTAURANT - DINNER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           The room is filled with the light romantic music of a string 
           quartet.  It’s a little piece of Italy.  

                                 ABBY
                        I’m telling you, Daddy.  Love at 
                        first sight.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Just like your mother and I.  When 
                        I saw her at the Junior Republicans 
                        meeting during Rush Week, I knew I 
                        had to have her.  

                                 ERIC
                        Should we order?

           Eric is in a hurry to wrap this up.

                                 HOLLY
                        Let’s get some appetizers!

                                 PETER
                        Do you really need an appetizer and
                        an entree?  We want to split the 
                        check, not your pants.

                                 ERIC
                             (interrupting)
                        Actually, guys, can we just skip to 
                        the main course?

                                 ABBY
                             (to Eric)
                        What’s wrong with you, Eric?  We’re 
                        having a nice time.

                                 ERIC
                             (whispering)
                        I know, but we have to talk.
                                 ABBY
                             (distracted)
                        Right after dinner, sweetie.

                                 WAITER
                        Can I get your drink orders, 
                        please?

                                 DENISE
                        Vodka tonic!

           Arthur looks a little embarrassed.

                                 ARTHUR
                        I’ll have an iced tea.

                                 PETER
                        I’ll have a Heineken.  My wife will 
                        have a water.

           The Waiter jots down their orders and looks to Abby.  She 
           places her hand on Eric’s.

                                 ABBY
                        Two Blue Moons.

           Eric does a double take.  Abby WINKS at him and then goes 
           back to the Waiter.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        With oranges, please.

           INT. ALLESANDRO’S RESTAURANT - SAME

           Sam bursts into the restaurant’s lobby. 

           He looks for Abby and her family.

           He spots the group at their table.  If he saw Eric he doesn’t 
           show it.

           The HOST moves to intercept Sam as he rushes toward the 
           family.

                                 HOST
                        Welcome to Alessandro's, can I help 
                        you, sir?

                                 SAM
                             (frazzled)
                        Um, yes.  My girlfriend and her 
                        parents have a reservation for 6.  
                        I’m a little a late.
                                 HOST
                        No problem, sir.  What’s the 
                        party’s last name?

                                 SAM
                        Abby...shit.

           Sam struggles to remember her last name.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        They’re right over there.  I see 
                        them.

           Sam points frantically.

                                 HOST
                             (puzzled)
                        Of course, sir.  You can join them.  
                        I’ll have a chair brought to you.

           Sam rushes toward the table.  He stops after a few paces and 
           spins around.

                                 SAM
                             (triumphant)
                        Carmichael!  Her last name is 
                        Carmichael.

           The Host smiles awkwardly.

           Sam continues towards Abby’s table.  He smoothes his clothes 
           and prepares to get back into character.

           After a few paces, Sam’s jaw drops.  He’s spotted Eric.  

           This. Is. Bad.

           Sam thinks quickly.  He suddenly ducks behind an approaching 
           Waiter’s dessert cart.

           The Waiter pushing the cart looks down at his crouching 
           interloper.

                                 WAITER
                        Can I help you, sir?

                                 SAM
                        Just keep pushing your cart, 
                        please.

           Sam crab-walks along side it and quickly scurries out of 
           view.

           The group’s Waiter arrives and begins to disperse everyone’s

           INT. ALESSANDRO’S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Sam is circling the restaurant.  He’s trying to stay out of 
           sight.

           He walks hunched over as he passes diners, waiters, tables, 
           and restaurant decorations.

           Finally, he stops.  He’s got a bird’s eye view of the table 
           from across the restaurant.  He’s positioned himself directly 
           in line with Eric.

           He takes a deep breath before he starts to frantically wave 
           his arms.  He’s trying desperately to get Eric’s attention 
           while avoiding the eyes of everyone else at the table.

                        write about?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not sure yet.  I’ve been a 
                        little distracted lately.

                                 PETER
                        Proposing will do that to you.  
                        What were you thinking, man?

                                 HOLLY
                        He was thinking about how much he 
                        loves his girlfriend.  I mean 
                        fiance!
                             (to Abby)
                        Sorry, Ab.

                                 ABBY
                        I’m not used to the word yet!

           Abby leans in and starts to converse with Holly.

           Eric tunes out and picks up his beer for another swig.  He 
           suddenly notices Sam frantically waving from across the room.

           He chokes on his beer.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                             (patting Eric’s back)
                        Babe, are you okay?

                                 ERIC
                             (coughing and sputtering)
                        Yeah, I’m fine.  I just...need to 
                        go to the bathroom.

                                 PETER
                        I’ll go with you.  I’ve gotta take 
                        a piss, too.

                                 ERIC
                        No! Um, you should wait here.  I’ve 
                        got to...you know.  Number 2.

           Denise dejectedly puts down her nearly empty glass.

                                 DENISE
                        Exactly what you want to hear 
                        before dinner.  
                             (beat)
                        Where’s that waiter with my double?
           Eric doesn’t give Peter a chance to join him.  He bolts up 
           from the table and power walks out of sight.

                                 ARTHUR
                        Ab, is everything alright with him?

           INT. ALLESANDRO’S RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Eric does a full circuit of the restaurant to make sure that 
           Abby and the rest of the group haven’t seen where he’s gone.

           Eric walks as fast as he can without running.  He looks 
           PISSED.

           Sam stands his ground.  The two brothers meet.  Eric grabs 
           Sam by the elbow and forcibly directs him to the restaurant’s 
           back hallway.

                                 ERIC/SAM
                        What’re are you doing here?

                                 ERIC/SAM (CONT'D)
                        Me?!

                                 ERIC/SAM (CONT'D)
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 SAM
                        I came to tell Abby the truth! 

                                 ERIC
                        I’m going to tell her the truth.

                                 SAM
                        Are you insane?  You’re going to 
                        tell her right in front of her 
                        parents? 

                                 ERIC
                        I’m doing what you should’ve done 
                        from the beginning.  I don’t know 
                        what I was thinking!

                                 SAM
                        Asshole!

           Eric starts to posture.  Things are boiling over.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m the asshole?!  All you had to 
                        do was dump her.  You went rogue!

           Eric shoves Sam.
                                 SAM
                        This was all your idea!  You don’t 
                        ask another guy to dump your 
                        girlfriend, you fucking pussy!

           Sam shoves Eric right back with both hands.  

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        Her whole family will see!  She’ll 
                        be humiliated!

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t want to upset her anymore 
                        than you do, but this has gone too 
                        far.

           Sam gets right up in Eric’s face.

                                 SAM 
                             (serious as hell)
                        You can’t do this to her.  

                                 ERIC
                        How did you think this was gonna
                        end?  You lied to me twice.  You 
                        had to know this was coming!

                                 SAM
                        Had to know what?  That you’d 
                        finally solve a relationship 
                        problem on your own?  You were too 
                        weak to do what needed to be done 
                        in the first place and now you 
                        suddenly have the balls?

           The guys stare each other down.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m going back to my table.  Get 
                        your lawn-mowing ass out of here.

           Sam PUNCHES Eric in the stomach.  He doubles over with a loud 
           GROAN.

                                 SAM
                        I won’t let you do this!

           Sam rushes past Eric.  He’s ready to confess to Abby.

           Eric recovers and stops Sam with a nut tap.  Sam cringes in 
           pain.
           Eric darts for the table before Sam tackles him around the 
           legs.   Eric goes down awkwardly, but continues dragging 
           himself into the main dining area.

           Each twin, still in obvious pain, tries to get past the 
           other.  It’s a foot race.  They no longer care who sees.

           The guys wail on each other. They each throw a hook at the 
           exact same time in a MIRROR IMAGE of each other.  

           Their fists CRACK into each other’s popping knuckles and 
           splitting skin.

           Glasses are spilled, plates are knocked to the floor, waiters 
           are shoved out of the way.

           The twins are a roiling hurricane of flying fists and kicking 
           feet.  They look like a pair of five year old boys fighting 
           over the last cookie.

           They stumble over to the LOBSTER TANK.  Eric gets the upper 
           hand, he PULLS Sam up to the surface of the tank.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                             (panicked)
                        Don’t do it, Eric!  You know we’re 
                        allergic to shellfi---

           Eric ignores him and DUNKS Sam’s head inside!

                                 ERIC
                        How’s the lobster, fucker?!

                        attitude, well, I mean he has, but 
                        he’s just been so different lately.

           INT. ALLESANDRO’S RESTAURANT - NEAR LOBSTER TANK

           Sam frees himself from the tank then shoves Eric away.  He’s 
           soaking wet.

                                 SAM
                             (sounding increasingly 
                              stuffed up)
                        I think thomethingth wrong with me!

           Sam’s NOSE and EYES are swelling shut.  His face looks bright 
           red!  

           Sam’s head blows up like a balloon. 

           Eric breaks for the table.  Sam CHASES after.

           INT. ALLESANDRO’S RESTAURANT, DINNER TABLE - INTERCUT

           Abby and her family hear the tell-tale signs of the twin 
           tornado tearing toward them through the restaurant. Sam has 
           caught Eric, and two GRAPPLE as they LURCH towards Abby’s 
           table.

           Women SCREAM, wine spills, the string quartet suddenly stops 
           playing.  

           Sam drags himself, and Eric, along with all of his might.  He 
           lands one wet hand on the table, pulling at the table cloth 
           as Eric heaves.

           Abby’s jaw drops.  Sam’s head looks like the fucking Elephant 
           Man!  Sam can barely see through clenched eyes!

                                 SAM
                             (slurring)
                        Abbbby!

                                 ABBY
                        Oh my God!

           The entire table is aghast at Sam’s sudden appearance and 
           disfigurement.  No one knows what the fuck is going on.

           Eric is still throwing punches left and right!

                                 DENISE
                             (cowering)
                        Stop it!  Stop it!  Someone will 
                        get hit in the face!

           As if on cue, Denise takes an accidental right hook to the 
           chin and falls in Arthur’s arms.
           Arthur moves to catch his wife.  Holly SCREAMS and hunkers 
           down next to Peter.  Everyone looks at Eric and Sam in 
           complete shock and disgust.  

           The room is dead silent.

           Sam and Eric realize what they’ve done.  The twins breathe 
           heavily. Platters RATTLE to a stop on the floor.

           Sam seizes the moment. 

                                 SAM
                        Abby! I love you!  

                                 ABBY
                        Sam?!

           Abby struggles to look at Sam’s swollen face.

                                 SAM 
                        Eric athked me to pretend to be him 
                        tho that he could dump you!

                                 ERIC
                        Traitor!  Shut up!  

           Eric wipes blood from his busted lip and WINCES at the mess 
           that is his brother’s face.

           Arthur still holds a groggy Denise.  She shakes off the punch 
           as she comes to.  Good thing for that double.

                                 ARTHUR
                        What does he mean, so he could dump 
                        her?

           Suddenly, Abby stands.  She’s fighting back tears.

                                 ABBY
                        What is he talking about, Eric? 

           Eric looks down, unable to meet Abby’s eyes.

                                 ERIC
                        I asked Sam to break up with you 
                        for me.  I asked him to pretend to 
                        be me so that he could do 
                        everything I couldn’t.

           Abby is stunned.

                                    SAM
                             (also ashamed)

                        Eric. 

           Abby can say no more.  The only word for her is CRUSHED.  She 
           steps to the twins and slaps each across the face.  She turns 
           and bolts for the door.

           Eric and Sam know they’ve fucked up.

           a face.  One of their radios plays audible police chatter.

                                 ERIC
                        Smooth, Sam.  Now look what you’ve 
                        done. 
           Each officer approaches a twin.  Hand cuffs are already out.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #1
                        Alright, tough guys.  Let’s go.

           They’re cuffed in a matter of seconds.

                                 POLICE OFFICER #2
                             (to Sam)
                        Jesus Christ, what happened to your 
                        face?

           The officers haul the guys out.

                                 PETER
                             (to a dumbstruck waiter)
                        Can I get another beer?

           EXT./INT. LOCAL JAIL - HOLDING CELL - LATER

           Eric and Sam sit next to each other on a bench in the crowded 
           holding cell.  They look like shit.  Bruised, bloodied, torn 
           sleeves, and ripped collars.

           They’re seated amongst a group of TRANSIENTS, THUGS, and 
           DRUNKS.

           Sam rubs his still-red, but less swollen face.

                                 SAM
                             (begrudgingly)
                        I promise to never make fun of you 
                        ever again for always carrying your 
                        EpiPen.

           An effeminate Latin STREET TOUGH approaches the guys.

                                 EFFEMINATE LATIN STREET TOUGH
                             (thick Latina accent)
                        Are joo guys twins?

           Sam and Eric make eye contact with the Street Tough.  They’re 
           each too tired to answer.

                                 EFFEMINATE LATIN STREET TOUGH (CONT'D)
                        What are you in for?

                                 SAM
                        I’m a prisoner of love.

           Eric shoots Sam a sidelong glance.
                                 EFFEMINATE LATIN STREET TOUGH
                        Oh, me too.  But, they can’t prove 
                        I was hookin’.
                             (yelling out of the cell)
                        They can’t prove nothing!

                                 ERIC
                             (unsure)
                        Then you’ll be fine.

                                 EFFEMINATE LATIN STREET TOUGH
                        So, who has the bigger-

           Sam stands up.

                                 SAM
                        Okay, Miss...ter,  I need to talk 
                        to my brother so if you could 
                        please give us a little moment.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not talking to you.

           Sam grabs Eric and tries to drag him to a free corner of the 
           cell.  

                                 SAM
                        Look at us.  What’re we doing? 
                        We’re brothers.  That should count 
                        for something.

                                 ERIC
                        That should count for everything.

           A giant THUG with tatoo tears glares at the brothers.

                                 TATOOED THUG
                        You fools been locked down for an 
                        hour and you already turnin’ homo.  
                        Don’t you know bitches ain’t shit
                        but hoes and tricks!

                                 SAM
                        Actually, that’s not entirely 
                        true...

           Tatooed Thug half-rises like he’s gonna throw down.  

                                 ERIC
                             (whispering frantically)
                        Shut up!  Haven’t you seen Oz?  
                        They cut off your sack and stuff it 
                        in your mouth!
                             (to Tatooed Thug)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Very sorry to disturb you, sir.  
                        You’re quite large. 

                                 TATOOED THUG
                             (sitting down)
                        Fuckin’ a.

                                 SAM 
                             (quietly to Eric)
                        She makes me wanna be a better man.  
                        You know, I’ve been thinking of 
                        taking some courses on Landscape 
                        Management; you know, expand my 
                        operation.  I can’t mow lawns 
                        forever.

                                 ERIC
                        You do have quite the green thumb.

           Sam looks around nervously.

                                 SAM
                        Don’t say that in here!

                                 ERIC
                        Relax.  Look at you.  Changing for 
                        a woman.

                                 SAM
                        It’s time, man.  I need to grow up.  
                        I was hoping to grow up with Abby.

                                 ERIC
                        You really do love her, don’t you?

           Sam nods sincerely.

           Eric looks guilty.  He knows he’s fucked up his brother’s 
           chance at true happiness.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        What do I do with Slutty Mary?

                                 SAM
                        Feel free to swoop on that.  Abby 
                        is the only girl for me.

                                 ERIC
                        Wow, you are serious.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, man.  I should never 
                        have brought you into this.
                                 SAM
                        I’m actually kind of glad it 
                        happened this way.  I mean, if you 
                        would’ve dumped her yourself then I 
                        never would’ve been able to get 
                        close to her.
                             (realizing)
                        But now I’ve gone and pissed it all 
                        away. 

           Silence.  The brothers have nothing more to say.

                                 POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Eric Scott.

                                 SAM/ERIC
                        Yes?

           An annoyed Eric lightly shoves Sam into the bars.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You have a visitor.

                                 JESS (O.S.)
                        They locked you two up together?!

           Eric looks toward the sound of the new voice.  He drags Sam 
           to the front of the cell.

                                 ERIC
                        Jess?!  What the hell are you doing 
                        here?

           Jess stands before the bars.  She takes in the two brothers.

                                 JESS
                        Wow, you really are twins.  Hi, 
                        Sam.  Nice to meet you.

           She tries to shake Sam’s hand through the bars.  Tatooed Thug 
           jumps up and tries to grab Jess’ hand.  She pulls back, but 
           she’s flattered.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                             (flirtatiously)
                        Sorry, big boy.  Look, don’t touch.

                                 SAM
                             (to Eric)
                        You know this chick?

                                 ERIC
                        She’s Abby’s best friend.
                                 JESS
                        I’m about to become your best 
                        friend, too.  I’m bailing you guys 
                        out.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you serious?!

                                 SAM
                        Why?

                                 JESS
                        Abby called and told me the whole 
                        thing.  She’s a mess.  You’re an 
                        asshole, Eric.

           Eric starts to reply.  Jess cuts him off with a wave of her 
           hand.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        If it weren’t for Sam I wouldn’t 
                        even be here.

           Sam perks up, but he’s still wary.

                                 SAM
                        What did I do?

                                 JESS
                        Abby told me about how you beat up 
                        your brother in the middle of the 
                        restaurant and declared your love 
                        for her in front of everyone.
                             (beat)
                        These last few days are the 
                        happiest I’ve ever seen her. 

           Eric and Sam are stunned.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        I would kill to have two men fight 
                        over me.

                                 INMATE (O.S.)
                        I’ve killed before.

           Eric and Sam inch closer to the bars.

                                 SAM
                             (excited)
                        So she’s not mad at me?
                                 JESS
                        No, she’s mad for sure.  You’re 
                        both gonna need to talk to her.  
                        Make this right.  Whether she 
                        realizes it or not right now, she 
                        has something really special in 
                        you, Sam, and you’re not gonna let 
                        her think otherwise.  Get out there 
                        and fix it. 

           Jess indicates Eric by mistake.  Sam raises his hand.

                                 SAM
                        Uh, Jess.  I’m Sam.

                                 JESS
                        Oh, right!
                             (beat)
                        By the way, what happened to your 
                        nose?

                                 SAM
                        Bad seafood.

           EXT./INT. ERIC AND ABBY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           Abby lies on her bed in the dark.  Her eyes are closed, but 
           she’s obviously awake.

           BUZZ.  BUZZ.  BUZZ.

           Her iPhone lights up.  The caller ID reads PRIVATE.

           Abby grabs the phone and considers it for a moment before 
           answering.

                                 ABBY
                        Hello.

                                 ERIC
                        Hey.

                                 ABBY
                        Why are you Private Calling me?

                                 ERIC
                        I didn’t think you’d pick up if you 
                        knew it was me.

                                 ABBY
                        Why, just because you made your 
                        brother dump me for you?
                                 ERIC
                        Look, I can explain everything.

                                 ABBY
                        You obviously don’t respect me.  
                        Why should I let you explain 
                        anything?  

                                 ERIC
                        Because you don’t deserve to be 
                        humiliated like that and there’s a 
                        few things I have to tell you.

                                 ABBY
                        Oh God, Eric what now?  Are you 
                        gonna tell me you’re gay? Because I 
                        don’t think I can handle any more 
                        surprises right now.

                                 ERIC
                        Just come downstairs to the 
                        playground.

                                 ABBY
                        Fine.

           EXT. ERIC’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           Abby makes her way gingerly through the dark towards the 
           playground.

           She finds Eric sitting on one of two swings hanging from the 
           old, rusty set. 

                                 ERIC
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 ABBY
                        I came for me.  Not for you.

                                 ERIC
                        Still.  Thanks anyway.

           Eric directs Abby to sit in the swing next to him.

                                 ABBY
                        So what do you need to say?

                                 ERIC
                        There’s a few things.  Please don’t 
                        get mad.

           She refuses to look at Eric while he talks.  
                                 ABBY
                        I don’t think I could be madder 
                        right now.

                                 ERIC
                        I hope you’re right.
                             (beat)
                        Anyway, look, we’re great together 
                        and I love being with you.

                                 ABBY
                             (eyes forward, unblinking)
                        But.

                                 ERIC
                        But.
                             (beat)
                        I can’t marry you.  All my life, 
                        I’ve been looked at as the perfect 
                        son, the perfect brother.  I’m just 
                        not ready to be the perfect 
                        husband.  Not when it’s finally 
                        time for me to focus on myself.  
                             (beat)
                        It’s too much.

           A tear rolls down Abby’s cheek.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        I’m just nowhere near ready for 
                        marriage.

                                 ABBY
                        Then why wouldn’t you just tell me 
                        that yourself?

                                 ERIC
                        I couldn’t.  I tried to, but I 
                        couldn’t get the words out.  You 
                        were putting me in a box I couldn’t 
                        fit in.
                             (beat)
                        I was afraid.  I needed Sam’s help. 

                                 ABBY
                        Afraid?  Am I that scary, Eric?
                        I can’t believe you actually asked 
                        him to do this.

           Still, Abby’s eyes look forward.

                                 ERIC
                        Abby, he only did it to protect 
                        you.
                                 ABBY
                        Protect me?  He impersonated you to 
                        protect me?

                                 ERIC
                        He knew I was being an asshole
                        better than I did.  He didn’t want 
                        you to get hurt.  He thought that 
                        if he could handle the breakup that 
                        he could at least leave you feeling 
                        good about yourself.

                                 ABBY
                        Way to make me feel good about 
                        myself.

                                 ERIC
                        He will, Abby.

           Finally, she looks at him.

                                 ABBY
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 ERIC
                        Abby.  
                             (beat)
                        He loves you.

           Abby snorts.

                                 ABBY
                        How could he?  We’ve never even 
                        dated.

                                 ERIC
                        He told me his time with you has 
                        been the best time of his life.  
                        And I believe him.

           Abby’s facade almost cracks, but she regains her composure.

                                 ABBY
                        How could you trick me like this?

                                 ERIC
                        I was weak.  I was a coward.  We 
                        should’ve just talked about this 
                        from the beginning.  Like we are 
                        now.  I just couldn’t do it.
                                 ABBY
                             (sarcastically)
                        Well, I hope this was easier for 
                        you.

                                 ERIC
                        It wasn’t, but Sam showed me you 
                        deserve better.  He loves you, 
                        Abby.  He might’ve done me the 
                        favor, but he’s paying the price.  
                        He begged me to let him come clean.  
                        He said you deserved the truth.  
                        And instead I went out and tried to 
                        ruin it for the both of you.

           Abby is speechless.

                                 ERIC (CONT'D)
                        Abby?

                                 ABBY
                        It’s crazy, Eric.  This last week 
                        with you really was the best of our 
                        relationship. You were finally 
                        ready to marry me, you were like a 
                        different person.
                             (sarcastic laugh)
                        Turns out you really were.

           Eric doesn’t have anything to say.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                             (oddly calm)
                        I think you should go.

           Eric approaches Abby.  Her face is lit by an overhanging 
           street lamp.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        Please, just go.

           Eric pauses for a second before leaving. He looks over his 
           shoulder.

                                 ERIC
                        I think you better talk to Sam.

           Abby stands alone under the light considering as Eric walks 
           away.
           EXT./INT. STARBUCKS - LATER

           Eric, drained from the events of the evening, walks into an 
           emptying Starbucks.  He finds a table in the back, sits down, 
           and cracks open his laptop.

           Bringing up his article, he begins typing furiously starting 
           with a new title.  From the top of the screen can be read:

           “BREAKING UP IS HARD TO DO” by Eric Scott

           The first words are glimpsed, “It was a very bold 
           experiment...”

                                                              FADE OUT:

           EXT. SAM’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - FRONT COURTYARD - THE NEXT 
           MORNING

           A very depressed Sam lazily mows the lawn in front of his 
           complex.  

           Sensing someone behind him, he cuts the motor and turns 
           around to see Abby standing there.  

                                 ABBY
                        Eric told me everything.

           He can’t meet her gaze.

                                 SAM
                             (looking down)
                        Did he tell you how I feel?

                                 ABBY
                        Maybe you should.

           Sam squares his shoulders and meets her look head on.

                                 SAM
                             (sincerely)
                        I never meant to hurt you, Abby.  
                        This was supposed to be a quick 
                        break-up.  Painless, like taking 
                        off a band-aid.  
                             (beat)
                        I never thought I’d fall for you.  

                                 ABBY
                        You really fell for me?
                                 SAM
                        Absolutely.  I didn’t even see it 
                        coming.  Honestly, I thought I’d 
                        never deserve a girl like you.  
                        Eric is the successful one, the 
                        hard working one, but now I know 
                        that he never truly appreciated 
                        what he had.

           Abby is moved by Sam’s revelation.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I agreed to help Eric dump you 
                        because he’s my brother and he 
                        begged me for help.  After that 
                        first night, our first date, I 
                        realized I needed you...

           He approaches her.  She lets him get closer.

                                 SAM (CONT'D)
                        I know it sounds crazy, Abby.  But 
                        I love you.  I know I can give you 
                        everything Eric did.  And more.

           She takes him in her arms.  He rests his head on her 
           shoulder, savoring the closeness.

                                 ABBY
                        Now it’s my turn to confess.

           Sam raises his head and looks at her not knowing what to 
           expect.

                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        I sensed little changes in Eric...  
                        And I liked them.  He, I mean you, 
                        God this is weird,  
                             (she laughs lightly)
                        you made me realize I didn’t like 
                        who I was.  I became so controlling 
                        with Eric.  He and I are too much 
                        alike.  I realize now I need a 
                        little conflict.  You’re a free 
                        spirit, Sam.  I love that about 
                        you.  And now, I love that about 
                        me, too.

           Sam’s eyes well up.  He starts to say something, but Abby 
           raises a finger to his lips.  He settles down and listens 
           intently.
                                 ABBY (CONT'D)
                        My time with you really has been 
                        the best part of my relationship 
                        with him.  The way you made me 
                        dinner, the way you look at me.   
                        The way you fought for me...

           Abby lets the words hang in the air as she tears up, too.

                                 SAM
                        I’ll always fight for you.  Just 
                        give me the chance, Abby.  I love 
                        you.

                                 ABBY
                             (almost cracking)
                        I love you, too, Sam.

           They embrace passionately, sharing the kiss of all kisses.  

           Right there on the half-finished lawn.  When they pull apart:

                                 ABBY (CONT’D)
                        So where are you taking me for our 
                        first date?

                                                              FADE OUT:

           EXT./INT. YARDHOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Various Daily Shopper employees gather here after work.  

           A giant banner reads:

           CONGRATS MARY!!

           Eric and Kingshuk hang by the impromptu dance floor where 
           Jess and Jean-Paul are freaking like they’re in a Nelly
           video.

                                 ERIC
                             (still surprised)
                        Did you even know Mary was in the 
                        running for the article?

                                 KINGSHUK
                        I knew she was running through my 
                        mind.

           Bullock slides in front of the guys with two beers.  He hands 
           one to Eric.  Kingshuk gets the hint and walks away.
                                 BULLOCK

                             (embarrassed)
                        I actually don’t know who they are.

           Bullock raises an eyebrow.  Eric tries to change the subject.

                             (resigned)
                        Look, I just wanted to say thanks 
                        for giving me a chance even if you 
                        went with Mary. 

                                 BULLOCK
                        What can I say, Scott? She 
                        surprised everybody.  She has a 
                        Masters in English from Brown and a 
                        very good way with words.

                                 ERIC
                        She’s obviously a talented woman.

                        I’ll have my desk packed up by 
                        Friday.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Not so fast.  You know, Scott, you 
                        still wrote a great article. 
                             (beat)
                        We’re thinking of adding a 
                        permanent relationship advice 
                        column.  Would you be interested?

                                 ERIC
                        Definitely!

           ON SAM AND ABBY as they enter the place hand in hand.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I’m sort of an expert now.

                                 BULLOCK
                        Here, here.

           They CLINK mugs before we find Kingshuk with Slutty Mary.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        Hey Mary. I just wanted to 
                        congratulate you on the column.  
                        You really deserve it.
                                 SLUTTY MARY
                             (rubbing Kingshuk’s arm)
                        Thank you so much, Kingshuk. That 
                        means a lot. I’m so excited!

           Kingshuk’s eyes are on Mary’s hand as she strokes his 
           “bicep”; he swallows hard.

                                 KINGSHUK
                        And, Mary, there’s something else I 
                        need to tell you.

           Mary puts a finger to Kingshuk’s mouth.

                                 SLUTTY MARY
                        No, there’s something I need to 
                        tell you first.
                             (her eyes drop to the 
                              floor nervously)
                        And I think now is the perfect 
                        time.

           Kingshuk cocks his head in bewilderment.

                                 SLUTTY MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had a crush on you since the 
                        day I met you and, well---

           Kingshuk wastes no time in planting a SLOPPY KISS on her 
           waiting lips; she reciprocates in earnest.

           Sam and Abby, still holding hands, wave to Eric before 
           heading over to the BARTENDER; Abby takes the lead.

                                 BARTENDER
                        What can I get you two?

           She smiles over her shoulder at Sam.

                                 ABBY
                        Two Blue Moons, please.
