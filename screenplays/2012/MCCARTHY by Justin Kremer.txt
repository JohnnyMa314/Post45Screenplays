                                       FADE IN:

           CLOSE on a pair of piercing blue eyes, cold. Shifting.

           Their owner - SENATOR JOSEPH MCCARTHY, 42. 

           He gazes into the distance, the noise of A DEBATE rattling 
           off in the distance. 

           He’s disinterested, weary.

           PULL BACK SLOWLY to reveal the enormity of...

           INT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING, SENATE FLOOR- DAY - 1950

           ...where the Senator sits alongside dozens of colleagues. 
           Anonymous.

           CHATTER fills the air. It leads us to --

           INT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING, LOBBY- DAY

           Bustling. A throng of reporters crowd around SENATOR WHERRY, 
           a strong, iron jawed man. 

           He entertains their queries casually. Accustomed to this type 
           of attention.

           McCarthy gazes at the spectacle. Envious.

                                       CUT TO:

           A lonely glass of bourbon. An ICE CUBE drops into it 
           violently.

           INT. APARTMENT- NIGHT

           The steadying voice of a NEWSCASTER blares from the 
           television.

           Joe sits on a couch, bourbon in hand. At his side -- a plate 
           with a half eaten sandwich.

           On the TELEVISION - 

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        ...and was met with resistance from 
                        President Truman.

           A pause...the broadcaster shifting gears. Joe rises, walks to 
           the television.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        The House Committee on un-American 
                        Activities will resume its work on 
                        Monday. 

           He holds the channel dial, prepared to change it. Holds for a 
           moment.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        This will mark the first session of 
                        the year which will mark what 
                        Chairman Wood is calling “our most 
                        important work yet.”

           Back to the TV -

           STOCK FOOTAGE OF CHAIRMAN WOOD, presiding over a hearing. 
           He’s animated, motions angrily at a witness.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        We don’t have anything.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- DAY

           The room is dark, blinds closed. Joe leans against a 
           makeshift bar adjacent to his desk.

           Across from him is DON SURINE, mid 30s, a friend first and 
           colleague second. Generally optimistic.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Immigration.

                                 DON
                        Without the Puerto Ricans, 
                        Milwaukee might be a ghost town.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What about gun control?

                                 DON
                        Morse beat you to that one.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s left? What’s out there?

                                 DON
                        We don’t need “an issue”. We’re 
                        doing fine.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Fine?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        Yeah, fine. What’s wrong with fine?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Fine gets us unseated in eighteen 
                        months. Fine doesn’t get us out 
                        there.

                                 DON
                        Out there...?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        On the radio, on television.

                                 DON
                        We’ll get there. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        When?

           A brief silence that serves as an answer to Joe’s question.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        What if we reached out to Wood? 
                        Tried to get a seat on his 
                        committee.

                                 DON
                        We’d have to take a number and wait 
                        in line.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They love him.

                                 DON
                        And they’ll love you. In time.

           Joe shakes his head, discouraged.

           INT. HUAC HEARING- DAY

           A spectacle. The room is packed to the brim. Joe sits amongst 
           a group of interested spectators. The buzz in the crowd is 
           palpable.

           CONGRESSMAN WOOD reigns above the hearing. He’s addressing a 
           SUSPECT, a nervous looking man in his late 20’s.

                                 WOOD
                        Are you a threat to this country?

           The suspect is silent, humiliated.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 WOOD (CONT’D)
                        This committee demands an answer.

           ON MCCARTHY - watching carefully.

                                       CUT TO:

           A prestigious GOLD PLATED LOGO... 

           Georgia. “The Empire State of the South”. We’re in...

           INT. CONGRESSMAN WOOD’S OFFICE- DAY

           The pictures that adorn the office reflect a shrine to the 
           Congressman’s state...and to the Congressman himself.

           The Georgian plains. Wood with President Truman. 

           The campus of UGA. Wood with Sinatra.

           Oh, and there’s MARLENE, late 50’s, hunched over her desk.

           Across from her sits DANIEL, a fresh faced 23 year old with 
           patience that would confound Confucious.

           Joe approaches the desk.

                                 MARLENE
                        Name.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Joe McCarthy.

           Marlene flips through an appointment book.

                                 MARLENE
                        I don’t see your name, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I saw the Chairman this morning. He 
                        told me...

                                 MARLENE
                        There’s nothing here. You can wait 
                        if you’d like.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Check again. Senator Joe McCarthy.

           This has no effect on Marlene.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Just ask Wood. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MARLENE
                        Congressman Wood is on a call at 
                        the moment.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ll wait.

           Joe reluctantly takes a seat adjacent to Daniel.

                                 DANIEL
                        Take a number, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’ve been waiting?

                                 DANIEL
                        Yes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Ah.

           A fleeting silence.

                                 DANIEL
                        17 days.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Excuse me?

                                 DANIEL
                        That’s how long it’s been.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And you haven’t --

                                 DANIEL
                        No.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I hope you didn’t have an 
                        appointment.

           Daniel shakes his head.

           Joe surveys him with curiosity; notices a paper in his hand.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        What’s that?

           Daniel hands it over - it’s his resume...sterling, of course.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Four years at Marquette? 
                        Impressive. You’re familiar with 
                        Senator Wood’s work?

                                 DANIEL
                        I wouldn’t say familiar.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What would you say?

                                 DANIEL
                        Name a date.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        June 10th.

           The wheels are turning in Daniel’s head.

                                 DANIEL
                        Monday June 13th. Docket number 
                        801306-004. Interrogation of Albert 
                        Mills and Donna Lattimer.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Impressive. 

                                 DANIEL
                  (staring at Wood’s office)
                        You think he’ll say so?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’d hope so.
                  (pause)
                        Why Wood?

                                 DANIEL
                        He’s not afraid.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I suppose not.

           Joe leans in to Daniel, covertly --

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        What do you say you let me pick 
                        your brain over a drink. I’m 
                        buying.

                                 DANIEL
                        No thanks. I have a good feeling 
                        about today.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        You think he’ll see you? 

                                 DANIEL
                        I can’t. Sorry.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        One drink and I’ll make sure he 
                        gets your resume.

                                 DANIEL
                        Doesn’t exactly seem like he’s 
                        dying to meet with you either. With 
                        all due respect.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Maybe not, but we’ve got a caucus 
                        on Thursday. I’ll make sure he gets 
                        it then.

           ON DANIEL -- slowly bending...

                                 DANIEL (V.O.)
                        That’s not the problem.

           INT. ANONYMOUS BAR- DAY

           Daniel, a few drinks deep, is animated. McCarthy, on the 
           other hand, seems much less enthused. The conversation hasn’t 
           been very productive.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I know, it’s Hiss. Listen, I should 
                        be heading out.

                                 DANIEL
                        There’s one place he hasn’t cleaned 
                        up. 

           Joe rises, takes his coat in hand. He flips through his 
           wallet for cash.

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s how I’ll pitch it - I know 
                        what’s next.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And what might that be?

           Joe throws a ten dollar bill on the table. Begins to put his 
           coat on.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DANIEL
                        The State Department.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Oh yeah?

                                 DANIEL
                        57 of them. Still working.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How’d you come up that one?

                                 DANIEL
                        I didn’t come up with anything. The 
                        FBI did it for me.

           Joe stops...slowly takes his seat.

           INT. READING ROOM, LIBRARY OF CONGRESS- NIGHT

           Eerily quiet. Less than a dozen readers populate the room. 
           Among them, Joe, who flips through a large file rabidly.

           He turns page after page, searching for something. No luck.

           A moment passes. More pages turned. 

           And finally...Joe stops. Moves his face closer to the page. 
           Concern washes over his face. It’s fleeting. 

           He keeps reading, can’t contain his smile.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           Joe scribbles on a legal pad. Drops his pen and rises from 
           his seat.

           He moves to the bar, pours himself a drink. He raises it, 
           clinks his glass against an empty one that rests in front of 
           him.

           A toast of sorts.

           He moves back to his desk. Picks up the phone. Dials.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did I wake you?

           INT. BEDROOM- NIGHT

           Don sits at the edge of the bed, pops a cigarette in his 
           mouth.

           At his side, a restless BRUNETTE. She looks at him, 
           incredulous.

                                 DON
                        Yeah.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 DON
                        No you’re not. What’s going on?

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        I need you to come in.

           Don rises, grabs a shirt from his closet. Begins to button 
           it.

                                 DON
                        What’s wrong?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ve got it.

                                 DON
                        Got what?

                                 DON
                        Give me twenty.

           Don hangs up the phone. The brunette shakes her head, far 
           from happy. He pretends to not notice.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        Where do we go next?

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- SUNRISE

           Don peruses an appointment book. Joe paces around the office, 
           very excitable.

                                 DON
                        West Virginia. Should draw two

                                 DON
                        The locals. I can try and pull some 
                        strings with Lott. Maybe get 
                        Reuters down there. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Good. Who else?

                                 DON
                        That’s all I’ve got.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Call in some favors.

                                 DON
                        Not many favors left.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Better than none.

           A roll of the eyes from Don. Joe doesn’t understand how 
           difficult this is.

                                 DON
                        Are you sure this is the one?

           confident enough.

           A banner. Large, bland...as if little care has been placed

           It hangs in the...

           INT. WHEELING TOWN HALL- DAY

           A room set up for three hundred that probably seats a little 
           more than half of that at the moment.

           Joe stands at the podium, clears his throat. A palpable 
           silence.

           He glances to the back of the room. Don stands next to a 
           reporter. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Ladies and gentlemen, tonight as we 
                        celebrate the one hundred forty-
                        first birthday of one of the 
                        greatest men in American history, I 
                        would like to be able to talk about 
                        what a glorious day today is in the 
                        history of the world. I would like 
                        to be able to speak of peace and of 
                        world-wide disarmament. These would 
                        be truly appropriate things to be 
                        able to mention as we celebrate the 
                        birthday of Abraham Lincoln. It 
                        saddens me to say that I cannot do 
                        so. 

           McCarthy examines the room...nothing. Don and the reporter 
           exchange words.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        This is not a period of peace. This 
                        is a time of “the cold war.” This 
                        is a time when all the world is 
                        split into two vast, increasingly 
                        hostile armed camps–a time of a 
                        great armament race. Six years ago, 
                        we outnumbered the Soviets 9 to 1. 
                        Today, it is 8 to 5 in their favor.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        This indicates the swiftness of the 
                        tempo of Communist victories and 
                        American defeats in the cold war. 
                        As one of our outstanding 
                        historical figures once said, “When 
                        a great democracy is destroyed, it 
                        will not be from enemies from 
                        without, but rather because of 
                        enemies from within.”

           And now interest is beginning to pique. What is he talking 
           about?

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        The reason why we find ourselves in 
                        a position of impotency is not 
                        because our powerful enemy has sent 
                        men to invade our shores...but 
                        rather because of the traitorous 
                        actions of those who have been 
                        treated so well by this Nation. 
                        Those that have betrayed us have 
                        had all the benefits that this 
                        nation has to offer...the finest 
                        homes and the finest education. The 
                        finest jobs in government. This is 
                        glaringly true in the State 
                        Department. There the bright young 
                        men who are born with silver spoons 
                        in their mouths are the ones who 
                        have been most traitorous.

           McCarthy pauses for dramatic effect. He’s commanding the 
           crowds attention and he knows it.

           He picks a piece of paper off of the podium and waves it 
           defiantly in the air.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I have here in my hand a list of 
                        57...a list of names that were made 
                        known to the Secretary of State as 
                        being members of the Communist 
                        Party and who nevertheless are 
                        still working and shaping policy in 
                        the State Department.

                        205 names -- and it is my mission 
                        to root each and every one of them 
                        out. This will not stand. 

           An eruption of applause. Joe savors it, looks up to the 
           rafters.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        It cannot.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM- NIGHT

           Joe unbuttons his dress shirt, perspiration stains under the 
           armpits. 

           A DISTANT RUMBLING. Joe looks to the closed door, puzzled. 
           The noise gets LOUDER. A mixture of many voices. 

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        The Senator can only take one 
                        question each, understood?

           Joe quickly throws on a new shirt, buttons it. He wipes his 
           forehead. Heads to the door. Opens it.

           INT. HALLWAY- CONTINOUS

           Over a dozen reporters crammed into this space, muscling to 
           get close to McCarthy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Good evening folks.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- DAY

           Joe gazes at his subordinates through his window shade. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           There’s an ever growing bullpen of desks. Things are frantic, 
           incredibly busy. Workers scramble around. Phones ring 
           constantly.

           He smiles. Something seems to have caught his eye.

           He watches a WOMAN unpacking contents from a brown box. She’s 
           moving in. This is JEAN KERR, 28. She has Grace Kelly’s looks 
           and Joe’s ambition.

           Joe exits the frame. We remain in the room as Joe approaches 
           Jean, introduces himself with a smile.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. THE OFFICE- LATER

           It’s late. Tranquil. Only a few left burning the midnight 
           oil. Jean types busily at her desk. She removes a page from 
           her typewriter.

           A thick stack of papers as they SLAM onto a desk.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe surveys the stack, amused. His gaze shifts to Jean, arms 
           folded.

                                 MCCARTHY

                        supposed to be protect.”

           Jean nods.

                        Did Don ask you to write this up?

           McCarthy smiles, thumbs through a myriad of pages.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You wrote all of this?

                                 JEAN
                        Is that surprising?

                        It’s a lot of writing. Case

                        You’re young...attractive. You

                                 JEAN
                        I don’t like to dance.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        A woman after my heart.

           Ignoring the personal talk...

                                 JEAN
                        So you’ll read it then.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Of course. I assume you’re not the 
                        General’s biggest fan.

                                 JEAN
                        He’s a fool.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Elaborate.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 JEAN
                        He’s too preoccupied with Berlin to 
                        worry about our security.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He should have taken action.

                                 JEAN
                        He’s not a child. There’s no excuse 
                        for acting so passively.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        No there is not.

           McCarthy surveys Jean’s hand. Her ring finger is discolored, 
           yet there’s no ring on it.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Forget your ring today?

                                 JEAN
                        No ring.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        But you wore one recently.

           Jean looks at her finger, rubs it.

                                 JEAN
                        Try to dull the mark every day in 
                        the shower. No luck.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’ll fade. Give it time.

                                 JEAN
                        I’ve given time. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I see. 
                  (a beat)
                        So what did he do wrong?

                                 JEAN
                        Marshall? Or my fiancee?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Either.

                                 JEAN
                        Long term engagement. Couldn’t take 
                        the last step.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        He should have taken action.

           Jean’s lips curl into a smile.

           INT. BEDROOM- NIGHT

           Darkness. The silence is shattered. The SHRILL RING of a 
           telephone.

           Another ring. The room is flooded with light.

           Joe picks up the phone. At his side, JEAN. Half asleep.

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Did I wake you?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Yeah.

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Sorry about that.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Uh huh. What’s going on?

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Have something to tell you.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Too late for good news.

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        No. It’s not.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What is it?

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Joe Kennedy. It seems he’s taken an 
                        interest in you. Dinner. Saturday 
                        night. Told him you were bringing 
                        Jean.

           Joe smiles. Jean squints at him, curious.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Okay.

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Wipe that smile off your face. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Yeah, yeah.

           He hangs up the phone.

                                 JEAN
                        What was that?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You ever been to Massachusetts?

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           Darkness. Sound asleep.

           We hear the CRACK of a ball flying off of a baseball bat -- 
           followed by a barrage of footsteps.

           The WAIL of a child. Giddy, excited.

           LAUGHTER.

                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD- SUNSET

           McCarthy, shirt covered in dirt, holds a baseball glove at 
           his side.

           He looks very awkward as he trails behind two athletic and 
           striking young men -- JOHN and BOBBY KENNEDY.

           A number of others follow them, ages range across the 
           spectrum. There are six year olds and sixty years olds. This 
           is a family event.

           They exit the field and head toward a beautiful Victorian in 
           the distance.

           John, smiling, slaps Bobby on the back. The two laugh; we’ve 
           not privy to the joke.

           McCarthy watches them closely. 

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        Bless us, oh Lord, and these thy 
                        gifts...

           INT. DINING ROOM- NIGHT

           JOE KENNEDY leads the family, numbering nearly a dozen, in 
           grace. All heads bowed.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy and Jean follow suit.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        ...which we are about to receive 
                        from thy bounty. Through Christ, 
                        our Lord. Amen.

           After a lingering moment of silence, the family begins to 
           pile food onto their plates.

           Joe and Jean, the outsiders, wait patiently. Wait until the 
           family is done serving themselves...then dig in.

           INT. DEN- NIGHT

           McCarthy sits across from Joe Kennedy. He looks to an 
           adjacent party room. Jean’s socializing, all smiles.

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        I suppose you’ve asked yourself why 
                        you’re here maybe two, three 
                        hundred times.

                                 MCCARTHY

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        Close enough.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Very.

           A fleeting awkward moment.

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        Friends are a valuable commodity.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Of course.

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        I think we should be friends.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’d like that. That’s not a 
                        problem...?

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        You’re a good, Irish-Catholic kid. 
                        There’s not many of us in the 
                        business. Gotta stick together, 
                        right?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Kennedy removes an envelope from his jacket pocket. Slides it 
           across the table to McCarthy. He opens it.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        A token of friendship. 

           McCarthy sips on a drink, tries to contain his surprise. 
           Plays it cool.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s a very generous gesture.

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        I can be more generous.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I wouldn’t ask you to be.

                                 JOE KENNEDY
                        You don’t have to. But if you were 
                        to ever consider making a run at 
                        it, friends support one another. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And if there’s anything I can to 
                        support you...

           Joe nudges his head in Bobby’s direction. Bobby’s chatting 
           with a guest amiably. The charm is visible.

           McCarthy gives him a once over. 

           EXT. CAR- NIGHT

           Joe speeds down an empty New England road. Nothing but the 
           HUM of the engine. Tranquil.

                                 JEAN
                        He said “making a run at it”?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He did.

                                 JEAN
                        You’re so calm. Unusual.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s not like I won the nomination.

                                 JEAN
                        Baby steps.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Fine. I almost spit up my drink.

                                 JEAN
                        I knew it. You were probably 
                        jumping for joy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Eisenhower likes to address us in 
                        football metaphors. Last month’s 
                        little lesson was “when you score, 
                        act like you’ve been there before”.

                                 JEAN
                        And?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I figured I’d try it.

                                 JEAN
                        Keep your composure. Play it cool.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Doesn’t suit me.

                                 JEAN
                        Why’s that?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I just wanted to dance in the end 
                        zone.

           A brief pause.

                                 JEAN
                        I wonder if it’s ever happened 
                        before.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s that?

                                 JEAN
                        Do you think Wilson, Harding, and 
                        Coolidge ever played a game of 
                        softball together?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I doubt Coolidge picked up anything 
                        that wasn’t a tennis racket.

           Jean smiles.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 JEAN
                        You know what I mean.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Which one am I?

                                 JEAN
                        Does it matter? You’re Wilson. 
                        You’re Harding. You’re Coolidge. 
                        You’re whoever.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Whoever? That sounds appealing.

                                 JEAN
                        It’s just strange. In twenty years, 
                        I could have had dinner with three -
                        -

               MCCARTHY
                                    JEAN
           -- drunken Irishmen.
                            Presidents.

           Joe flashes a smile at her. He turns the radio on, pretends 
           he’s not thinking about what she just said. 

           A cheery pop song BLARES from the speakers. They drive on. 

           EXT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING- MORNING

           The sun peaks over the horizon as suits of all kinds head up 
           the steps.

           INT. THE OFFICE- MORNING

           Staffers work busily, field calls and type reports. 

           Jean’s desk is chaotic; full of papers. Hunched over her desk 
           is the fresh faced Bobby Kennedy. The pair converse 
           inaudibly.

           Joe passes Jean’s desk, smiles at her. She nods, fakes 
           cordiality. He plays along.

                                 JEAN
                        Mr. McCarthy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Morning. Welcome to the team, Mr. 
                        Kennedy.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Glad to be here, sir.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- MORNING

           McCarthy is at his desk, door open. Don enters and throws a 
           newspaper down at his side.

           Its headline-

           “BLACKBALLED STAR RAY HUDSON KILLS HIMSELF”. 

           There’s a picture of Ray. He’s in his mid 30’s, classically 
           handsome. McCarthy glances at the paper with curiosity.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Guess he saw his last movie.   

                                 DON
                        Press is looking for a statement. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ll be out soon.

           EXT. SENATE HALLWAY- DAY

           A rabid group of reporters walk rapidly alongside McCarthy. 
           They attempt to both keep up with him and note every word he 
           utters. This proves to be a difficult task.

           REPORTERS 1 and 2, the most persistent of the bunch, butt in 
           with questions.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        His death is certainly unfortunate. 
                        That being said, his record of 
                        membership with the IWW is clear. 

                                 REPORTER 1
                        And what about the rally Sunday, 
                        are you prepared?

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Have you spoken to Eisenhower?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        No, I haven’t had the pleasure of 
                        speaking to Dwight but I am more 
                        than prepared for the occasion.

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Any hint of what you’ll say?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                  (smiles)
                        That’s private fellas. Have a good 
                        day.

           -- And with that, McCarthy strides past them and exits the 
           building through a pair of double doors, leaving the 
           reporters winded.

           EXT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, WISCONSIN- DAY

           A beautiful two story Victorian with acres of land 
           surrounding it. It’s complete with a porch and swing. 

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- DAY

           McCarthy sits comfortably in a chair. He attempts to complete 
           the day’s crossword puzzle. Appears to be struggling. 

           There’s a lot of blanks on the page. He continues to stare 
           intently at it- determined to complete it.

           The RADIO booms in the background; white noise to Joe until a 
           NEWSCASTER snaps him to attention...

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        More grim news from Korea today as 
                        American air support has failed the 
                        deter the movement of forces just 
                        west of Chorwon. Casualties are 
                        expected to number --

           He shakes his head weakly in disgust, flips the radio off. 
           Returns to his crossword puzzle.

           INT. KITCHEN- AFTERNOON

           A small pillar of smoke billows from a boiling pot. Jean 
           stands in front of it, stirs. 

           Joe sits a few feet away at the table, flipping through the 
           day’s newspaper. 

           A KNOCK on the door. Joe rises and heads for it.

           From the kitchen, we hear the CREAK of the door opening. 
           Voices in the other room.

           Joe enters again, now with Don at his side.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        How ya doin, Jean?

           He gives her a kiss on the cheek. 

           The men file through the kitchen; enter the backyard through 
           a screen door in an adjacent room. 

           Through a window directly above the stove, Jean watches them 
           outside as they light a pair of cigars. 

           She turns off the stove. Exits the frame.

           A moment later, she joins the two in the backyard.

           EXT. BACKYARD- SAME

           Don and Joe sit on the deck comfortably, puffing away on 
           their Cubans.

                                 DON
                        Eisenhower wants to meet before the 
                        speech.

                                 JEAN
                        Are we sure that’s a good idea?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Fine by me. What’s the worst that 
                        could happen? 

           Don shakes his head as if to say- “I guess”.

                                 DON
                        Already told his camp he doesn’t 
                        want to be photographed with you.

                                 JEAN
                        He’s insufferable.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Toss the intro you’ve written. I’ll 
                        prepare something myself.

           Joe puffs on the cigar, inhales deeply.

           EXT. HIGHWAY- MORNING

           A nondescript three car caravan speeds down the empty 
           highway. The vehicles maintain a close proximity to one 
           another.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. CAR- MOMENTS LATER

           McCarthy in the backseat. He dabs his forehead with a 
           handkerchief. Not nervous but certainly not at ease.

           EXT. HOTEL- MOMENTS LATER

           A towering, elaborate complex filled with security at every 
           step. The caravan comes to a stop.

           Joe and Don exit the car. Walk toward the entrance 
           purposefully.

           A SECURITY GUARD, clipboard in hand, blocks the door.

                                 DON
                        Senator McCarthy here to see 
                        Senator Eisenhower. 
                  (glances at his watch)
                        Have an appointment in five 
                        minutes.

           The guard nods, looks at the clipboard for a long moment.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m going to have to search you 
                        before you enter the hotel.

           Joe laughs. Looks toward the top floor of the hotel.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He tell you to do this?

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Just protocol, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Protocol...

           The guard begins to frisk McCarthy; it’s a bit of an 
           embarrassing sight. He finds nothing.

           Joe passes the security guard and enter the hotel.

           INT. PENTHOUSE- CONTINUOUS

           DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER, mid 50’s, stands with his back toward 
           McCarthy. He peers out a window with a beautiful landscape of 
           Green Bay. It overlooks nearly the entire city.

           A television BLARES -- on it, a football game. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy inches toward Eisenhower; without turning around --

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Sit down.

           McCarthy looks to his left; there’s an empty chair waiting 
           for him at a table. He sits.

           Eisenhower turns around, looks at McCarthy with an obvious 
           taste of reprehension. 

           An attempt to break the silence --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Good to see you, Dwight.

           Eisenhower takes a seat across from McCarthy.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You’re going to listen to what I 
                        have to say and keep your mouth 
                        shut until I’m finished. I want to 
                        reach an understanding. Is that 
                        clear?

           McCarthy smirks, unable to contain himself. Eisenhower waits 
           for a response. A moment passes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Go on.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        I’m not going to stand for your 
                        bullshit here or anywhere else. I 
                        don’t like your methods and I’m 
                        going to tell the people I disagree 
                        with you today.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        If you say that, you’ll be booed.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        I’ve been booed before and being 
                        booed doesn’t bother me.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Do what you want.

           Another uncomfortable silence.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You know where I spent Saturday 
                        night?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        I don’t know, an NRA convention?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You don’t follow the news?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I do.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        There were reports.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Reports...of your night?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Yes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I guess I tuned out.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        George Marshall’s home. That’s 
                        where I was.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Congratulations.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Your remarks about him have been --

               MCCARTHY
                                  EISENHOWER
           Accurate.
                            Tasteless.

                                 EISENHOWER (CONT'D)
                        They’ve hurt the family.

                                 MCCARTHY 
                        I guess truth hurts.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You’re going to apologize. I’ve 
                        arranged for some flowers to be 
                        sent to his home. Katherine will 
                        appreciate the gesture.

           Eisenhower looks to the football game. Observes a play. 

                                 EISENHOWER (CONT’D)
                        You know when I was a tailback at 
                        West Point, I never could beat the 
                        linemen. The linebackers and 
                        safeties -- the smaller guys -- 
                        they were easy to get past. 
                                 (MORE)

                                 EISENHOWER (CONT’D)
                        Once I stood in the face of a two 
                        hundred twenty five pound tackle, I 
                        was finished. Went straight to the 
                        ground without fail. A few years 
                        after I graduated, I watched some 
                        old film and realized why. Every 
                        time one of those linemen charged 
                        at me, I slowed down for a split 
                        second. I was terrified of being 
                        hit. Of being taken down. I started 
                        playing in a men’s league about 
                        three years after I graduated. 
                        First snap I took, I knocked the 
                        defensive end on his ass. Must have 
                        weighed close to 275. Ran right 
                        through him.
                  (brief pause)
                        I’m not afraid anymore.

           Silence.

                                 EISENHOWER (CONT’D)
                        When I’m elected, things are going 
                        to change. If you do what I say, 
                        I’ll tolerate you. Treat me like 
                        you did Truman and I will burn you 
                        to the ground.

           Eisenhower rises, returns to the window. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And how exactly are things going to 
                        change?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You’ll find out soon enough.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Is that all I get?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        You think you deserve more?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And if things don’t change...

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Then there will be consequences.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How ominous. What do you plan to 
                        do?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 EISENHOWER
                        Nothing.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I may be a bit slow. I don’t 
                        understand.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        I don’t need to do anything. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Then why should I stop?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Because if you don’t, they’ll turn 
                        on you.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Sixty eight percent approval rate. 
                        What are you at -- fifty nine, is 
                        it?

                                 EISENHOWER
                        For now.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I think that you’re lucky I’m a 
                        principled man. If Stevenson wasn’t 
                        such a damned Communist, I’d be 
                        helping him hand out fliers after 
                        this morale booster of a chat.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Don’t kid yourself. You’re not an 
                        idealist, you’re a vulture. And if 
                        there’s one thing you’re 
                        intelligent enough to know, it’s 
                        when to back a winning horse. 
                        That’s why you’re staying with me. 
                        What’s been said here isn’t to 
                        leave this room. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I certainly would hope not.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Get out. 

           McCarthy slowly rises -- still a bit stunned from the 
           encounter. 

           He thinks -- attempts to muster words that could puncture 
           Eisenhower’s bravado. He fails and reluctantly exits.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           EXT. HOTEL- MOMENTS LATER

           Several REPORTERS are now camped out at the entrance. 
           McCarthy exits and they swarm. 

                                  REPORTER 2
               REPORTER 1
           How was the meeting, Senator?
                            What did you talk about?

                                 REPORTER 3
                        Is it true that Eisenhower will 
                        condemn...

           McCarthy stops for a moment, pauses --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        We had a very, very pleasant 
                        conversation. That’s all, 
                        gentlemen.

           He continues walking and enters a car waiting nearby.

           EXT. CAMPAIGN RALLY- DAY

           An enthusiastic and jam packed crowd waits excitedly at the 
           stage.

           There’s a considerable buzz amongst them -- a mix of both the 
           young and old. Of course, the media is present as well.

           McCarthy steps foot on the stage, heads toward a podium in 
           the center.

           The crowd cheers wildly. Anticipating his words.

           McCarthy does little to hide his mood from his supporters. 
           His words are terse and lack excitement.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I wish to present to the people of 
                        my home city, the next President of 
                        the United States -- General Dwight 
                        Eisenhower.

           McCarthy walks off the stage abruptly. Members of the crowd 
           exchange looks of confusion as if to ask- “That’s it?”

           An uncomfortable moment passes.

           Eisenhower emerges on stage. Reaches the microphone. He 
           smiles and waves to the crowd. Appears warm and genial.  

           This is a different man than the one who just spoke to 
           McCarthy.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Acknowledging the applause --

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Thank you. It’s great to be here.

           MCCARTHY --

           Watches Eisenhower from the side of the stage. The view isn’t 
           ideal but he’s able to see the man. Don stands alongside him.

                                 DON
                        You really tossed my intro for 
                        that?

           In no mood...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did the job, didn’t it?

           EISENHOWER --

           Continues his speech.

                                 EISENHOWER
                        Senator McCarthy has spent a great 
                        deal of time discussing his fear 
                        that Communists have infiltrated 
                        some of Washington’s most valuable 
                        and formative institutions. 

           McCarthy braces for a condemnation. Eisenhower 

                                 EISENHOWER (CONT’D)
                        We have spent two decades 
                        tolerating Communists as they have 
                        ascended to the highest levels in 
                        our bureaucracy. This has resulted 
                        in a contamination -- to some 
                        degree -- in every department, 
                        every agency, every bureau, and 
                        every section of our government. 
                        This...acceptance of communism has 
                        allowed national policy to be 
                        molded by men who have turned their 
                        backs on our country. We will not 
                        stand for this for one moment 
                        longer.

           DON --

           Turns to McCarthy. Beaming.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        This isn’t a denunciation. It’s a 
                        goddamn endorsement.

           A smile creeps across McCarthy’s face. He stares at 
           Eisenhower, intoxicated by his power.

           EXT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, WISCONSIN- NIGHT

           A furious rain beats down on the pavement. It’s a gloomy 
           evening.

           Joe, jacket slung over his arm, lumbers up the driveway.

           INT. BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           He removes his tie, tosses it on the bed. Jean enters, paper 
           in hand.

                                 JEAN
                        Left the message this morning. You 
                        need to read this.

           Joe glances at the paper dismissive. Until he continues to 
           read --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Start packing.

                                 JEAN
                        Already done.

           Jean exits the room as Joe reaches for a phone on the 
           dresser. He quickly dials a number.

           A ring. Nothing.

           Another ring. Still no answer.

           Until --

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           We PUSH IN on the paper. It reads --

           “Reds infiltrated Army. Signal Corps. Fort Monmouth.”

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           EXT. DULLES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT- SUNRISE

           Joe and Jean enter a taxi that idles in front of the 
           entrance.

           INT. TRAIN- MORNING

           Joe stares out the window of the train. The brim on his hat 
           is low enough to nearly cover his eyes.

           A conductor reaches his seat. Joe tilts his cap up ever so 
           slightly, passes his ticket to the man. 

           As the conductor passes, he slides the hat back down.

           INT. DINER- SUNSET

           An empty dive. McCarthy sips on a cup of coffee, hunched over 
           his table. 

           Across from him is CORPORAL RHODES, 45. He still can’t 
           believe he’s doing this. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How many?

                                 RHODES
                        Enough. I’ve seen them. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Have you tried to talk to others, 
                        to your --

                                 RHODES
                        Supervisors? Yeah. They don’t want 
                        to hear it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What about others like ‘em? Are 
                        there any you outside of Monmouth?

                                 RHODES
                        I can’t speak to that.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And you work in the...

                                 RHODES
                        Signal corps.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Communications, huh?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Rhodes nods.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Never could get a damn signal over 
                        the islands when I flew. Real pain 
                        in the ass. Lots of blind fire.

           Rhodes is expressionless, disinterested; he’s here for one 
           reason and it’s not to socialize. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you called.

                                 RHODES
                        They told me you were the guy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They?

                                 RHODES
                        General Bradford. He’s one of the 
                        few that listen.

                                 MCCARTHY
                  (nods knowingly)
                        He was right.

           Rhodes pulls a buck fifty from his pocket, lays it on the 
           table. Begins to rise.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Where are you going?

           Rhodes stops.

                                 RHODES
                        We’re done, aren’t we?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Not yet.

           He takes a seat again.

                                 RHODES
                        What else do you need?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Names.

                                 RHODES
                        I don’t know.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’ve come this far. All you have 
                        to do is tell me what rocks to turn 
                        over.

                                 RHODES
                        My name will stay out of this?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Not a word.

           Rhodes shifts in his seat, folding.

                                 RHODES
                        What are you going to do to them?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Put ‘em where they belong.

                                 RHODES
                        What if you get scared?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I won’t.

                                 RHODES
                        Bradford’s word ain’t enough.  I 
                        need a little more than that.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And I need the same thing. That’s 
                        why this doesn’t end here.

                                 RHODES
                        What’s that?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        More. 

           A brief silence.

                                 RHODES
                        Start by looking at Smith, Carroll, 
                        and Morse. You’ll find what you’re 
                        looking for. 

           Joe quickly jots down the names on a napkin.

                                 RHODES (CONT’D)
                        Can I go?

           McCarthy extends his hand. Rhodes shakes it and exits.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- DAY

           The mood is tense. Bobby and the other staffers sit quietly, 
           waiting. A seat at the head of the table is empty. That is, 
           until McCarthy enters with a note pad in hand. 

           He speaks to no one in particular.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Has this room been swept?

           BOBBY dares to speak up.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Swept, sir?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did I stutter? I ordered this room 
                        to be swept for bugs.

           Looks of confusion. A few wonder if McCarthy is just drunk.

                                 STAFFER
                        We never received that order.

           McCarthy sighs loudly. He rises from his chair and circles 
           the room as if to search for a listening device. In 
           actuality, he has no clue what he is searching for.

           After he completes a circle and is satisfied -- 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Last night I received a call from a 
                        young man. We spoke, and I found it 
                        absolutely imperative to meet with 
                        him. So I hopped on a plane, a 
                        train, and off I went. This young 
                        man did something quite brave. He 
                        alerted me to a disturbing new 
                        reality. There is now significant 
                        Communist infiltration in our armed 
                        forces.

           Staffers try to hide their collective shock. Some scribble 
           notes furiously.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Starting this minute, I want each 
                        and every one of you to begin 
                        investigating this man’s claims. 
                        This is your priority. The 
                        infiltration began at Fort 
                        Monmouth. That is where we need to 
                        begin digging.

                        Look at Privates Smith, Carroll, 
                        and Morse. If you search hard 
                        enough, you should find that their 
                        ties to the Communist party are 
                        long standing and undisputable. 
                        Your job is to pick up the trail 
                        and bring it to me. Now lets get to 
                        work. 

           ON BOBBY - very few notes in front of him, an air of 
           skepticism.

           Around him, the staff disperses fairly instantaneously. Joe 
           lingers in the room for a moment.

                                 DON (V.O.)
                        Who’s the source?

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER

           Don puffs on a cigarette. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        A corporal.

                                 DON
                        Corporal -- who?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I told him his name would stay out 
                        of it.

                                 DON
                        How do you know he’s not screwing 
                        with you?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He reached out through Bradford. 
                        Seems like a good kid. 

                                 DON
                        So you initiated an investigation 
                        of the United States Army because 
                        some kid had table manners?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He’s not lying.

                                 DON 
                        Won’t know that for sure until we 
                        run a background check.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        We’ve got the seed. That’s enough 
                        to raise eyebrows.

                                 DON
                        And if the kid’s a liar, you’ll see 
                        a lot of scowls below those 
                        eyebrows. 

           A brief silence.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Rhodes.

           EXT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING- DUSK

           Another day on Capital Hill...this one isn’t far from over. 
           Joe lumbers down the steps, hat in hand. As he reaches the 
           street --

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY  (O.S.)
                        Mr. McCarthy.

           McCarthy whips around; Bobby approaches him, looks slightly 
           uneasy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s going on?

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I need a new assignment.

           McCarthy is thrown; he’s unaccustomed to being spoken to so 
           bluntly by an underling.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Excuse me.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Sir, I just...uh, I really would 
                        prefer to work on another issue.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        There is no ‘other issue’.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I see.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You find our work objectionable? 
                        Unsatisfying?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Unsatisfying isn’t how I would 
                        characterize it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How might you characterize it, 
                        then?

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I’d prefer not to --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Air your grievance.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I’d just be very grateful if I 
                        could work alongside you on the 
                        Employment Reform. I have some 
                        ideas that I really think --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What you have is an assignment. 
                        Nothing is more important than 
                        that.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Let me write a proposal for the 
                        workers comp reform. I can have it 
                        on your desk tomorrow.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        No.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Just glance at, that’s all I ask. 
                        If it’s no good, forget it.

           McCarthy is silent, unconvinced. Bobby’s persistence has only 
           caused him greater irritation.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        With all due respect, I’m asking 
                        for a favor.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And what exactly do I owe you?

           Bobby takes a moment; nods ever so slightly in understanding. 
           He’s unhappy.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Have a good weekend, sir.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           He exits. Joe watches him for a moment, shakes it off. Puts 
           his hat on.

           A classic 50’s pop ballad begins to play over the following -- 
           Something soulful. Think Doris Day’s ‘Que Sera Sera’. And now 
           we’re in a...

           HALLWAY

           McCarthy walks with purpose down the corridor, briefcase in 
           hand. He reaches a door at the end and opens it. 

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER

           He unpacks his briefcase on his desk. Removes a flask. Takes 
           a sip and places it to the side. Starts to pour over a series 
           of papers that are stacked on his desk.

           EXT. FORT MONMOUTH- DAY

           A military checkpoint. McCarthy’s car waits at the gate. A 
           moment later, the gate is lifted and he passes through.

           INT. COMMUNICATIONS LAB, FORT MONMOUTH- DAY

           A frantic environment. McCarthy’s presence, along with Don’s, 
           seem to go unnoticed as he tours the facility. 

           He surveys each engineer with suspicion. Paces through the 
           lab, curious.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- NIGHT

           A late night. Staffers focus on a series of papers that lie 
           on the table. 

           Isolated from the rest is Bobby. He stares at a file with 
           obvious distaste.

           McCarthy enters. The staffers nearly pounce on him -- eager 
           to reveal what they have uncovered. They motion passionately 
           toward the documents on the table.

           Joe takes this all in for a moment -- then grins widely. Good 
           news.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           Another glass. It’s larger this time. The poison is scotch. 
           Joe raises it to his lips and drinks it as if it is water. 
           Reaches to pour another.

           EXT. HOME- NIGHT

           Two men, who both don black overcoats, rummage through a few 
           trash cans that rest at the curb.

           The home they stand outside of is quaint, completely ordinary 
           aside from the large American flag that proudly hangs in its 
           lawn.

           Their search is unproductive.

           One of the men accidentally tips the garbage can as he 
           surveys its contents. The can CRASHES to the ground.

           The men look toward the house -- a light turns on inside.

           They quickly return to their car and speed away.

           INT. RESTAURANT- DAY

           McCarthy and Don sit across from a man dressed in full Army 
           garb. His lapel is full of commendations. We’ll call him The 
           General.

           McCarthy speaks to the man with passion, motions with his 
           hands often.

           The General doesn’t like what he is hearing. Motions 
           demonstratively. Looks very dissatisfied.

           INT. OFFICE- DAY

           Bobby watches his co-workers in the conference room. They’re 
           all smiles. He taps his pencil against his desk, 
           contemplative.

           INT. BEDROOM- NIGHT

           It’s dark, difficult to see anything but shadows. 

           A moment passes. Light floods the room.

           In it are the two men we’ve just met. Once again, they are 
           snooping. What they are looking for is unclear.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           They rummage through drawers, search frantically.

           INT. RESTAURANT- DAY

           The General throws his napkin down on the table. Rises in 
           anger and exits.

           McCarthy says nothing. We get the sense that he’s not too 
           surprised at the outcome.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- NIGHT

           Another long night. A white board has been assembled in the 
           middle of the room. 

           On the board lie pictures -- almost like mug shots -- of a 
           number of young men.

           They have one thing in common. All wear military uniforms.

           INT. BAR- NIGHT

           An office party, a celebration. Intimate. Two dozen or so in 
           attendance. Joe, as per usual, is the center of attention. He 
           holds a glass in the air.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        -- this is just the beginning, but 
                        you’ve done a hell of a job. Enjoy 
                        it.

           Joe drinks. The others follow. Conversation resumes, the room 
           buzzing.

           BOBBY

           eyes Joe from across the room. He downs his drink in a single 
           gulp. A hint of nervousness. 

           He places the glass down, navigates the crowd to reach Joe 
           who is engaged in conversation with a small group.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Can I have a minute?

           Joe laughs at a joke we’ve missed, he’s not paying Bobby much 
           attention.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Later. I’ll come find you.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Now.

           Catching Joe’s attention with its urgency --

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           EXT. BAR- NIGHT

           Joe surveys the well lit, abandoned street. Puffs on a 
           cigarette. Bobby faces him.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I asked you for an out. I tried to 
                        do this the right way.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        This? 

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        We can’t stand behind this any 
                        longer. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        We? Who is we?

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I’m sorry. Desk is already packed. 
                        I’ll wait for the good-byes. Don’t 
                        want to disrupt the celebration.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Come on. I’m sure there’s something 
                        we can do.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Thank you for everything.

           He extends his hand. Joe is confused, shakes. Bobby begins to 
           walk away.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Immigration. Workers comp. 
                        Whatever. Spearhead them. Do 
                        whatever you want.

           He stops. Turns back to Joe.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                  (nods to the bar)
                        And what about this? What about 
                        what we’re doing here?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        What about it?

           Bobby shakes his head - “you really don’t get it, do you?”

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I appreciate everything you’ve done 
                        for me.

           He heads down the street, leaves Joe in solitude.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH- MOMENTS LATER

           A RING. Another RING. Joe presses the receiver to his ear, 
           anxious.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        ...hello?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Joe. It’s McCarthy.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        It’s late.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m sorry if I woke you.

           A silence.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I just spoke to your son.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        I see.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I think he had one too many drinks 
                        tonight. Said some crazy things.

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        Did he now?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        He wants to hang it up. Quit. We’ve 
                        gotta get him back on the team. 
                        Nothing a father son chat won’t 
                        fix, right?

                                 JOE KENNEDY (V.O.)
                        He was sober. And he speaks for the 
                        family. I’m sorry it had to happen 
                        this way.

                  (pause)
                        It’s late. Goodnight.

           CLICK.

           INT. BAR- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe enters to the raucous celebration uninterrupted. He puts 
           on his best smile. To the crowd...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Who wants another round?

           Cheers. As the attention fades, so does his smile.

           INT. OFFICE- DAY

           Joe makes his way through the bullpen on his way to his 
           office when Jean approaches him, a look of worry on her face.

                                 JEAN
                        There’s somebody here to see you, 
                        it’s --

           Joe reaches his office. The door’s closed. Unusual. He looks 
           at Jean curiously, opens it.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- CONTINOUS

           Inside -- Don stands perched against Joe’s desk. With his 
           back to Joe is Corporal Rhodes. His expression is one of 
           anger and betrayal.

                                 DON
                        Joe, Corporal Rhodes here wanted...

           Joe extends his hand to Rhodes. It is left hanging there. He 
           pulls it back a moment later. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How can I help you, Corporal?

                                 RHODES
                        You made me a promise.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Excuse me?

                                 RHODES
                        I know you’re a politician and all 
                        but you made me a promise.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re 
                        referring to.

                                 RHODES
                        They made me pack up my things. 
                        Sent me home. They knew -- they all 
                        knew we talked.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Who knew?

                                 RHODES
                        Everyone.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s the name of your C.O.?

                                 RHODES
                        Esposito.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        General, lieutenant...?

                                 RHODES
                        Lieutenant.

           Jotting the name down on a piece of paper...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I am going to talk to Lieutenant 
                        Esposito and get this whole thing 
                        straightened out.

                                 RHODES
                  (confused)
                        You didn’t tell?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Not a soul. Although my friend Don 
                        here knows now.

                                 RHODES
                        But how do they...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I intend to find out. You have my 
                        word.

           McCarthy extends his hand. Rhodes, unsure, takes it. They 
           shake. 

                                 RHODES
                        Thank you.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ll be in touch.

           He smiles at Rhodes who takes the cue and exits. Don shakes 
           his head, a smirk on his face.

                                 DON
                        Poor son of a bitch actually thinks 
                        you’re sincere.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Who said I’m not?

           Joe crumples up the piece of paper with Esposito’s name on 
           it. Chucks it in the garbage can.

                                       CUT TO:

           A fist, clenched. It KNOCKS forcefully on a white door.

                                       CUT TO:

           INT. MCCARTHY’S HOME- SUNRISE

           The door swings open. Don stands at the doorstep, all smiles.

           Joe, groggy and half awake, gestures him inside.

           INT. KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe sips on a cup of coffee. Don leans forward in his seat, 
           excited.

                                 DON
                        Eisenhower’s camp called.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Trying to ruin my morning?

                                 DON
                        The hearings. They want to 
                        televise. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Fine. Which affiliate? 

                                 DON
                        This isn’t local. They want a 
                        nationwide broadcast.

           McCarthy sits up in his chair; he’s awake now.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s he after?

                                 DON
                        Must think it’s nothing more than a 
                        wild goose chase. They’ll never 
                        admit it --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Trying to embarrass me.

                                 DON
                        Seems that way.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What do you think?

                                 DON
                        ‘60 is wide open. Bobby won’t stop 
                        blabbing about his brother. But I 
                        don’t see it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Kid just got his diapers off. Maybe 
                        ‘68.

                                 DON
                        Either way, spotlight like this is 
                        awfully rare. Could serve as a 
                        launching pad. If you want the top 
                        job, this is what we do.

           Don looks around the quaint home.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        But there is nothing wrong with 
                        this.  Nothing at all. If this is 
                        what you’re comfortable with -- 
                        then this is where we stay. Sleep 
                        on it.

           EXT. MCCARTHY’S HOME- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe stands in the driveway, hand raised to say goodbye. Don 
           pulls away in his car.

           Joe surveys the neighborhood carefully, pensive. Is this 
           where he wants to be?

           INT. TAXI- DAY

           A RADIO BLARES. The strong, potent voice of a newscaster.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           The Driver, mid 40’s, reserved, speeds down a busy street. 
           Joe and Jean sit in the backseat. Both wear rings.

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        ...less than twenty four hours away 
                        from the start of Senator Joseph 
                        McCarthy’s Army hearings. 
                        Anticipation has reached a fever 
                        pitch and for many Americans 
                        outside of the Senator’s home 
                        state, this will be their first 
                        real look at the man they have 
                        heard so much about. Our first 
                        witness, a General Zwicker, is 
                        expected to testify as to the 
                        discharge of accused private...

                                 JEAN
                        I told Linda we couldn’t do dinner 
                        this week. She didn’t even know 
                        about the hearings.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        If only we could use that one every 
                        time.

           ON Jean -- who smiles faintly. 

           And at the moment, through her window, we see a CAR just 
           thirty feet away moving with frightening speed headed 
           directly toward the cab.

           The CAR SLAMS INTO THE CAB AT FULL SPEED. A SCREAM. 
           DEVASTATING IMPACT.

                                        BLACK.

           A PLUME OF SMOKE rises from the cab’s engine.

           We PULL BACK to reveal the totality of the crash.  Wreckage.  
           Crumpled metal. Shattered glass. Jean’s passenger side door 
           is crushed.

           INT. CAB- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe opens his eyes slowly. Appears serene for a moment. As if 
           he has forgotten where he is. 

           And then -- it hits him. He launches forward in his seat. 
           Places his hand on his throbbing head. Remnants of blood rest 
           on his fingertips.

           He looks over to Jean -- she is unconscious, badly cut.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           The Driver is in just as poor shape. His head in slumped on 
           the steering wheel.

           For anyone to hear...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Help! 

           EXT. STREET- MOMENTS LATER

           The ambulance attendants have arrived and a small crowd 
           gathers on the sidewalk to gawk.

           An attendant attempts to treat Joe. Joe brushes the man away.

           He runs over to Jean, who is being placed on a stretcher. A 
           few feet away, the Driver is being given the same treatment.

           The Driver is loaded onto the ambulance which idles a few 
           feet away.

           ATTENDANT 1 reaches to shut the door --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Hey -- what about my wife? 

                                 ATTENDANT 1
                        We’ve got a second ambulance on its 
                        way. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        This is -- national security. 

                                 ATTENDANT 1
                        Excuse me?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m a United States Senator and I 
                        need her taken care of right now.

                                 ATTENDANT 1
                        Sir, we have to take him now -- 
                        he’s in bad shape. Someone will 
                        stay with you until it gets here.

           The door slams shut and the ambulance speeds away.

           Joe is utterly helpless. Unsure of what to do. He stands in 
           the street, looks for an ambulance on the horizon. Nothing 
           yet.

           He clutches Jean’s hand. ATTENDANT 2 idles nearby.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           He snaps --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Aren’t you going to do something?

                                 ATTENDANT 2
                        She’s going to be fine, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        No thanks to you two.

           The attendant remains silent. Appears accustomed to this 
           abuse.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Where is the goddamn ambulance?

           He taps his fingers impatiently on the side of the gurney. A 
           moment passes. Still nothing.

           Finally -- a SIREN sounds in the distance. Joe sees the 
           ambulance flying down the street. It reaches them and the 
           attendant’s exit.

           Jean is loaded into the ambulance. Joe climbs in.

           INT. HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM- NIGHT

           Nothing but more nerves. Joe paces around, unable to sit. 

           The DOCTOR, a man in his late 40’s with an unusual 
           enthusiasm, enters. He extends his hand.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s a honor to meet you, sir. A 
                        real honor.

           Joe nods, feigns a smile. They shake.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Your wife suffered a concussion. 
                        Has a few contusions in the sternum 
                        and ribs...and we had to give her 
                        some stitches. We’re going to keep 
                        her overnight for observation. 
                        We’re afraid that the amount of 
                        blood being spilt internally is... 
                        significant. Won’t know for another 
                        day or two what her prognosis is. 
                        But we’re going to take real 
                        special care of her, sir. That’s a 
                        promise.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        If she’s bleeding, what does that 
                        mean?

                                 DOCTOR
                        The blood can compress the organs 
                        and cause them to malfunction. We 
                        just need to make sure that doesn’t 
                        happen. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Well when can I see her?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Visiting hours ended at 9.

           Sensing Joe’s disappointment --

                                 DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        But I think we can make an 
                        exception. 

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           Jean lays fast asleep in the bed. Her face is bruised. Skin 
           discolored. Bandages cover her body. It isn’t the prettiest 
           sight.

           Joe sits at her side, strokes her hair gently.

           She turns over, rustling. Her eyes open briefly. Half awake.

                                 JEAN
                        Don’t leave.

           He says nothing. Continues to play with her hair.

           INT. HOSPITAL, WAITING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           Joe sits in silence. It’s difficult to discern if he’s 
           thinking a lot, or of nothing at all. 

           Don bursts through the door, worry on his face, a briefcase 
           in hand.

                                 DON
                        I’m sorry it took so long.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Don’t worry about it.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        Is everything okay? What did they 
                        say?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Too soon to know.

           Don takes a seat alongside Joe, slumps down in his chair. 
           Unsure of how to react.

                                 DON
                        If you want to postpone a few days, 
                        it’s totally understandable. Nobody 
                        would argue -- you should be 
                        here...

           Joe shakes his head vehemently.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nothing changes.

           Joe takes the briefcase Don has brought and places it on his 
           lap. Opens it.

           Inside are a series of papers. But that’s not what Joe wants. 
           He digs under them and removes a flask. 

                                 DON
                        C’mon.

           Joe ignores him, unscrews the cap and begins to sip from it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        After today...

                                 DON
                        We’ve got ten hours till the 
                        hearings.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nervous?

           Don smiles.

                                 DON
                        Not one bit. I know you’ll knock 
                        ‘em dead. Always do.

           Another sip from the flask.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        My only concern is making sure you 
                        can walk in a straight line to the 
                        bench.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Joe musters up a weak laugh. The most he can possibly enjoy 
           himself at this moment.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Give me some of that.

           He grabs the drink. Takes a swig. They sit. Tranquil.

           EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING- DAY

           The antithesis of tranquil. An absolute scene. The media is 
           camped out outside. Protestors and spectators alike line the 
           streets. 

           Merely entering the building without commotion is difficult 
           in itself.

           A car pulls up in front of the building. McCarthy and Don 
           exit.

           McCarthy begins to walk up the courthouse steps.

           A loud cheer erupts from the crowd as they sight him. He 
           ignores it and moves briskly up the steps and into --

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING- CONTINUOUS

           Joe moves through an ornate corridor, vaulted with high 
           ceilings and full of suits. The atmosphere is similarly 
           frantic inside. 

           He moves through the crowd with speed. Reaches a door at the 
           end of the hall and enters.

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           McCarthy sits alongside CHAIRMAN MUNDT, even tempered and 
           incredibly articulate. 

           The setup is the same as we’ve seen earlier. Mundt, McCarthy, 
           and the other committee members take their seats at the 
           bench.

           The gallery is packed. 

           In contrast, the table that sits across from the bench is 
           empty.

           A bulky camera rests in the back of the room. A man behind it 
           operates. This is what the nation will see.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Mundt slams his gavel on the bench.

                                 CHAIRMAN MUNDT
                        This hearing has now been called to 
                        order. I’d like to welcome all of 
                        you today on behalf of the Senate 
                        Subcommittee on Investigations. We 
                        are here to explore charges levied 
                        against the Army as it relates to 
                        Communist subversion within its 
                        ranks. The first witness the 
                        committee seeks to call is General 
                        Ralph W. Zwicker.

           GENERAL ZWICKER, late 50’s, polished yet temperamental, rises 
           from the first row of the gallery alongside his COUNSEL. They 
           takes their seats at the witness table.

                                 CHAIRMAN MUNDT (CONT’D)
                        Senator McCarthy will have the 
                        floor first. You have twenty 
                        minutes.

           McCarthy shifts in his seat, repositions his microphone. 
           Clears his throat.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        General Zwicker --

           The doors of the room swing open loudly. 

           A DOZEN GENERALS, in full uniform, station themselves in the 
           back of the room. They stand. Their appearance is 
           intimidating. That is the point.

           The gallery buzzes over the theatrics.  McCarthy attempts to 
           ignore the distraction.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Irving Peress is a proud member of 
                        the American labor party, and a 
                        fifth amendment communist. He’s 
                        also an honorably discharged member 
                        of the Army. The Peress case has 
                        come to your attention in the past 
                        year, has it not?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        Yes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Now, General, explain to me what 
                        steps you took against Peress.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        That is a toughie.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You know that somebody authorized 
                        an honorable discharge for this 
                        man, correct?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I do.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The day the discharge was signed, 
                        were you aware of the fact that he 
                        had been questioned before our 
                        committee one month earlier and 
                        refused to answer certain 
                        questions?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I was.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And you knew that Peress refused to 
                        divulge whether he was a Communist, 
                        did you not?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I don’t recall.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’re a commanding General. When 
                        one of your officers appears before 
                        a committee and refuses to answer 
                        such questions, would you not pay 
                        rather close attention to that 
                        story?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I read the press releases.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you were aware that he invoked 
                        his fifth amendment rights...

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I knew everything that was in the 
                        press.

           His temperature rising with each moment --

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Don’t be coy with me, General. Did 
                        you take any steps to have Peress 
                        retained once the allegations 
                        against him arose?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        No, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did it occur to you that you 
                        should?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        No, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Could you have taken such steps?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        No, sir.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        In other words, there’s nothing you 
                        could have done. Is that your 
                        statement here today?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        That is my opinion.

           McCarthy shifts in his seat, readjusts the microphone. Signs 
           of frustration.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I see. Let me ask you a question 
                        General. Perhaps I can help you 
                        understand the situation more 
                        clearly. Let’s say one of your men 
                        is to be honorably discharged 
                        tomorrow morning. Tonight, he 
                        commits a crime. He goes out and he 
                        steals 50 dollars. Would he still 
                        be discharged tomorrow morning?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        No, he would not.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Do you think stealing 50 dollars is 
                        more serious than being a traitor 
                        to this country as part of the 
                        communist conspiracy?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        That is not my call to make, sir. I 
                        was never officially informed that 
                        Peress was part of the communist 
                        conspiracy, Senator.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        But you read the papers.

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I did.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And that wasn’t enough?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        There was no official notification.

           A brief pause. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Let’s try this one more time. John 
                        Doe is a major in the Army. There 
                        is sworn testimony to the effect 
                        that he is part of the communist 
                        conspiracy. His General...
                  (fumbling with his words)
                        General...Smith is responsible for 
                        discharging the man honorably, 
                        knowing this fact. Do you think 
                        General Smith should be removed 
                        from the military?

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        That is not a question for me to 
                        decide.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You are ordered to answer it. You 
                        have a rather important job. I want 
                        to know how you feel about getting 
                        rid of Communists.

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I’m all for it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Okay, then please answer the 
                        question. I don’t care how long we 
                        stay here. You will answer.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I’m sorry, Senator, you’ve lost me. 
                        Do you mean how I feel toward 
                        communists?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I mean exactly what I asked you, 
                        General; nothing else. And anyone 
                        with the brains of a 5 year old can 
                        understand the question.

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I do not think the General should 
                        be removed from the military.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Then, General, you should be 
                        removed from any command. Any man 
                        who says ‘I will protect another 
                        General who protected communists’ 
                        is not fit to wear the uniform. You 
                        sit here and knowingly mislead this 
                        committee as to your knowledge 
                        about Mr. Peress’ situation —

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        I did nothing of the sort. I don’t 
                        like to have anyone impugn my 
                        honesty, which you just about did.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Either your honesty or your 
                        intelligence; I can’t help 
                        impugning one or the other.

           A deafening silence.

           McCarthy takes a deep breath — looks down and notices that 
           his hands are trembling ever so slightly.

           Zwicker, an icy glare, surveys McCarthy with a slight hint of 
           satisfaction.

                                 GENERAL ZWICKER
                        Any other questions...sir?

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING- SUNSET

           Joe strides down the corridor, walks right to the exit with a 
           head of steam.

           REPORTERS 1 and 2, whom we’ve met earlier, follow him 
           dutifully. REPORTER 1 is especially rabid.  

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 REPORTER 1
                        Will Peress be testifying before 
                        the committee?

                                 REPORTER 2
                        Senator, how do you feel about 
                        today’s proceedings?

                                 REPORTER 1
                        Did General Zwicker prove that --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Sorry boys, I can’t do this right 
                        now. 

                                 REPORTER 2
                        How’s your wife, sir?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m about to find out. If you’ll 
                        excuse me.

           Joe reaches the exit. As he pushes the door open --

                                 REPORTER 1
                        What do you say to those who claim 
                        you acted like a bully today?

           Joe turns around, lets the door close. Sensing an opening, 
           another reporter or two mosey over.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’d say that’s ridiculous. The 
                        American people are fed up. So am 
                        I. If my words reflect that, so be 
                        it.

           A pause.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Next question.

           INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM- NIGHT

           Joe sits with his head in his hands, exhaustion emanating 
           from his every movement.

           Our Doctor approaches once again, a smile on his face.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Good news. CT checked out okay, and 
                        the internal bleeding is minimal. 
                        Should be home by Thursday.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Joe smiles, relieved. Shakes the doctors hand.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        Hell of a job today. Snuck a radio 
                        into the OR. Couldn’t miss it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Appreciate it.  

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY- NIGHT

           The SHRILL BEEP of hospital machinery. We’re just outside 
           Jean’s door, a clear view through the window.

           Joe sits at Jean’s side. She’s awake. They talk animatedly. 

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           Closer to sunrise than sunset. Joe’s office is the only one 
           with a light on. The rest of the place is pitch black.

           Joe sits at his desk, gazing at a file. 

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS in the darkness.

           Joe looks up, a bit alarmed. Turns his focus back to the 
           papers.

           A beat.

           The footsteps grow louder. Closer.

           Joe looks up again; he’s lost his focus.

           More footsteps. And then a SOFT CRASH. Sounds like metal 
           hitting the ground.

           Joe rises from his seat. Creeps toward the door. Silence.

           He moves into the darkness, leaving us at the door. A shadow 
           is half cast over it. It’s proudly engraved with his name and 
           position. We HOLD there for a moment.

           The LIGHTS flicker on, illuminate the office with an 
           abundance of brightness.

           Joe stands at the switch, looking for the source of the 
           noise. 

           Empty desks are the only thing in sight.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           He moves around the office slowly. Looks to the conference 
           room on his left.

           Papers are strewn across it, most disorganized on the table 
           and a few on the floor. 

           This was not the way the room was left. A stapler lays on the 
           floor, ajar.

           Joe checks his peripherals and then cautiously enters the...

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- CONTINOUS

           ...where he picks up a piece of paper on the floor. 

           The contents of the sheet alarm him. He leans over the table, 
           scans the others.

           And as he’s doing this, he hears the SLAM of a DOOR. Unclear 
           whether it has been opened or shut.

           Joe looks to the bullpen of desks. Waits for a figure to 
           emerge. And one does.

           Don reaches a desk, suitcase in hand. He’s surprised to see 
           Joe, noticeably frightened. He walks over to him.

                                 DON
                        Look like you’ve just seen a ghost.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Was that you? Trying to pull a 
                        prank on me or something?

                                 DON
                        How much have you had?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Stop assing around. Was it you who 
                        did this?

           He motions to the mess of papers.

                                 DON
                        How much?

           Joe ignores the question.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’re telling me you know nothing 
                        about this?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        No.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Someone was in here. The lights 
                        were off, it was dark. I heard 
                        footsteps. Loud. Then a crash. Came 
                        in and found our files all over the 
                        place. 

                                 DON
                        Are you sure somebody was here?

           Joe nods.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        We need to call security.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Get Nancy over here -- have her 
                        make sure nothing’s missing.

                                 DON
                        Who do you think it was?

           Joe looks over at the WHITEBOARD which remains in the corner 
           of the room, complete with pictures of military personnel. 
           Their targets.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Take your pick.

           EXT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING- MORNING

           Ominous clouds that hint at rain.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- MORNING

           Don sits across from a visibly exhausted McCarthy, who 
           lounges with his feet on his desk and eyes closed. A small 
           towel is pressed against his forehead. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Where’s the number?

                                 DON
                        They’ll call as soon as it’s in.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Well what do you think? 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        Maybe 8.5, 9 million. I don’t want 
                        you to be disappointed if we end up 
                        closer to 4 or 5. It’s early. 
                        Remember that.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Uh huh.

           INT. MICKEY’S BAR- NIGHT

           Packed, buzzing with a bridge and tunnel crowd. A place to be 
           seen and heard.

           McCarthy sits at the bar, alone for the moment. Perhaps 
           preparing 

                                 DON (V.O.)

           He turns around. There’s Don, a smile on his face...beer in 
           hand.

                                 DON

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Stop assing around.

                                 DON

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What...?

           Joe breathes a sigh of relief. Clearly, to some extent, a 
           weight has been lifted off of his shoulders.

                                 DON
                        Don’t be disappointed if we drop 
                        tomorrow.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Always managing expectations.

                                 DON
                        Don’t want you to be angry.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They won’t drop.

           Joe motions to the bartender.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        Lets hope not.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They won’t. 

                                 DON
                        I like your confidence.

           A new round of drinks appear.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Why do you think the ratings were 
                        so high?

                                 DON
                        I don’t know if we can point to one 
                        thing --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They’re angry. They wanted me to be 
                        angry. I was. It doesn’t matter 
                        why. They want to see it, they want 
                        something to actually --

                                 DON
                        I also got the poll numbers. 
                        They’re not as favorable as we 
                        hoped.

           A SUIT walks by, slaps McCarthy on the back cheerfully. Joe 
           gives him a perfunctory nod. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And...

                                 DON
                        People don’t know what to think. 
                        There’s been some backlash.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        But they’re going to keep watching.

                                 DON
                        They might.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        They will. Maybe a few will object, 
                        sure. They don’t understand yet. 
                        But they’re entertained. They still 
                        watch. We’ve got ‘em. All that’s 
                        left is reaching our destination.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        I’m worried about the journey.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nothing more than a means to an 
                        end. We’ll get there. 

           McCarthy takes a hefty swig of his drink. He puts it down. 
           Don covers the glass, as if to command his attention.

                                 DON
                        I was just thinking maybe if you 
                        adjusted the way you spoke to the 
                        witnesses...

                                 MCCARTHY 
                        I haven’t done a damn thing I need 
                        to be ashamed of.

                                 DON
                        I’m not saying you should be 
                        ashamed. You should be proud. I 
                        just want the rest of the world to, 
                        to -- sympathize with you. To see 
                        you the way I do.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The people want a show.

                                 DON
                        They want justice.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And I’ll give ‘em both. Now drink 
                        up. Celebrate.

           Don musters a weak smile. A moment passes. 

           A POP BALLAD blasts from the jukebox...an audible yell of 
           approval from the crowd. 

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM- MORNING

           SUPERIMPOSE: DAY TWO

           MARVIN BELSKY, another military man in his mid 40’s, sits at 
           the witness’ table. There is counsel at his side.

           Jean sits a few rows behind him, jotting notes on a pad. A 
           heavy dose of makeup doesn’t completely obscure her cuts, 
           bruises.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Just so that there is no question, 
                        you have received no orders either 
                        from President Eisenhower or your 
                        commanding officer not to testify, 
                        have you?

                                 BELSKY
                        No.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you are free to testify here 
                        today, unless, of course, you 
                        invoke the fifth amendment?

                                 BELSKY
                        As free as I can possibly be.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        When you were drafted, you applied 
                        for a commission, did you not?

                                 BELSKY
                        Yes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Why were you denied this 
                        commission?

           Belsky leans over to his counsel, whispers something in his 
           ear. They confer for a moment. 

                                 BELSKY
                        I received notice that my forms 
                        were not properly completed.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        In other words, you did not answer 
                        questions about your Communist 
                        background and as a result, you 
                        were denied the commission?

           Following another mini conference with his counsel --

                                 BELSKY
                        They never told me why I didn’t 
                        properly complete the form.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you have no idea why you were 
                        rejected?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 BELSKY
                        I couldn’t venture on giving you an 
                        opinion.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I just want to know whether you 
                        have any idea why this happened.

                                 BELSKY
                        I couldn’t venture to give you any 
                        idea why I was denied.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m not asking you whether you 
                        venture. I’m asking you whether you 
                        have any idea. What do you fail to 
                        understand?

                                 BELSKY
                        No; I have no idea.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Is that a truthful answer?

           Belsky pauses. Consults with his counsel again.

           SUPERIMPOSE: DAY EIGHT.

           ZACHARY O’BRIEN, a 20 something cadet, sits at the witness 
           table. 

           McCarthy shuffles through a series of papers in front of him 
           as he speaks. His attention is divided.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. O’Brien, quite frankly...you 
                        should be ashamed of yourself. I 
                        think the evidence is rather 
                        damning and completely --

           McCarthy stops speaking, stares intently at a piece of paper.

           To those in the gallery, it’s surely a legal document, a 
           piece of evidence, etc.

           Wrong. It’s a NEW YORK TIMES article:

           RATINGS FREE FALL AMIDST ARMY INVESTIGATION.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy’s glued to the paper. His eyes scan it furiously. A 
           beat. He catches himself? “Where was I?”

           EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING- DAY

           SUPERIMPOSE: DAY 16

           A throng of protestors have gathered. Many hold signs that 
           read “Americans for the Army”, “McCarthy = Traitor”, and 
           similar slogans to the same effect. 

           Joe walks up the steps, a Secret Service agent flanking him. 
           The protestors scream words of hate as he passes.

           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM- DAY

           The crowd has thinned, however its presence is still notable.

           COLONEL ADAM POTTER is being questioned.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        When you were asked the question...
                  (looks to a paper at his 
                  side)
                        ...did you belong to an 
                        organization that believes in the 
                        right to overthrow our government, 
                        how did you respond?

                                 POTTER
                        I respectfully decline to answer 
                        that question under the protection 
                        of the fifth amendment.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Were you a member of the Communist 
                        party at the time you joined the 
                        service?

                                 POTTER
                        I respectfully decline to answer 
                        that question...

                                 MCCARTHY
                  (cutting him off)
                        Have you attended meetings for the 
                        Communist cause with other 
                        personnel, civilian or military, 
                        while stationed at your base?

                                 POTTER
                        I respectfully decline..

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Have you attempted to recruit any 
                        personnel into the Communist cause?

                        Let me guess, you respectfully 
                        decline?

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- NIGHT

           Joe stares emptily into space as the radio crackles softly in 
           the background.

           Jean lays on the couch, fast asleep. There are overturned 
           files and a half empty glass of wine at her side. She’s been 
           working just as hard as he has. 

           He looks at her- peaceful. For the moment.

           ON JOE -- envious.

           Dark and silent. Joe sits at his desk in a vain attempt to 
           work.

           A loud BANG. Joe nearly jumps out of his chair. Startled.

           He runs to the window, looks to the street. A car has 
           backfired. He takes a deep breath.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. COMMITTEE ROOM- DAY

           The typical setup. A slightly thinned crowd.

           JOSEPH N. WELCH, 64, lightning quick wit despite his age, 
           stares at McCarthy. His responses are drenched in sarcasm and 
           indignation. They are calculated, perhaps even rehearsed. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        On behalf of the committee, I’d 
                        like to thank you for appearing 
                        here today Mr. Welch.

                                 WELCH
                        It is my pleasure.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        As you have surely been aware, at 
                        the beginning of these proceedings, 
                        we found it quite difficult to 
                        contact you.

                                 WELCH
                        My apologies.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        But you are here today --

                                 WELCH
                        Rest assured, when I heard you were 
                        calling I came running.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Your cooperation is much 
                        appreciated.

                                 WELCH
                        Anything for you, Senator.

           McCarthy is put off by the response. Moving on... 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        As general counsel for the Army, 
                        you have a very important position 
                        in maintaining the integrity of the 
                        Armed Services. Do we agree?

                                 WELCH
                        Yes.

                        the Communist problem in our 
                        country?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 WELCH
                        My feelings? Report ‘em and get 
                        every one of them out by sundown. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Is that how you feel?

                                 WELCH
                        It is what I said.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Get them out by sundown, huh?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I think it is important to note Mr. 
                        Welch that you have been employing 
                        a young man named -- Fischer -- who 
                        for a number of years has worked 
                        for an organization that is the 
                        legal bulwark of the Communist 
                        party. This is an organization that 
                        swings to the defense of anyone 
                        that has been accused of being a 
                        Communist. Mr. Fischer is still in 
                        your law firm today. 
                  (looks at his watch)
                        I expect you’ll remove him by 
                        sundown today, time permitting.
                        Whether you knew he was a member of 
                        that Communist organization or not, 
                        I don’t know. I assume you did not, 
                        Mr. Welch, because I get the 
                        impression that, while you are 
                        quite an actor, you play for a 
                        laugh, I don’t think you have any 
                        conception of the danger of the 
                        Communist Party. 

           Chairman Mundt leans over to McCarthy, whispers in his ear. 
           They confer quietly as Welch speaks.

                                 WELCH
                        Senator --

           McCarthy nods as if to acknowledge Welch while still talking 
           to Mundt.

                        May I have your attention?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        I am listening to you. I can listen 
                        with one ear.

                                 WELCH
                        I want you to listen with both.

           McCarthy stops, stares at Welch.

                                 WELCH (CONT’D)
                        Until this moment, Senator, I think 
                        I never really gauged your cruelty 
                        or your recklessness. Fred Fisher 
                        is a young man who went to Harvard 
                        Law and came into my firm and is 
                        starting what looks to be a 
                        brilliant career with us. 
                        Little did I dream you could be so 
                        reckless and cruel as to do an 
                        injury to that lad. Fred is not a 
                        Communist. It is true he has done 
                        work with the National Lawyers 
                        Guild. The work he does is not for 
                        the sake of ideology. He practices 
                        law because that is what he loves. 
                        However, I fear he will stop doing 
                        so because he will bear a scar 
                        needlessly inflicted by you in 
                        front of millions of people.

           The air is sucked out of the room. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You talk about being cruel and 
                        reckless but the truly reckless act 
                        here is the perjury you are 
                        committing. I have papers here that 
                        says Mr. Fisher has long been 
                        labeled a member of the party as 
                        far back as 1944 and --

                                 WELCH
                        Senator, can we please drop this? 
                        We know he belonged to the Lawyers 
                        Guild.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Mr. Fisher was in contact with such 
                        well established Communist 
                        organizations such as --

                                 WELCH
                        Let us not assassinate this lad 
                        further, Senator.

                        You have done enough. Have you no 
                        sense of decency sir, at long last? 
                        Have you left no sense of decency? 

                                 MCCARTHY
                  (exploding)
                        I will finish this, Mr. Welch, 
                        whether you like it or not. Now, 
                        you recommended Mr. Fisher as 
                        counsel...

                                 WELCH
                        Mr. McCarthy, I will not discuss 
                        this with you further. If there is 
                        a God in heaven, it will do neither 
                        you nor your cause any good. I will 
                        not discuss it further. You, Mr. 
                        Chairman, may, if you will, call 
                        the next witness. 

           Welch rises from his chair with defiance and exits -- his 
           back turned towards McCarthy. 

                                 CHAIRMAN MUNDT
                        We’ll take a fifteen minute recess.

           A loud chatter erupts in the gallery. McCarthy rises from his 
           seat in a huff and exits.

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING- MOMENTS LATER

           McCarthy walks down the crowded corridor. A large crowd has 
           gathered no more than forty feet away from him.

           The attraction - a teary eyed Joseph Welch who is being 
           interviewed by an enormous contingent of the media.

           McCarthy turns and walks in the opposite direction, eager to 
           get away.

           EXT. THE MCCARTHY HOME - DAY

           Joe walks down the driveway, on his way to retrieve the 
           morning’s newspaper.

           He reaches it. Picks it up. Gazes across the street 
           momentarily. Stops.

           He sees a man leaning on his car -- staring in his direction. 
           A beat. The man gets in his car. Pulls away.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. MCCARTHY’S STUDY- NIGHT

           Joe peeks out the window, drink in hand. He sees a car idling 
           across the street again. 

           INT. GUN SHOP- DAY

           A .38. Joe holds it in his hand. Feels comfortable.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- DAY

           The noise of water running from upstairs. Joe quietly reads 
           the paper, gun at his side. 

           A loud, forceful KNOCK on the door. 

           Joe quickly reaches for the gun.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Jean?

           No answer.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Jean? Who’s here?

           He moves towards the door, gun behind his back. His hand 
           shakes. 

           Joe looks out of the window -- can only see the shadow of a 
           man. This does nothing to alleviate his fears.

           He reaches the door. Flings it open as if to catch the person 
           off guard with his gun drawn.

           Standing in front of him is LEONARD HALL, 55, a genial 
           Southerner. He is the Chairman of the RNC.

                                 HALL
                        Joe, what the hell is going on?

           Joe lowers the gun. Motions for Hall to come in.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m sorry. I thought --

                                 HALL
                        Thought what? I was a damn thief? I 
                        came to check up on you for 
                        chrissake.

           Hall takes a seat in the den. McCarthy follows suit. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 HALL (CONT’D)
                        What, you’re not going to offer me 
                        a drink? I know you’ve certainly 
                        got some.

           A vain attempt at humor. McCarthy rises and pours Hall a 
           drink.

                                 HALL (CONT’D)
                        How have you been holding up?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Holding up?

                                 HALL
                        The hearings were...difficult.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m fine.

                                 HALL
                        Good. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You don’t need to ass around. Tell 
                        me what’s going on.

                                 HALL
                        I, uh...have some news.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I do have a phone.

                                 HALL
                        This is delicate.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Dwight again?

           McCarthy hands Hall the drink. Takes a seat.

                                 HALL
                        No. That would be cleaner.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Who?

                                 HALL 
                        It’s Murrow.

           INT. CAR- DAY

           McCarthy and Don in the backseat, both dressed nicely. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m gonna tell Friendly where he 
                        can shove it as soon as he agrees 
                        to can this garbage. This -- this 
                        is about national security. That’s 
                        what I’ll stress. He can’t really 
                        want war.

           An uncomfortable silence.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take some sense into him. Turn 
                        on the charm.

           McCarthy smiles faintly.

           EXT. CBS HEADQUARTERS- DAY

           A towering building that bears the CBS logo. The car reaches 
           a security checkpoint just outside of the building.

           INT. CAR- MOMENTS LATER

           Don rolls down the window, addresses the Security Guard who 
           holds a clipboard in his hand.

                                 DON
                        Don Surine for Fred Friendly.

           The guard checks the clipboard, nods and waves them forward. 
           Don rolls the window up.

           A beat. 

           The car rolls to a stop. McCarthy reaches for the door 
           handle. Don puts his hand on Joe’s shoulder, stops him.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Joe, I’ve been thinking...it would 
                        be better if I took care of this 
                        myself.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What -- what do you mean?

                                 DON
                  (half convincing)
                        Like you said, we don’t want to 
                        have to deal with the questions. If 
                        you walk in there, the secretaries 
                        call their friends. Friends call 
                        the press. You know how it goes.

                        That wouldn’t be much fun, would 
                        it?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’ve got a hat in the back. I could 
                        throw it on and...

           Trying to lighten the mood --

                                 DON
                        Nothing could disguise that ugly 
                        mug.
                  (pause)
                        I’ll be back before you know it.

           Don exits before McCarthy can protest. McCarthy sits quietly, 
           troubled.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           McCarthy slumped over in the backseat. His tie is loosened, 
           sleeves rolled up. 

           Don enters, feebly attempts to mask his disappointment. He 
           offers nothing.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How did we make out?

                                 DON
                        Who do we know higher up?

           INT. RESTAURANT- NIGHT

           The haze of cigarette smoke.

           A five star restaurant. The type it takes months to get a 
           reservation at. McCarthy and Don sit at a table with CHARLIE 
           KORN, 60, a power broker.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hear they’re pushing Kennedy as 
                        the next candidate. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Please. We may have to do something 
                        about that.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You still want to take a shot at 
                        The White House?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Of course. It’s only a natural 
                        progression. 

           Charlie nods agreeably, does his best to conceal his 
           surprise.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        About this Murrow affair.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Appetizers first. We’ll have plenty 
                        of time for talk later.

           Charlie raises his glass to Joe. Their glasses clink.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           Empty glasses. Scraps of food on fancy china. The aftermath 
           of a feast. The men sit back in their chars, relaxed.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I won’t beat around the bush any 
                        long. Murrow, this special -- it 
                        can’t happen.

           A WAITER approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Can I get you anything else?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We’ll take three Old Fashioned’s.

           The waiter scurries away. McCarthy surveys the empty glasses 
           around them.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Finally, someone that can keep up. 
                        Don has always had the stomach of a 
                        teenage girl.

           The men laugh.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know I’m very sympathetic to 
                        the cause...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I knew we could count on ya. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 CHARLIE
                        But -- as much sway as I may have, 
                        I still have a man or two to answer 
                        to myself. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What happened to “I run the 
                        building”, “I can push anything 
                        through” --

           His tone taking a turn for the worse, Don tries to deflect --

                                 DON
                        Hey, bosses are a pain in the ass 
                        right.

           Not much laughter.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I tried. They’re going full speed 
                        ahead.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I knew we were talking to the wrong 
                        man.

           The waiter returns with their drinks. McCarthy downs his in 
           one long, desperate sip.

           He rises from his seat.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Have to use the boys room.

           He walks away. A silence. 

           Charlie removes a pack from cigarettes from his jacket, 
           offers one to Don who accepts it. They light up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When you need it, I’m sure we can 
                        find you some good work.

                                 DON
                        What do you mean?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sometimes we’re too far in the 
                        trees to see the forest.

           ON DON, unsure how to react --

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER

           McCarthy stumbles in, heads straight for a stall. He lowers 
           his head over the toilet. Clutches his stomach.

           INT. RESTAURANT- MOMENTS LATER

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s toxic.

                                 DON
                        The hearings could have gone better 
                        but our numbers still look good. 
                        The base is strong.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you familiar with John Morgan?

           Don nods.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Looking for a director of 
                        communications. He’s throwing 
                        together some new energy 
                        conglomerate. I could put in a good 
                        word.

                                 DON
                        No. Thank you.

           Reassuring himself until he believes it --

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        It’ll be okay. He’s gonna come out 
                        of this alright.

           He takes a long puff on the cigarette. The smoke trails 
           upwards.

                                       CUT TO:

           A PAIR of bloodshot, brown eyes open. They belong to McCarthy 
           and we are in a...

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- NIGHT

           A cup of coffee rests on a stand a few feet away from his 
           bed. A small pillar of smoke rises from it.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy looks around, bewildered. Checks his body- unsure of 
           his ailment. He searches for wounds on his arms. Legs. 
           Nothing.

           Don enters, relieved to see Joe conscious.

                                 DON
                        How you feeling, sunshine?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What happened?

                                 DON
                        Found you with your head in the 
                        toilet at Robertos. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So why the hell am I here?

                                 DON
                        You wouldn’t wake up.

           Panic rising...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Did anyone see?

                                 DON
                        No. I handled it. Had to call Jean 
                        though.

           McCarthy rolls his eyes.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        They made me.

           A silence. A DOCTOR enters, his expression glum. He gives Don 
           a glance that says “get out”.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I’ll leave you two alone.

           We follow Don as he exits. He shuts the door on his way out. 
           But peers through the WINDOW on it.

           The doctor appears stern, as if he’s delivering a lecture. 
           McCarthy nods agreeably, his mind clearly elsewhere.

                                 DON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        What’d he say?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

                                 MCCARTHY
                        The usual. You know doctors.

                                 DON
                        I know doctors?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nothing too important. How’s the 
                        response coming along?

                                 DON
                        Still looking into Murrow. Might 
                        have some questionable 
                        associations.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Good. Find them and get me a draft 
                        by noon.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- NIGHT

           Jean sits on the couch sipping a glass of wine. She stares at 
           the TELEVISION. Joe takes a seat alongside her, non chalant. 

           On the TELEVISION --

           EDWARD R. MURROW. His voice is strong, his words ring with 
           conviction. He stares directly into the camera. A piercing 
           glance.

                                 MURROW
                        The Senator has traveled far, 
                        interviewed many, terrorized some. 
                        He has interrogated a varied 
                        assortment of what he calls “Fifth 
                        Amendment Communists.” As Senator 
                        Flanders of Vermont said of 
                        McCarthy today: “He dons war paint; 
                        he goes into his war dance; he 
                        emits his war whoops; he goes forth 
                        to battle...and he proudly returns 
                        with the scalp of a pink army 
                        dentist.”

           ON THE COUCH --

           Jean picks up her glass of wine, it’s empty. She gets up; she 
           definitely needs a refill.

           McCarthy sits quietly...waiting for more.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           BACK TO THE TELEVISION --

                                 MURROW (CONT’D)
                        Upon what meat doth Senator 
                        McCarthy feed? Two of the staples 
                        of his diet are his investigation, 
                        protected by immunity, and the half 
                        truth. We herewith submit samples 
                        of both. First, the half-truth...

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           On Murrow. A dramatic pause.

                                 MURROW (CONT’D)
                        The actions of the Junior Senator 
                        from Wisconsin have caused alarm 
                        and dismay amongst our allies 
                        abroad and given considerable 
                        comfort to our enemies. And whose 
                        fault is that? Not really his. He 
                        didn’t create the situation, he 
                        merely exploited it, and rather 
                        successfully. Cassius was right. 
                        “The fault dear Brutus is not in 
                        our stars, but in ourselves.”

           BACK TO THE COUCH --

           McCarthy rises from the couch and shuts off the television. 
           He sits back down for a moment, distracted...perhaps in a 
           state of shock.

           A long, lingering silence washes over him.

           EXT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DC- DAY

           The crack of dawn. McCarthy scoots down the driveway, grabs 
           the newspaper.

           The headline:

           “MURROW TAKES COURAGEOUS, HEROIC STAND.”

           Joe gently lays the paper down on the ground, heads back 
           toward the house.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S STUDY- NIGHT

           A madhouse. Hordes of people running around. Expansive 
           lights. Microphones being set up. A camera focused on the 
           chair in which McCarthy normally sits.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy’s back is to us as he sits in his chair. He wipes 
           his brow as sweat drips down from it. Looks at the notes he 
           has prepared.

           A moment passes. Don stands alongside the camera. Looks at 
           Joe.

                                 DON
                        We’re on in three, two...

           He gives a signal to McCarthy who begins to speak.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow, 
                        Educational Director of the 
                        Columbia Broadcasting System, 
                        devoted his program to an attack on 
                        the work of the United States 
                        Senate investigating committee and 
                        on me personally as its Chairman. 
                        Now, over the past four years, he 
                        has made repeated attacks upon me 
                        and those fighting communists. Now, 
                        of course, neither Joe McCarthy nor 
                        Edward R. Murrow is of any great 
                        importance as individuals. We are 
                        only important in our relations to 
                        the great struggle to preserve our 
                        American liberties.

           A pause for dramatic effect.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Now ordinarily, I wouldn’t take the 
                        time out of the important work at 
                        hand to answer Murrow. However in 
                        this case I felt justified in doing 
                        so because Murrow is a symbol, the 
                        leader and the cleverest of the 
                        jackal pack which is always found 
                        at the throat of anyone who dare 
                        expose communists and traitors.

           In the corner, Jean nods in agreement, silently urging her 
           husband on.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I am compelled by that fact to say 
                        to you that Mr. Edward R. Murrow, 
                        as far as back as twenty years ago, 
                        was engaged in propaganda for 
                        communist causes. Mr. Murrow 
                        sponsored a communist school in 
                        Moscow...

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- NIGHT

           McCarthy picks at a plate of takeout. He isn’t enjoying it, 
           throws his fork down on the plate in frustration.

           The RING of the telephone. Another ring. It stops.

           The sound of FOOTSTEPS approaching. Jean enters, worry on her 
           face.

                                 JEAN
                        We need to go to the office.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           McCarthy sits at his desk, gazes out the window. Jean stands 
           at his side.

           Don faces them, a sheet of paper in his hand. He’s at a loss 
           for words.

                                 JEAN
                        A censure?

                                 DON
                        Yes.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        For what?

                                 DON
                        ‘Acting contrary to Senatorial 
                        ethics.’

           A hearty laugh from McCarthy.

                                 DON (CONT'D)
                         Impairing the dignity of the 
                        Senate. Obstructing constitutional 
                        processes. Abusing the members of 
                        the subcommittee including the 
                        Honorable General Ralph J. 
                        Zwicker.’ It goes on.

                                 JEAN
                        It’s ludicrous. What does this 
                        mean?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        It’s a public lynching. Our 
                        credibility, our poll numbers, any 
                        shots at running for higher 
                        office...it all goes right out the 
                        window.

                                 JEAN
                        Is it going to pass?

           A brief silence that could serve as an answer to the 
           question.

                                 DON
                        We need to go on the 
                        offensive...just to be certain. I’m 
                        scheduling face time with Wiley, 
                        Magnuson, Capehart. Anyone who 
                        might be on the fence.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Don’t stop there. 

                                 DON
                        Who else?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Every one with a vote. The bigger

                        they’ll regret it.

                        You make a strong case.

           A grin falls across McCarthy’s face.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        So you’re with us.

                                 SENATOR BUSH
                        I’m still weighing my options. You 
                        know how it goes.

           ...and that grin slowly fades.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Ah. Of course.

           EXT. BASEBALL FIELD- SUNSET

           Bobby Kennedy shifts in his seat on a small set of bleachers, 
           uncomfortable. Joe sits across from him. Waiting.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I need you here.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Let me think about it.

           Joe smiles, slaps Bobby on the shoulder in an all too 
           friendly way.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Don’t play hard to get. Come on. 
                        Who gave you a job?

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        Workers Comp reform. That’s all I 
                        asked.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        You should have let me work on it. 
                        Or the Flanders bill. Or the 
                        immigration proposal. Anything but 
                        the trial. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What?

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        We could have stuck together. Done 
                        some good things. You got in the 
                        way.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Bobby, don’t make me beg here.

           A sad silence.

                                 BOBBY KENNEDY
                        I appreciate you making the trip. 
                        It was good to see you.

           He rises, pats Joe on the shoulder, and stalks off into the 
           distance.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM- NIGHT

           Back to the white board. The military photos are gone. In 
           their place are three columns and a long list of names. 

           The columns read - “Yes”, “No”, and “Undecided”.

           The “Yes” and “No” columns aren’t long. Nearly even. The 
           “Undecided” column almost fills up the entirety of the board.

           EXT. RUSSELL SENATE BUILDING- DAY

           The lobby is bustling with traffic. McCarthy stands in a 
           corner, secluded. He watches the passersby, one of whom 
           happens to be Don. 

           McCarthy checks his watch.

                                 DON
                        We’ve already got an abstention.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Who?

                                 DON
                        Kennedy.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.

                                 DON
                        One vote won’t make or break us.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What will?

                                 DON
                        I talked to Frear.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And?

                                 DON
                        They’re voting in a bloc.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        For or against?

                                 DON
                        That depends.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        On what?

                                 DON
                        They want an apology. An admission 
                        of guilt.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Guilt?

                                 DON
                        If you apologize on the floor for 
                        Zwicker and the rest of it, this 
                        thing is dead in the water. Two 
                        words. That’s all it’ll take. We 
                        can salvage it all.

           Confusion washes over Joe’s face. A moment passes. That 
           confusion morphs into some certainty. Joe hardens.

                                 SENATOR FLANDERS (V.O.)
                        The Senator has tainted the 
                        prestigious history of both the 
                        United States Senate --

           INT. THE SENATE FLOOR- DAY

           A packed hearing. Both chambers are full. McCarthy waits in 
           the wings, out of sight.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           SENATOR RALPH FLANDERS speaks. He’s 55, balding. There’s 
           anger in his voice.

                                 SENATOR FLANDERS
                        --  and the great state of 
                        Wisconsin. He has badgered and 
                        abused our servicemen. He has 
                        denigrated any who stepped in his 
                        twisted path. He has hurled 
                        accusations at fine American 
                        citizens, regardless of their 
                        validity. And above all, he has 
                        brought out the worst in us. He has 
                        preyed on our fears and used them 
                        for his own political gain. He is a 
                        godless man.

           Flanders roams the floor, appeals to his fellow Senators. 
           McCarthy shakes his head in dissent.

                                 SENATOR FLANDERS (CONT’D)
                        We must send a message. This 
                        behavior cannot stand. The censure 
                        must pass. Regardless of our 
                        political leanings, there is a 
                        standard to uphold. A standard of 
                        honesty and decency. This standard 
                        does not exist in Senator 
                        McCarthy’s world. Let us show him 
                        that it most certainly does in 
                        ours.

           The Senator takes a seat amongst his colleagues, some of whom 
           shake his hand.

           McCarthy walks towards the center of the floor. All eyes turn 
           to him. As he takes his place at a podium, a silence falls 
           over the hall.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Well, that was a vote of 
                        confidence.

           Nobody laughs. 

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I’m here today, whether I agree 
                        with it or not...

           He trails off, loses his train of thought.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        What we have done has not been an 
                        easy task.

                        It has not been with a light heart 
                        nor a blind eye. And whether we’re 
                        from St. Louis or New York, 
                        Jacksonville or Green Bay, there 
                        are things every person can agree 
                        on. One of those things is 
                        Communism. Nobody here contends 
                        that communism is not a threat. Our 
                        differences lie in our approaches 
                        to combating it. I have sought to 
                        never give Communists comfort. To 
                        never allow our security to be 
                        compromised and to cut the 
                        Communist support system at its 
                        throat.

                        For this, I have no regrets. I do 
                        not apologize.

           A very large group of his colleagues exit. It’s a 
           distraction. He continues on.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I do not apologize for being tough 
                        on Communists. I do not apologize 
                        for doing what I think is right. I 
                        do not apologize --

           A second exodus. Another dozen of his colleagues. Only twenty 
           or so Senators fill the vast chamber. McCarthy may as well be 
           talking to himself.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        Senator Flanders alluded to, uh, a 
                        great number of errors I have made.
                        He speaks as if this is some sort 
                        of witch hunt. As if there is no 
                        evidence for our claims. As if I 
                        leafed through the pages of the 
                        phone book and designated 
                        communists at random. Despite the 
                        naysayers, there is much to be 
                        proud of. We have done good things. 
                        Important things. 
                  (’I am not over’)
                        This is far from over.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           The room is dark, blinds closed. 

           McCarthy leans against a makeshift bar adjacent to his desk. 
           He stares emptily into a bottle of vodka.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           Don stands with his arms folded, speechless.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How many?

                                 DON
                        We’ve got twenty one with us.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Twenty one, huh?

           He shakes his head, smiles faintly in disbelief.

                                 DON
                        They’re spineless, the rest of 
                        them. They don’t understand...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        All 70? They know what’s best for 
                        them.

                                 DON 
                        We’ve already started damage 
                        control. Once the censure vote is 
                        through, we’ll torch ‘em. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Forget it.

           A stunned silence.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT'D)
                        No more fighting.

           McCarthy reaches for the vodka, pours it into a glass. Fills 
           it to the brim. 

                                 DON
                        What about reelection? 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Two years is a long time.

           McCarthy raises the glass in front of him, looks directly at 
           Don.

                                 DON
                        Stop.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What?

                                 DON
                        Put it down.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy looks at Don as if he has three heads.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        One more drop is all it’ll take.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How do you --

                                 DON
                        I spoke to the doctor myself. 
                        Wanted to see if there was anything 
                        I can do to help or...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You didn’t trust me?

                                 DON
                        Should I have? You could keel over 
                        right here. That would be it. Is 
                        that how this is going to end?

           McCarthy raises the glass to his lips and chugs it until 
           there’s nothing left.

           He places it on the table. Don grabs it, takes it away.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is wrong with you?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What do you think you’re doing?

           McCarthy holds his hand out, waits for Don to give him back 
           the glass. Nothing.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        That’s why they sell them in sets.

           He takes another glass off the bar. Begins to pour a drink 
           into it.

                                 DON
                        Stop it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It’s one drink.

                                 DON
                        You think this is funny? You know, 
                        there are other people invested in 
                        your life besides you.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And I appreciate all two of them. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON
                        You’re not quitting now. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I think that’s for me to decide.

                                 DON
                        No, it’s not. I have worked my ass 
                        off for you. I have done everything 
                        you’ve ever asked.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And I appreciate it.

                                 DON
                        Yeah, well that’s not enough. We’ve 
                        come too far to stop now. You said 
                        it yourself, this isn’t over.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You think I believe that?

                                 DON
                        You said it.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You know me better than that.

                                 DON
                        We need to fight this.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I don’t think so.

                                 DON
                        If you were so tired of fighting, 
                        why didn’t you just apologize?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        It was never an option.

                                 DON
                        It was always an option.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        If I apologized, I’d look...

                 DON
                                   MCCARTHY
           Human.
                            Like a coward.

           A silence.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 DON 
                        So what are you going to do with 
                        the rest of your life?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        According to your friend, the 
                        doctor, I don’t have much time to 
                        begin with. So I suppose I don’t 
                        have anything to worry about. 

           Don shakes his head, disgusted. McCarthy raises his glass to 
           his lips again.

                                 DON
                        Don’t.

           McCarthy drinks it defiantly. Don storms out, slams the door 
           shut. McCarthy takes a seat at his desk. A piercing silence.

           INT. THE OFFICE- MOMENTS LATER

           Don stands hunched over a desk, on the phone.

                                 DON
                        Charlie, it’s me. Tell John Morgan 
                        I’m interested.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, KITCHEN- NIGHT

           Joe stands over the sink, a handful of dirty dishes in it. He 
           picks one up, begins to scrub it.

           The radio BOOMS in the background.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        ...and The Dow Jones rose one 
                        hundred and twenty today, marking 
                        the first big gain in the ten days.
                  (a pause)
                        In political news...

           Joe’s grip on the dish tightens. He continues to scrub. A 
           little harder this time.

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The Senate voted by an overwhelming 
                        margin today to censure Senator 
                        Joseph McCarthy.

           Joe scrubs furiously, his anger pouring out.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        The vote, largely uncontested by 
                        the Senator’s own party, passed by 
                        a tally of 67 to 22.

           The dish cracks. Joe puts it down, leans against the sink. 
           Inhales.

           INT. THE OFFICE- MORNING

           Joe heads toward his office, passes Jean on the way.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Tell Don I want to go over a few 
                        things with him.

           Joe keeps walking. 

                                 JEAN
                        Joe.

           He stops, turns to her. She rises from her desk, almost 
           whispering. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What is it?

                                 JEAN
                        Don isn’t here.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Where is he?

                                 JEAN
                        He’s got an interview.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        With who? The Post?

                                 JEAN
                        Not that -- a job interview.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What?

                                 JEAN
                        John Morgan.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I see.

           Joe keeps walking, opens the door and enters his...

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- CONTINOUS

           He shuts the door. Takes a seat at his desk. Idles. Unsure of 
           what to do.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- DAY

           The television booms. Joe watches it from the couch. It’s a 
           news program. The image of Eisenhower delivering a speech 
           fills the screen.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, KITCHEN- DAY

           Joe enters, looks to Jean who lounges at the table.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Has he called back yet?

           She shakes her head with a frown. Joe moves to the window. He 
           sees

           A SNOWFLAKE as it gently hits the ground.

                                 JEAN
                        First snow?

           Joe nods quietly, his glum expression reflected in the 
           window.

           EXT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, D.C.- DAY

           The bleakness of winter. Fresh snow on the driveway. A gust 
           of freezing wind.

           EXT. WASHINGTON BOOKSTORE- DAY

           A display window is pelted with snow. Among its contents, an 
           issue of Picture Review. Its cover article: “Whatever 
           Happened to Joe McCarthy?”

           The snow continues to fall, slowly covers the display.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- NIGHT

           Joe rubs his forehead, grimacing slightly. A KNOCK at the 
           door.

           Joe rises and heads down a...

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           HALLWAY

           ...where he reaches the front door. Opens it. It’s Don, 
           bundled up with snow all over his coat. 

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Don, I wasn’t expecting you --

                                 DON
                        Figured it was best if we spoke in 
                        person.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I called.

                                 DON
                        I know.

           An uncomfortable silence.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        You gonna let me freeze?

                                       CUT TO:

           The SHRILL WHISTLE of a teapot on the stove. A hand grips its 
           handle and picks it up.

                                       CUT TO:

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER

           Don sits at the kitchen table, cigarette lit. Joe pours him a 
           glass of tea, takes a seat across from him. 

                                 DON
                        Four months. That’s how long I 
                        lasted at Morgan’s firm.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You quit?

                                 DON
                        Guess you’re a hard boss to top.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m -- you know I’m not good at 
                        this.

                                 DON
                        Good at what?

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 MCCARTHY
                        Apologizing.

                                 DON 
                        It’s okay.

           A silence.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        Feeling alright?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Can’t even drink anymore. And the 
                        headaches -- two whiskeys and I’m 
                        out.

                                 DON
                        Maybe it’s a good thing. Have you 
                        stopped?

           Joe says nothing.

                                 DON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure it just takes time.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Yeah. Time.
                  (shifting gears)
                        You haven’t missed much.

                                 DON
                        Things have been quiet.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’m just as loud.

                                 DON
                        What’s changed?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nobody will listen. 

                                 DON
                        We’ll keep trying.

           ON JOE -- processing the implication of “we”. He smiles 
           faintly.

           INT. THE SENATE FLOOR- DAY

           Majority Leader LYNDON B JOHNSON sits at the head of the 
           room. 

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
                                 LYNDON B JOHNSON
                        We’ll now hear the Senator from 
                        Wisconsin.

           McCarthy, standing at his podium, addresses his colleagues.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I’d like to put forward a motion in 
                        response to the President’s plan to 
                        hold a summit in Geneva. I’m 
                        standing here to tell you that it 
                        is our duty to ensure that this 
                        summit does not go the route of 
                        Potsdam and Yalta. We cannot 
                        sellout again. I’d like to 
                        introduce Bill 6012 today which 
                        would require any summit to 
                        determine the status of the 
                        communist powers that have joined 
                        the Warsaw Pact. As you can read 
                        here on page twelve, paragraph 
                        three --

                                 LYNDON B JOHNSON
                        Senator, I don’t think we need to 
                        hear anymore.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        With all due respect, we certainly 
                        do.

                                 LYNDON B JOHNSON
                        Why don’t we take it to the floor 
                        for a vote?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Great.

           INT. THE SENATE FLOOR- LATER

           Johnson stares down at a piece of paper.

                                 LYNDON B JOHNSON
                        In response to Bill 6012, sponsored 
                        by the Senator from Wisconsin, 
                        there are 4 yays and 77 nays.

           On McCarthy -- crestfallen but doing his best to hide the 
           disappointment.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. HOTEL LOBBY- DAY

           McCarthy and Don walk quickly, with purpose.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And what am I supposed to talk 
                        about here?

                                 DON
                        The usual stuff.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Usual stuff?

                                 DON
                        You know what I mean. The room 
                        seats about seven hundred. Ray 
                        assured me it would be packed and 
                        he’s giving us more money than 
                        anybody else.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Just seven hundred?

                                 DON
                        Still plenty of people.

           McCarthy looks as if he has just digested some bad food.

           The two reach a set of doors with a sign labeled 
           ‘Auditorium’. They open them and enter the...

           INT. AUDITORIUM- CONTINOUS

           There are no more than seventy people seated. They spread 
           themselves out amongst the auditorium. It’s disconcerting for 
           both men.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What time were we supposed to give 
                        the speech?

                                 DON

                                 MCCARTHY
                        And what time is it now?

                                 DON
                        3:15.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           McCarthy reaches a small set of steps that lead to the podium 
           in the room. As he ascends, he looks at Don like a lamb 
           heading to the slaughter.

           Joe looks at the crowd and smiles.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I want to, uh, thank you all for 
                        coming out tonight.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, DEN- NIGHT

           McCarthy watches television with a glass of bourbon in hand.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        There’s no place I’d rather be.

           INT. AUDITORIUM- MOMENTS LATER

                                 MCCARTHY
                        In the army, I earned the nickname 
                        ‘Tail-Gunner Joe’. I was proud of 
                        it. It was about my fight. My, uh, 
                        determination. 

           INT. MILITARY OFFICE- DAY

           A 30 year old McCarthy sits back in a chair, places his feet 
           on a desk.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        I flew thirty two combat missions 
                        in the war. 

           INT. AUDITORIUM- MOMENTS LATER

                                 MCCARTHY
                        My determination has not waned in 
                        the face of what I have encountered 
                        in Washington.

           INT. MCCARTHY’S OFFICE- NIGHT

           McCarthy and Don’s argument is replayed inaudibly. Don storms 
           out.

                                 MCCARTHY (V.O.)
                        I have not lost my desire to fight.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. AUDITORIUM- MOMENTS LATER

                                 MCCARTHY
                        For the past eight months, I have 
                        sat and watched as the communists 
                        in this country have grown more 
                        safe and prosperous. For the past 
                        eight months, I have seen first 
                        hand how government operates when 
                        it is run by the inept. 
                  (pause)
                        President Eisenhower suggested last 
                        week in the New York Times that a 
                        summit conference with the Soviets 
                        would be held later this year.

           McCarthy pauses, wipes his brow. Still nervous.  

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        I say to you that you cannot offer 
                        friendship to tyrants and murderers 
                        without advancing the cause of 
                        tyranny and murder. Our objective 
                        must be the eradication of 
                        communism from the face of the 
                        Earth. Coexistence with the 
                        communists is neither possible nor 
                        honorable.

           A pause. He waits for any affirmation. Nothing.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT'D)
                        Communism cannot be, uh, tolerated. 
                        It cannot be...

           He trails off. Loses his train of thought.

                                 MCCARTHY (CONT’D)
                        We cannot embrace it. We must 
                        fight. Thank you.

           INT. BAR- NIGHT

           A cloudy haze of smoke. The place is run down, only a few 
           customers. The perfect hideout.

           Joe sits at the bar, stares into his empty glass. Signals the 
           bartender for another.

 4738b4014cafab9ffce9c964232bb9e6
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM- NIGHT

           Joe sits at the edge of the bed, pale. The DOCTOR stands 
           across from him.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        How long?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Hard to tell with any certainty.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Just give me an idea.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Maybe four, five months. You need 
                        to think about a transplant.

           EXT. HOSPITAL- NIGHT

           Joe exits the building, a patients wristband on his arm.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, D.C.- NIGHT

           Joe stumbles in the door, clearly drunk. He shuts the door.

           He enters the...

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, KITCHEN- CONTINUOS

           ...where he’s surprised to see Jean sitting at the table. 
           There’s a glass of wine next to her.

           Jean’s expression is stern. Her eyes immediately wander to 
           his wristband.

                                 JEAN
                        Where have you been?

           Joe gives her a kiss.

                        Office.

           Jean sniffs, can smell the booze from a mile away.

                                 JEAN
                        The scissors are in the drawer. Cut 
                        the wristband off before I put you 
                        to bed.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, BEDROOM- NIGHT

           Both husband and wife lie in bed, eyes open.

                                 JEAN
                        What’d the doctor say?

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Nothing to worry about.

                                 JEAN
                        Good.
                  (as to reassure herself)
                        Good.

           Joe turns over in bed, his back facing Jean.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Goodnight.

           Jean turns over too, her back facing his. Her eyes begin to 
           well.

                                 JEAN
                        Goodnight.

           INT. THE MCCARTHY HOME, STUDY- NIGHT

           TAP. TAP. TAP.

           Joe taps a pen repeatedly on the receiver of his phone. What 
           the hell is he doing?

           Jean enters, puzzled.

                                 JEAN
                        What are you --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Breaks up the wiretap.

                                 JEAN
                        The wiretap?

           Still tapping away --

                                 MCCARTHY
                        What’s up?

                                 JEAN
                  (stumbling)
                        I -- I’m headed to the store. You 
                        want the usual?

           Joe nods. Jean walks over, kisses him. He stops tapping and 
           embraces her.

                                 JEAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be back soon.

           Jean exits. Joe hangs up the receiver. A beat.

           We hear an ENGINE ROAR to life. Jean’s car. Joe reaches into 
           his pocket and retrieves a set of keys.

           He inserts the key in the bottom drawer of his desk. Removes 
           a pristine bottle of bourbon from it.

                                    DISSOLVE TO:

           Three shot glasses are filled with liquor. Joe looks at them, 
           contemplative. He picks one up. Throws it back.

           He reaches for the next. Drinks it. 

           And the third -- his hand shakes ever so slightly. Down the 
           hatch. 

           A moment passes. He slumps back in his chair.

           EXT. WASHINGTON MONUMENT- NIGHT

           A beautiful view overlooking the capitol. Joe and Don sit on 
           a bench, taking it all in. A long silence. 

           Joe surveys the monument and the pool of water that lies in 
           its shadow.

                                 DON
                        We’ve got another gig lined up for 
                        next Thursday. The crowd will be 
                        bigger this time. I promise.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        I owe you.

                                 DON
                        No, I’m still kicking myself about 
                        the last one. I should have made 
                        sure they could fill the space -- 
                        it was stupid.

                                 MCCARTHY
                        You did the best you could.

                                 DON
                        Just wait till Thursday.

           Almost laughing, as if it’s a year away...

                                 MCCARTHY
                        Thursday.

           EXT. BACKYARD- NIGHT

           A fire pit. Joe stands over it with a glass of whiskey at his 
           side.

           In it -- A MIX OF PICTURES. DOCUMENTS. FILES. Pictures of 
           people and places. General Zwicker. Fort Monmouth. Joseph 
           Welch. Army records.

           Joe steps back for a moment- takes it all in. He pours the 
           remainder of the whiskey into the fire pit. 

           Lights a match. Holds it for a fleeting moment - hesitant. As 
           if this is his life he is destroying.  

           He throws it into the pit. The pictures and files slowly 
           burn. 

           His past disintegrates before his eyes. Joe waits until 
           there’s nothing left but blackness. Slowly walks away.

           He shuts the door behind him.

           A plume of smoke rises from the pit. It fades into the 
           impenetrable darkness of night.

                                   FADE TO BLACK.

                                       THE END.
