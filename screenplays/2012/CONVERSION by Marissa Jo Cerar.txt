           Glasses clink.  People laugh.  Someone's playing an old Henry
           Mancini song on a piano.  

           Then we hear the sizzle of an old photobooth snapping
           pictures.

           FADE IN:

           INT. PHOTOBOOTH - NIGHT

           Two handsome and All-American YOUNG MEN snap a silly photo
           inside a dive bar photobooth.   

           FLASH.

           They pose like two, serious men.

           FLASH.

           The final pose reveals their truth: these people are in love.  

           One rests his head on the other's shoulder, and they stare
           at the camera.

           Each holds a melancholy gaze, as if they know this moment
           will pass, but wish it would never end.

           FLASH.

           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           The developed photos shoot from the slot and fall onto the
           bar floor.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. ATHENS, IL - DAY

           Visitors are welcomed to town with a sign: WELCOME TO ATHENS. 
           THIS LITTLE TOWN IS HEAVEN - DON'T DRIVE LIKE HELL THROUGH
           IT.  

           It's an overcast day in God's Country, and the porches of
           the mid-century homes are barren.  Dead Christmas trees line
           the ditches.  A few clumps of brown snow remain.  
           In a town this small there is one grocery store, three bars
           and six Christian churches.  

           EXT. CROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY

           This enormous brick church boasts a giant cross on its
           steeple.  The parking lot is crammed with Buicks, Fords, and
           Chevys.  There are no foreign cars.  Not here.  

           Today's church sign message is: GOD CAN MAKE ALL THINGS NEW -
           EVEN YOU!

           INT. CROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY

           A MAN (40's) in a fine suit commands the attention of a
           solemn, Anglo CONGREGATION.  Veins pop from his forehead, 
           sweat drips from his brow, but that doesn't diminish his
           wholesome good looks.  

           Meet Pastor DAVID WRIGHT.

                                 DAVID
                        ...A good tree cannot bring forth
                        evil fruit, nor can a contaminated
                        tree bring forth good fruit. 

           LIZ WRIGHT (40's), an icy woman with Stepford looks, sits in
           the front pew, her sad eyes fixed on David.  As he shouts
           his proclamations, Liz stares.  She couldn't blink if she
           wanted.  She wouldn't dare.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        False prophets shall rise and deceive
                        many, and the love of some shall
                        wax cold... 

           EXT. EXIT UP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           It's eerily quiet in the parking lot.  The only decor is a
           stone cross sculpture in the courtyard.  There are no plants,
           or flowers, or color here.

           DR. ROY (50's), a Ted Haggard-ish looking therapist, stands
           next to  a beautiful boy in painfully generic clothing. 
           This is CHRISTIAN (19), one of the boys from the photobooth,
           but now all life seems drained from his once vibrant eyes.  

           A suitcase rests at Christian's side.  Dr. Roy checks his
           watch as they wait, both keeping their eyes on the road
           leading to the parking lot.
           INT. CROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY

           Pastor David feeds his congregation wine and Jesus crackers
           at the head of the church.  Liz is the first to take a swig
           of the dark wine poured directly from her husband's hands
           into her mouth.

           Liz looks titillated as the wine oozes down her throat.  Her
           tongue glides over her lip, catching a lingering drop before
           she smiles at fellow worshipers and returns to her seat.

           EXT. EXIT UP HEADQUARTERS - LATER 

           Looking anxious and eager to please, Christian waits, watching
           as his parents, Pastor David and Liz Wright, shake hands
           with Dr. Roy.  

                                 DR. ROY
                        He's never fought us in ninety days. 
                        Not once.  

                                 DAVID
                        We're so proud, son.

           David extends a hand.  Tears build in Christian's eyes as he
           takes it.  A firm shake, and David releases his son's hand
           and turns to Dr. Roy. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        We are forever grateful.

           Liz squeezes Christian and runs her hand across his face. 
           As he walks the family to their car, Dr. Roy rubs Christian's
           back and lingers a bit too long.  Christian briefly flinches,
           but his parents don't notice.

                                 DR. ROY
                        Enjoy your freedom.  

           As they part, Dr. Roy hands all three of them a copy of the
           EXIT UP POST-CARE GUIDEBOOK.

                                 DR. ROY (CONT'D)
                        You're on your way.  

           EXT. HIGHWAY 55 - DAY

           Rain pelts the desolate highway as David's late-model Buick
           cruises in the slow lane. 
           INT. DAVID'S SEDAN - DAY

           Silence.  As David drives, Liz sips from an environmentally
           friendly water bottle with the "Crossroads Christian Church"
           logo on it.  

           Each swig seems to burn -- burn so good, that is.  

           Christian sits in back staring at the passing farmland.  

           Ready to connect with her son, but unsure how to go about
           it, Liz makes eyes with Christian through the rearview mirror.

                                 LIZ
                        We'll be excited to see you in the
                        front row at church again, baby.

                                 DAVID
                        Enough with the "baby" stuff, Liz. 
                        He is a man.  Call him by his name.

           She faces her son.  

                                 LIZ
                        Christian?  

           Christian smiles at his mother, an exhausted, world-weary
           smile.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        We planned a little something.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Oh, please...

                                 DAVID
                        It's no big deal, chief. 

           RE: "chief", Christian scoffs, trying not to laugh.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Then what?

                                 DAVID
                        It's a surprise.

           Christian sighs and once again turns to the cows, cornfields,
           and decrepit barns.
                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Oh joy.

           INT. RESTAURANTO ITALIANO - NIGHT

           SINGING WAITERS and WAITRESSES belt the classically cheesy
           tune, "That's Amore".  

           Around the corner at the bar, Liz downs a martini while
           keeping her eye on the singing servers in the main dining
           room.  

           The song comes to an end.  The DINERS applaud and return to
           their heaving plates of lasagna.  

           Liz leaves the bar and joins her family in the dining room. 
           She sits next to David, who's sitting across from Christian
           and a bubbly gal-next-door, BETTY (19).  

           No one has touched their food. 

                                 LIZ
                            (slurring)
                        Long line in the little girl's room.

           Christian just nods, embarrassed by his mother's slurred
           speech, but no one will speak of it.  

           A ginger-haired WAITRESS grabs Liz's empty wine goblet and
           slides her a fresh glass of bloody red.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sorry about the wait, Mrs. Wright.  

                                 LIZ
                        No worries.

           Liz smiles and delicately sips her drink.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Everyone else good?

                                 DAVID
                        Dandy.  

           The waitress moves to another table.  

                                 BETTY
                        Shall we?
           They close their eyes and bow their heads.

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        Be present at our table, Lord.  Be
                        here and everywhere adored.  

           Some of the other diners look a smidge uncomfortable while
           Betty prays, but they're respectful and quiet.

                                 THE WRIGHTS
                        Amen.

                                 DAVID
                        Fantastic.  

                                 BETTY
                        Just a little something I picked up
                        from Dad.

           Liz soaks in her son's presence, whips out her camera phone,
           and shoots.

                                 LIZ
                        Just look at you two!  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Come on, mom.

           David slides Christian a couple fifty-dollar bills.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        What's this?

                                 DAVID
                        Pastor Frank has already given the
                        OK, so if you want to catch a movie,
                        or whatever, feel free.

           David winks at his son.  Christian swallows nervously.  Betty
           bats her eyes as Christian palms the cash.

                                 BETTY
                        What a blessing.  

           EXT. RESTAURANTO ITALIANO - LATER

           Happily buzzed, Liz squeezes Christian and Betty before
           walking toward David's car. 
                                 LIZ
                        Have fun tonight, darlings.

           David is stone-sober as he helps his tipsy wife into the
           car.

                                 BETTY
                        Thanks for dinner, Pastor, Mrs.
                        Wright.

                                 DAVID
                        Give my best to your father.

           Christian waves at his parents as they drive away.  

                                 BETTY
                        I've seen it all.  Parents arranging
                        marriages in central-fucking-
                        Illinois.

           Christian's eyes pop.  Betty's a whole new girl now that the
           parents are gone.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        When the old man slid me the cash I
                        instantly flashed back to sixth
                        grade.

                                 BETTY
                        What's next, dropping us at the
                        mall? 

           Christian laughs.  Betty yanks Christian's hand and pulls
           him towards her new Ford Mustang.

           INT. BETTY'S FORD - MOMENTS LATER

           Betty cranks the wheel and speeds out of the restaurant's
           parking lot.  She scrolls through her iPod, searching for
           the perfect playlist.

           As Betty speeds down the road, Christian holds on for dear
           life in the passenger seat, but he's finally enjoying himself. 

           Betty pulls a joint from her console and offers it to
           Christian.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Don't tell me you're testing me,
                        too?
                                 BETTY
                        Christian, seriously.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        But, your dad --

                                 BETTY
                        -- is a chauvinist asshole.  

           Christian glances at her, tries to figure her out.

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        I'll wear the mask.  Play nice until
                        I'm in college, and then sayonara,
                        you know?

           Christian nods, still skeptical of Betty.  But she soldiers
           on and lights her joint, takes a hit, and passes it to
           Christian.  

                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        We're what - twenty minutes from
                        the capital city, and it's like
                        we're in a time machine.  No
                        brownies, or Jews, or gays.  I mean
                        you get me, right?

           Christian nods.  He gets her.

           INT. THE WRIGHT HOME - NIGHT

           The room is sea of beige with a baby grand piano tucked in
           the corner.  It's silent as David reads scripture and jots
           down notes.  

           Liz sits next to him, with a book in her lap, but she's only
           pretending to read.  Her cell phone is tucked in its pages,
           and she's flipping through the pictures she snapped of
           Christian and Betty at dinner.  

                                 LIZ
                        David.

           David turns to his wife.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Should we have pushed this on him
                        so soon?  This date?
                                 DAVID
                        Dr. Roy said not to waste any time. 
                        You have your guidebook.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes, but shouldn't we just let him
                        find a girl on his own?

                                 DAVID
                        We invested in Christian's treatment. 
                        We musn't fiddle with their fine
                        work.  We'll follow the guidelines
                        and pray for the good news to keep
                        on coming, for his continued success.

           David gives his wife a stern glance. 

                                 LIZ
                        Of course.

           David smiles and turns his attention to back to his book.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Honey?

           David closes his book, tired of all the chatter.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Christian will be on his own soon. 
                        College, probably out of state --

                                 DAVID
                        And?

                                 LIZ
                        Have you thought about adopting? 
                        Maybe Haiti.  All those poor children
                        orphaned after the quake.

                                 DAVID
                        That's a bit premature.

                                 LIZ
                        Christian is going to leave, and
                        then what?  

           David sees the worry, the anxiety in his wife's eyes.
                                 DAVID
                        Maybe a mission, together.  This
                        summer.  Yes. 

           David pats Liz on the thigh.  

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes that little head of yours
                        conjures up some good.

           Liz accepts David's patronizing gesture and reaches for the
           remote.  Not so fast - David grabs it and flips the TV on. 
           Liz accepts defeat and grits her teeth as Bill O'Reilly's
           face graces the TV.

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           MUSIC BLASTS from Betty's Ford, parked on a desolate country
           road. 

           INT. BETTY'S FORD - NIGHT

           Pot smoke fills the interior of the car while Christian and
           Betty massacre Madonna's "Like a Prayer".

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Just like a prayer, your voice can
                        take me there -- 

                                 BETTY
                        Just like a muse to me, you are
                        mystery --

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Just like dream, you are not what
                        you see --

                                 BETTY AND CHRISTIAN
                        Just like a prayer, no choice your
                        voice can take me there!

           The song comes to an end, and Christian takes a swig of
           bottled water.

                                 BETTY
                        I fucking love that song!

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Hush now.  Don't sing a holy song
                        and then curse.
                                 BETTY
                        God doesn't mind if we smoke pot,
                        but we can't say fuck?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        God gave us pot.

                                 BETTY
                        And "fuck".  

           Christian laughs and reclines in his seat. 

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Feels good to laugh.  To actually
                        hear something funny and laugh
                        without feeling obligated.

           Betty casually smiles, having no idea how much this moment
           means to him.

                                 BETTY
                        We're kindred, us pastors' kids.  I
                        imagine your house is as "spirited"
                        as mine.

           Pleasantly high, Christian closes his eyes and leans back.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        My father just wants to see me in
                        Heaven.  There are worse things,
                        no?

           Betty smirks and takes a hit.  She inhales, reclines her
           seat and nudges Christian. 

           Christian takes the joint and gazes at Betty.  As Betty's
           eyes close, she exhales a plume of smoke.  

           Christian takes a deep breath and leans toward her.  He's
           ready to seize the moment and kiss Betty, but her iPhone
           VIBRATES, and the moment is lost.  

                                 BETTY
                            (checking a text)
                        Shit!  I have to meet Caleb.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Caleb?
                                 BETTY
                        My boyfriend.  Fuck!  I totally
                        spaced it.

           Christian is at a loss.  He then smiles and looks at Betty, 
           waiting for the punchline that never comes.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Shut up.

           She smiles, although she doesn't know why.

                                 BETTY
                        You shut up.

           Her thumbs dance across her iPhone.  Christian watches,
           confused.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I thought...you know.  We were having
                        fun.

           Oblivious to Christian's embarrassment and intentions, Betty
           flips on the lights, whips out her compact, and touches up
           her face.  

                                 BETTY
                        We can hang tomorrow, get a coffee
                        or something.  Or you could come
                        with tonight?  You'll love Caleb.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        What about me?  What's wrong with
                        me?

           Disconcerted, Betty turns to Christian.  He's glaring at
           her, and she doesn't know why.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        What was all of this?

           Betty smiles and nudges him, trying to lighten the mood.

                                 BETTY
                        Come on.

           Christian just stares at her, and his gaze is getting severe.
                                 BETTY (CONT'D)
                        Shit, Christian.  I mean - eighties
                        night, Zoo Babies in the city?

           Christian looks horrified.  He can't even look at Betty now.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I have no idea what you're talking
                        about.

                                 BETTY
                        Zoo Babies!  I use my sister's old
                        ID.  I've seen you there like twelve
                        times.

           Christian starts to panic.  He is terrified and humiliated.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I have no idea what you're talking
                        about.

                                 BETTY
                        Seriously --

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Take me the fuck home!  

           Betty's smile fades.  Instinctively, her hand grabs the door
           handle.

           Christian realizes he's scared this girl, so he collects
           himself, turns away from her, and stares out his window. 
           There he spots a deer prancing along the side of the road.

           He closes his eyes.

                                 CHRISTIAN (CONT'D)
                        Please, just take me home.

           EXT. THE WRIGHT HOME - NIGHT

           As Betty's Ford pulls into the driveway, Christian's passenger
           door flings open.  He hops out.

                                 BETTY
                        Christian, I'm sorry!  I just thought
                        you knew that I knew --

           Christian can't let her say the words.  He slams the door
           and marches up the walkway to his house.  
           As Christian enters his home, he purposefully avoids the
           sign hanging by the front door: As for me and my house, we
           will serve the Lord.

           INT. THE WRIGHT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Christian oozes with disdain and dread.  He tries to slip
           past Liz, who's sitting by the fireplace, drinking something
           clear and flipping through an old photo album.

                                 LIZ
                        Honey!

           Liz jumps up and waves a photo in his face.  It's a nine-
           year-old Christian, a tiny boy, posing like a body builder.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Remember this?

           Christian nods, anxious to leave and get some privacy.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Fourth grade, just a couple years
                        before you realized you didn't need
                        me anymore.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Night, mom.

                                 LIZ
                        Not so fast!  Tell me all about
                        your night.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        It's late.  

                                 LIZ
                        Five minutes with your old ma won't
                        kill you.

           Liz sits and pats the empty spot next to her near the fire. 
           Christian takes a moment before giving in and sitting.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        How'd we do?

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        She's nice. 
                                 LIZ
                        She likes you.  

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        They all do. 

                                 LIZ
                        I saw her gazing into those baby
                        blues.  

           Christian can't take anymore.  He kisses his mom's forehead
           and rises.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        I'm spent, mom, really.

                                 LIZ
                        So good to have you back.

                                 CHRISTIAN
                        Yep. 

                                 LIZ
                        And I don't just mean at home.  

           Christian gives her a melancholy smile before heading
           upstairs.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                            (calls out)
                        Sleep tight.

           He's gone.

           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Christian glances at his barren walls with a look of doom.  

           A lone suitcase sits by his bed.  He opens his drawers and
           finds his clothes neatly arranged and tucked away.  He half-
           laughs and sighs.  

           Christian plops at his desk where his EXIT UP POST-CARE
           GUIDEBOOK waits.  He glances at the book for a second and
           then diverts his eyes to his laptop. 

           Christian logs onto his GMAIL and scrolls.  Lots of SPAM,
           but one message grabs his attention.  
           Christian's breath grows rapid.  He looks at the subject
           line: HEARTACHE.  He gets up and looks out the window.  He
           flips through channels on TV, but he can't keep his eyes off
           his laptop.

           He returns to his desk and looks at the email's sender, IAN. 
           Christian closes his eyes.  He opens them, but IAN is still
           there.  He can't escape Ian.

           Christian clicks "DELETE" and "EMPTY TRASH".  

           Christian paces.  He punches his bed.  He wants to scream,
           but he can't.  

           He grabs his EXIT UP POST-CARE GUIDEBOOK and flips through
           it.  His eyes pass a series of phrases: DEALING WITH URGES --
           FREE FROM HELL -- MALE BONDING -- SMOTHERING MOTHER.

           Christian throws his guidebook on the floor and reclines on
           his bed.  Tears stream down his face.

           INT. THE WRIGHT BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Liz is sauced.  Her eyes droop, but she manages to keep them
           open as David thrusts her.  Neither makes a sound, Liz just
           keeps staring at the ceiling until David utters a slight
           moan, kisses her, and rolls over.  

           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Face puffy from tears, Christian reclines on his bed, staring
           at the photostrip: he's with the other beautiful boy, IAN
           (21).  

           Christian looks at the photo fondly - two lovers, posing in
           a bar photobooth.  The bar's name, ZOO BABIES, is printed on
           the side of the strip.  

           Christian wipes his tears, takes a seat at his desk and types.

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                        I'm sorry I took off without saying
                        goodbye.  I don't mean to be trouble.  

           Christian plops his suitcase on his bed, opens it and places
           the photostrip from Zoo Babies inside.  

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I can't help it.  I still love --
           Christian looks toward his open window as his printer shoots
           out one sheet of paper.

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        -- I still love the wrong way, and
                        I just don't feel comfortable living
                        in your house, shaming you.  

           Christian closes his suitcase and sets it on the floor.  He
           grabs the paper from the printer, closes his laptop and leaves
           the paper on his desk. 

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. THE WRIGHT KITCHEN - MORNING

           David sips his coffee while reading the morning paper, The
           Menard County Review.  Liz tops his coffee off and hands him
           a fresh napkin before making herself a plate.

           Liz glances at the empty plate next to them.

                                 LIZ
                        How much longer should we give him?

           David checks his watch and smiles.

                                 DAVID
                        It's only nine.  Let him enjoy his 
                        own bed.

           INT. HALLWAY - LATER

           Liz taps on Christian's door.

                                 LIZ
                        Rise and shine, son of mine.

           Silence.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Christian, you'll sleep your life
                        away.

           She knocks again.  No answer, so she turns the knob and steps
           inside.
           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Liz gasps -- Christian's bed is made and empty.  She shivers,
           hurries to the open window and pokes her head out.  

           Liz looks outside and sees nothing out of the ordinary. 
           Both cars are in the driveway.  All seems well.

           Now bewildered, Liz spots the letter on Christian's desk,
           next to his EXIT UP POST-TREATMENT GUIDEBOOK.  

           Liz opens the letter and reads.

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                        I know God will forgive me for
                        leaving so soon, but He could never
                        forgive me for having another impure
                        thought.   

           Liz panics.  

                                 LIZ
                        No. 

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.)
                        You've done your job as parents. 
                        You tried. 

           Liz grabs the land line and rapidly punches a number.  She
           hears a faint cell phone RINGING and follows the sound to
           the closet.

                                 CHRISTIAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Take care of each other.  Your son,
                        your Christian.

           Liz drops the land line, but the cell rings one last time.  

           Liz stands at the closet door, terrified.  She turns the nob
           and opens the door.

           Liz SCREAMS.

                                                               SMASH CUT:

           (cid:13)           (cid:13)           OVER BLACK:

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                        Christian! 

           FADE IN: 

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The parking lot is half full.  It's a gray morning in central
           Illinois as MOURNERS walk toward a freshly dug gravesite. 

                                 WOMAN
                        Our Lord and His mysterious ways.

                                 ANOTHER WOMAN
                        Poor boy died in his sleep.  What
                        are we to learn from that?

           Liz and David stand nearby.  David remains calm and strong,
           but Liz can hardly keep her puffy eyes open as people shake
           hands and offer sympathetic looks.

           David's brow furrows when he sees a slight boy approaching. 
           This is IAN (21), the boy from the photobooth.  

           David gives him a look, but Ian won't retreat.  He approaches
           David, offers his hand --

                                 IAN
                        I just want to know what happened.

                                 DAVID
                        Go.  I won't say it again.  

           David and Liz step away from Ian and walk toward Christian's
           gravesite.  

           Ian remains with the parked cars.

           EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

           An ELDERLY PASTOR gives a somber speech to a small group
           presiding over Christian's open grave.  

                                 ELDERLY PASTOR
                        He will wipe away from them every
                        tear from their eyes.  Death will
                        be no more; neither will there be
                        mourning, nor crying, nor pain... 
           Betty stands by her well-dressed PARENTS.  In shock, she
           just stares at the coffin.  

           Liz is numb.  Instead of watching her son's casket disappear
           into the earth, she watches the street where Ian stands by
           his car, alone and devastated, and staring right back at
           her.

           INT. THE WRIGHT HOUSE - DAY

           PEOPLE eat, drink, and try to be respectful.  

           From across the room, while pretending to listen to the
           onslaught of condolences, Liz watches David chat with a
           beautiful, corn-fed girl, ASHLEY (20's).  

           Liz watches until David catches her.  Ashley immediately
           ends her conversation with David and approaches Liz with
           open arms. 

                                 ASHLEY
                        Mrs. Wright.

           Liz remains dead in Ashley's embrace.  David approaches.

                                 DAVID
                        Ashley has generously offered to
                        step in and pick up the slack.

                                 LIZ
                        Of course she has.

                                 ASHLEY
                        I can cook, do laundry --

           Liz yanks Ashley's glass of wine right out of her hand and
           navigates her way through packs of mourners like she's in a
           funhouse maze.  

           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - DAY

           Liz smells Christian's pillow, sheets, and blanket.  She
           swallows the rest of her wine and sits on the floor with his
           suitcase.  She clicks it open.  Everything is still in it --
           his shirts, socks, and his photo with Ian at Zoo Babies.  

           The doorknob turns, and Liz locks the photo back in the
           suitcase.  David steps in, looking concerned.
                                 DAVID
                        Liz.  

                                 LIZ
                        David.

                                 DAVID
                        This isn't healthy.

                                 LIZ
                        What would you prefer?

                                 DAVID
                        We have a house full of people.

                                 LIZ
                        How are you so wooden?

           David is silent.  He just stares at her, uncomfortable with
           all this raw emotion.  He's ready to leave this room, but
           Liz squeezes Christian's pillow and he can't go yet.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        My boy.

           David watches, helplessly.  

                                 DAVID
                        Liz, he's in God's hands.  

           David sits with his wife and wraps an arm around her.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        In some ways I think he was brave. 

           Liz pulls away, so startled she can no longer produce tears.

                                 LIZ
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        No more temptations.  He's free.

           Liz just stares at David as if meeting him for the first
           time.  Her eyes move to the EXIT UP post-care guidebook, and
           she grabs it.

                                 LIZ
                        You said this would fix everything.  
           David rises.

                                 DAVID
                        Join me downstairs when you've
                        collected yourself. 

           Fed up, David leaves the room.

           INT. STAIRWELL - LATER

           With her glass of wine in one hand and the GUIDEBOOK in the
           other, Liz steps out of Christian's room and sits at the top
           of the stairs.

           Liz takes a drink and watches people eat, drink, and speak
           in hushed tones.  Disgusted, Liz takes the book and HURLS it
           down the stairs.

           For a moment, everything stops.  Liz sees the concerned looks
           on her guests' faces, but no one does or says anything. 
           They glance at her.  They glance at the book, and that's it.  

           Liz glares at David, who manages to keep a happy face.  Like
           the others, he's carrying on like this is a cocktail party.  

           He's carrying on as if nothing happened.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - MORNING

           Liz is passed out on the bed.  Her eyes flutter when the
           blinds are pulled and the dark room starts to fill with
           sunlight.  

           Liz opens her eyes to find David, smiling and standing over
           her with a steaming cup of coffee.

                                 DAVID
                        And how are we this morning?

           Liz mumbles something incomprehensible.  She's beyond groggy.

           David hands her the coffee.  She accepts the warm mug and
           takes a soothing sip.  

           David rubs the temples of her head.  Upon his touch, Liz
           grimaces and pulls away.
                                 LIZ
                        Don't.

                                 DAVID
                        Let's get you out of here.  I have
                        a bath running.

                                 LIZ
                        I don't want a bath.

           Liz does everything in her power to keep from looking into
           his eyes.

                                 DAVID
                        Come with me - I have a surprise.

           David manages to lift Liz from the bed.  She gives in and
           follows him out of the room.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As David and Liz leave Christian's room --

                                 DAVID
                        I wanted to tell you when you had a
                        clear head --

                                 LIZ
                        Good luck with that.

                                 DAVID
                        -- but since you insist on being a
                        grouchy goose I'll tell you now.

           Liz takes a deep breath and an even deeper sigh.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Aus.  It's a village in Namibia.  I
                        pulled some strings.  I'll run the
                        mission there.  We leave tomorrow
                        night and come back in six weeks.  

           Liz stares at him in disbelief.  If this situation weren't
           so horrendous, she'd laugh. 

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        It's exactly what we need right
                        now.

           Liz freezes.
                                 LIZ
                        We don't need a distraction, David. 
                        We need answers. 

           David looks at his reflection in the hall mirror.  He fixes
           some stray hairs, examines his pores, but he can't look at
           the photo of his son staring right at him.

                                 DAVID
                        What else is there to know?  

                                 LIZ
                            (as if speaking to a
                             6th grader)
                        I want to know why my son hung
                        himself after therapy that was
                        supposed to cure him. 

           David turns to his wife and speaks to her so casually it's
           as if he's ordering dinner.

                                 DAVID
                        When we go to Aus, you'll have an
                        entire village of children to tend
                        to.

                                 LIZ
                        They are not my children.  

                                 DAVID
                        You're still my wife, and we both
                        have responsibilities to the church. 

                                 LIZ
                        If you go on a mission you're going
                        alone.

           David stares her down, but Liz doesn't back off.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I'm not going, but I'm sure Ashley
                        will be happy to accompany you.  

           There's nothing David can say.  Liz has won this battle, so
           she walks into the bathroom and slams the door.

           INT. LIZ'S BATHROOM - DAY

           The room is steamy.  Liz's face is pressed to the small
           window, peering through the blinds.  
           Naked, she watches David fill his car's trunk with luggage. 
           He gets in his car and is about to pull out of the driveway
           when he sees her.  She pulls the blinds and steps away.

           Liz wipes the condensation from the mirror and looks at her
           skeletal body.  Her skin is flawless, with the exception of
           a scar on her lower abdomen.  

           She smiles as she runs her hand across the Caesarean scar. 
           And then she remembers, and her smile fades.

           EXT. EXIT UP HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           With a fierce look of determination on her face, Liz strides
           toward the entrance of EXIT UP.  

           INT. EXIT UP HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz marches down the hallway, passing rooms full of YOUNG
           MEN deep into the process of Conversion Therapy. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!

           INT. MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Liz sees a dozen MEN (18-20's) like zombies, all lined up in
           metal folding chairs, watching an AWKWARD MAN (40's) pummel
           a pillow with a wiffle-ball bat.  

           With each hit the man shouts:

                                 AWKWARD MAN
                        Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom!

           Some men flinch.  Others stare, looking comatose.

                                 AWKWARD MAN (CONT'D)
                        Why, why, why, why?!

           INT. ANOTHER MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Here, Liz watches a similar group of homogenous MEN sit in
           an intimate setting.  A KEN-DOLL GUY (40's) commands their
           attention with forced displays of machismo.  

                                 KEN DOLL
                        Only affirming our manhood, affirming
                        our place in the world of men, can
                        bring us peace.  
           The men listen hopefully as Ken Doll circles the group,
           squeezing shoulders and patting backs.

                                 KEN DOLL (CONT'D)
                        Together, we'll heal our father
                        hunger and reverse the wounds left
                        by smothering mothers.  We will
                        heal our sense of estrangement from
                        men and our own masculinity! 

           The hopeful men applaud.

           INT. REC ROOM - DAY

           Liz finally sees a lounge of sorts filled with stacks of
           Bibles and other reading material: JOURNEY INTO MANHOOD, MEN
           AT THE CROSS and DARE TO SOAR.  

           YOUNG MEN recline in pleather chairs with their eyes closed 
           as a mantra plays: 

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        You are a man.  You are strong. 
                        You have proven yourself as a man
                        among men.  You are whole.  You are
                        a man.  You are strong.  You have
                        proven yourself as a man among men.

           INT. EXIT UP HALLWAY - DAY

           A hand grasps her shoulder.  Liz jerks, turns, and finds Dr.
           Roy.

                                 DR. ROY
                        Mrs. Wright?

           INT. DR. ROY'S OFFICE - LATER

           Liz has mascara smudged around her eyes.  She looked awful
           before, but her eyes are approaching Tammy Faye status.

           As Dr. Roy speaks in an oblivious and matter-of-fact tone,
           Liz looks behind his sweaty mug at a framed TIME MAGAZINE
           COVER.  

           On the magazine cover Dr. Roy's arms are wrapped around a
           thick woman.  The headline reads: EX-GAY? 
                                 DR. ROY
                        Like all of our patients, we tried
                        to find the root of your son's
                        condition.  First we explored the
                        father-son relationship as a possible
                        cause for his SSA.  

           Liz looks lost.  

                                 DR. ROY (CONT'D)
                        Same Sex Attraction.  Growing up, a
                        great number of men have issues
                        with their fathers that contribute
                        to their SSA.  Often the father-son
                        relationship is marked by either
                        actual or perceived abandonment,
                        extended absence, or hostility. 

                                 LIZ
                        So you're saying...what are you
                        saying?

                                 DR. ROY
                        Like all human experiences, this is
                        not universal, and we never thought
                        Christian's relationship with his
                        father contributed to his SSA.  He
                        never mentioned it, and nine out of
                        ten of our patients fit into another
                        group.  Smothering Mother Syndrome.  

                                 LIZ
                        Smothering Mother?

                                 DR. ROY
                        While some patients perceived their
                        fathers as abandoning, it's common
                        for them to become so dependent on
                        their mothers they feel alienated
                        from the male world and find comfort
                        in female companionship.  They then
                        label women and femininity as
                        superior to men and masculinity.

           Silence.  Liz takes a moment to process all she's heard and
           she looks horrified.

                                 LIZ
                        I smothered my son?  
           Dr. Roy is silent.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I smothered my son and this is the
                        result?

                                 DR. ROY
                        You're not alone --

                                 LIZ
                        Then there are other casualties?!?  

                                 DR. ROY
                        That's not what I meant.

                                 LIZ
                        Then what?  That's what you tell a
                        mother who just lost her son?

                                 DR. ROY
                        Mrs. Wright --

                                 LIZ
                        What am I supposed to do with that?

                                 DR. ROY
                        Please, he's in God's hands now.

                                 LIZ
                        God's hands?  Can't you men come up
                        with something better than that? 
                        God's hands?  

           Liz jumps up and charges for the door.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I smothered my son!  

           Suddenly, she looks pale.  She's silent, and then:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I killed my son?

                                                               FADE OUT:
           OVER BLACK: 

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                        You've reached The Wrights, please
                        leave a message and have a blessed
                        day.

           BEEP.

                                 MAN (V.O.)
                        Liz, please.  Your mother is worried. 

           BEEP.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Hi, honey.  It's Karen.  We miss
                        you in church and Bible study. 
                        Please just call, email -- something
                        to let us know you're okay.

           BEEP.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Liz.  I'm in Aus.  I'm in Aus and
                        I'm hearing things.  
                            (sigh)
                        You're still representing our church. 
                        Please, Liz, don't forget the church.

           BEEEEEEEEP.

           FADE IN:

           INT. LIZ'S HOME - DAY

           Trash cans overflow with empty bottles of booze.  This house
           is a damned mass.

           INT. LIZ'S BATHROOM - DAY

           Liz is on the tiled floor, eyes closed and wearing nothing
           but panties and one of Christian's Hedwig and the Angry Inch
           t-shirts.  

                               SUPER: ONE WEEK LATER

           Liz's eyes snap open, and it's instantly clear that her smooth
           skin has been taken captive by dark circles and a sallow
           tint.  
           In a daze, she plops onto the toilet, yanks her panties down
           and slides off.  She can't sit on the toilet, and she pees
           all over herself.  

           Liz strips and looks in the mirror.  She is horrified by
           what she finds: an emaciated, haggard woman.  

           She can't look at her reflection any longer, so she kills
           the lights. 

           INT. CHRISTIAN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Naked, Liz stumbles into Christian's room.  It's still
           pristine, including a Bible that was so neatly placed on his
           bedside table - like a hotel. 

           She opens his closet and tears everything out, including his
           packed suitcase.  She only stops when the suitcase opens and
           the photostrip of Christian and Ian at ZOO BABIES falls out
           and catches her eye.  

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT

           Liz stumbles out of her sedan.  It's "parked" on the curb
           and obstructing the sidewalk, but she doesn't seem to notice
           or care.  

           Liz takes a look at herself in the side mirror - she tries
           to smooth her hair, but gives up.  This is as good as it's
           gonna get.  

           Liz looks at the old block of storefronts near the Capitol
           building that boasts a bronzed statue of Abraham Lincoln.  

           Across the railroad tracks, Liz sees a SKINNY KID (22) in a
           Unicorn T-Shirt smoking a cigarette with a long, plastic
           filter.  He leans against a hole-in-the-wall bar, ZOO BABIES.  

           INT. ZOO BABIES - NIGHT

           Liz takes a deep breath and saunters inside.  This divey
           joint is empty except for an OLD QUEEN playing the piano and
           identical twins, RAMON and LAMON (20's), tending bar.  

           As Liz steps inside and searches, Ramon and Lamon size her
           up.  She certainly doesn't fit here.  

                                 RAMON
                        Someone's lost.
           Liz scans the joint, and her eyes fix on an old photobooth
           in the back corner of the bar.   

                                 LIZ
                        Grey Goose on the rocks.  Tall.

                                 RAMON
                        Girl's got a score to settle.

                                 LAMON
                        Long day?

                                 LIZ
                        Long life.

                                 RAMON & LAMON
                        We hear you.

           Lamon fills a tall glass with ice and Grey Goose and slides
           it to Liz.  She takes a long drink before releasing a great
           sigh.

                                 LIZ
                        Perfect.  

                                 LAMON
                        You can't really mess up vodka and
                        ice.

                                 LIZ
                        Start a tab, will you?  

                                 RAMON
                        You do know where you are?

                                 LIZ
                        Zoo Babies?

                                 RAMON
                        Yes, but you know you're not gonna
                        pick up any men here.

                                 LIZ
                        Perhaps that's why I'm here.

           Ramon grins and snaps his fingers in agreement. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Does that photobooth work?
                                 RAMON
                        It ain't for decoration.  

           Liz pulls a ten-dollar bill from her purse and slaps it on
           the bar.

                                 LIZ
                        Be a doll and change this?

           Lamon keeps a suspicious eye on Liz, takes her ten, and slides
           her singles.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        If I'm not out in twenty minutes
                        call the National Guard.

           She smiles and heads to the photobooth.  Ramon and Lamon
           exchange amused glances.

           INT. PHOTOBOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz pulls the curtain and pulls out the photo of Christian
           and Ian and feeds the machine a few singles and waits.  

           She takes a drink and reclines against the booth's wall:

           FLASH -- Liz poses like her son in the first photo of his
           strip, goofy and carefree. 

           FLASH -- Liz poses like Christian in the second shot, serious
           and beautiful, a fierce pose.

           FLASH -- Liz just stares at the final photo of her son and
           Ian, so very much in love.  No posing, Liz's face reveals
           raw pain.

           Liz downs her vodka and closes her eyes, head pressed against
           the back of the booth.  

           Her photos shoot onto the floor of the bar.

           INT. ZOO BABIES - LATER

           The bar is about half full of all sorts of guys -- young,
           old, cute, not-so-cute, butch, femme, and everyone in between.

           The Old Queen on the piano is now singing Henry Mancini's
           "Moon River".
                                 OLD QUEEN
                            (singing)
                        Two drifters, off to see the world,
                        there's such a lot of world to see...

           Lamon manages the bar as Ramon carries a tall glass of Vodka
           on ice through the crowd. 

                                 OLD QUEEN (CONT'D)
                            (singing)
                        ...We're after the same rainbow's
                        end, waiting by the bend...

           As Ramon passes, the Old Queen spins him.  

                                 OLD QUEEN (CONT'D)
                            (singing)
                        ...my Huckleberry friend...Moon
                        River and me.

           The crowd claps, and the Old Queen takes a bow, grabs her
           cane and walks to the bar.  

           Ramon taps on the photobooth.  Looking sauced, Liz yanks the
           curtains open.

                                 RAMON
                        Listen, honey, I gotta liquor license
                        to keep.  This is your last one.

           Liz grabs the booze and shoves the photo of Christian and
           Ian in Ramon's face.  She points at Ian (in the photo).  

           A flash of concern runs across Ramon's face.

                                 RAMON (CONT'D)
                        Don't tell me you're Ian's mama?  

                                 LIZ
                        No.  I'm a friend...of a friend.

           Relieved, Ramon pulls Liz out of the photobooth and turns
           her toward the bar.

                                 RAMON
                        Look no further, baby.

           He points to the bar where Ian sits with a group of young
           MALE FRIENDS (20's).  They're laughing and drinking and having
           a grand time chatting with Lamon.
                                 LIZ
                        Ian!

           A few patrons gawk as Liz stumbles toward Ian with open arms. 
           The color drains from Ian's face as Liz steps up and tries
           to hug him.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Honey.

           He pulls back.  He's horrified.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I found this, and I thought you
                        might want it.  

           She shows Ian the photostrip, but he can't bring himself to
           look at it.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Can we talk? 

           He can't look at her either.  He takes a gulp of his Jack &
           Coke and stares at the floor.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You're the only one who can help me
                        through this.

                                 IAN
                        Help you?  

                                 LIZ
                        Please.  I want to understand --

           Ian's struggling, trying his damnedest to remain strong and
           hide his pain. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You're the only one who really knew
                        him.

                                 IAN
                        Yes, before you sent him to that
                        concentration camp.  

                                 LIZ
                        We were only trying to help him,
                        trying to save him from years of
                        heartache.
                                 IAN
                        Well, you saved him from years of
                        everything.  Christian and I had to
                        sneak around, and when he couldn't
                        take it any longer, the lies,
                        deceiving his beloved parents --
                        that was it.  He was gone.  
                            (beat)
                        The sick thing is, he loved you so
                        much, both of you.  

           Liz listens, crumbling, as Ian speaks.

                                 IAN (CONT'D)
                        Healthy nineteen-year-olds don't
                        just die in their sleep.  You want
                        answers?  Christian killed himself
                        because of your husband, and your
                        phony shrinks with their fake
                        science, and your book, your big
                        book of bullshit, Mom.  

           Liz closes her eyes.  This is too much.

                                 IAN (CONT'D)
                        At least you got to see him for a
                        day, MOM.  For me - no calls or
                        emails.  Not even a text in three
                        fucking months.  My best friend?  

           Ian's voice cracks, and he can't pretend any longer.  He's
           breaking down.

                                 IAN (CONT'D)
                        My love, and I didn't even get to
                        say goodbye.

           Ian can't hide his grief any longer and gathers his friends.

                                 IAN (CONT'D)
                        I can't.

           Ramon reaches out to Ian, locks arms, and stops him from
           leaving the bar.

                                 RAMON
                        This is our house, honey.  

           Lamon takes Liz by the arm.
                                 LAMON
                        Time to go, Misses.

           Liz pushes Lamon away.

                                 LIZ
                        Please, Ian --

                                 LAMON
                        We get enough shit from the cops,
                        we don't need this, too.  

                                 LIZ
                        I don't mean any trouble --

                                 LAMON
                        Get the fuck out!

           Liz is scared silent.  Lamon is clearly not playing with
           her.  He glares into her frightened eyes and motions for the
           door.  Liz takes one final, pleading look at Ian, but he
           turns his back.  

           Liz turns and walks out of the bar without realizing she's
           left the photostrip of Christian and Ian behind.  

           The photo remains on the floor with wadded up napkins, chewed
           gum, and cigarette butts.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD - MUCH LATER

           Liz wanders the streets swilling a pint of cheap Vodka.  

           Around the corner a Lexus kills its headlights and parks
           behind a row of dumpsters. 

           INT. LEXUS - NIGHT

           It's very dark, but the flickering street lamp provides just
           enough light to see a MIDDLE AGED DRIVER reclining in his
           seat.  

           DEZ (23), a slim kid with striking, dark features and a pseudo
           hipster hair cut, unzips the driver's pants and gives him a
           half-hearted blow job.

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT

           BAR HOPPERS dodge Liz on the sidewalks as she mumbles, slurs
           and sways.  She's a mess.
           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Liz rounds the corner and ends up next to the Lexus.  She
           starts to dry heave.  She leans over to puke, but instead
           trips and falls flat on her face.  She doesn't move.

           Incomprehensible yelling and cursing spew from the Lexus. 
           The passenger door SWINGS open, and Dez is PUSHED into the
           alley.  

                                 DEZ
                        I said fifty, you fuck!  

           The Lexus speeds into the night.  Dez tries to chase after
           it, but it's too late.  He's alone on the street with a twenty-
           dollar bill.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Fuck!

           Dez kicks a dumpster.  He turns and spots Liz, face-down in
           the alley.  Before approaching Liz, he checks his
           surroundings.  All is clear. 

           Dez crouches down and runs his hand under Liz's nose.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Still kicking.

           He opens her purse, finds her driver's license.  He glances
           at her photo and does a double-take.  In the frozen image,
           she looks like an All American Mom, far from the face-planted
           drunk in the alley.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        What a waste.

           Dez pockets her only cash, a $20.00 bill, and takes off.  He
           gets about fifteen steps, but he can't keep going.  He turns
           and looks at Liz.  She's still there, face-down on a
           disgusting street with her dress hiked.  

           Dez returns to Liz's side.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Ah, fuck.

           Dez pulls Liz up and lugs her down the street.  Wrapped in
           Dez's arms, Liz's eyelids flutter.
                                 LIZ
                        Christian? 

                                 DEZ
                        Naw.  No Christian.  Not here. 
                        Where you staying?  

           Liz's eyes close again.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Hey.  Wake up!

           She SNORES in response.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Jesus.

           Dez sighs and carries her down the street.

           INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Working up a sweat, Dez struggles, but manages to get Liz
           around a corner to a shitty first floor apartment with a
           tattered EVICTION NOTICE hanging on the door.  

           He breezes past the notice without a glance.  It's clearly
           been there awhile.

           INT. DEZ'S PAD - NIGHT

           This one-room apartment has an old couch that's missing its
           cushions.  There is no refrigerator or stove, just a hot
           plate and a bunch of trash on the counters, and there are
           half a dozen sleeping SQUATTERS on the floor.  

           Dez carefully plops Liz on the couch and covers her with a
           an old quilt.  He takes a spot on the floor, in the only
           corner without a warm body, and he closes his eyes.  No
           blanket - Liz has his.

           INT. DEZ'S PAD - MORNING

           It's dark, but there are a few rays of light shining through
           the filthy blinds.  A family of ROACHES scuttles across the
           stained, hardwood floor, just past Dez and the rest of the
           squatters.  Dez is still asleep, blanketless, and in the
           fetal position.  

           Liz wakes up in a daze and slowly opens her eyes.  She sits
           up, startled as she surveys the unfamiliar surroundings.  
           Her face is bruised and swollen from her fall.  She sees the
           sleeping strangers and gasps.  She covers her mouth, limps
           to the sink and PUKES.  

           The wretched sounds of Liz's heaves wake Dez.  He quickly
           fumbles to the kitchen to help, but Liz SCREAMS.

                                 DEZ
                        Hey, hey!  Quiet.   

           Liz reaches for the first thing in sight - a plastic fork -
           and waves it at Dez.  He keeps his distance and can't help
           but laugh.

                                 SQUATTER
                        'the fuck, man!

                                 DEZ
                        Sorry, Kurt.

                                 LIZ
                        What is this place?  

                                 DEZ
                        Ssh.  Slow down, sister, and listen
                        to me.  

                                 LIZ
                        Who are you?  Oh, dear God!  

                                 DEZ
                        Lady, I found your drunk ass face-
                        down in an alley last night.  You
                        should be squeezing my sack for
                        bringing you here.  

           Dez cautiously moves toward her.  Liz backs into an
           overflowing trash bin.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Relax, Liz.  

                                 LIZ
                        You know my name?

                                 DEZ
                        Your license.  If I was going to
                        hurt you, I would've done it six
                        hours ago.  Think.  
           She drops the plastic fork.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        I'm Dez.  Short for Dezmond.  

           Liz folds her arms, shivers, and glances at all the sleeping
           squatters on the floor.

                                 LIZ
                        And they are?

                                 DEZ
                        My tenants....

           He takes a swig of bottled water and offers the rest to Liz.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Here.

           She grimaces.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Like you haven't put your mouth on
                        worse.  Drink.

           Liz gives in and grabs it.  She takes it all down.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Do you know how you got that way? 
                        Face-down in an alley?  

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know.  I was in this bar
                        and then...?

           She shrugs, clueless.

                                 DEZ
                        It happens.  One of your John's
                        probably roofied you up.

                                 LIZ
                        My what?

           Dez smirks at her.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You think I'm a hooker?  Oh, God. 
                        We didn't...?
           Dez shivers in mock disgust.

                                 DEZ
                        You wish.

           Liz surveys Dez's pad and her trepidation returns.

                                 LIZ
                        And you actually live here?

                                 DEZ
                        No.  I broke into this shithole to
                        impress middle-aged roadkill.

                                 LIZ
                        I'm barely forty, thank you.

                                 DEZ
                        Whatev.

                                 LIZ
                        No photos...

                                 DEZ
                        That's intentional.

                                 LIZ
                        Does that mean no family?  Other
                        than the fine folks on the floor
                        here?

           Dez shrugs.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        So, you're an orphan?

                                 DEZ
                        I guess.  

                                 LIZ
                        How old are you?

                                 DEZ
                        What are you, a fucking census taker?

                                 LIZ
                        Do you have to curse?

                                 DEZ
                        No, but I like to.
                                 LIZ
                        I just woke up in a strange
                        apartment, I think I have the right
                        to ask you some questions.  How do
                        I know you're not holding me for
                        ransom, or are part of some kind of
                        cult!

           Dez moves out of the way and points to the front door.

                                 DEZ
                        I'm sure you have somewhere to go,
                        someone who's missing the shit out
                        of you, so scoot.

           Liz sighs and takes another look at his pathetic apartment. 

                                 LIZ
                        Thank you, Dezmond, for...whatever
                        you did.  Can I treat you and your
                        friends to breakfast?  

                                 DEZ
                        They won't be up 'til noon --

           POUND!  POUND!  POUND!

                                 LIZ
                        What --

           Dez covers Liz's mouth with his hand and gives her the
           international sign for SHUT THE "F" UP.  

           The doorknob jiggles.  

           Dez kicks each of the sleeping squatters on the floor.  One-
           by-one they open their eyes, confused -- 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Goddamn it!  

           POUND!  POUND!  POUND!

           The squatters grab their shit and hop through the ground-
           floor window. 

                                 MAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I can hear you, you little faggot! 
                        I want my fucking money! 
           Dez gestures for Liz to follow the squatters.  Dez grabs his
           backpack, allows Liz to slip through the window first, and
           he follows.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           The squatters run one way, and Liz is about to follow them,
           but Dez stops her --

                                 LIZ
                        What about your friends?

                                 DEZ
                        I prefer to eat in peace.

           INT. COZ'S DINER - DAY

           The wood-panelled walls are covered with St. Louis Cardinals
           and Illini Basketball memorabilia.  The red-pleather booths
           and stools are filled with the butts of BLUE COLLAR folks.  

           Still there are a couple HUNGOVER HIPSTERS sprinkled in the
           mix, recovering from late nights at the bars.  

           Stuffed in a cozy booth, Liz sips a bloody mary and watches
           Dez create a peculiar concoction on his plate.  

           Dez cuts his toast into four squares.  He then places broken
           strips of bacon, Tabasco sauce, and fried eggs on top of
           each square.  As he prepares to eat it open-faced, he looks
           at Liz, who's staring at him.

                                 DEZ
                        Don't you eat?

           Liz picks at her eggwhite omelet and takes another sip of
           her bloody mary.

                                 LIZ
                        There are tomatoes in this, no?

           Dez dives into his mini breakfast sandwiches.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        There has to be a story there...all
                        that work just to shove it down one
                        pipe.

           Entertained by his culinary quirks, Liz watches Dez inhale
           his food.
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        How long have you lived in that
                        hole?

                                 DEZ
                        Little over a month.

                                 LIZ
                        You can't go back.

                                 DEZ
                        I'll give him until sundown.  He'll
                        be so fucked on oxy he'll forget I
                        exist.  He does that song and dance
                        every few days.

                                 LIZ
                        Where will you go when he's had
                        enough?

                                 DEZ
                        Jesus, wherever the road takes me.

                                 LIZ
                        You're a real rolling stone, eh?

                                 DEZ
                        Rolling stone?  How old are you?

                                 LIZ
                        And your friends?

                                 DEZ
                        Girl, they're not my friends. 
                        They're squatters.  They're fellow
                        tossaways, new to the game.  It's
                        the least I can do.

                                 LIZ
                        Tossaways?  You mean their families
                        kicked them out?

                                 DEZ
                        Ding, ding, ding!   

                                 LIZ
                        Your family tossed you away, and
                        now you take in others.  
                                 DEZ
                        Oh, God.  Don't get all Reader's
                        Digest on me.  I've been on my own
                        since I was sixteen.  Lived with a
                        guy until last year --

                                 LIZ
                        What happened?

                                 DEZ
                        I went through puberty, and suddenly
                        he just wasn't that into me. 

                                 LIZ
                        Goodness.

           Liz nods and sips her drink, careful to keep her eyes on Dez
           without intimidating him.

                                 DEZ
                        When he left I had to figure shit
                        out on my own.  My parents didn't
                        quite get it, so I never looked
                        back.  Hustled my way into that
                        shitbox. 

                                 LIZ
                        So you're not an orphan?

                                 DEZ
                        I got into some shit along the way. 
                        Got into the wrong car a couple
                        times, you know, but I'm here. 

                                 LIZ
                        What do you do for money?  How do
                        you live?

                                 DEZ
                        That's what I'm trying to tell you,
                        Liz.  
                            (singsong)
                        I'm a hustler, baby.

                                 LIZ
                        And you like this life?

                                 DEZ
                        Love it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                            (in a breathy, Scarlett
                             O'Hara accent)
                        When I was just a boy I dreamt of
                        this very moment. 

           Liz reaches across the table and takes Dez's hand.

                                 LIZ
                        You're worth more.  

           Dez squirms before pulling his hand away.

                                 DEZ
                        I'm not the one who takes naps in
                        alleys.

           Liz pretends she didn't hear that.

                                 LIZ
                        I have a son your age, a little
                        younger.

                                 DEZ
                        Is he cute?

                                 LIZ
                        He's away.  

                                 DEZ
                        Okay...?

                                 LIZ
                        He had a fight with my husband. 
                        Haven't seen him since.

                                 DEZ
                        He'll be back.

                                 LIZ
                        Have you gone back?

                                 DEZ
                        No.

                                 LIZ
                        My husband left, but he's Namibia
                        on a church mission.  He's a pastor.
           Dez nearly chokes on his breakfast.  This is the distraction
           he needed.

                                 DEZ
                            (mouth full)
                        You're a pastor's wife?  

           Liz tries not to react.  She just tears napkins to keep from
           revealing too much emotion.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Holy shit!   

                                 LIZ
                        The point is - my home is free.  So
                        you can stay with me until you get
                        back on your feet.  It's the least
                        I can do.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit, you already bought me
                        breakfast.  

                                 LIZ
                        I have a big house.  Too big for
                        just me.  

                                 DEZ
                        The pastor's wife bringing home a 
                        Mary she met on the street?  What
                        will the ladies who lunch think, or
                        your son?  Jesus, I do not need a
                        beatdown by a Bible-toting
                        quarterback.  

                                 LIZ
                        I'm a Christian.  It's what we do.  

           Dez sits back and folds his arms.  Now he gets it.

                                 DEZ
                        I see what this is, and I happily
                        decline.  No Bible school for me. 
                        I'll find a Mark.  

                                 LIZ
                        Who's Mark?
           Dez laughs at Liz's innocence.  But then he says nothing and
           stares at her, trying to figure her out, to uncover a hidden
           agenda.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You saved me from God knows what. 
                        Let me return the favor. 

           Dez finishes his last nibble of food and takes the final
           gulp of his coffee.

                                 DEZ
                        Don't need saving.  Good luck, church
                        lady.

           He takes off, leaving Liz at the table alone.  Resigned, she
           holds up her empty glass and signals to the busy WAITER.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Liz stumbles to the sidewalk, searching, but there's no car. 
           She circles the street and looks up at the sign: NO PARKING
           8AM - 12PM.  Liz stands in the street just staring at the
           damned sign.

           EXT. SPRINGFIELD IMPOUND - DAY

           Liz is at the head of a long line of ANGRY PEOPLE.  As she
           makes it to the CLERK --

                                 WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Liz?  

           Liz's look of dread reveals that she knows this voice, but
           she takes a deep breath and ignores it.  She slides her
           license and credit card to the clerk --

                                 CLERK
                            (checks the name on
                             her ID)
                        Think she's talking to you, Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        Just get my car, it's a black 2011
                        Lacrosse.  

           The clerk gives her a sassy look, scans her card.

                                 CLERK
                        One-fifty.
                                 LIZ
                        Fine.  Will they bring it to the
                        front?

                                 CLERK
                        This ain't a Holiday Inn.

           The clerk hands Liz keys and a receipt.

                                 CLERK (CONT'D)
                        Next!

           Liz grabs her keys, turns and faces a woman bathed in Ralph
           Lauren, KAREN HENDRICKS (50), Liz in ten years...if she stops
           drinking.  (cid:13)

           Karen does her best to stifle her gasp as she gives Liz a
           once-over.  

                                 KAREN
                        Elizabeth, honey?  

           Liz sighs and addresses Karen as if she just now noticed
           her.

                                 LIZ
                        Karen.  Did you park in a red zone,
                        too?

                                 KAREN
                        Helping out one of the ladies from
                        the shelter.  

           She gestures to an EMACIATED WOMAN in line. 

                                 KAREN (CONT'D)
                        Honey, your face.

           Liz gently touches the wound under her eye and remembers.

                                 LIZ
                        I tripped, broke my heel in a
                        pothole.  Guess it serves me right
                        for buying shoes from Kohl's.   

                                 KAREN
                        Elizabeth.

           Karen squeezes Liz, who remains limp in her arms.
           (cid:13)                                 LIZ
                        Nice catching up with you, Karen.

           Liz doesn't even give Karen a chance to stop her.  She's
           already made it to the door, leaving Karen to gawk at her
           shadow and whip out her cell phone.

           INT. DEZ'S PAD - NIGHT

           Dez rummages through his apartment, shoving whatever he can
           into his backpack.  

           INT. DEZ'S HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dez quietly strides to the door at the far end of the hallway. 
           There's a tattered sign on the door: (cid:13)
            (cid:13)
           RENT DUE AT NOON 1st OF MONTH NO CEPTIONS!  

           Dez KNOCKS.  He's careful to check his surroundings and look
           both ways as he waits.  

           He KNOCKS again.  No answer, so Dez rattles the knob.  It's
           locked.  

           Dez loosens his sleeve and reveals a small flathead
           screwdriver.  

           INT. LIZ'S HOME - NIGHT

           The house is silent.  The floors are covered with photos and
           tissues, and tiny vodka bottles.  Liz is face-down on her
           couch and immobile.  

           The DOORBELL RINGS.  No movement from Liz.

           The DOORBELL RINGS again.  

           Liz wakes and pulls herself up.  She tiptoes to her window
           where she peers outside but quickly pulls the shades.

           The DOORBELL RINGS frantically. 

           Fed up, Liz cracks the door open and finds Karen Hendricks
           on the porch.

                                 LIZ
                        Are you following me?
                                 KAREN
                        Honey, I'm here to help.

           Karen tries to push her way inside.

           EXT. LIZ'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Liz steps onto the porch and closes the door behind her,
           blocking Karen from entering her home.

                                 KAREN
                        You're not going to invite me in?

                                 LIZ
                        On my way out.

                                 KAREN
                        You look like you could use some
                        company.

                                 LIZ
                        Looks can be deceiving.  

                                 KAREN
                        Let us be here for you.  We can
                        pray the pain away.  

                                 LIZ
                        I just want to be left alone.

           Karen flinches at the scent of Liz's breath.

                                 KAREN
                        I can smell your problem, you poor
                        thing.  

           Karen takes her by the arm, but Liz pulls back, which only
           makes Karen pull harder.

                                 LIZ
                        Let me go!

           Karen won't let up.

                                 KAREN
                        Let's get you into the shower and
                        fill that belly with a home-cooked
                        meal.  I told David I'd try.  You
                        can stay with me until he gets back.
                                 LIZ
                        So you didn't visit out of the
                        goodness of your heart?  Imagine
                        that.

                                 KAREN
                        People talk.  You know that.

           As Karen tries to push her way into the house, Liz pushes
           back.  In the scuffle Karen trips on a pair of Christian's
           shoes and falls down the stairs.  

           Liz stares at the shoes as Karen yelps in pain and rubs her
           ankle.  

                                 LIZ
                        I told you to go.

                                 KAREN
                        My ankle.

                                 LIZ
                        Does it hurt?

                                 KAREN
                        Yes, Liz, please --

                                 LIZ
                        Why don't you just pray the pain
                        away?

           Liz marches to her car, slams her door and speeds out of her
           driveway.  She leaves Karen in her yard, speechless with a
           throbbing ankle.

           EXT. DEZ'S PAD - NIGHT

           Parked across the street from Dez's Pad, Liz sits taking
           sips from a tiny bottle of Smirnoff.  She perks up when she
           hears YELLING --

           With blood trickling from his nose, Dez leaps off the stoop
           and plows right past Liz's car.  She HONKS her horn, but he
           doesn't look back.

           The LANDLORD, an enormous man in his boxers, plows through
           the front door and chases him with a bat.
           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           The Landlord wheezes as Dez's skinny ass trots down the dark
           alley.  With his Landlord following close behind, Dez sees
           headlights coming right at him.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit!

           Dez ducks, but the car stops next to him.  He can't believe
           his eyes when Liz rolls her window down.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        You're deranged.

                                 LIZ
                        My offer still stands.

                                 DEZ
                        A deranged stalker.  

                                 LIZ
                        You have about six seconds to make
                        a decision.

           Dez looks behind him and sees his Landlord heading toward
           him, waving the bat.

                                 DEZ
                        If you try and beat me with the
                        Bible of yours --

                                 LIZ
                        As long as you don't lecture me
                        about anything, we're good.  

           Dez hops in Liz's car.  As they speed into the night he pokes
           his head out the window and taunts his wheezing Landlord.

                                 DEZ
                        Kisses!  

           He smooches and flips him off - hooting along the way.  

           In her side-view mirror, it's clear that Liz is scared, but
           also titillated by the crazy turn her life has suddenly taken.
           INT. VILLAGE MARKET - NIGHT

           Small town SHOPPERS gawk as Dez sashes through the aisle of
           this quaint market.  As Dez floats past the pasta, it's like
           a ballet, or at the very least an artsy grocery store
           commercial.  

           Liz looks uncomfortable with the attention, but she's clearly
           amused by Dez's carefree attitude.

                                 DEZ
                        Here we are.

           Liz grins as Dez carefully reads the back of a box of arborio
           rice.  Once satisfied with the arborio rice's ingredients,
           Dez tosses the box into her grocery cart that's already
           overflowing with booze and cleaning supplies.  

           They make their way to the CASHIER, a chubby gal (20's) with
           extraordinarily long nails and a smirk on her face.  She
           eyes the booze in the cart and scoffs.

                                 CASHIER
                        Having another one of your "parties",
                        Mrs. Wright?

           Liz nods, embarrassed.  She's about to speak --

                                 DEZ
                        It's always a party at Pastor
                        Wright's place.  Don't you know
                        that, girl?

                                 CASHIER
                        I'm gonna have to see your ID.

                                 LIZ
                        I'm paying.

                                 CASHIER
                        Still.  He don't look old enough.

                                 DEZ
                        Why thanks, peach. 
                            (whispers)
                        Botox.

           Dez bats his eyes and whips his ID at the bewildered, small
           town girl.  
           INT. LIZ'S HOME - NIGHT

           This house is overflowing with trash, mostly empty bottles
           of booze.  As Dez steps inside, he struggles to hide his
           shock.  

                                 LIZ
                        No judgments.

                                 DEZ
                        I didn't say anything.

                                 LIZ
                        The maid's on a vacation.

                                 DEZ
                        Well, let's put the food away and
                        roll up our sleeves.

           Liz looks ashamed of the awful mess, evidence of her problem
           and her grief.  Dez gives her a quick and understanding nudge. 

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        No judgments.

           Relieved, Liz smiles.

           EXT. AUS - SUNSET

           Pastor David's Girl-Friday, Ashley, is among a dozen sunburnt
           AMERICAN MISSIONARIES watching as the VILLAGERS perform a 
           song and dance.  

           Ashley follows David's every move as he takes photos with
           the children, smiling like he doesn't have a care in the
           world.  

           David laughs with a Namibian girl.  Then the girl takes his
           hand and makes David her dance partner.

           The song comes to an end, and David leads the applause.

                                 DAVID
                        God bless you all.  We will see you
                        bright and early!

           EXT. AUS - MOMENTS LATER

           David and Ashley wave goodnight to the Missionaries as they
           each duck into their private huts.  
           One MISSIONARY, a wide-eyed kid with fair hair, skin, and
           eyes (18), follows David and Ashley on their path.

                                 MISSIONARY
                        What a day.

           David smiles and wraps a comforting arm around the young
           Missionary.

                                 DAVID
                        Is your first mission all you hoped?

                                 MISSIONARY
                        Oh, more than I can say.  But do
                        you ever worry that once we leave
                        they'll forget?

                                 ASHLEY
                        They'll convert.  They always do.  

                                 MISSIONARY
                        But why Aus?  Why now?  

                                 DAVID
                        God is always looking down on us
                        and calling out, begging us to spread
                        His word.  It's up to us to listen. 
                        I heard the call and I said "Here I
                        am, Lord.  Send me."  The rest is
                        up to Him.
                            (beat)
                        Good night, son.

           It's almost comical how Pastor David abruptly ends his
           proclamation.  He smiles his million-dollar, trustworthy
           grin, and waves. 

           The young Missionary is transfixed as he ducks into his hut.

           EXT. LIZ'S HOME - NIGHT

           A couple NOSY NEIGHBORS have their faces pressed to their
           windows.  Some stand outside, pretending to walk their dogs,
           others just boldly stare into Liz's back yard.  

           Dez and Liz look pleasantly sauced as they eat dinner on her
           patio.  Their plates are almost clean, and there's a half-
           empty gallon of vodka in front of them.  
           The Hedwig and the Angry Inch soundtrack BLASTS in the
           background.  

                                 DEZ
                        I can't believe you have this!

           Liz shrugs.

                        One of my son's friends probably
                        left it.

                                 DEZ
                        Hmm...I'm keeping my thoughts to
                        myself on that one.

           Liz takes the final bite of risotto and closes her eyes,
           savoring the creamy concoction.  Dez gives Liz an inquisitive
           look.  She's quick to change the subject.

                                 LIZ
                        Where on earth did you learn to
                        cook like this?

           Dez shrugs.

                                 DEZ
                        Home, but I never had access to so
                        much quality shit.  

                                 LIZ
                        You can run my kitchen any day.

                                 DEZ
                        Fifty bucks I gain ten pounds while
                        I'm under your roof.

                                 LIZ
                        You could use it.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit.  You're one to talk.

           Liz grabs the vodka and pours some over ice before taking a
           refreshing gulp.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        What's your husband going to say
                        about all this?
                                 LIZ
                        He knows I enjoy a drink.

                                 DEZ
                        No, silly.  What's he going to say
                        about me?

                                 LIZ
                        Oh.  I couldn't say. 

                                 DEZ
                        Separate lives?

                                 LIZ
                        For now.

                        Africa.  Shit, you must have been
                        all over the world together.

                                 LIZ
                        I've never been on any of his
                        missions.

                                 DEZ
                        Why the hell not?

                        Duties at home.  Responsibilities
                        with the church.

                                 DEZ
                        And now?

                                 LIZ
                        I guess I'm trying to figure all
                        that out, my next step.

                                 DEZ
                        I'd give my left tit to go to Africa,
                        or Arkansas for that matter.  I've
                        been stuck in the Central ILL my
                        whole life.

                                 LIZ
                        That makes two of us.

                                 DEZ
                        For me, there's really no choice.

                        It's criminal for you.  A sin, my
                        dear Christian Soldier.

                                 LIZ
                        You can go anywhere.  You're young,
                        on your own, and you have no
                        responsibilities.

                                 DEZ
                        Or family, or anyone to come home
                        to.  Yeah, I get it.

                                 LIZ
                        That's not what I meant.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit, it's true.  No one's waiting
                        for me to tiptoe up the stairs at
                        night.

                                 LIZ
                        Now there is.

                                 DEZ
                        We just met.  What if I gut you in
                        your sleep, or make a skin suit out
                        of you? 

                                 LIZ
                        For such a sweet kid you have one
                        morbid sense of humor.

                                 DEZ
                        Sweet?

           Dez hops on the table, being showy and dramatic.

                                 LIZ
                        You are.  I'm a mom.  We know these
                        things.  

           Dez hops down, disappointed his antics aren't getting a
           response.

                                 DEZ
                        Not all mothers are maternal.
                                 LIZ
                        Sure, but your nature.  It's kind,
                        or I wouldn't have brought you into
                        my home.

           Dez is uncomfortable with Liz's gaze, so he changes the
           subject.

                                 DEZ
                        In some circles, "sweet" is a
                        euphemism for gay.

                                 LIZ
                        How did you know you were a
                        homosexual?

           Dez nearly chokes on his drink.

                                 DEZ
                        So clinical, Christ!  Subtle, too. 
                        How did you know you were a
                        heterosexual?

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know.  I met a man and
                        married him.  Did what my mother
                        did.  Did what was expected of me.

                                 DEZ
                        How long have you been married?

                                 LIZ
                        We've been together since tenth
                        grade.  Our parents introduced us.

                                 DEZ
                        This is all so fascinating, like a
                        classic episode of Dynasty or
                        something.

                                 LIZ
                        You're too young to reference
                        Dynasty. 

                                 DEZ
                        TV Land.

                                 LIZ
                        What about your parents?  
                                 DEZ
                        What about them?

                                 LIZ
                        Anything.  Everything.  

                                 DEZ
                        Mom stayed at home.  Dad wasn't
                        around most of the time.  Worked a
                        lot.  Next question, counselor. 

                                 LIZ
                        Do you think, perhaps, that your
                        mother overcompensated for your
                        father's abandonment?  

                                 DEZ
                        For fuck sake, I thought we were
                        having a nightcap, not a therapy
                        session.  My dad didn't abandon me. 
                        He drove a truck.  Ever been honked
                        at by a creepy truck driver?

           Liz nods.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        That was probably my dad.

                                 LIZ
                        You were home with your mom a lot. 
                        You were all she had.  Would you
                        say she smothered you?

           Dez snorts at such a question.

                                 DEZ
                        Smothered, Liz?  Come on, my story
                        isn't special.  Like I said before,
                        all those squatters - tossaways
                        like me.  My parents didn't get me.  

           Dez pauses.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        And I'd rather be an orphan than a
                        stranger in my own home.

           This hits Liz where it hurts.  She takes a drink.
                                 LIZ
                        But did you ever tell your parents
                        how you felt?

                                 DEZ
                        It wouldn't have done any good. 
                        I'm an only child, the son.  Fuck,
                        I tried.  I dated girls, screwed a
                        couple to see if I liked it.  

           He takes a gulp of vodka.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        I didn't.  The whole time I was
                        wondering what Johnny Depp's tongue
                        tasted like. 

                                 LIZ
                        Nothing worked.

                                 DEZ
                        It's not something you "work out".  
                            (beat)
                        I had this friend in high school,
                        Jessica.  Prom queen, youth group,
                        blah, blah, blah.  Every time she
                        got a little booze in her she'd
                        suck face with another chick - didn't
                        matter who.  On Monday she was back
                        with her jock boyfriend, and
                        eventually she got married.  She
                        teaches Kindergarten.  

                                 LIZ
                        Your point?

           Dez smirks.  

                                 DEZ
                        I can't say for sure, but I bet
                        when Miss Jessica has a girls' night
                        out she's gonna down on one of her
                        fellow teachers, and Monday morning
                        they'll all be back to playing the
                        good wife.  
                            (beat)
                        I can do that, Liz.  I could kiss
                        you right now and it would be fun.

                        It might even be hot because it's
                        so wrong, you know?  And I'll wake
                        up with a hard cock, but it won't
                        be from you.  I'll still be thinking
                        about Johnny Depp.

           Liz just stares at Dez, speechless.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Why'd you really bring me here? 
                        What're you gonna do with me?

           Liz stares at him, trying to figure out what he means.  He
           takes another sip of his drink, keeping his eye on her the
           whole time.  

                                 LIZ
                        I'll make up the guest room.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Dez follows Liz up the stairway and down the hall.  While
           making his way through Liz's beige house, Dez glances at the
           family photos. 

                                 DEZ
                        Now this is America.  Beautiful
                        wife.  Handsome son.  Proud papa. 
                        Are you sure these aren't ripped
                        from a Ralph Lauren ad?

           Liz says nothing.  She can't even look at the photos.  Then
           Dez grabs the knob to Christian's room.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        This it?

                                 LIZ
                        Don't!  

           Dez freezes, his hand still on the doorknob.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        That's my son's room.

                                 DEZ
                        He's a private fellow I gather?

           Liz collects herself.
                                 LIZ
                        Yes.

           Liz watches as Dez releases his hand from Christian's
           doorknob.  Now she can breathe.

           INT. DEZ'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dez's eyes widen at the sight of the king-sized bed covered
           with a mountain of pillows and a down comforter. 

                                 LIZ
                        It's not much.

                                 DEZ
                        It's a real shit factory, Liz.   

           He throws himself on the bed. 

                                 LIZ
                        Knock if you need me.  I'm next
                        door. 

           Liz gives Dez a sweet glance as he continues immersing himself
           in his new bed.  Just as she's about to leave the room --

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Dezmond?

           He pulls himself from under the covers and looks at her.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You never told me your last name.

                                 DEZ
                        So?

                                 LIZ
                        You're sleeping in my home, I don't
                        think it's too much to ask.

                                 DEZ
                        Jones.  

                                 LIZ
                        Dezmond Jones.  Sounds like a movie
                        star. 

                                 DEZ
                        From the seventies.
           Liz smiles and watches Dez tuck himself into bed like a little
           boy.

                                 LIZ
                        Good night, dear.

           INT. LIZ'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A light flicks on.  Liz is in bed, staring at the ceiling. 
           She chews her inner cheek.  She tries to keep her eyes closed
           for more than a second, but it's not working.

           Liz slides to the side of her bed, hangs over and looks
           underneath.  Her eyes pass a single running shoe, some loose
           change, and a few bobby pins.  

           Her eyes then fix on a nearly empty bottle of Vodka.  There's
           about an inch left in the 1.75 liter of Smirnoff. 

           Liz stares at the vodka, as if waiting for it to speak to
           her or sprout legs and walk into her mouth.  She closes her
           eyes for a moment, pulls herself up and walks out of the
           room.

           INT. DEZ'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Dez sleeps in the dark room.  His window is open and a nice
           breeze flows through the curtains.  

           FOOTSTEPS tiptoe into the doorway.  Liz stands, just watching
           Dez.  She smiles - he bites his full lips in his sleep.

           Liz carefully creeps into bed and slides behind Dez.  She
           slowly wraps her arms around him, waking him up.

                                 DEZ
                        Liz?

           He keeps his back to her.  Liz takes a moment before
           responding, trying to think of the right words to express
           what she needs.

                                 LIZ
                        Is it okay if I just...

                                 DEZ
                        Yeah.  Sure.  Whatever you want.
           Liz holds onto Dez.  He freezes for a moment, waiting for
           something else to happen, waiting for a hand to travel
           south...but nothing does.  There are no wandering paws.

           Liz is content just holding him.

           Dez relaxes his body and closes his eyes.  Liz closes hers,
           and they both drift to sleep.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. LIZ'S KITCHEN - DAY

           The sun shines through the gingham-curtained windows.  The
           mood is light as Liz sips a bloody mary at the breakfast
           table.  Dez takes the drink and slides her a plate with an
           eggwhite omelet.  

                                 DEZ
                        Solids first.  

           Liz takes a bite, and Dez joins her.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Good girl.

                                 LIZ
                        You need your own restaurant.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit.  I need training, and training
                        costs money.  Besides, to truly
                        understand food you have to travel
                        and sample.  

                                 LIZ
                        You could find money for school.  

                                 DEZ
                        Umm, where?

                                 LIZ
                        Financial Aid.  Scholarships.  You'll
                        never know unless you try.

                                 DEZ
                        Right, it's that simple!  And life
                        is full of rainbow omelets and
                        fairies that burp butterflies.
                                 LIZ
                        I think you're afraid.  

                                 DEZ
                        You fucking kidding me, Mrs.
                        Smirnoff?  Your husband sees the
                        world while you're trapped in this
                        cave.

                                 LIZ
                        What happened to "no judgments"?

                                 DEZ
                        You can ask me fifty fucking
                        questions about my parents and being
                        a queer?  All I know about you is
                        that your husband's a pastor.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes, and?

                                 DEZ
                        But what does that make you?

                                 LIZ
                        A pastor's wife.

                                 DEZ
                        What else?

           Liz sits on this question...she doesn't have an answer.

                                 LIZ
                        Maybe you should go.  

           But Dez stares at her as if challenging her to a duel.

                                 DEZ
                        When you were my age, hell, when
                        you were a little kid, what did you
                        want to be?

           Liz shrugs.  She's not playing this game.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        What was your favorite subject in
                        school?

           Then she softens and smiles, getting lost in a memory.
                                 LIZ
                        Chorus.

                                 DEZ
                        You can sing?

                                 LIZ
                        A little.

                                 DEZ
                        Sing something. 

                                 LIZ
                        I'm rusty.

                                 DEZ
                        Come on.  We slept in the same bed,
                        I think we're past playing coy.

           Dez gets up and hands Liz her drink.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Don't be mad.  

           Liz accepts the drink, takes a gulp, and sighs in relief. 
           Dez plops a photo album on the table - it's open to an old
           pic of Liz - she's fresh-faced and stylish in her 1980's
           garb.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Dayglo leggings!  Well, Liz, I never.

                                 LIZ
                        Why I ever let you loose in my house
                        is a mystery to me.

                                 DEZ
                        I'm an early riser, what can I say?

           Liz closes the photo album, but Dez flips it back open.  He
           points to the old photo of Liz.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        What happened to this girl?

           Liz takes a moment.

                                 LIZ
                        She got married.  She grew up.  
           Dez runs his fingers through her hair.  It's starting to
           feel good, too good to Liz.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

           Dez removes a bobby pin from Liz's hair, letting her locks
           fall against her face.  Dez grabs a paper towel and wipes
           some of the dark lipstick from her lips.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Dez --

                                 DEZ
                        Ssh.

           He clears the smudges off her face and tousles her hair.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Perfect.

           He takes Liz by the hand and leads her out of the room. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Dez places Liz in front of her mantle where the family photos
           are on display.  He takes the drink from her hand and places
           it next to the photos.  

           Dez steps behind Liz so she can only see herself in the
           mirror.  Gone is the Stepford Wife.

                                 DEZ
                        Look at you.

           Liz does everything she can to avoid looking at the family
           photos of David and Christian.  She looks at her reflection.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        This is you.

           Liz's eyes soften and she smiles.  Dez moves out from behind
           Liz so they can both look in the mirror.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        This is us.

           He gives Liz a lingering kiss on the lips.  She's so lost in
           the moment she can hardly open her eyes, but she manages.
                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        You're more than a Pastor's Wife.

           Liz looks at the bloody mary sitting on the mantle next to
           the photos.  The drink is leaving a ring on the wood.  The
           ice is melting into the tomato juice and vodka.

                                 LIZ
                        Maybe.

                                 DEZ
                        And I know things are weird with
                        your kid, but trust me.  He'll come
                        back.

                                 LIZ
                        And if he doesn't?

                                 DEZ
                        Then you'll look for him.

                                 LIZ
                            (staring into Dez's
                             eyes)
                        Yes.  

           In search of a distraction, Dez's eyes move to the baby grand
           piano in the corner.

                                 DEZ
                        Play for me.

                                 LIZ
                        Come on, Dez.

                                 DEZ
                        I'll warm up the keys.

           Dez plops on the piano and plays "Chopsticks".  Liz cringes.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Think you can do better?  

           Liz grins.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Just do the damn thang, girl.
           Liz gently scoots Dez over and sits at her piano.  She places
           her long, delicate fingers on the keys and takes a deep
           breath.  

           Liz begins her version of the bluegrass song, "I am Weary
           Let Me Rest".  

                                 LIZ
                            (singing)
                        Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin', 
                        lay my head upon your breast.  Throw
                        your loving arms around me, I am
                        weary let me rest.  

           Her voice doesn't sound at all like a "church lady", it has
           rasp, edge, and a lot of pain.  

           Dez listens in disbelief and true admiration. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                            (singing)
                        Seems the light is swiftly fading,
                        brighter scenes they do now show. 
                        I am standing by the river, angels
                        wait to take me home. 

           The SONG continues:

           EXT. CARPENTER PARK - DAY

           Dez and Liz hike through the lush forest preserve.  Out of
           breath, they stop on a cliff overlooking the Sangamon river.  

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                            (singing)
                        Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin',
                        see the pain upon my brow.  While
                        I'll soon be with the angels, fate
                        has doomed my future now.

           As the spring birds soar above, Liz stands atop the cliff
           and takes a deep breath, absorbing all that surrounds her. 
           She has a melancholy smile, so does Dez. 

                                 LIZ (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                            (singing)
                        Through the years you've always
                        loved me, and my life you've tried
                        to save.  But now I shall slumber
                        sweetly in a deep and lonely grave.
           Dez strips off his clothes and gestures for Liz to follow,
           but she won't do it.  She shields her eyes from Dez's taut,
           nude body.  When completely naked and shivering, Dez offers
           Liz his hand.  

           Liz just stares at it.  She's not ready.

                                 LIZ (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                            (singing)
                        Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin', 
                        lay my head upon your breast, throw
                        your loving arms around me...

           Dez is about to jump, but Liz slowly disrobes.  She joins
           Dez at the edge of the cliff.  She takes a deep breath and
           squeezes Dez's hand.  

           Hand-in-hand Liz and Dez leap off the cliff and plummet into
           the river below.

           EXT. SANGAMON RIVER - DAY

           Surrounded by the forest and cliffs, Liz and Dez float in
           the river as naked as the day they were born.  They're on
           their backs, both silently staring at the clear, midwestern
           sky. 

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                            (singing)
                        I am weary let me rest. 

           END SONG.

           EXT. RURAL ILLINOIS - NIGHT

           Liz's car ventures into the quiet countryside where the roads
           are lined with dogwood trees and signs that warn of deer.

           INT. LIZ'S CAR - NIGHT

           Liz drives.  Dez sits in silence, staring out his window. 
           With wet, matted hair and damp clothes, these two are still
           recovering from their impromptu swim.

           Dez turns to Liz - sees a troubled look on her face.

                                 DEZ
                        I guess The Mister doesn't take you
                        skinny dipping much?
           Liz keeps her eyes on the road ahead.

                                 LIZ
                        David is a very serious man.

           Silence.  

           Liz drifts away for a moment, and the car starts to drift
           off the road.

                                 DEZ
                        Liz!

           Dez grabs the wheel and jerks it back.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Where did you go?  Stop, let me
                        drive --

           But Liz ignores him and keeps driving.

                                 LIZ
                        I was just thinking about Christmas
                        Eve, two years ago.  David was
                        running late, "counseling" a worthy
                        member of our congregation.  My
                        son, our son, was angry with us and
                        refused to come home.  I couldn't
                        stand being alone in that house, so
                        I put a little basket of goodies
                        together for David and whoever he
                        was counseling.  But he wasn't at
                        church.  I came home and waited. 
                        He eventually showed up smelling
                        like Dream Angels. 

           Dez looks lost.  Liz keeps her eyes on the road.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        His little helper, Ashley.  I
                        remember hugging her before church,
                        Sunday after that Thanksgiving. 
                        She smelled like a department store
                        whore.  It took everything I had to
                        keep from vomiting.  Instead I asked
                        what delightful scent she was
                        wearing.  "Dream Angels," she
                        giggled.  

           Silence.
                                 DEZ
                        Pull over, Liz, please?

           EXT. ROUTE 29 - NIGHT

           On the side of the desolate country road, Liz parks her car
           and gets out.  Dez taps the hood and Liz joins him on her
           hood of her pristine car.

                                 DEZ
                        So your husband's a cheat, you don't
                        have to take his shit.  Move on. 
                        Do your thing.

                                 LIZ
                        It's not so simple.

                                 DEZ
                        Your kid's how old?

           Liz pauses before answering.

                                 LIZ
                        Nineteen.

                                 DEZ
                        And he took off, so now's the time
                        to get out of this mess.  You can
                        tell Pastor David to fuck off and
                        finally do something for yourself. 
                        You can travel, play your piano at
                        bars or something.

                                 LIZ
                        Me, playing piano for tips?  What
                        could be more humiliating?

                                 DEZ
                        I can think of a few things.

                                 LIZ
                        Like?

                                 DEZ
                        Hiding from the world and pretending
                        to be someone you're not.  

                                 LIZ
                        I'm not you, Dez.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I can't just say and do whatever I
                        want without consequence.  You're
                        young, but you know who you are. 
                        You're brave, kiddo.

           Dez softens.  

                                 DEZ
                        I'm not so brave.

           Liz offers a dismissive smile.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        As a kid, every time my dad gave me
                        shit about being "off" I played it
                        like I was dumb or didn't care.  My
                        mom did a good job pretending, too. 
                        But when I locked myself into my
                        room at night I'd pray...

           He looks at Liz, waiting for the reaction that doesn't come. 
           She's too intent on hearing the rest.  No judgment here.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Yeah, fuck, I prayed.  Still do
                        sometimes, but as a kid I prayed
                        that I'd wake up a straight, butch
                        pitcher for the Springfield Warriors,
                        girls on each side of me, class
                        President or some shit.  Needless
                        to say I've come a long way, baby.   

           Liz is cracking.  She takes a swig of bottled water and then
           realizes her hands are shaking.

                                 LIZ
                        Dez, I've gone all day without a
                        drink.

           Dez nods, not wanting to make a big deal of it.

                                 DEZ
                        How's it feel?

                                 LIZ
                        Clearer.
           INT. LIZ'S HOME - NIGHT

           Liz and Dez are on the floor in front of the TV watching old
           home movies.  

           ON THE SCREEN: Liz, David, and ten-year-old Christian open
           Christmas presents.  Christian beams when he gets a karaoke
           machine.  

           Something about this gets to Dez.  He turns to Liz and watches
           her laugh and wipes her eyes.  

                                 LIZ
                        I never get to watch these when
                        he's home.

           Liz catches Dez watching her and shoves a handful of popcorn
           in her mouth.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You are so going to be the next
                        Orville Redenbocker.  

                                 DEZ
                        Shit, this face on a box of popcorn? 
                        America ain't ready.

           The phone RINGS until the answering machine picks it up.

                                 LIZ (V.O.)
                        You've reached The Wrights, please
                        leave a message and have a blessed
                        day.

                                 DAVID (V.O.)
                        Liz, pick up.  

           Liz's smile fades.

                                 DAVID (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If I don't get a call from you
                        tonight I'm booking the next flight
                        home --

           Liz hurries to the cordless phone and grabs it.  Dez watches,
           amused by the domestic drama unfolding before him.

                                 LIZ
                            (into phone)
                        David, hi!  
           Liz vanishes around the corner with the phone.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                            (whispering)
                        No.  I've not had strange men here. 
                        You know how people exaggerate. 
                        They're bored!  No, David, listen
                        to me!  I'm helping a boy.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Liz hurries up the stairs while harping into the phone.  She
           walks inside the bathroom, carefully closing the door behind
           her.  Dez rounds the corner and listens.

                                 LIZ (O.S.)
                        Not a man, just a boy in need.  Of
                        course we'll be in church this
                        Sunday.  

           Disgusted, Dez walks to Christian's door and turns the knob.

                                 LIZ (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        He'll see what life can really be
                        if he makes the right decisions...

           Dez quietly steps inside Christian's room.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ear pressed to her cordless phone, Liz pulls the lid off the
           toilet and finds a small bottle of vodka inside.  She takes
           a swig while listening to David.  

                                 LIZ
                            (into phone)
                        It's been arranged.  This Sunday
                        I'll introduce him to the whole
                        congregation.... 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Dez is clanging dishes when Liz pops into the room. 

                                 LIZ
                        Don't clean up.  I thought my little
                        gourmet was going to whip up a
                        chocolate something or other?

           Dez huffs, but keeps his back to Liz.
                                 DEZ
                        I'm just a poor boy.  I need to do
                        my part.  Fucking Oliver Twist.

                                 LIZ
                        Dezmond, come on.

                                 DEZ
                        Don't call me Dezmond.  You sound
                        like my mother, and let's get one
                        thing straight -- you are not my
                        fucking mother.

                                 LIZ
                        Dez, I had to get him off the phone.  

                                 DEZ
                        What is with you people?  You gasp
                        when I curse; you're appalled that
                        I fuck guys, but you can lie to
                        your husband and down a gallon of
                        vodka a day?  

           Liz reaches out, but Dez has had enough.  He finally turns
           to face her and reveals the EXIT UP POST-CARE GUIDEBOOK.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        I thought my parents were bad, but 
                        this is where your son really is? 
                        Is your husband one of the counselors
                        at EXIT UP? 

                                 LIZ
                        No!

                                 DEZ
                        What am I to you?  An experiment? 
                        Asking me all those inane questions
                        about being gay, my parents and
                        smothering mother!  It's all in
                        that book!

           Liz freezes.  She wants to speak, but she can't.  

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        Your son isn't a lab rat.  God, I
                        wish I could warn him.  Did you
                        really think you'd convert me, too?
                                 LIZ
                        No, Dez.  You don't understand --

                                 DEZ
                        Do you understand what they do to
                        people at those places?  They
                        brainwash them.  They shame them
                        and force them to live a fucking
                        lie, Liz.  It's sick!  It's torture -
                        Nazi shit.

                                 LIZ
                        I didn't know.  

                                 DEZ
                        I'm such a fucking idiot, but it
                        all makes sense now.  You pretend
                        to be Mrs. PTA, Mrs. Jesus H Christ,
                        while your liver is deteriorating. 
                        What's it gonna be like when hubby
                        comes home?   

           He hurries out of the room.  

           INT. LIZ'S HOUSE - SAME

           Dez grabs his jacket and his backpack.  Liz tries to stop
           him, but he pushes her away.

                                 DEZ
                        You're a fraud. 

                                 LIZ
                        Don't go.  I'll leave him.  

                                 DEZ
                        I'm not going to be your security
                        blanket.  You have a life of your
                        own.  LIVE IT!

                                 LIZ
                        Don't go back to that life, Dez. 

                                 DEZ
                        You think by keeping me here I'll
                        never fuck another guy?

                                 LIZ
                        No!  I'll talk to your parents --
           Dez laughs.

                                 DEZ
                        You wonder why so many of us come
                        from broken homes, it's because
                        people like you break them.  I
                        haven't seen my parents since I got
                        my driver's license.  I ran away
                        because I knew they knew I was gay,
                        but they wouldn't talk about it. 
                        Just like you, my parents would
                        rather pretend I was dead than gay.

           Before he opens the front door Dez takes one final look back
           at Liz, but she's too hurt to say anything.  She just pleads
           with her eyes.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        I pity your son.

           Dez takes off.  Liz just stands in her living room, silent
           and unable to move as the door SLAMS OFF SCREEN.   

           Silence.  

           Liz is alone in her big, beige house. 

           EXT. LIZ'S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Dez walks past the homes in this idyllic neighborhood. 
           PARENTS and CHILDREN sit on their couches, looking like 1950's
           commercial families watching reality TV.  

           Dez keeps walking, passing more homes.  He sees a TEENAGE
           BOY standing in front of a mirror, naked, staring at himself,
           looking torn, worried, and confused.

           Dez stops for a moment and watches the boy...and then keeps
           walking until he vanishes into the night.

           EXT. COUNTRY GAS STATION - NIGHT

           A CLERK stands inside scratching instant lottery tickets.  

           The parking lot is abandoned except for Dez.  He sits out
           front, watching a rusty old Ford pull up.  

           The BURLY DRIVER gets out and fills up his tank.  Dez makes
           eyes with the burly guy as he walks inside the gas station.
           Dez watches the guy pay for a pack of smokes and a couple
           scratch offs before walking outside.

           Dez smiles and nods at the Burly Driver, who hands him a
           ticket. 

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        Go ahead.

                                 DEZ
                        What, you want me to scratch this
                        now?

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        You look like you could use some
                        good fortune.

           Dez is not amused by this guy.  He's exhausted.

                                 DEZ
                        You give me a ride, you can keep
                        the ticket.

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        Scratch.  You win, you find your
                        own ride.  You lose, I'll take you
                        wherever you need to go.

           The Burly Driver hands Dez a penny.  Dez takes the coin, the
           ticket, and scratches it against the gas station door.  The
           Burly Driver watches with an uneasy smile. 

           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

           The rusty old truck travels the winding, cornfield lined
           roads of Central Illinois.

           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           The Burly Driver plays old folk music while keeping one eye
           on the road and the other on Dez, who stares out his window.

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        Where on the north side you headed?

                                 DEZ
                        Just drop me at the Long John
                        Silver's on Sangamon. 
                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        How's someone so young end up like
                        this?

                                 DEZ
                            (humoring him)
                        Like what?

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        Young man out in the middle of
                        nowhere, looking for a ride, looking
                        for a handout?

           Dez shrugs.

                                 BURLY DRIVER (CONT'D)
                        You gotta get your stuff together,
                        son, or you'll end up in prison...or
                        worse.

                                 DEZ
                        Thanks for the advice, pop.  

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        I bet your daddy wouldn't be too
                        keen on you hitching rides with
                        strangers.

                                 DEZ
                        My daddy?  Jesus.  Do they teach
                        you to talk like that, or does it
                        just come naturally out here? 

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        You got one life, and you boo hoo
                        your way through it, always blaming
                        others.  I've lived, boy.  

                                 DEZ
                        Look, I don't need a fucking lecture. 
                        If you're going to kick the shit
                        out of me, or rape me or whatever
                        gets you off -- just get it over
                        with already.  I've seen this movie.

           The Burly Driver is stunned.  He's silent for a moment, and
           then:
                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        If you think that why'd you get in
                        my truck?

                                 DEZ
                        I NEEDED A RIDE!

                                 BURLY DRIVER
                        Boy, you keep going like this, sooner
                        or later you're gonna run out of
                        gas.

           Dez is near tears.  He's fed up, tired of running, and unsure
           of his next move.  

           EXT. SPRINGFIELD - NIGHT

           Dez walks the quiet streets of this modest, north end
           neighborhood.  He walks past a GUTTER PUNK panhandling outside
           of Long John Silvers, then he looks at the middle-class homes
           on the other side of the street.

           Dez takes a deep breath and follows the sidewalk to the
           residential side of the street.  

           Dez stops in front of a single-family home.  He glances at
           the work-boots on the steps and the chewed-up dog toys in
           the yard.  He's weighing his options, unsure if he should
           really keep walking toward this house.

           Dez takes another breath and follows the steps to the porch. 
           His hand hovers over the doorknob, but he lets go.

           A dog BARKS.  Dez hears MUFFLED VOICES and walks away, but a
           middle-aged WOMAN in a robe with a cigarette in her mouth
           opens the door, keeping the screen shut, keeping a barrier
           between her and Dez.

           Dez stops, his back to the woman.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN
                        Yeah?

           Dez turns.  The woman gasps.

                                 MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        Dezmond!

           Dez sighs as the door SWINGS open and his mother grabs him.
                                 DEZ
                        Hey, ma.

                                                                FADE TO:

           INT. LIZ'S HOME - DAY

           The shades are pulled.  Liz is in the fetal position on the
           floor of her living room.  She's only wearing a wifebeater
           and panties, but she's covered with sweat and shaking
           violently. 

           We hear a deep SIGH.  Liz opens her eyes.  They're plagued
           by chronic dark circles and puffiness.  Her skin is ruddy.  

           Liz finds David towering over her, and he looks absolutely
           disgusted.

                                 DAVID
                        Where's the boy?

           Liz tries to speak, but nothing comes out.  

           David's face fills with rage - he grabs her, shaking her -
           needing some sort of reaction.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Nothing's going on?  Everything's
                        fine?  

                                 LIZ
                        David...

                                 DAVID
                        Where is he?!

           She can barely answer.  She's lethargic and dazed.  

                                 LIZ
                        Gone.

                                 DAVID
                        Clean yourself up.  We're going to
                        meet with Deacon James in
                        Shelbyville.  

           David kicks a path through the piles of empty bottles of
           booze and trash.  

           Liz cowers.  She covers her ears with each SMASH.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        For God's sake, Liz, who are you?  

           SMASH.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Do you realize all the
                        misunderstandings I'm going to have
                        to clear up with you and that boy?

           SMASH.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Did you ever stop to think about me
                        when you were running around with
                        him?  Didn't you think I'd find
                        out, or did you even care?

           SMASH.  SMASH.  SMASH.  

           David faces her.  He glares at her.

                                 LIZ
                        I just wanted to feel better.

           David picks Liz up and drags her up the stairs.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz lay motionless as David forces her into the bathtub and
           turns the water on.  She's mute, even as cold water hits
           her.

           David leaves the room.  The water starts to steam.  Liz has
           no energy.  She remains in the bathtub in her wifebeater and
           boxers as the water rains over her.  

           David returns with a glass of wine and kills the water.  He
           hands the glass to Liz.  She just stares at it.  He pulls
           her clothes off.

           He takes the glass and pushes it, gently, to her lips.

                                 DAVID
                        A little souvenir from Windhoek
                        Airport.  Two-hundred US per bottle. 
                        It was supposed to be for my parents.

           Liz turns away from the booze.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        Your body needs it.  This will get
                        you through today.  

           Liz looks into David's eyes.  He smiles.  He looks sincere,
           so Liz drinks the wine.

           INT. HOLY FAMILY CHURCH - DAY

           David's hand is firmly clasped around Liz's.  She's wearing
           makeup.  Her hair is done, and she's dressed and in her
           Pastor's Wife uniform.  She's wearing the mask for now.

           They sit across from a soft-spoken middle aged man in glasses,
           DEACON BROWN.  

                                 DEACON BROWN
                        -- we don't say addict here.  Each
                        meeting begins with a prayer,
                        followed by a hymn and testimony.

           David squeezes Liz's hand.

                                 DEACON BROWN (CONT'D)
                        We don't want you to be stuck in
                        some facility with vagrants and
                        Lord knows what else.

                                 DAVID
                        We can handle this our way.

                                 LIZ
                        And what is our way?

                                 DEACON BROWN
                        Prayer, Mrs. Wright.  

                                 LIZ
                        What about detox?  

                                 DEACON BROWN
                        We want you with like-minded people. 
                        We want to protect you.

                                 LIZ
                        From what?  

                                 DEACON BROWN
                        People can be judgmental, you know
                        this.
                                 LIZ
                        People, or you? 

                                 DAVID
                        Liz --

                                 DEACON BROWN
                        It's okay.

                                 DAVID
                        With everything that's happened we
                        don't think this should be public
                        knowledge.

                                 LIZ
                        "Everything"...like the suicide of
                        our son?

           The Deacon recoils. 

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Or your affair with that girl?  

           Disgusted, Liz gets up and leaves the room.  

           EXT. HOLY FAMILY CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz sits on the steps when David hurries outside -- 

                                 DAVID
                        I'm only trying to help clean up
                        your mess.

                                 LIZ
                        This isn't the help I need.

           He keeps walking.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Look at me!

                                 DAVID
                        What is wrong with you?

           He stops walking and turns to her.

                                 LIZ
                        Christian didn't need doctors or
                        three months of isolation, and I 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        don't need a Deacon, or a Pope, or
                        a Pastor.  

                                 DAVID
                        I do not have an alcoholic wife.  

                                 LIZ
                        Or a dead son or a wandering eye. 
                        Just because you say it doesn't
                        make it true.

           Liz stares at David, who looks broken.  A sad look takes
           over her face.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        You're human.  Me, too.  Right?  We
                        fucked up. 

                                 DAVID
                        Our home, our church, everything
                        we've worked so hard to build -- 

                                 LIZ
                        We can't go back.  I'm done
                        pretending, and I don't blame you
                        for moving on.

           David stares at Liz, weighing his options, breathing heavily. 
           Liz leaves him on the steps of Holy Family Church.  She gets
           in the driver's seat of his car and waits for him to join
           her. 

           EXT. LIZ'S HOME - MORNING

           David finishes loading a U-HAUL truck while Liz watches from
           inside the house. 

           From the glass of the front window, Liz makes eye contact
           with one of the neighbor WOMEN and softens her eyes, hoping
           for a smile, or a look of empathy.  Instead, she gets a
           grimace, a look of disgust. 

           Liz pulls the shades.

           EXT. TRANSITIONS - DAY

           With a suitcase in hand, Liz stands in front of a sign:
           TRANSITIONS.  
           Acres of grass, trees and ponds provide a welcoming appearance
           to this treatment facility, but that doesn't make those few
           steps from the parking lot into the front doors any easier.

           Liz stares at those looming glass doors.  She closes her
           eyes, she opens them and channels Dez.

                                 LIZ
                        Just do the damn thang, girl.

           INT. TRANSITIONS - DAY

           Liz walks through the glass doors and sees Counselor SID and
           DR. LAURENCE (40's).  Sid opens his arms to her.  

                                 SID
                        Liz Wright?

           Liz nods.

                                 SID (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to Transitions.  I'm Sid,
                        your counselor.

                                 LAURENCE
                        I'm Laurence.  I'll be helping you
                        through detox.  

           Liz hugs Sid, won't let go.  Clearly, this woman needed a
           hug.  

           INT. THERAPY ROOM - DAY

           Liz sits with ADDICTS in a circle.  Sid and Laurence sit
           among them.  A thin, middle-aged MAN with sunken cheeks and
           a long, gray hair and a beard is in the middle of a story.

                                 GRAY BEARD
                        -- when some drunk driver killed my
                        wife I went on a bender.  I tried
                        to find him when he got released. 
                        I was going to stab him, duct tape
                        him in the driver's seat of his
                        truck, and light his car on fire,
                        but I drove my Mustang into a
                        cemetery, knocking over God knows
                        how many graves.  I finally realized
                        it was time to choose, death or
                        rehab.
           Gray Beard stops and the group shuffles.

                                 LAURENCE
                        Liz, why don't you share?

           Liz shakes her head.

                                 SID
                        You've been as good as furniture in
                        these groups for two weeks now.  We
                        need you to participate.

                                 LIZ
                        I like to listen.

           The other addicts crack knuckles and sigh, disappointed and 
           annoyed by her lack of participation.

                                 LAURENCE
                        So you haven't lost anything as a
                        result of your drinking?

                                 LIZ
                        No.

           INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

           ADDICTS and STAFF dine on pastries, omelets, and coffee. 
           Liz takes a seat by herself and picks at her food.  She then
           smiles and cuts her toast into four pieces, placing a bit of
           omelet on each piece, just as Dez did when they first met. 

           Liz stops messing with her food when she looks around the
           room at the recovering addicts, as if she cannot believe
           she's here.

           Then something catches her eye.  Liz sees Sid and Laurence
           eating breakfast at the same table.  She watches them interact
           with warmth and a bit of flirtation.  This isn't an exchange
           between friendly co-workers.  There's love at the table, and
           Liz sees it.  

           She watches Sid and Laurence, intrigued.

           INT. SID'S OFFICE - LATER

           Sid takes notes in a patient-progress journal when he hears
           THREE KNOCKS.
                                 SID
                        It's open.

           Liz steps in.

                                 LIZ
                        Are you and Laurence together?

           Sid looks a bit shocked, but also humored by her abrupt
           question.

                                 SID
                        Have a seat.

           She remains on her feet.

                                 LIZ
                        How long have you been together?

                                 SID
                        Ten years.

                                 LIZ
                        So, you're in love?

           Sid smiles.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        And you're happy?

                                 SID
                        This isn't about me anymore, is it?

                                 LIZ
                        Do you believe in God?

                                 SID
                        Sure.  

                                 LIZ
                        And Laurence?

           Sid nods.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Why doesn't anyone go to church
                        here?

                                 SID
                        We do.  
                                 LIZ
                        Really?

                                 SID
                        Good Shepherd Unitarian.  We'll
                        take you anytime, just let us know.  
                            (beat)
                        We can't read your mind.  You have
                        to talk to us, Liz, or this won't
                        work.

                                 LIZ
                        I'm following the plan.

                                 SID
                        You're not just here to work the
                        physical stuff out.  

           Liz takes a deep breath and locks eyes with Sid.  They
           exchange a hopeful glance before she nods and leaves the
           room. 

           INT. THERAPY ROOM - LATER

           Liz sits in GROUP.  Sid and Laurence are both here, as well
           Gray Beard and the other addicts.  EDMOND, a white collar
           type, is mid-speech.

                                 EDMOND
                        I went a year without a drop, but I
                        needed a test, so I tried to drink
                        a single shot of rum.  I hate rum,
                        can't stomach the smell of the shit,
                        but I thought by drinking one shot
                        I'd prove that I had control over
                        booze.  I drank the entire bottle
                        before passing out in my garage. 
                        My daughter found me.  She's six. 
                        She thought I was dead.  And that's
                        why I'm here.  I owe her.  

           His eyes drop to the floor.

                                 EDMOND (CONT'D)
                        Thanks.

           Liz sits up and makes eyes with Sid.  He gives her a "go
           ahead" gesture. 
                                 LIZ
                        Well, all my life I've been focused
                        on rules and appearances, so much
                        that I betrayed my son when he
                        confided in me.  He just said,"Mom,
                        I'm in love.  Ian's his name.  He
                        loves me, too."  He stared at me,
                        waiting for my reaction, and when
                        he sensed that I didn't approve or
                        understand he panicked and begged
                        me not to tell his father.  

           Liz lowers her head in shame.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        If I had just kept my mouth shut,
                        if he had just run away maybe I'd
                        have been able to learn all that
                        I've learned without losing him.  
                            (beat)
                        We fought until we broke him down. 
                        We paid fifteen-thousand dollars to
                        rid our son of his homosexuality,
                        of his love for Ian.

           Liz struggles to hold back tears, but she has to get through
           this.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        And he was a star patient.  He never
                        challenged authority, he was always
                        respectful and humble.  Our boy
                        behaved just as we raised him.  We
                        were so proud.  
                            (beat)
                        He left therapy, said he was cured,
                        and hung himself four hours later.  
                            (beat)
                        I was too drunk and blind to save
                        my son, and then I pushed everyone
                        away until I found a boy. 

           Liz finally realizes.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I guess I just didn't know who I
                        was unless I had someone to take
                        care of.  But now...there's no one
                        left to save.  
                                 SID
                        Except you.

           Liz is overwhelmed by the group of addicts staring at her. 
           But there's no judgment.  They watch with empathetic eyes.  

           Liz closes her eyes and takes too deep of a breath.  She
           doesn't exhale until she's ready to open her eyes.  And when
           she does, she looks at Sid and Laurence and nods.

                                                                FADE TO:

           EXT. CROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY

           The parking lot is crammed with late model American cars. 

                               SUPER: 99 DAYS LATER

           Today's church sign says: IN HIS DEATH WE WALK IN NEW LIFE. 

           INT. CROSSROADS CHRISTIAN CHURCH - DAY

           The pews are full.  LITTLE GIRLS wear pastel dresses and
           oversized hats.  LITTLE BOYS wear light blue suits.  MOTHERS
           and FATHERS wear their Easter Sunday best as Pastor David
           Wright preaches to his captivated congregation.

                                 DAVID
                        ...And after His resurrection he
                        said, "I am he that liveth, and was
                        dead.  Behold, I am alive for
                        evermore, Amen".

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen.

           David closes his Bible and steps away from the pulpit with
           his microphone in hand.  He moves into the congregation,
           closer to his people, and stands in the center of the church.  

                                 DAVID
                        Easter is about rebirth, and today
                        I'd like to take some time to pray
                        for those of us who are in need of
                        that extra push to get a fresh start.  

           He looks out into the pews, searching.
                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                        If you'd like us to pray for someone
                        in need, please stand up.  Share
                        your story.  

           A proud WOMAN (50's) in white stands up and addresses the
           church.

                                 WOMAN IN WHITE
                        My Mother, Alfreda Jameson, just
                        finished her chemo, and we're praying
                        for her to beat this thing.

                                 DAVID
                        God Bless Alfreda Jameson.  May she
                        beat that awful cancer.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen.

           A shy MAN in khaki stands and speaks with his head down.

                                 KHAKI MAN
                        My son, Jake Gustafson, is in his
                        third tour of Afghanistan.  We just
                        want him to come home safe.   

                                 DAVID
                        God Bless Jake Gustafson, and all
                        our brave soldiers.

           People CLAP.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen!

           Then a woman in a beautiful, buttery yellow dress and hat
           stands up.  David looks at her, and his face pales.  

           It's Liz.  She looks awake, refreshed -- renewed.

                                 DAVID
                        Thank you all for sharing your
                        stories --

                                 LIZ
                        Wait.

           Everyone turns and looks at her.  
                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        My son, Christian. 

           David returns to the pulpit.  

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        Our son, Christian, was a beautiful
                        boy who just wanted to please his
                        parents, his community, and his
                        God.  He was funny, kind, devout,
                        and in love.  

           David stands behind the pulpit with his hands clasped, his
           eyes closed.  He cannot face anyone.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I now know that God welcomes all
                        loving relationships, I only wish I
                        could have told this to my son. 
                        I'm telling you in hopes that you'll
                        remember...if it ever comes up.  

           Silence.

           Liz musters up the courage to finish:

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        God bless Christian Wright.  

           Liz gets up and makes her way through the packed pew.  

           The entire congregation, including David, is staring at her.

           Liz makes it to the end of the aisle, and just as she's about
           to exit the church she hears:

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Amen.

           Liz stops, but only for a second.  Her back is still to the
           congregation and David, but she heard them.  She exhales a
           lifetime of relief and exorcizes years of regret before
           walking away from the church.

           INT. COZ'S DINER - DAY

           Reading the paper in her yellow dress and hat, Liz sits at
           the same booth where she had breakfast with Dez months ago.  
                                 GUY (O.S.)
                        Sorry for the wait, peach.  Seems
                        the Easter Egg Omelets are a hit.  

           Liz lowers her paper, removes her hat and looks up at Dez.

                                 DEZ
                        I'll be damned.

                                 LIZ
                        You're employed.  

                                 DEZ
                        Saving up.  Going south next month
                        to try some regional cuisine.

                                 LIZ
                        That's good news.

                                 DEZ
                        Yellow's your color, I must say.

                                 LIZ
                        Do you have a break coming up or
                        anything?  I'd like to talk to
                        you...if that's okay.

                                 DEZ
                        Give me a minute.  Bloody mary?

                                 LIZ
                        Decaf and an Easter Eggwhite omelet.

           Dez takes off, keeping his eyes on Liz the whole time.  

           Liz exhales a giant sigh of relief.  Dez slides into the
           booth with two cups of coffee.

                                 DEZ
                        Omelet's on its way.

                                 LIZ
                        Sure you won't get into trouble for
                        chatting?

                                 DEZ
                        Shit, no.  I got the owner in the
                        palm of my hand, if you know what I
                        mean.
           Liz laughs.

                                 DEZ (CONT'D)
                        You finally got one of my innuendos!  

                                 LIZ
                        I have something to tell you.

           Liz pulls Dez's hand into the center of the table and holds
           it.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I filed for divorce.

                                 DEZ
                        I won't marry you, Liz.

           Dez laughs, but Liz won't be swayed.

                                 LIZ
                        This is serious, please.  I'm ninety-
                        nine days sober.

                                 DEZ
                        Good for you.

           Liz takes a deep breath.

                                 LIZ
                        My son didn't run away.  He killed
                        himself after we convinced him to
                        go to EXIT UP.

           Dez's smile fades.  He's shocked, confused, sad -- so many
           emotions hitting him at once.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        I never wanted to change you.  I
                        just thought you should know. 

           Liz squeezes his hand and tries to pull it back, but Dez 
           reaches across the table and gives her a long kiss.  

           Overcome with emotion, Dez and Liz part, both wearing glassy-
           eyes and melancholy smiles.

           EXT. COZ'S DINER - LATER

           Arm-in-arm Dez walks Liz past the DINERS shuffling in and
           out of the busy joint.  
                                 DEZ
                        -- it took all of like six-tenths
                        of a second for ma to hug me.  

                                 LIZ
                        What a gift you gave her.

                                 DEZ
                        Dad came around.  We're seeing how
                        it goes.

                                 LIZ
                        It's not easy.

                                 DEZ
                        Shit, you're telling me?  We'll see
                        though.  So what's next for Liz?  

                                 LIZ
                        I'm planning a trip of my own.

                                 DEZ
                        Finally.

                                 LIZ
                        I don't know where yet.  I've never
                        really been anywhere.  Just looking
                        for something --

           She looks around at the American cars and the homogeneous
           FAMILIES heading inside the diner.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        -- else.

                                 DEZ
                        You, my dear, need a night at the
                        opera.  La Boheme.  

                                 LIZ
                        I don't speak Italian. 

                                 DEZ
                        You don't need to.  It's about a
                        seamstress and a poet in a tragic
                        love affair.  There's even a dramatic
                        reunion in the end.  

           Dez winks.  They arrive at Liz's car, parked at the end of
           the lot.
                                 LIZ
                        We'll see.  

                                 DEZ
                        Good luck.

                                 LIZ
                        Eat some soul food for me.  You
                        still have my cell?

           Dez nods.

                                 DEZ
                        Good seeing you.  

           They hug.  They part.  Dez starts to walk away, but Liz
           remembers something.

                                 LIZ
                        Dez.

           He turns to her.

                                 LIZ (CONT'D)
                        This is silly, but while I was in
                        treatment we had a lot of time on
                        our hands, and I was looking up the
                        meaning of my family's names on-
                        line. 

                                 DEZ
                        Oh yeah?

                                 LIZ
                        Christian means anointed one.  Liz
                        means gracious plum.

                                 DEZ
                        Let me guess, Dezmond means silly
                        fruit?

                                 LIZ
                        No.  Gracious protector.

           Liz smiles a grateful smile at Dez and slips into her car. 
           Still hanging on Liz's words, Dez watches her car drive away.     
           EXT. RURAL ILLINOIS - DAY

           An AMTRAK TRAIN speeds down the tracks alongside the
           cornfields of I-55.

           INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - DAY 

           Dez sits with SOUTHERN CUISINE books piled in the empty seat
           next to him.  But he's not reading, he's staring outside at
           the flatland of the midwest, the countryside of his home
           passing by.  He smiles.

           INT. OPERA HOUSE AUDITORIUM - DAY

           La Boheme is in the fourth and final act.  The audience is
           silent as the seamstress, MIMI, collapses.  She lies on the
           stage, motionless.  Her lover, RODOLFO, cries out in anguish
           and weeps helplessly.

           Her intense gaze directed at Rodolfo, Liz watches the scene
           from a high balcony.  

           EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA - DAY

           COUPLES dressed in formal attire trickle out of the gorgeous
           building.  

           Wearing a gown to rival any twenty-something fashionista,
           Liz saunters out of the Opera House.  She takes her time,
           absorbing the diverse NEW YORKERS, the city sounds, the
           unknown.  

           With a look of fear, uncertainty and hope, Liz Wright strolls
           down the sidewalk and disappears into the vast city.

                                                               FADE OUT.
