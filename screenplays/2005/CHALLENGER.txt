           EXT. DESERT - EARLY DAWN

           A wind catches fluttering bits of white paper, released by an 
           unseen hand. We could be anywhere in time and space. We hear 
           RADIO STATIC mixed with strains of a WALTZ carried on a 
           faraway frequency. 

                                 FEYNMAN (V.O.)
                        The Nobel Prize? Yeah, I tried to 
                        turn it down. It was a nice gesture 
                        from those fellas at the Swedish 
                        Academy, but it doesn’t mean 
                        anything. The real prize is the 
                        pleasure of finding things out, the 
                        kick in the discovery. 

           INT. CAL-TECH PHYSICS X CLASSROOM - EVENING

           In a large basement auditorium, RICHARD FEYNMAN stands 
           spotlighted in front of a blackboard covered in equations 
           With his tan youthful face, deep laugh lines, and a rumpled 
           mop of hair, he seems much younger than his 69 years.  

           Feynman holds the rapt attention of the audience of adoring 
           young STUDENTS with his warm voice, still carrying its 
           coarser Brooklyn roots.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Honors are unreal to me, okay? 
                        We're all still just apes trying to 
                        figure out how to get the banana 
                        that’s just outta reach. Most of 
                        the time we can’t, but sometimes we 
                        figure out how to tie two sticks 
                        together and we get that banana and 
                        it is very exciting – when an idea 
                        actually works!

           He sits partially on his desk, heavy with intent.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        The important thing as scientists 
                        is not to fool yourselves into 
                        thinking you’ve got something when 
                        you don’t. Because unlike you and 
                        me and the fellas at the Swedish 
                        Academy-- Mother Nature can’t be 
                        fooled.

           EXT. CAPE KENNEDY, FLORIDA - NIGHT, JANUARY 27TH, 1986

           Super: Cape Kennedy, Florida. January 27th, 1986.

           The CHALLENGER SPACE SHUTTLE looms on the 39B launch pad. 
           Twenty stories high, it is lit up with sodium lights-- 
           impressive, ominous, dominating the Florida wetlands. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOISJOLY’S OFFICE, UTAH - SIMULTANEOUS

           We hear the PANTING breath of ROGER BOISJOLY, a bald, large-
           waisted engineer, as he rushes around his office. 

           Super: Morton Thiokol Complex (MTI), Utah

           Boisjoly sweats through his button-down shirt as he 
           frantically pulls down blueprints from shelves, grabs 
           paperwork and charts, throwing them all into a file box.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD 39 B

           There is a HUMMING in the air, the repetitive HISS of 
           pressure building up and releasing from the liquid fuel 
           tanks, the sound of a living, breathing creature. Yet with 
           over two million separate parts, the space shuttle is the 
           most complex piece of technology ever built by man.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        This is no time to be getting cold 
                        feet, MTI. 

           INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           In a conference room at Cape Kennedy sits NASA manager LARRY 
           MULLOY, a bulldog in a suit-- jowly and broad-shouldered. 
           Across from him is a nervous ALLAN MCDONALD-- a reedy man 
           with glasses.

                                 MULLOY
                        First McDonald says he won’t sign 
                        the launch directive, now you’re 
                        all backing out?! I took the heat 
                        for you the last three times. I 
                        won’t do it again.

           Behind them is a COUNTDOWN CLOCK, keeping track of the hours 
           before launch. Out their window we can see the launchpad.
                                 BOISJOLY (O.S.)
                             (out of intercom)
                        Mr. Mulloy, you saw my damage 
                        reports and burn-through charts--

                                 MULLOY
                             (interrupting)
                        My God, when do you want us to 
                        launch, next April?!

           INT. MTI TELECONFERENCE ROOM, UTAH - SIMULTANEOUS

           Boisjoly stands in front of a group of men, seated around a 
           table.  There are several MTI ENGINEERS and two MTI MANAGERS. 
           Technical charts and graphs cover the table in front of 
           Boisjoly-- the proof he was frantically compiling before.

                                 BOISJOLY 
                        We’ve all looked at the data. And 
                        we all agreed to scrub.

           An awkward silence. On the table, the intercom SQUAWKS:

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        There are other companies out there 
                        who can build us a solid rocket 
                        booster. I suggest you take another 
                        look at your data, MTI. 

           The two MTI Managers exchange looks. 

                                 MANAGER #1
                        Okay, we’ll take a five minute 
                        caucus here.  Off-line.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        I just want to say, we-- we're 
                        moving away from goodness here. 

           MTI Manager #2 switches off the intercom. Manager #1 is 
           looking at Boisjoly. Looking hard...

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD 39 B - SIMULTANEOUS

           At the base of the shuttle, an ICE INSPECTION TEAM murmurs 
           with concern, as they huddle around something we can’t see. 

           The ICE TEAM CAPTAIN shakes his head.

                                 ICE TEAM CAPTAIN
                        Looks like Dr. Zhivago out here.
           One by one, they leave, dismissing the flight as obvious no-
           go, and revealing a fringe of foot-long icicles hanging from 
           the launchpad’s railings.

           We see that the icicles aren’t limited to the railing-- they 
           COVER THE ENTIRE launch pad. It’s an unsettling sight.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        How did five minutes turn into 
                        forty-five?! We’re eight hours to 
                        launch. I need your decision.

           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Back in the conference room, the room holds its breath. 
           Boisjoly looks beaten down, his shirt sticking to him, the 
           dry erase boards behind him covered in graphs and figures.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                             (into intercom)
                        Mr. Mulloy, we’ve reanalyzed our 
                        data.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        And?

                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                             (into intercom)
                        Let’s go for it.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        Are you all in agreement?

           Boisjoly meets no one’s gaze. His hands are shaking.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        No objections on this end. Right, 
                        gentlemen?

           A long silence. No one looks at Boisjoly. He slowly, 
           inconspicuously gathers his charts under his hands and slides 
           them back into the file box.

           INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Mulloy looks relieved. 

                                 MULLOY 
                        I want a launch directive as soon 
                        as possible... And don’t forget to 
                        sign it.
           EXT. LAUNCH PAD 39 B - SIMULTANEOUS

           The shuttle waits, as the sky begins to lighten behind it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CAPE KENNEDY, FLORIDA - NEXT MORNING

           From above, we see a NASA carrier van traveling the straight 
           line of the road, leading inevitably to the launchpad. 

           EXT. NASA OBSERVATION BLEACHERS - SIMULTANEOUS

           A giant digital clock inexorably counts down the minutes 
           remaining before launch. SPECTATORS, bundled up against the 
           cold, CHEER as the NASA van zooms past their bleachers.

           EXT. CAPE KENNEDY, FLORIDA - LATER

           A chipper NEWSCASTER in earmuffs addresses her CAMERAMAN.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        The question is, will NASA launch 
                        this morning after three failed 
                        attempts? In the white room, 
                        Christa McAuliffe, America’s first 
                        Teacher in Space, waits with the 
                        rest of us.

           ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE - SIMULTANEOUS

           In the White Room beside the Challenger’s entry hatch, the 
           seven excited ASTRONAUTS move towards the catwalk. Someone 
           tosses CHRISTA MCAULIFFE an apple, and she laughs.

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - MOMENTS LATER

           NASA ENGINEERS watch the pre-launch proceedings on monitors 
           in the massive Mission Control room. McDonald looks ill-at-
           ease at his console.

           ON THE GROUND

           We see the news cameras focused on the shuttle from multiple 
           angles. A hundred different versions of this one moment.

                                 ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                        T minus ten, nine, eight, seven--
           The crowd is on their feet, holding their breath. 

                                 ANNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        --four, we have main engine start!

           LAUNCH PAD - SIMULTANEOUS

           And we’re engulfed in the overwhelming roar of the engines’ 
           fire, which drowns out all other noise. 

           INT. MISSION CONTROL - SIMULTANEOUS

           McDonald nervously watches the digital readout of the 
           rocket’s technical data on a console screen.

           As the shuttle rises, Mulloy gets up and pumps his fist, then 
           pats McDonald on the back. Macdonald gives him a shaky smile.

           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM- SIMULTANEOUS

           In Utah, the conference room we saw last night is now so 
           packed that Boisjoly is forced to sit on the floor. The 
           launch is being broadcast on a big screen TV.

           As Boisjoly watches, he softly prays under his breath.

                                 ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
                             (on TV)
                        Lift off! Lift off of the twenty-
                        fifth space shuttle mission... and 
                        it has cleared the tower...

           CLOSE ON video footage on multiple monitors of the Challenger 
           climbing higher and higher in the unbroken blue.... The roar 
           of the flame and static, as the shuttle accelerates towards 
           its fate.

           Challenger suddenly EXPLODES in a huge rolling fireball, 
           splitting off into twin trails of smoke, frozen in the sky. 
           We hear the horrified GASPS and WAILS of the spectators on 
           the ground, as flaming debris trails towards the sea.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE, WASHINGTON DC - DAY

           SUPER:. Washington DC. Three days later
                                 ROGERS (O.S.)
                        If we lose control of this 
                        investigation, NASA could lose its 
                        Congressional funding. 

           NASA’s Chief Administrator BILL GRAHAM, 40’s, listens to 
           WILLIAM ROGERS, 73, former Secretary of State during the 
           Nixon administration, now the newly appointed Chairman of the 
           Presidential Commission to investigate the shuttle disaster. 

           Rogers gestures to a LIST OF NAMES, some of which have been 
           crossed off.

                                 ROGERS (CONT’D)
                        Your Mr. Wizard is a loose cannon, 
                        a publicity hound. He’s exactly the 
                        kind of trouble-maker we don’t 
                        want. 

           We see that sitting off in the background is ALTON KEEL, 
           40’s, a thin jackknife of a man who looks like he was born 
           into his suit. Keel SPINS a red pen deftly around his thumb 
           and forefinger, not missing a word of what’s being said.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Feynman’s a genius. And he’s famous 
                        throughout the scientific 
                        community.

                                 ROGERS
                        Famous for pulling stunts, and for 
                        flouting authority. We’ve already 
                        got Neil Armstrong, Chuck Yeager, 
                        Sally Ride--

                                 GRAHAM
                             (dismissive)
                        --who are all tied to NASA.

                                 ROGERS
                        How many celebrities do we need?!

                                 GRAHAM
                        Just one, who’s untouchable.

           Rogers glances at Keel, with a sour twist to his mouth. Keel 
           shrugs, as if to say, “can’t win this one.”

           Graham slips into the back of the auditorium. Taped to the 
           door is a piece of paper with “Physics X” scrawled across it. 
           Feynman stands at the front of the room, writing a 
           complicated set of equations across the board.

           The young SIMON GROSSBART, caught off guard, looks nervously 
           around. His friends don’t offer any assistance.

                                 GROSSBART
                        I don’t know... maybe to understand 
                        why we exist?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You should have stopped after “I 
                        don’t know.” THAT was the right 
                        answer. “Why” designates some sort 
                        of meaning to it all, like 
                        religion. But religion is a culture 
                        of faith, science is a culture of 
                        doubt. 

           He taps the blackboard behind him. His students perk up, 
           chewing on their pencils.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Einstein’s Special Theory of 
                        Relativity is just that-- a theory. 
                        It’s not infallible, okay? To take 
                        everything I teach you as gospel 
                        would be to doom humanity to the 
                        confines of our limited 
                        imagination. 

           Feynman sits on the edge of his desk. 

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Great progress can only come from 
                        embracing uncertainty. Doubt is not 
                        to be feared, but to be welcomed. 
                        Doubt is in-ter-esting. We owe it 
                        to the future not to know. 

           Grossbart raises his hand. Feynman acknowledges him.
                                 GROSSBART
                        So does this mean we’ll pass this 
                        class by being really good at not 
                        knowing?

           The laugh lines of Feynman’s face deepen.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I seriously doubt it.

           While getting off the desk, Feynman suddenly staggers a 
           little, and has to brace himself.  

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        I think that’s it for today.  

           The students, a little puzzled by the abruptness, gather 
           their things.  Graham fights like a salmon against the stream 
           of exiting students. Feynman sits at his desk, exhausted.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Dr. Feynman!

           Graham comes up and shakes his hand vigorously. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You’ll have to refresh my memory.

                                 GRAHAM
                        Bill Graham. I was in this same 
                        classroom a million years ago.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        And what are you up to these days?

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m head of NASA. 

           Feynman looks up with a smile.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I assume you passed, then.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m here about the Presidential 
                        Commission to investigate the 
                        Challenger accident...

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (smile fading)
                        Don’t ask me.

           Graham is caught off guard.
                                 GRAHAM
                        I assure you, it would only take up 
                        a few months of your time--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        These days, time’s my most valuable 
                        commodity.

           He carries his briefcase out of the room, followed by Graham.

           EXT. CAL-TECH CAMPUS - LATER

           They walk together towards the staff parking lot. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’ve got my own work to do-- work I 
                        find much more interesting than 
                        which bolt of yours shoulda got 
                        tightened and didn’t. No offense.

           They’ve reached Feynman’s van-- which is covered in hand-
           painted spidery Feynman physics diagrams in bright colors.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m sure you understand, it would 
                        be a great service to your country. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I did my service back during the 
                        war, at a little place called Los 
                        Alamos.

           Graham tries another tack, desperate to break through 
           Feynman’s nonchalance.

                                 GRAHAM
                        As a man of science, don’t you feel 
                        a responsibility to use your 
                        knowledge to benefit society?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry, but I’m sort of a super-Jew: 
                        impervious to guilt. 

           Feynman finishes loading his van, and shakes Graham’s hand.  

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Besides, if scientists worried 
                        about responsibility all the time, 
                        nothing would ever get 
                        accomplished. 

           Graham is out of ideas.
                                 GRAHAM
                             (holding onto his hand)
                        Just-- think about it?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        It’s been nice seein’ ya. And hey-

           He tucks a theater ticket into Graham’s shirt pocket.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m headlining tonight. Check it 
                        out.

           As Feynman gets into his van, a puzzled Graham takes the 
           ticket out and examines it.

                                 STUDENT ACTORS (O.S.)
                        All hail the Chief! Chief Bali Hai!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAL-TECH THEATER - THAT NIGHT

           A group of STUDENTS dressed in South Pacific garb, grass 
           skirts and leis, pound on drums.

           In the darkened audience sits Graham, next to Feynman’s 
           British wife GWENETH, 49 and pretty, and Feynman’s coltish 
           daughter MICHELLE, 16.

           The drumming intensifies and suddenly a figure rises from a 
           trap door in the stage, amidst much dry-ice mist. He is 
           wearing an elaborate feather headdress and grass skirt.

           It is Richard Feynman, a pair of bongo drums tucked under one 
           arm. The audience goes wild, CHEERING and HOOTING. He’s a 
           rock star.  Feynman starts drumming, and we see his skill-- 
           he’s an expert player. Even Graham is impressed.

           INT. FEYNMAN HOUSEHOLD KITCHEN - FOLLOWING MORNING

           The kitchen is flooded with yellow morning light. Gweneth 
           watches coverage of the shuttle disaster. 

           We see the twin trails of smoke on the TV, the careening 
           solid rocket boosters shooting off in two directions.
                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        Until the wreckage has been 
                        recovered officials can do little 
                        but speculate as to the cause of 
                        the accident that killed America’s 
                        first Teacher In Space-

           A photo appears on TV of Christa McAuliffe-- in front of a 
           classroom of children, wearing her NASA-issue jumpsuit. CLOSE 
           ON McAuliffe’s face, glowing with excitement and hope. 

           Gweneth is engrossed and doesn’t see at first when Feynman 
           enters the kitchen behind her wearing PJs and bunny slippers.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Where do we keep the spoons around 
                        here?

                                 GWENETH
                        Sorry?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        The spoons!

                                 GWENETH
                        Same place they’ve been for the 
                        last 15 years, sweetheart.

           He opens the cutlery drawer, gets two spoons. Opens freezer.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        How many times can you watch that 
                        thing explode?

           He takes out a carton of mint ice cream, then spoons ice 
           cream into two bowls.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Seven astronauts dead, and for 
                        what? Watching spiders weave webs 
                        in zero g? I’m telling you, we took 
                        a wrong turn after Apollo.

           He casually shakes a few pills out of a prescription bottle 
           and tosses them back.

           Suddenly we hear RONALD REAGAN’s voice-- it’s a sound bite 
           from his press conference on TV.

                                 REAGAN (O.S.)
                        We don't hide our space program. We 
                        don't keep secrets and cover things 
                        up. We do it all up front and in 
                        public. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REAGAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        That's the way freedom is, and we 
                        wouldn't change it for a minute.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        They’re gonna bungle this thing, I 
                        can tell. 

                                 GWENETH
                             (exasperated)
                        Shh! Enough, Richard.

                                 REAGAN
                             (on TV)
                        We will never forget them, nor the 
                        last time we saw them, this 
                        morning, as they prepared for their 
                        journey and waved good-bye and 
                        slipped the surly bonds of earth to 
                        touch the face of God.

           Gweneth is openly tearful. Feynman can’t help but feel a 
           twinge at this. He slips away quietly.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S BASEMENT STUDY - LATER

           Feynman, wearing pajamas and bunny slippers, and his daughter 
           Michelle, are sprawled out on the carpet of his study. He’s 
           skimming through her algebra textbook. Two empty ice cream 
           bowls lay nearby.  

                                 FEYNMAN
                        This math is all funny-thinking! 
                        Let me show you a short-cut.

           He reaches for her homework, but Michelle snatches it away.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Your tricks cost me points for not 
                        showing my work.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        But you got the right answers in 
                        half the time!

           Michelle closes the book and kisses him on the cheek. 

                                 MICHELLE
                        Only Nobel Prize winners get to use 
                        short-cuts. The rest of us have to 
                        follow the rules. Thanks anyway.

           She trots up the stairs. After a moment he calls after her:
                                 FEYNMAN
                        ...They’re not tricks if they work! 

           INT. FEYNMAN’S BASEMENT STUDY - LATER

           We hear the sound of Feynman HUMMING to himself as we pan 
           slowly over the walls of his office, on which hang photos of 
           him shaking hands with Einstein, playing bongo drums in 
           Brazilian costume, charcoal drawings of nudes, rubbings of 
           Mayan hieroglyphics. An amazingly diverse life on display.

           We linger on one photo in particular: a black and white 
           glossy of himself as a young man in the desert, amidst a 
           group of other scientists. One of the men is recognizable by 
           his broad-brimmed hat to be ROBERT OPPENHEIMER. Behind the 
           group, the first ATOMIC BOMB is being hoisted onto a skeletal 
           steel tower.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                             (muttering to self)
                        Wait Feynman, that’s a mistake...

           As he scribbles physics equations across scraps of paper, 
           napkins, anything within his grasp. Meanwhile, Gweneth 
           descends the stairs behind him. She reaches the bottom step 
           and sits gingerly on it, waiting.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (after a moment)
                        Okay, what?!

                                 GWENETH
                        Grumpy lately, aren’t we?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’M NOT GRUMPY! I’m never grumpy.

           She looks at him, eyebrow raised.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        So I’m a little grumpy. I can’t see 
                        my way into this problem.

                                 GWENETH
                        You’ve been thinking about this 
                        NASA investigation.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I don’t want to be on that 
                        committee. I hate committees!

           She gets up and goes to him, placing her hands lightly on his 
           shoulders, as if she can feel the tension radiating off him.
                                 GWENETH
                        I know. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        It’s coming at the worst possible 
                        time.

                                 GWENETH
                        I know. But darling, could you find 
                        out what went wrong?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I don’t know, maybe. So what? 

           Gweneth looks like she’s fighting with herself. Reluctantly, 
           she continues.

                                 GWENETH
                        So, those eleven Commissioners are 
                        going to be lead around from place 
                        to place, seeing all the same 
                        things. But if you’re there, then 
                        there will be eleven people doing 
                        that, and then you, who will be 
                        running all over the place, 
                        checking out unusual things. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You heard the news, it could’ve 
                        been anything--

                                 GWENETH
                        Or just one thing, Dick. One thing 
                        that no one else sees, no one else 
                        COULD see, except for you. Because 
                        you’re you.

           Feynman looks up and notices the bereft look on her face.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (upset)
                        Ah, damn it to hell. 

           She pulls him into an embrace, her eyes creasing with worry. 
           He holds her tight.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREETS - NEXT MORNING

           In a stark contrast to sunny California, Washington DC is 
           gripped by February’s chill. The marble monuments glow 
           deceptively warm in the pink light of morning.
           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE, DC - MORNING

           A jet-lagged Feynman hurries down the hall to his first 
           meeting, towing his wheeled suitcase behind him. The wheels 
           SQUEAK, echoing in the grandiose marble hallways.

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman opens the door on the first Commission conference, 
           catching Rogers in mid-sentence. He looks at his watch, 
           pointedly. 

                                 ROGERS
                        Dr. Feynman, I presume? 

           Pencils stop their writing. Eleven heads swivel to take in 
           this newcomer.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        That’s right. Looks like I’m the 
                        twelfth disciple.

           All of the others wear name tags. Included in this 
           illustrious group of astronauts, journalists, and scientists 
           are NEIL ARMSTRONG, CHUCK YEAGER, SALLY RIDE, and a handsome 
           man who wears his uniform with quiet dignity, GENERAL KUTYNA. 

                                 ROGERS
                        I’m William Rogers. There are name 
                        tags on the sideboard. We’ll, ah, 
                        do the introductions again later.

           A continental breakfast set up next to the pile of name tags.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Is this spread over here for us?

           Rogers nods. Feynman pours himself some granola, oblivious to 
           the fact that no one else is eating. He grabs a name tag and 
           sits beside Neil Armstrong, taking note of his name tag.

           CLOSE ON ARMSTRONG’S NAME TAG: The pre-printed label reads 
           “Hello, my name is:” followed by the handwritten, “Neil 
           Armstrong.”

           Armstrong glances at Feynman’s name tag, on which is written 
           “Chief Bali Hai.” Armstrong looks away, not amused.

                                 ROGERS
                        Now tomorrow is the public swearing-
                        in ceremony, and there will be 
                        questions from the press. It is-- 
           Feynman CHOMPS granola. Rogers loses his train of thought and 
           glares at Feynman. Feynman stops chewing.

                                 ROGERS (CONT’D)
                        It’s imperative that we speak with 
                        one voice, as a unified body. We 
                        will now cover the parameters for 
                        press interaction--

           Feynman raises his hand, is stiffly acknowledged.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Excuse me, but this being the first 
                        meeting and all, I’m just wondering 
                        when we’re going to get the 
                        technical information.

                                 ROGERS
                        We have briefings scheduled for 
                        next week. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Shouldn’t we get that information 
                        first? All the nuts and bolts stuff 
                        on how the shuttle works?

                                 ROGERS
                        Our report isn’t expected to be a 
                        technical investigation. We may 
                        never find out what really happened-

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Whaddya mean we won’t find out what 
                        happened? Isn’t that the whole 
                        point?

           Feynman sees that most of the other Commissioners are annoyed 
           by his interruptions.  Kutyna alone, covers a gentle smile.

                                 ROGERS
                        I don’t think you understand--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I think I’m beginning to. 

           EXT. BUILDING - LATER

           Feynman exits the building after the meeting, visibly 
           disgruntled. He struggles to carry several large and unwieldy 
           binders, along with his suitcase. Kutyna catches up to him.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Need a hand, Professor?
           Feynman again eyes the uniform. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Let me guess-- Eagle scout.

           Kutyna smiles as he takes the stack of binders from Feynman.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Airforce, actually. You missed the 
                        introductions. I’m Don Kutyna.

           They shake hands. Feynman is leery.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So, General. Which one of these 
                        monsters is yours?

           He gestures to the line of LIMOUSINES at the curb. Rogers 
           disappears into one.

                                 KUTYNA
                        A two star general doesn’t get a 
                        limo in Washington. I take the 
                        subway.

           INT. METRO STOP - LATER

           Kutyna walks Feynman to his subway platform and hands him 
           back his binders.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Thanks. DC’s a labyrinth to me.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’ll get the hang of this place. 
                        All you need is a map... and a 
                        warmer coat. It gets cold here.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I don’t need a coat. What I need is 
                        to go back to California.

           The General looks surprised and saddened.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’re leaving?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        On the first flight I can get. This 
                        whole thing was a mistake. PR and 
                        luncheons aren’t what I signed up 
                        for. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FEYNMAN (CONT'D)
                        I want technical manuals and 
                        blueprints, rocket models. You 
                        know, the fun stuff!

                                 KUTYNA
                        I hope you’ll reconsider, 
                        Professor. I think the Commission 
                        could use a man like you. 

           Feynman’s train pulls up, before Feynman can respond 
           properly. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I guess any General who takes the 
                        subway can’t be all bad.

           Kutyna smiles. Through the glass, Feynman grins back. 

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC MALL - LATER

           There’s a fierce wind blowing, and Feynman leans into it, 
           tugging his wheelie suitcase through the icy streets. He’s 
           inadequately dressed, and lost to boot. First one way... Then 
           the other... The Professor is helpless in a sea of strangers.

           At last, the shivering Feynman pauses to blow warm air into 
           his bare hands, when he realizes where he is: before him 
           climb the imposing white steps to the NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE 
           MUSEUM. Feynman pauses, considering... 

           INT. NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ATRIUM - LATER THAT DAY

           In the massive atrium, we see planes and space capsules 
           suspended from the ceiling. Feynman ENTERS the doors, huffing 
           and puffing from dragging his suitcase all the way up here.

           As Feynman walks through the galleries, he does a double-take 
           of a wax figure of Sally Ride in flight uniform, holding her 
           astronaut’s helmet. 

           Above her is a sign that reads “Now Playing: ‘The Dream Is 
           Alive’ with an arrow pointing to the Imax theater entrance.

           INT. IMAX MUSEUM THEATER - LATER

           On screen plays “The Dream is Alive,” a documentary about the 
           Shuttle Program.  We see the eerie image of the Challenger 
           astronauts on an earlier mission, sleeping in zero gravity, 
           arms floating as if their bodies were underwater. Next we see 
           gorgeous imagery of the earth accompanied by inspirational 
           music. 
           Feynman is illuminated by light cast by the film. In spite of 
           himself, he is moved by it.

           INT. MUSEUM GIFT SHOP - LATER

           Feynman smirks at all the crass commercialization of the 
           space program, the key chains and T-shirts. But even as he 
           does so, he pays for a toy model of a shuttle.

           INT. NATIONAL AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM ATRIUM - LATER

           Feynman is waist-high in a sea of elementary SCHOOLCHILDREN 
           on a field trip. He trails along with them as their teacher 
           points out the important aircraft suspended from the atrium’s 
           ceiling. Strangely, he does not look out of place among them.

                                 TEACHER
                        There’s the Spirit of St. Louis, 
                        which carried Charles Lindbergh 
                        across the Atlantic ocean. And next 
                        to it is the first working 
                        airplane, invented by the Wright 
                        Brothers!

           The kids’ mouths hang open as they stare at the marvels high 
           above their heads. A little BOY raises his hand.

                                 BOY
                        What’s the shiny plane over there?

           The whole class, including Feynman, pivots to see where he’s 
           pointing...

           ...and Feynman stops dead in his tracks as the rest of the 
           kids move in the plane’s direction. The plane looms high 
           above them, silver and streamlined.

                                 TEACHER (O.S.)
                        That’s the Enola Gay. It was the 
                        plane that dropped the atomic bomb 
                        on Hiroshima. Does anyone know what 
                        an atomic bomb is?

           FLASH: 

           A SEARING WHITE LIGHT-- which dims into the DESERT SUN.

           BACK ON:

           Feynman staggers a little, and leans on a railing, shielding 
           his eyes from an imaginary glare above him. He is getting 
           lost in his memories.
           FLASHBACK TO LOS ALAMOS, 1945:

           As he lowers his hands, and we see now a he’s staring up at a 
           metallic ball covered in wires that’s being hoisted up a 
           skeletal tower. It is the first ATOMIC BOMB-- the image is 
           right out of the black and white photograph in Feynman’s 
           study.

           He stands among the scientists, including ROBERT OPPENHEIMER 
           in his famous broad-brimmed hat. Everyone smiles as they 
           watch the bomb being hoisted, excitement in the air.

           BACK ON:

           Feynman in the museum, breathing heavily. He suddenly seems a 
           weakened man. He watches the children being taught about the 
           Atomic Bomb, and the sight goes straight to his heart.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOISJOLY’S OFFICE, MTI - DAY

           Back in Utah, Boisjoly is packing up things from his office, 
           stripping it of the framed photos of his family, his various 
           engineering diplomas, etc. 

           Lastly, he furtively picks up a heavy FILE BOX full of 
           folders that we recognize from the night of the launch.  

           INT. MTI HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

           It’s Sunday and MTI is deserted. Boisjoly carries his file 
           box down the long hallway, his footsteps echoing. He seems 
           jumpy, and clutches the box to his chest like a baby.

           EXT. MTI PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           We see the front of Boisjoly from inside the trunk of his car 
           as he places the box inside. SLAM. He closes the trunk.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1 (O.S.) 
                        You’re only taking personal 
                        objects, I assume.

           Boisjoly jumps, seeing that the two MTI Managers from the 
           night of the teleconference call are behind him. 

           We see that Boisjoly’s car is practically the only one in the 
           lot, parked far out-- a boat in a sea of concrete.
           Boisjoly takes a step back, placing himself between the 
           managers and the trunk of his car.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        Of course. That’s what I came in 
                        for... Why are you here on a 
                        weekend?

                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                        We came to wish you luck. Though 
                        we’re still not sure why you’re 
                        leaving us.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        I- I just want to go somewhere I 
                        can forget about this for a while.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        That’s a good idea, this whole town 
                        is reeling right now.

                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                        We just want to make sure you don’t 
                        do anything stupid. People wouldn’t 
                        understand.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        No one who wasn’t in that room will 
                        understand the way we do. 

           Boisjoly drops his eyes and hurries into his car.

           INT. BOISJOLY’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Boisjoly casts a look over his shoulder as he pulls out of 
           the parking lot. The two men in suits still stand there, 
           watching him go, their shadows long in the afternoon sun.

           EXT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE - MORNING

           Establishing shot of the impressive building. Limos are 
           pulling up in front, letting out Rogers and Neil Armstrong.

           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AUDITORIUM - MORNING

           Kutyna and the other members of the committee stand in a row 
           on a dais in front of a sea of REPORTERS. A large American 
           flag hangs behind them. We pan across until we arrive at 
           Feynman’s seat, which is empty, marked by his nameplate.

           Kutyna is preoccupied-- glances at the clock and at the door. 
           Suddenly the door opens and Feynman strides in purposefully. 
           His hair is windblown, he carries a thick wool coat with him. 
           Relieved, Kutyna waves him over to the seat beside him.

           Feynman opens his Cal-Tech composition book, ready to start 
           taking notes on the meeting.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Copilot to pilot, comb your hair.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (sarcastic)
                        Got a comb, General?

           Kutyna whips a comb from his pocket and slides it to Feynman, 
           who, humbled, combs his hair as Graham reads aloud:

                                 GRAHAM
                        Please repeat after me: “I do 
                        solemnly swear that I will 
                        faithfully perform the duties of 
                        Investigator General--”

           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Sitting in a row at a table are the several nervous-looking 
           NASA MANAGERS there to brief the Commission.

           NASA MANAGER #1 references frames of video footage on a 
           screen showing the disintegration of the shuttle frame by 
           frame. In the first frame, the shuttle appears to be fine. 

                                 NASA MANAGER #1
                        Here the shuttle is rising normally-
                             (he points out the parts)
                        - you can see the solid rocket 
                        boosters, the external tank, the 
                        shuttle main engines here, and 
                        lastly the crew compartment, here--

           In the second frame, a white plume of flame seeps out of the 
           right-hand rocket. His tone changes, becoming more clinical.

                                 NASA MANAGER #1 (CONT’D)
                        There appears to be some fire here, 
                        coming out at 59.8 seconds. 

           He switches to the third frame. There is a white circle 
           imposed around the problem area.
                                 NASA MANAGER #1 (CONT’D)
                        Here that fire has grown and merged 
                        into the tail. We’re at 73 seconds, 
                        just milliseconds from the breakup.

           He progresses to the final frame-- post-explosion. Amidst the 
           ball of fire, pieces of the shuttle plummet towards the 
           ocean.  The difference between the before and after frames is 
           vast, and incredibly vague. 

           In the meantime we see a pale McDonald, (the reedy man who we 
           recognize from the night before the launch,) enter the room 
           from a side security door. No one notices him.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Now, in that second photo it 
                        appears to me that flame might be 
                        coming from the side of the right-
                        hand solid rocket booster. 

           The press jots this down. Rogers looks displeased at this.

                                 NASA MANAGER #1
                             (thrown off)
                        We don't know for sure it is the 
                        SRB.  It might’ve been the SRMs, 
                        SSMEs, the ET, the ATCS, even the 
                        EPS that caused the in flight 
                        anomaly.

           Feynman looks around to see if anyone else is as lost as he 
           is. No one is showing any confusion, so he raises his hand.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry, I'm just a theoretical 
                        physicist, not a rocket scientist, 
                        and I’m drowning in the alphabet 
                        soup. Can’t one of you explain the 
                        whole system to me in simple terms? 

           The older southern man, NASA MANAGER #2, fields this one.

                                 NASA MANAGER #2
                        I think it’s important for the 
                        Commission to understand that the 
                        shuttle is the most complex piece 
                        of machinery ever built by man. No 
                        single individual can possibly 
                        understand the entire system, it is 
                        beyond understanding. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        But surely someone--
           Chairman Rogers is impatient.

                                 ROGERS
                        Professor, you don’t need to 
                        understand all the technical 
                        details at this time, and General, 
                        you shouldn’t speculate on the 
                        cause of the accident until we have 
                        more information, which we’ll get 
                        during our visit to the Cape.

           Nodding, Kutyna displays no irritation at being shot down. 

                                 RIDE
                             (to NASA Managers)
                        Do you have any additional, more 
                        detailed photos of the break-up? 

                                 NASA MANAGER #1
                        Many photos didn’t turn out. 

                                 NASA MANAGER #2  
                        Some cameras jammed in the cold.

                                 NASA MANAGER #3  
                        The quality of these is not ideal, 
                        and for that we apologize. But this 
                        is all that we have at this time.

           Feynman struggles not to get impatient with their bumbling. 

           INT. GRAHAM’S OFFICE - LATER 

           We see a SECRETARY’s hand knocking on a door marked MR. 
           GRAHAM, CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR. It looks like until recently, 
           another, larger nameplate hung in the same spot.

                                 GRAHAM (O.S.)
                        Yes?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Professor Feynman is on the phone 
                        for you, Sir.

           Through the plate glass of his office wall, we see him pick 
           up. We follow the Secretary back to her desk, hearing the 
           conversation, only slightly muffled through the thin walls.

                                 GRAHAM 
                        Dick! What can I do you for?
                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Can you get me into NASA HQ to talk 
                        to some engineers? I’m getting 
                        nowhere with these managers.

                                 GRAHAM
                             (nervously)
                        Now, Chairman Rogers doesn’t want 
                        anyone going off on their own.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Come on, who’s the head of NASA, 
                        you or Rogers? I just want to talk 
                        to some engineers. 

                                 GRAHAM
                             (considering)
                        You know what? Rogers doesn’t even 
                        have to know. I’ll arrange a 
                        special briefing, just for you.

           The secretary leans forward slightly, listening. She quietly 
           reaches for the phone.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - EVENING

           HEARTY LAUGHTER leads us through a wood paneled good old 
           boys’ club, glutted with fatcat POLITICOS and clouds of cigar 
           smoke.

           Sitting around a table with several SOUTHERN CONGRESSMEN, is 
           Al Keel, red pen tucked in his front suit pocket. 

           They’re nursing scotches, having a merry time, when a SUITED 
           WAITER approaches and whispers in the ear of the oldest 
           Senator. The Senator rises, using an ivory-tipped cane.

           The Senator follows the waiter to the bar, where a BLACK 
           PHONE is waiting. He speaks quietly.

           Off Al Keel, his eyes never leaving the Senator’s face. His 
           pen is out of his pocket and spinning between his fingers...

           INT. NASA HEADQUARTERS CAFETERIA - SATURDAY MORNING

           The NASA cafeteria is empty on this Saturday. Around the 
           table are seated several NASA ENGINEERS from various 
           branches. One of the engineers studiously constructs a paper 
           clip chain. Feynman sits across from them.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        Okay look. I’m in a complete 
                        fuzdazzle here, with all these 
                        different systems. I need your 
                        help.

                                 ENGINEER
                        We were told we wouldn’t have to 
                        testify.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        This isn’t testimony, it’s just us 
                        technical guys sitting around 
                        shooting the breeze.

           A couple engineers are mildly gratified by this.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Are you sure you don’t want to be 
                        talking to our managing directors?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You guys built the shuttle, didn’t 
                        you? Why would I want to talk to 
                        anyone else?

           And like that, they’re won over.

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        Where do you want to start?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        My General friend mentioned 
                        something about the right-hand 
                        SRB... 

           The engineers settle in, ready to put in a long day.

           INT. NASA HEADQUARTERS CAFETERIA - LATER

           Feynman is grilling a NASA ROCKET SEALS EXPERT for 
           information. They’ve obviously been at work a long time, as 
           there are charts and blueprints littered about.  

           Feynman has his Cal-Tech composition book open, and we see 
           that it’s filled with handwritten facts and figures. 
           Unscrolled in front of him is a blueprint showing the whole 
           shuttle, as well as the SRBs, how they’re created in pieces.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So these solid rocket boosters are 
                        made in sections right? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FEYNMAN (CONT'D)
                        Because one whole rocket is too big 
                        to transport by itself?

           The expert nods. Feynman picks a strange piece of metal. It’s 
           a cross-section of a BOOSTER JOINT, with black rubber o-ring 
           seals sandwiched in the joint.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        And this is the joint that connects 
                        the booster segments?

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        Right. It connects them here... 
                        Here, and uh, here.

           He circles the joints with a red pen on the blueprint. 
           Feynman quickly sketches the field joint in his notebook.

           Meanwhile, we see Al Keel unobtrusively enter the cafeteria. 
           He goes to a vending machine, taking his time to find change. 

           As the rest of the scene plays out, Keel gets a Coke, opens 
           it, without attracting anyone’s attention. Listening to every 
           word they say.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So these rubber o-ring seals here 
                        are all that’s keeping the hot 
                        gases in the boosters from 
                        escaping?

           He points to the rubber sticking out of the joint model.

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        That’s right. They’re actually 
                        about 27 feet around.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Why are there two of them?

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        Well sometimes there’s erosion on 
                        the first one.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You mean it gets burned?

           The expert nods, shifting in his seat.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        What about the second one?
                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        There was secondary seal erosion on 
                        a few occasions. Caused by blow-by-- 
                        that is, hot gas leaking out from 
                        around the first seal.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        And how hot is that gas in there?

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        Around... 5600 degrees.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Gas that hot boils steel! So it’s 
                        more like “blow-torch” rather than 
                        “blow-by,” isn’t it?

           No one notices as Keel quietly leaves, having heard it all.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t happen to have any DATA 
                        on this “blow by” from past 
                        flights, do you? 

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        I can get you that information.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Or just put me in touch with your 
                        top o-ring guy.

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        That would be Roger Boisjoly over 
                        at MTI. 
                             (off Feynman’s clueless 
                              look)
                        They’re the independent contractor 
                        who builds NASA’s solid rockets. 

           Feynman writes Boisjoly’s name in his notebook.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So how can I reach this Boisjoly?

                                 ROCKET SEALS EXPERT
                        You can’t.
                             (beat)
                        He took a leave of absence from MTI 
                        last week. 

           Off Feynman gazing at the expert over his glasses.
           INT. BOISJOLY’S BEDROOM, UTAH - MIDNIGHT

           The sound of GLASS BREAKING wakes up Roger Boisjoly. His wife 
           sleeps beside him. Uneasy, he waits to hear something more, 
           but all is silent. He gets out of bed.

           HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Boisjoly approaches the bedroom of his sleeping teenage 
           daughter. He peers in-- she sleeps peacefully. Suddenly he 
           hears MUFFLED CURSING and the sudden SCREECHING of tires from 
           outside.

           LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Boisjoly quickly pads down the stairs into his living room. 

           Pulling aside his curtains, he sees the flickering light of 
           FIRE outside. His trash can has been pulled into the center 
           of his yard, and is burning.

           He THROWS OPEN the front door--

           EXT. BOISJOLY HOME - CONTINUOUS

           As Boisjoly’s screen door bangs shut, he turns around and 
           sees in red paint scrawled across the front of his house: 

           “MURDERER” 

           In the firelight the words appear a nightmarish condemnation. 
           Off Boisjoly’s expression, torn between anger and fear.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Rogers looks out the window of his office onto the Capitol 
           building. He has the phone cradled to his ear.

                                 ROGERS
                             (into phone)
                        General, I have an assignment for 
                        you: I want you to take the 
                        Professor under your wing. 

           INT. GENERAL KUTYNA’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Kutyna is meticulously putting on his uniform as he listens.
                                 ROGERS (O.S.)
                        Apparently he’s been taking 
                        independent briefings at NASA over 
                        the weekend. I’m sure you 
                        understand why that’s unacceptable. 

                                 KUTYNA
                        I’ll talk to him.

                                 ROGERS (O.S.)
                        Do. And I’ll put in a good word at 
                        the Pentagon about getting you that 
                        third star.

           Kutyna listens, looking a little uneasy as he views himself 
           in the mirror, in full regalia.

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           As Rogers hangs up the phone, a copy of the Sunday New York 
           Times is placed directly under his nose. It’s headline is 
           circled in red pen, and screams: “NASA Accountant Says: NASA 
           Had Multiple Warnings of a Disaster Risk Posed by Booster.”

           Thin-lipped with anger, Rogers looks up at the man who 
           brought it to him: Al Keel. Wordlessly, Keel turns on his 
           heel and leaves Rogers to digest the leak to the press.

           INT. CONCERT HALL - THAT EVENING

           Kutyna sits in the front row of a Military Band Concert next 
           to his pretty wife LUCY, listening to the brass band. After a 
           moment, Kutyna gets up, circumspectly excusing himself.

           INT. CONCERT HALL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Kutyna is on the phone at the concert hall’s front desk. 
           Everything around him is draped with patriotic bunting, and 
           we can hear the strains of the music coming through clearly.

           We hear Feynman pick up on the other end.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Hi Professor-- it’s Don Kutyna.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Feynman is at his desk, on which is perched the toy shuttle 
           model. He has marked it up with a sharpie, with various 
           arrows pointing to possible burn-through points.
           He’s wearing just his boxer shorts, and we see that his 
           abdomen is crisscrossed with surgery scars. He fans himself 
           with his Cal-Tech composition book.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (genuinely pleased)
                        General! 

                                 KUTYNA (O.S.)
                        How you holding up?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Well my room’s thermostat only has 
                        two settings: Sahara and Arctic, 
                        but otherwise I’m swell.

           Feynman opens the book: inside we see that he’s written list 
           of strange numbers, such as “STS launch 51-c, 53 degrees” and 
           “STS launch 41-B, 56 degrees” into a hand-drawn graph. 

           INT. CONCERT HALL LOBBY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Kutyna speaks over the wave of APPLAUSE coming from the hall.

                                 KUTYNA 
                        Listen, I was wondering if you 
                        might be free to join my wife and 
                        me for dinner at our house tomorrow-

           He’s suddenly drowned out by the sound of the National Anthem 
           being played at full volume. Automatically, Kutyna stands at 
           attention, forced to drop the phone as he salutes the flag. 

           The phone receiver dangles, as Feynman’s voice emanates:

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Hello? General?! ...What’s that 
                        racket? 

           Kutyna grimaces at the awkwardness of the situation.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Perplexed, Feynman lays the receiver on his desk, and 
           continues to work on his list of statistics. Out of the phone 
           comes the tinny RENDITION of the Star Spangled Banner.
           INT. KUTYNA’S LIVING ROOM - NEXT EVENING

           On a mantle, Feynman examines framed photos of Kutyna in the 
           military: a young flyboy grinning in front of a fighter jet, 
           shaking hands with famous Generals. There are framed medals 
           of honor, and plaques with pictures of rockets on them. 

           Lastly Feynman picks up a silver model plane on a stand, with 
           a little plaque that reads “The Polish Glider.” 

                                 KUTYNA (O.S.)
                        Beauty, isn’t she? Flew her in 
                        Vietnam. 120 missions.

           Feynman starts, a little abashed. Kutyna has entered the room 
           with drinks in hand. 

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        Darned thing would try and kill you 
                        every time you got in it. You like 
                        models?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sure do, but not this kind. 

           He grins. Kutyna laughs.

           INT. KUTYNA’S LIVINGROOM - LATER 

           Feynman and Kutyna sit next to each other on the couch. 
           Feynman has his toy shuttle in his hands to demonstrate.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I think your idea about the rocket 
                        boosters was dead-on, and that New 
                        York Times article confirms it. I 
                        talked to a guy over at NASA this 
                        weekend, and it turns out they’ve 
                        been having all sorts of problems 
                        with something called blow-by on 
                        the o-rings. Burning through ‘em 
                        like Reagan did the budget. ...Now 
                        look at this.

           He rotates the shuttle so that we can see where he’s drawn 
           the lines of the rocket joints.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Seems awful close to where we saw 
                        that fire, doesn’t it?
                                 KUTYNA
                        True. But that’s not enough to 
                        prove anything.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        That’s why I made this list.

           He opens his notebook to the handwritten list we saw earlier.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        These are all the flights that had 
                        erosion on the back-up seal. The 
                        numbers next to them are the 
                        outside air temperatures from that 
                        day of the launch.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (impressed)
                        So you’re drawing a correlation 
                        between cold weather and o-ring 
                        malfunction? 

           Feynman nods.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        ...You know, Commission protocol 
                        suggests we turn in all relevant 
                        findings...

           Feynman scrutinizes Kutyna, trying to decide if he can be 
           trusted.  After a pause:

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You know, you’re not what I was 
                        expecting, General.

           Kutyna looks up, surprised by this non-sequitur.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        My father was a uniform salesman, 
                        and he always said “a man in 
                        uniform is no different from a man 
                        out of uniform, he just thinks he’s 
                        different.” 

                                 KUTYNA
                        I’m not just some polished brass. 
                        I’m on this Commission because I 
                        managed the Department of Defense 
                        Space Shuttle and Rocket Programs. 
                             (with a smile)
                        Sure I went to West Point, but it 
                        was MIT after that.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        So you’re a nerd in uniform! Well 
                        then General, I gotta tell ya... 
                        I’ve been taking some secret 
                        meetings Chairman Rogers wouldn’t 
                        approve of.

           Kutyna looks uncomfortable, which Feynman reads as 
           disapproval.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        I know, I know it’s not Kosher, but 
                        if I hand in my findings now he’ll 
                        just slap me on the wrist! I 
                        figure, I’ll keep my illicit 
                        investigation secret and hand it in 
                        right before the end of the 
                        investigation, when there’s no 
                        denying I’m right.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (with a smile)
                        And what if you’re wrong? 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Then I’ll toss out my notebook and 
                        still look like a genius!

           They laugh. At that moment, a feminine voice calls out from 
           the kitchen.

                                 LUCY (O.S.)
                        Dinner’s on, fellas! 

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           They’ve finished their meal. Feynman and Kutyna are in the 
           midst of an intense discussion.

                                 KUTYNA
                        The shuttle is a multi-billon 
                        dollar industry. MTI’s contract 
                        alone is worth two billion dollars. 

           Feynman whistles, impressed.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        And NASA employs forty thousand 
                        people, mostly in Southern states. 
                                 FEYNMAN
                        So if our investigation cries foul, 
                        you can bet there will be a serious 
                        outcry from the mint julep boys on 
                        Capitol Hill.

           Kutyna’s wife Lucy gets up and starts clearing away plates.

                                 LUCY
                        Now Don, you two have been talking 
                        shop all night. Can’t I have the 
                        Professor’s ear for a few minutes?

                                 KUTYNA
                             (with a grin)
                        She wants to know what you won the 
                        Nobel Prize for.

           She blushes, a little embarrassed. Feynman smiles.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        If I could explain it in a few 
                        minutes, it wouldn’t be worth the 
                        Nobel Prize, now would it?

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Kutyna is drying the dishes, a dish towel slung over one 
           shoulder, as Feynman animatedly explains his work to Lucy. He 
           has a floral-print plate in one hand.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So it’s just after the war, and I’m 
                        in my university’s cafeteria, going 
                        crazy trying to solve these quantum 
                        equations, when all of a sudden I 
                        notice some smart alec doing this:

           Feynman throws the plate in the air like a pizza-dough 
           thrower and catches it when it lands. Lucy laughs.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        And I notice that the little design 
                        on the rim is going around faster 
                        than the wobbling. So I decide to 
                        figure out the motion of the 
                        rotating plate, and I discover that 
                        when the angle is slight, the 
                        design on the rim rotates twice as 
                        fast as the wobble rate!

           He demonstrates. Kutyna watches over his shoulder at how 
           engaging Feynman’s brilliance is.
                                 LUCY
                        Okay, so...?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So it made me wonder if this 
                        applied to the orbits of electrons 
                        moving around the atomic nucleus. 
                        It was just me fooling around, but 
                        I went on to prove that the 
                        electron doesn’t just go around the 
                        nucleus in a simple orbit, it 
                        actually does all sorts of crazy 
                        things, zooming around all over the 
                        place, taking every possible path 
                        simultaneously! 

                                 LUCY
                        Even paths that move backwards and 
                        forwards in time?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You got it! I know it sounds nutty, 
                        but some fellas went out and did 
                        some hands-on experiments and 
                        proved my nutty idea was right. 

           We see that Kutyna has stopped mid-way in his dishes. He has 
           a thoughtful look on his face, as if something has just 
           occurred to him. He puts down the dish towel.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Come on, Professor. I want to show 
                        you my baby.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Your baby?

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman looks around, disinterested in all the cars. There is 
           a beautiful white vintage Opel parked inside, with the hood 
           up. Kutyna lays his hands on it lovingly.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        A car? That’s your baby?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Opel GT. She’s beautiful, ain’t 
                        she?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I think you’re getting your car 
                        mixed up with your wife.
           Feynman walks over to Kutyna’s tool bench, where several 
           carburetors are laid out in various stages of assembly.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (impressed)
                        You do your own auto work?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Sure.

           Feynman picks up half the carburetor, examining it.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Everything I take apart stays 
                        apart. You’re a genius, Kutyna!

                                 KUTYNA
                             (patting the Opel)
                        This girl here, she’s my favorite, 
                        though she’s only a summer car. 

           Kutyna picks up the rubber carburetor gasket and squeezes the 
           rubber between his fingers.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        Got to keep replacing the 
                        carburetor seals in winter. Darned 
                        things leak when they’re cold-- no 
                        resiliency. 

           Feynman takes the seal in his hands, sure enough, it’s stiff. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Only leak when they’re cold...?

           He slowly looks up to meet Kutyna’s meaningful gaze. 

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT, DC SKYLINE - DAWN

           The next morning dawns over the city. It’s a cold winter’s 
           day; the rising sun paints the marble of the city’s monuments 
           a deceivingly warm pink.

           EXT. CAB - LATER

           Feynman pays the cab driver and leaps out the door. 

           In front of him is a humble Mom and Pop hardware store. It’s 
           PROPRIETOR is just turning the “closed” sign to “open.”

           Feynman follows the proprietor inside, close on his heels.
           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AUDITORIUM - SIMULTANEOUS

           The large auditorium is empty except for the morning CLERKS, 
           who are busy readying the room for a large media event. 

           We see water glasses being filled and placed with precision 
           before empty seats, each marked a Commissioners’ name plate. 

           Individual microphones at each seat are being switched on.

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - SIMULTANEOUS

           With a CLATTER, Feynman dumps a collection of various C-
           clamps and pliers on the counter in front of the PROPRIETOR.

           Feynman’s obviously in a rush, and tries not to hurry the 
           proprietor as he rings up his purchase.

           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           The PRESS begins to file into the room, taking their 
           designated seats towards the front. Video crews set up their 
           equipment, focusing their cameras on the still-empty stage.

           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AUDITORIUM - LATER

           Again, the Commissioners are now seated at tiered desks in 
           front of press. The same long table is in front of them, and 
           beyond that, the audience. 

           Feynman looks uncharacteristically nervous. Kutyna glances 
           over at him, curious.

           Rogers clears his throat at the podium. Graham sits nearby.

                                 ROGERS
                        Now, the New York Times has created 
                        an unpleasant situation with this 
                        speculative talk of scandal. We’re 
                        here today to show that no one’s 
                        trying to brush anything under the 
                        rug. Right, Bill?

                                 GRAHAM
                        Absolutely. However if any 
                        misleading statements are 
                        accidentally made by NASA 
                        officials, they can always amend 
                        their testimony later. 
           This comment makes Feynman choke on the water he’s drinking.  
           Feynman waves over a CLERK, who comes by with the pitcher. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (in whisper, to clerk)
                        I need ICE water. Cold.

           The clerk nods, leaves. Kutyna notices this.

           Meanwhile, McDonald again slips into the back of the room. He 
           looks poorly rested, unshaven. This time Feynman notices, 
           recognizes him from the last briefing.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Kutyna)
                        That guy again?

           Kutyna shrugs. 

           Suddenly the doors swing open. Mulloy, from the opening 
           sequence strides down the aisle, carrying a briefcase. 

           When McDonald sees Mulloy about to pass by him, he turns his 
           shoulder so Mulloy won’t see him.

                                 ROGERS
                        I would like to introduce Mr. Larry 
                        Mulloy, who is NASA’s project 
                        manager of these solid rocket 
                        boosters at the Marshall Space 
                        Flight Center. 

           The clerk refills Feynman’s glass. Eagerly, Feynman puts his 
           finger in, then scowls at the clerk.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        This isn’t cold enough! Where’s the 
                        ice I asked for?

           Feynman looks like he wants scream with frustration.

           Meanwhile, Mulloy lays his briefcase down at the long table-- 
           the only man there. He raises his hand to be sworn in.

           INT. NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AUDITORIUM -  LATER

           Sally Ride leans in to her microphone to ask Mulloy a 
           question.
                                 SALLY RIDE
                        Mr. Mulloy, I have a fistful of 
                        messages from reporters saying 
                        rumors are flying about some last 
                        minute conference call between NASA 
                        and its contractors. What was that 
                        about?

                                 MULLOY
                        It’s standard protocol to go over 
                        flight readiness the night before 
                        the launch.

           Meanwhile, the booster joint we’ve seen before at NASA HQ is 
           being passed around for the Commissioners to inspect.  

           Feynman reaches eagerly for it just before someone grabs it. 
           His fingers itch to get a hold of it.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        Who was on that phone call?

                                 MULLOY
                        Oh, our people at Kennedy, and MTI 
                        engineers and management heads. 

                                 RIDE
                        Was there a record of those 
                        deliberations?

                                 MULLOY
                        To my knowledge, there was not.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        So what were you discussing?

                                 MULLOY
                             (breezily)
                        The usual things. 

           The Clerk finally shows up with ice cubes, that he petulantly 
           plunks into Feynman’s glass. One. Two. Three. Happy?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Thank you. For your prompt and 
                        professional service.

           The clerk huffs off.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                             (annoyed, to Mulloy)
                        What I’m asking is, was there any 
                        concern about these o-ring seals 
                        that night?
                                 MULLOY
                        It may have come up, but in the end 
                        MTI recommended to proceed with the 
                        launch, so we launched. In fact, I 
                        have the launch directive, signed 
                        by MTI, right here in my hands.

           He takes out the faxed LAUNCH DIRECTIVE, shows it to the 
           room, then hands it to a clerk who gives it to Rogers.

                                 MULLOY (CONT’D)
                        If there were any unusual concerns, 
                        it was up to MTI to speak up. 

                                 GRAHAM
                             (clearing his throat)
                        NASA prides itself on giving its 
                        engineers a voice in launch 
                        readiness procedures.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        But have you seen any evidence in 
                        the Shuttle’s past performance that 
                        the o-rings were a serious cause 
                        for concern? 

                                 MULLOY
                        Our design analysis task force has 
                        not concluded that the o-rings had 
                        anything to do with the failure of 
                        the Shuttle.

           Suddenly, there’s a disturbance in the back of the room. 
           McDonald has leapt to his feet, and is shouting. 

           Commissioners look up and take notice. Rogers frowns and 
           motions to the SECURITY GUARDS.

           McDonald makes his way down the aisle towards the front, 
           murmurs from the audience abound.

                                 MCDONALD
                        What about flight STS 51-C, Larry? 

                                 ROGERS
                        Who the hell are you?! You can’t 
                        just storm in here!

           Security guards GRAB him, and he struggles.

                                 MCDONALD
                        What about the erosion on flights 
                        41-B and C and 61-C?! Why aren’t 
                        you telling them about THOSE?!
                                  ROGERS
                        Do you know this man, Mr. Mulloy?

                                 MULLOY
                        Yes, his name is Allan McDonald. 
                        He’s in MTI’s engineering 
                        department, which signed off on 
                        Challenger’s launch. Understandably 
                        he’s devastated, as are we all.

           Rogers nods at the guards to take McDonald out.

                                 ROGERS
                        Would you please escort Mr. 
                        McDonald out of the room? If he has 
                        any issues to voice he can do so 
                        when we visit MTI next month.

           They take him out. He kicks the door so hard it rattles. The 
           room murmurs with concern, as Rogers brings it back to order.

           Feynman uses this opportunity, when everyone’s attention is 
           focused elsewhere, to reach down past the bosom of Sally Ride 
           who is seated below him, and grab the booster joint. She 
           gasps and glares as his arm brushes her shirt. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (whisper)
                        Oops, sorry Doll!

           Using his pliers, he quickly tugs out the rubber o-ring bits 
           out of the booster joint under his desk. 

                                 ROGERS
                        Will Mr. MacDonald’s outburst 
                        please be stricken from the 
                        meeting’s transcript?

           Feynman clears his throat.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Excuse me, those flights he 
                        mentioned all had something in 
                        common: they were all conducted at 
                        temperatures below 53 degrees. And 
                        all showed evidence of o-ring 
                        erosion.

           Some of the Commissioners turn to Feynman, surprised that 
           he’s become so well-versed in the shuttle specs.
                                 MULLOY
                        That data is far from conclusive. 
                        We had erosion in all sorts of 
                        weather, even on days as warm as 75 
                        degrees.

           Kutyna watches Feynman take an O-RING and CLAMP it tightly 
           with a small C-CLAMP VISE. He then DROPS IT IN THE ICE WATER. 
           Kutyna realizes what Feynman’s up to. 

           Another member of the Commission, presses the button on his 
           microphone that allows him to ask a question.

                                 COMMISSION MEMBER 
                        There’s erosion on cold days and 
                        warm days?! So what’s the big deal?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So you’re going on record saying 
                        that cold does not affect o-ring 
                        performance?

                                 CHUCK YEAGER
                        Hell, give me a nice day and I’ll 
                        go fly that son of a bitch! 

           There is laughter from the press. They are bored, confused by 
           Mulloy’s presentation-- they aren’t really paying attention.

           Feynman is ready for action. He reaches again for the 
           microphone, readying his materials-- when he is blocked by 
           Kutyna laying a hand on the button.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (whisper)
                        Not now.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (whisper)
                        Why not?!

                                 KUTYNA
                             (low voice)
                        Wait til the cameras are on you. 

           A slow grin takes over Feynman’s face. 

                                 ROGERS
                             (condescending)
                        I think Mr. Mulloy has exhausted 
                        this subject. Shall we move on?

           Mulloy projects a complex blueprint on the screen.  
                                 MULLOY
                        Certainly. You can see here how the 
                        leak test ports are assembled, with 
                        zinc chromate putty laid up in 
                        strips--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry, just one more question. The 
                        purpose of these seals is to keep 
                        the hot gas from leaking out during 
                        the bumpy lift-off maneuver?

                                 MULLOY
                             (peeved)
                        That is correct.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So it is important that the rubber 
                        is soft enough that it can handle 
                        jolts and vibration. I think you 
                        call that “resiliency,” right?

           Mulloy speaks slowly to Feynman, as if to a child.

                                 MULLOY
                        Correct. That is why we use rubber.

           Mulloy looks to Rogers as if to say ‘is this guy for real?’

                                 ROGERS
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        Dr. Feynman, can we move on to 
                        subjects with more significance to 
                        the purpose of our meeting today?

           Checking to make sure the cameras are in fact on him, Feynman 
           clears his throat and pushes the his glass of ice water to 
           the front of his desk. One c-clamp is submerged.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Well it’s just that, I took this 
                        piece of o-ring that I got out of 
                        your joint and I put it in ice 
                        water, and I discovered that when 
                        you put some pressure on the rubber 
                        and then undo it, it doesn't bounce 
                        back for quite some time. 

           As he talks he removes the rubber from the clamp and holds it 
           up for the world to see: it is mangled and cramped.
                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        So I think it’s safe to say there 
                        is no resiliency in these o-rings 
                        when they’re at a temperature below 
                        32 degrees. 
                             (beat)
                        Now Mr. Mulloy, remind me of the 
                        temperature when the Challenger 
                        launched?

                                 MULLOY
                             (pale)
                        It was-- I believe it was 23 
                        degrees Fahrenheit.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Then I believe this has some 
                        significance to our problem.

           The press realizes the importance of this demonstration. They 
           go nuts, starting to clamor and stand up in their seats, 
           shouting questions to Mulloy and Rogers.

                                 ROGERS
                        Will the room please come to order! 

           No one pays any attention to him.

                                 ROGERS (CONT’D)
                        I’d like to call a recess-- we will 
                        reconvene tomorrow.

           And the press is up and out of their seats, forging their way 
           towards the front of the room. Kutyna pats Feynman on the 
           shoulder as he gets up, leaving Feynman to the hungry crowd. 

           He smiles-- leans back in his chair and lets them come.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MEDIA CIRCUS SEQUENCE:

           -- The Press camps out outside the Holiday Inn, clamoring to 
           get a photo of Feynman as he exits a cab.

           -- We see grainy television footage of Feynman and his ice 
           water demonstration being replayed endlessly on network news.
                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        Dr. Richard Feynman, using merely 
                        ice water and a c-clamp, 
                        demonstrated to the world exactly 
                        what went wrong with the Challenger 
                        two weeks ago--

           -- An irate Rogers makes a statement on the Capitol Steps:

                                 ROGERS
                        We are not ruling anything out. 
                        Professor Feynman’s demonstration 
                        merely illustrates one potential 
                        factor in the accident...

           -- In the old Washington club we see Keel crossing the room, 
           striding towards a hallway on the other side. We follow Keel 
           to a door being guarded by a SECRET SERVICE AGENT. 

           The agent nods when he sees Keel, and steps aside, opening 
           the door for him.

           We glimpse a room with no windows. There are six unhappy 
           SENATORS waiting for Keel around a table. The GENTLEMAN 
           SENATOR is there with his ivory-tipped cane.

                                 GENTLEMAN SENATOR
                        Take a seat, Mr. Keel.

                                 KEEL
                        Yes, Senator.

                                 GENTLEMAN SENATOR
                        We’re finding the antics of your 
                        rogue scientist deeply troubling. 

           The door closes, blocking our view.

           -- Three NEWS PUNDITS around a news desk argue on TV.

                                 PUNDIT #1
                        So for all intents and purposes, is 
                        the investigation over now?

                                 PUNDIT #2
                        Well it’s pretty obvious what the 
                        problem was, isn’t it? 

                                 PUNDIT #3
                        But who’s to blame? I think this 
                        should become a criminal 
                        investigation!

           They then talk over each other, as pundits often do.
           END MEDIA CIRCUS SEQUENCE.

           INT. LIMO - EVENING 

           Mulloy opens the door to a limo and sits down, laying his 
           briefcase on his lap. Sitting opposite, sandwiched between 
           two heavy-set SECURITY GUARDS, is Allan McDonald.

                                 MCDONALD
                             (defensive)
                        This is really unnecessary. I 
                        didn’t tell the Commission anything 
                        they couldn’t find by looking at 
                        Boisjoly’s reports--

                                 MULLOY
                             (matter of fact)
                        Reports? I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about. 

           He lets this sink in with McDonald. McDonald tries to hold 
           his gaze, but after a moment drops it, intimidated.

                                 MULLOY (CONT’D)
                        Allan, if we go down, you go down 
                        with us.

           EXT. DC STREET - THAT NIGHT

           Tracking with Feynman walking down a street, his collar 
           turned up against the sleet and cold.

           Feynman approaches a building on which hangs a neon sign 
           proclaiming “Copacabana Club” and “Live Dancing Girls!!” As 
           he opens the club’s door, ENERGETIC MUSIC fills the air.

           Only when a windshield wiper crosses the view do we realize 
           that Feynman is being watched from a car across the street. 
           We hear the sound of a camera SHUTTER CLICK.

           INT. BLACK TOWN CAR

           The PHOTOGRAPHER rapid-fires frames of Feynman disappearing 
           into the club. The photographer looks over his shoulder in 
           the dark back seat. All we can see is a red pen dancing 
           through long fingers.

           After a moment, the hand GESTURES with the pen. “Follow him.” 
           The photographer exits the car, disappearing into the club.
           INT. COPACABANA CLUB - LATER

           The room is steamy-- orange light and tropical drinks abound. 
           DANCING GIRLS gyrate on stage wearing feather headdresses.

           Feynman is surrounded by new friends; two long-legged BLONDES 
           in particular hang on his every word. 

           Meanwhile the dancers on stage part ways for a group of 
           MUSICIANS carrying BONGO DRUMS. They start a choreographed 
           RIFF as the dancers shimmy in time in the background.

           Feynman leaps to his feet with the vitality of a young man.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (shouting)
                        All right! 
                             (using Brazilian slang)
                        Un Batucada! Pe De Boi!

           The musicians nod encouragingly. Feynman takes an 
           outstretched hand and jumps up to join them on stage. He 
           grabs a bongo and starts playing expertly, upping the rhythm, 
           and impressing even the professionals.

           The crowd cheers him on-- he’s a rock star with wild gray 
           hair, his shirt now plastered to him with sweat.

           INT. COPACABANA CLUB - LATE AT NIGHT

           It’s last call, and Feynman is talking to the two blondes. He 
           looks exhausted, but is still a charmer.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’d love to ladies, but really, I 
                        can’t...

           One of them leans over, writing something on a napkin.

                                 BLONDE 
                        Well, in case you reconsider... 

           Feynman looks at it-- a phone number written in lipstick. He 
           pockets it, then hurriedly slaps some bills on the table.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        It’s been a pleasure, but I’m 
                        afraid it’s past my bedtime.

           He kisses them on the cheek, winks, and saunters towards the 
           exit. However as soon as he’s out of the blondes’ view, he 
           makes a dash for the bathroom.
           INT. COPACABANA CLUB BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman staggers into the bathroom, clutching his abdomen in 
           agony. He struggles to open a pill bottle, and tosses back a 
           pill. He turns on the faucet to chase it with water. 

           Leaning heavily on the counter, he inhales, exhales, trying 
           to breathe through the pain, letting the water run...

                                                              FADE OUT.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - EARLY AFTERNOON

           It’s dark, the curtains drawn. A glowing digital clock on 
           Feynman’s bed reads 11:15 am.

           There’s a persistent KNOCKING on the door. Feynman wakes up, 
           groggy and disoriented. The KNOCKING continues.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (half awake)
                        Alright, alright, gimme a second.

           EXT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Kutyna, impeccably dressed in his uniform, reaches forward to 
           knock again just as the door swings open to reveal a rumpled 
           Feynman. He’s still in his clothes from the previous night.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        General.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Professor...

           Kutyna is taken aback by Feynman’s haggard appearance.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                             (concerned pause)
                        I take it you had a late night? 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (dismissive)
                        Gotta enjoy my fifteen minutes. May 
                        I ask...?

                                 KUTYNA
                        I’ve got a field trip planned. You 
                        interested?
                                 FEYNMAN
                             (dry)
                        Don’t I need Rogers to sign my 
                        permission slip?

           Kutyna hands Feynman a Pentagon SECURITY BADGE.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Not this time.

           EXT. THE PENTAGON - AFTERNOON

           Establishing shot of the building, against a sleet-gray sky. 

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        You know, I didn't think civilians 
                        were allowed to get so deep into 
                        this place.

           INT. PENTAGON, 4TH LEVEL OF SECURITY- SIMULTANEOUS

           Feynman and Kutyna go through security.  

                                 KUTYNA
                        They’re not.

           He doesn’t elaborate, but looks nervous as he ushers Feynman 
           into the depths of the Pentagon. 

           INT. PENTAGON HALLWAY - LATER

           Kutyna takes Feynman down a long hallway with many turns and 
           no windows. They travel deep into the complex.

           Feynman looks a little intimidated by the fact that everyone 
           they’re passing in the hallways is in military uniform.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (grim)
                        There are some things I have to 
                        tell you. Things I shouldn’t be 
                        telling you. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So then don’t tell me! I don’t want 
                        to know any military secrets, I 
                        figured out what went wrong with 
                        the shuttle, now it’s time to go 
                        home.

           Kutyna at last stops in front of a door.
                                 KUTYNA
                        The issue is a lot bigger than o-
                        rings. If we want to solve what 
                        went wrong up there, you have to 
                        understand how big the problem is 
                        down here. 

           Kutyna swipes his pass card and enters a room, followed by a 
           reluctantly curious Feynman.

           INT. PENTAGON BRIEFING ROOM 

           They enter a darkened media room, where monitors line the 
           walls. Taking up the center of the room is a large oblong 
           Lucite table, on which is engraved a detailed map of the 
           world. Feynman runs his hands along it, impressed.

           Kutyna flips a switch, and the semi-transparent table lights 
           up, illuminating their faces from underneath.  

                                 KUTYNA
                        Tell me Professor, how do we deploy 
                        our spy satellites?  

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You mean besides the shuttle?

                                 KUTYNA
                        There is no “besides the shuttle.” 
                        It’s our only access to space.

           Kutyna touches another button and suddenly various circles of 
           light appear on the map, some stationary, others slowly 
           moving across the table.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        These circles represent the extent 
                        of our global surveillance 
                        capability. If we can’t reach 
                        space, this whole map will slowly 
                        go dark, and we’ll be playing Blind 
                        Man’s Bluff with Russia, who is 
                        sending up Soyuz rockets sixty 
                        times a year. Losing the shuttle 
                        means we fall dangerously behind.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        But the Space Race is over!

                                 KUTYNA
                        Guess Russia didn’t get the memo.

           Feynman looks deeply disturbed by this.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        How can we only have one channel to 
                        space when so much is on the line?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Well, NASA sold everyone on the 
                        idea the shuttle was going to 
                        provide cheaper, safer, more 
                        reliable access to space. You know 
                        what they said was the probability 
                        for failure?

           Feynman shakes his head.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        One in a hundred thousand. 

           Feynman does some quick calculations in his head.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        That would mean you could launch 
                        the shuttle every day for three 
                        hundred years without a problem! 

                                 KUTYNA
                        Safer than an airliner.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Safer than driving your car to 
                        work! It’s ridiculous.

                                 KUTYNA 
                        Sure, but the aerospace industry 
                        wants the jobs, Congress wants the 
                        money for their states, and the 
                        military wants the access. 
                        Everyone’s clamoring for more 
                        launches, but the unspoken cost is 
                        the safety of the astronauts. So 
                        NASA lied. They lied to Congress 
                        and the American people. Just like 
                        they lied to their own damned 
                        astronauts.

           Kutyna takes a seat near Feynman, leaning in with intensity.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        In Vietnam, I depended on the men 
                        who flew chase for me, the guys who 
                        tested my tires, the engine 
                        mechanics and the traffic control 
                        team. If even one person had lied 
                        to me about the safety of my 
                        vehicle, I’d be toast. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        The Air Force taught me how to 
                        trust my company with my life. So 
                        when NASA sends their own 
                        astronauts up without bothering to 
                        tell them their spacecraft was a 
                        time bomb... it’s the ultimate 
                        betrayal. 

           For once Feynman is silent.

           EXT. PENTAGON PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           It has started to snow. Feynman and Kutyna walk in silence to 
           Kutyna’s car.  Feynman looks deep in thought.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’m a college professor, I don’t 
                        belong in Washington. I’m the last 
                        guy you should be asking for help.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’re the only person on the 
                        Commission who’s free of government 
                        influence. Everyone else has ties 
                        to NASA-- even me. But you can say 
                        and do whatever you want. The 
                        American people deserve to have 
                        someone expose the truth of what 
                        happened to the Challenger, so it 
                        won’t happen again. 

           Feynman looks pained, but nods. Kutyna shakes his hand.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get out of here, it’s 
                        freezing.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I think I’m going to walk back. 

                                 KUTYNA
                        You sure? 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I don’t see snow much. Makes me 
                        feel alive. 

           Kutyna waves Feynman off as he sets out into the snow.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (calling out)
                        Watch your footing, Professor. 
                        It’ll be slippery getting home.
           EXT. DC STREETS  - LATER

           Feynman is the only one out on the street. He treks across 
           virgin snow, passing DC monuments, their marble as white as 
           the sky. 

           A bitter wind blows the naked and frail saplings planted 
           alongside the road, prompting a--

           FLASH

           --of grainy archival footage, showing TREES in slow motion, 
           bending and swaying from the force of the atomic blast.

           IN THE SNOW

           Feynman staggers, suddenly hit with pain. He presses his hand 
           to his abdomen and leans against a nearby newspaper machine, 
           staring up at the sky, catching his breath.

           The fat flakes fluttering in the wind remind him of 
           something... As he loses his sense of place and time, we FADE 
           TO WHITE.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE: LOS ALAMOS, 1945

           WIND ripples across desert sand, everything illuminated by a 
           strange white light.  

           BACK ON

           Feynman in the snow, who closes his eyes as the flakes gather 
           on his lashes. A strain of TCHAIKOVSKY fights its way through 
           the incongruent sound of RADIO STATIC.

           EXT. LOS ALAMOS DESERT, 1945 - EVENING

           A YOUNG FEYNMAN, 27, fiddles with an army radio in the 
           desert. Try as he might, he only hears the music and the 
           static.  After a painfully tense moment, Feynman gets a 
           COUNTDOWN, faint but coming through clear.

                                 ANNOUNCER’S VOICE
                        Nine, eight, seven, six...

           The young Feynman has ducked behind the window of a nearby 
           Jeep, protecting his eyes from the UV rays. 

           ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE

           A MUSHROOM CLOUD blooms in front of them.
           FEYNMAN’S POV: Color is washed out of the landscape, 
           everything silent. Nearby, OPPENHEIMER wears his signature 
           broad-brimmed hat, and is silhouetted by white light.

                                 OPPENHEIMER (O.S.)
                        “Now I am become Death, the 
                        Destroyer of worlds.”

           Gradually, as the white light of the atomic blast becomes  
           less blinding, we see a hand releasing the bits of paper in 
           the unnatural wind, to measure the force of the blast.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREETS - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Snowflakes flutter past Feynman in the snow. 

           Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE emerges from the swirling flakes in 
           front of him, wearing a broad-brimmed hat. Feynman squints, 
           spooked-- but isn’t able to see the man’s face.

           The dark figure passes him by, his collar turned up against 
           the snow. Feynman, pale and shaken, turns on his heel, and 
           sees the man glancing back at him over his shoulder. The 
           figure continues on until he is swallowed up by the snow.

           Overwhelmed with pain and fear, Feynman COLLAPSES in the 
           snow. PULL OUT on his prone figure in a sea of white.

           INT. IDLE ISLE CAFE, BRIGHAM CITY UTAH - SAME EVENING 

           Boisjoly and McDonald sit at the counter of a small town 
           diner. Shadows fill the empty corners.

           Boisjoly speaks in a low voice to McDonald.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        Can’t you feel it?

                                 MCDONALD
                        What?

                                 BOISJOLY
                             (re: other diners)
                        How much they hate us.

           McDonald darts a glance around, and sees the glares from the 
           few silent customers. They are definitely not welcome here.
                                 MCDONALD
                        This will all blow over eventually. 
                        Brigham City needs MTI-- without us 
                        this town would dry up and blow 
                        away. Just lay low for a while.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        “Lay low?!” Allan, you saw how 
                        Mulloy tried to cover everything 
                        up! You were there!

                                 MCDONALD
                        Not for long. I got hustled onto a 
                        plane and demoted, remember? 

           Boisjoly doesn’t say anything.

                                 MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Look, we tried to blow the whistle, 
                        and it didn’t work. Now it’s time 
                        to heal, like everyone else.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        How can I heal, when every night 
                        when I close my eyes, all I see are 
                        the faces of those astronauts. 
                        Christa especially... We gotta do 
                        the right thing, Allan.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Sometimes, there is no right thing.

           They ponder this as the WAITRESS slaps down their check. 

                                 WAITRESS
                             (rude)
                        You done? 

           EXT. IDLE ISLE CAFE PARKING LOT - LATER

           The two men stop walking in the parking lot. It’s late --
           there are only a couple cars left. 

                                 MCDONALD
                        You sure you want to walk home 
                        alone?  

                                 BOISJOLY
                        It’s only a few blocks. The day I 
                        stop being able to walk in my own 
                        neighborhood is the day I move out. 
                        ...But thanks.
           McDonald pats him on the shoulder and gets into his car.

           The neon lights outside the cafe flicker off, and the 
           waitress locks the door. Boisjoly waits for McDonald to pull 
           away, before he gets into a PHONE BOOTH near the parking lot.

           INT. PHONE BOOTH

           With shaking hands, Boisjoly dials a phone number. 

                                 BOISJOLY
                             (into phone)
                        Dr. Feynman’s room, please.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Feynman’s hotel phone RINGS and RINGS, unanswered. His bed is 
           neatly made, and obviously has not been slept in.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH, BRIGHAM CITY UTAH - MOMENTS LATER

           A long shot of the weakly-lit phone booth, from the far side 
           of the deserted parking lot. Boisjoly’s leaving a message. 
           Suddenly, a pair of blinding HEADLIGHTS SWITCH ON, starkly 
           illuminating the booth. Boisjoly looks up, exposed. 

           Spooked, Boisjoly immediately HANGS UP, walking away fast.

           EXT. BRIGHAM CITY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Boisjoly hurries away from the parking lot. Ominously, a beat-
           up PICK-UP TRUCK slowly pulls out behind him. REVVING ITS 
           ENGINE, it starts to accelerate, headed right for him. 

           Boisjoly starts to RUN. The car is almost upon him, when he 
           JUMPS off the side of the road into a ditch. 

           The truck SWERVES towards him as if to hit him, but misses. 
           It takes off into the night.

           Boisjoly, wide-eyed with shock, trembles in the ditch, 
           breathing hard.

           INT. HOSPITAL, WASHINGTON DC - NEXT MORNING

           We see the X-Rays of Feynman’s convoluted abdomen, as a 
           DOCTOR examines them on a light box.
           Feynman sits up in a hospital bed, his thin arms sticking out 
           from his paper patient’s dress. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        But you agree with Dr. Morton? That 
                        I only have six months to a year?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Less, if you don’t slow down.

           He lowers the x-rays and looks at Feynman.

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        You know, these kinds of cancer are 
                        incredibly rare. To have both at 
                        once is unheard of. I can’t help 
                        thinking there’s a connection 
                        between your cancers and the atomic 
                        radiation you were exposed to.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (dismissive)
                        That was forty years ago. You’re 
                        leaping to conclusions.

                                 DOCTOR
                        It’s a medical likelihood.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Is it? You know what’s funny? I’m 
                        feeling like my blood pressure has 
                        risen about four-- no, five points 
                        since last night. Am I right?

           The Doctor checks the nurse’s charts. His eyes widen.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Why, that’s incredible! How on 
                        earth could you tell?

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (dry)
                        I looked at the charts before you 
                        came in. You get my point? It’s 
                        human nature to leap to the most 
                        sensational conclusions before the 
                        most logical.
                             (beat, then softer)
                        People die of cancer all the time, 
                        Doc.

           Suddenly a NURSE pokes her head in.
                                 NURSE
                        Dr. Feynman? Your wife is here to 
                        see you.

           The doctor takes his leave as Gwen hurries into the room, 
           throwing her arms around Feynman’s neck. Seeing him so frail 
           visibly breaks her heart.

                                 GWENETH
                        Oh, Dick...

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Hey, beautiful.

                                 GWENETH
                        I spoke to the doctors, and they 
                        say you’re ready to be discharged. 
                        You can come home with me tonight.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No can do, doll. Tomorrow night the 
                        Commission is flying down to 
                        Kennedy Space Center.

                                 GWENETH
                        To Florida?? You can barely walk--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So I’ll hobble. I can’t leave now, 
                        not when I’m starting to smell 
                        certain rats. You know I just love 
                        the smell of rats, it’s the spoor 
                        of exciting adventure.

           His charm doesn’t work on her, not now.

                                 GWENETH
                        Look what this “adventure” has done 
                        to you. God, I wish I’d never 
                        pushed you into this...

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You saw the press conference-- if 
                        it wasn’t for me, the whole thing 
                        would have been swept under the 
                        rug!

                                 GWENETH
                        You saved the day. You got your 
                        photo in the paper. Now come home. 
                        You have so little time left--

           She gets up and turns away, her arms clasped around her 
           chest.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        Exactly. And I can do so much good 
                        with that time.  

           When she spins to face him, we see she’s fighting back tears.

                                 GWENETH
                        And what about me? Michelle and 
                        Carl? 

           He doesn’t respond.

                                 GWENETH (CONT’D)
                        Please, Dick. Will you please come 
                        home, and let other people, healthy 
                        people, finish what you started? 

           EXT. HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - LATER THAT DAY

           Feynman gets out of a taxi. Gwen sits inside, her packed bag 
           beside her. Feynman waves goodbye as the taxi pulls away. She 
           stares straight ahead, dazed. Feynman sadly watches the taxi 
           disappear around the corner.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman shakily enters his hotel room to see a BLINKING RED 
           MESSAGE LIGHT on his phone. Feynman picks up the phone, 
           checking his message.

                                 BOISJOLY’S VOICE
                             (urgent)
                        Dr. Feynman, my name is Roger 
                        Boisjoly. --You were right-- the 
                        night before the launch, we knew 
                        about the o-rings. Everyone knew. 
                        But we went ahead anyway because--

           CLICK. Feynman looks puzzled, but also intrigued. He hits a 
           button on the phone to replay the message, simultaneously 
           taking out his Cal-tech notebook, flipping back through the 
           pages to where he had written Boisjoly’s name previously.

                                 BOISJOLY’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                             (as before)
                        Dr. Feynman, my name is Roger 
                        Boisjoly. --You were right--

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BOISJOLY’S OFFICE, UTAH - LATER

           A phone RINGS, unanswered, in Roger Boisjoly’s former office.

           INT. ROGER BOISJOLY’S HOUSE - LATER

           Then the phone RINGS in Boisjoly’s living room, where we see 
           that his windows are boarded up, broken glass on the carpet. 
           No one lives here now.

           INT. ALLAN MCDONALD’S HOME - NEXT MORNING

           Lastly, a phone RINGS and is picked up by Allan McDonald. He 
           listens.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Yes Dr. Feynman, I know who you 
                        are. ...I’m sorry, I don’t know 
                        where Roger went. 

           INT. WASHINGTON DC AIRPORT - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Feynman is on a pay-phone, his suitcase at his feet. He looks 
           profoundly frustrated. In the background, the rest of the 
           Commission is boarding a plane.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Alright, well if you get any leads 
                        on where to find him, you know how 
                        to contact me.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Final boarding call for flight 705 
                        to Orlando, Florida.

           Chairman Rogers, annoyed, comes storming towards Feynman.

           INT. ALLAN MCDONALD’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Allan peers around the corner of his home-office.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Roger doesn’t want to be found. I’m 
                        sure if he changes his mind he’ll 
                        be in touch.

           He hangs up, and we see that he’s looking at Boisjoly, curled 
           up asleep on the couch, wrapped in a quilt. McDonald looks 
           worried for his friend.
           INT. BUS, CAPE KENNEDY - MORNING

           Feynman and Kutyna sit next to each other towards the back of 
           the bus. None of the other eleven Commissioners look at them.

           Feynman stares out the window at the ghost town the Cape has 
           become; the litter blowing around the abandoned bleachers, 
           the huge NASA crawlers frozen by the side of the road. 

           EXT. KENNEDY CENTER HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER

           The bus zooms towards the gaping mouth of an enormous hangar. 

           In front of it we see the first signs of life-- a crowd of 
           reporters and cameramen await the bus’s arrival.

           INT. BUS - DAY

           The bus slows as the throng presses against the windows. 
           Feynman’s name is shouted over and over, as note pads wave. 
           Camera crews struggle to get a good shot.

           Gradually, the annoyed Commissioners turn to peer back at 
           Feynman, glaring at the ruckus he has caused.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You know, there’s a phrase you 
                        should learn.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Oh yeah? What’s that?

                                 KUTYNA
                        “This is not for attribution.”

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (scowling)
                        When are you going to stop telling 
                        me what to do, General? 

           The Press clamors outside, knocking on their windows, until 
           the bus is swallowed up by the darkness of the hangar.

           INT. KENNEDY CENTER HANGAR 39 - LATER

           The Commissioners dressed in white “bunny suits,” enter a 
           vast, cavernous hangar-- so large that it almost makes the 
           concept of “indoors” moot.

           Forklifts and cranes arrange salvaged pieces of CHALLENGER 
           onto the grid, like a crime scene investigation.  
           The wreckage looms large around the Commissioners as they 
           explore the post-apocalyptic jumble of twisted metal.

           Over this scene we hear the staticky FINAL TRANSMISSION of 
           the shuttle-- the VOICES of the astronauts haunting the room. 
           Their voices are excited, completely ignorant of their fate.

           Nearby, a crane lowers a piece of the crew capsule onto its 
           designated quadrant. Charred safety belts dangle. Wires spill 
           out of its side like guts. Feynman sees that the capsule 
           still carries the insignia of the American flag on its side-- 
           burned and blistered from the heat of the explosion.

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           The entire Commission sits around a table in a conference 
           room, with a NASA MEDIA TECHNICIAN. On the table in front of 
           them is a little black box recorder, playing the 
           transmission. Everyone is very still.

                                 SMITH (O.S.)
                        Throttle up.

                        Feel that mother go.
                                 CREW’S VOICES
                        Woooohoooo!!

           Their familiar joy at launching resonates with Sally Ride.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. WRECKAGE HANGAR - EARLIER

           Sally Ride approaches the area of the crew capsule wreckage. 

                                 MISSION CONTROL (O.S.)
                        Challenger, you are go for throttle 
                        up.

           She sees something, and looks to make sure she’s not spotted 
           before she clambers deeper into the segment of the capsule. 

           Sally’s looking at a cylindrical tank stamped RESNIK. She 
           toes it over. What she sees there makes her face go ashen.

                                 SCOBEE (O.S.)
                        Roger, go at throttle up.

           There is a long silence in the transmission. Then:

                                 SMITH (O.S.)
                        ...Uh oh.

           There suddenly are a series of CLICKS, ghostly and empty. 
           They echo over the wide shot of the wreckage in the hangar.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Click. Click. Click. The NASA MEDIA TECHNICIAN reaches over 
           and abruptly shuts off the recording.

           The Commissioners and Rogers all look pale and affected, 
           especially Sally Ride, who is white with sadness.

           Kutyna’s only betrayal of emotion is the way he ducks his 
           chin into his chest, fingers steepled to his lips.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Did they survive the break-up?

                                 TECHNICIAN
                        It’s not certain. The cabin most 
                        likely depressurized immediately--
                                 SALLY RIDE
                        They were alive while they fell. 
                        Judy activated her emergency oxygen 
                        tank. 

           The room reacts. 

                                 NASA TECHNICIAN
                        Three tanks were activated. The 
                        others weren’t. That’s all we can 
                        say for sure.

           Sally Ride looks away from him, disgusted. Kutyna looks 
           deeply unsettled, as do many of the Commissioners. 

                                 NEIL ARMSTRONG
                        How long did it take them to fall?

                                 NASA TECHNICIAN
                        They were at 65,000 feet so it 
                        would have taken about three 
                        minutes to reach the ocean.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        They were falling for three 
                        minutes? 

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        Is there a recording?

           Beat. 

                                 NASA TECHNICIAN
                        Only the families are going to hear 
                        it. Then it will be destroyed.

           Sally gets up to leave, upset.

                                 ROGERS
                        Sally, please--

           She spins and addresses the technician.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        It should have been test pilots up 
                        there, not teachers. 

           She leaves. No one looks at each other. 

           EXT. KENNEDY PARKING LOT - LATER

           Rogers hands his luggage to a CHAUFFEUR beside a town car.
                                 ROGERS
                        You didn’t find the briefings NASA 
                        prepared for us thorough enough? 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sure they were thorough, on the 
                        subjects they wanted to show us! 
                        It’s like when the Czar visits the 
                        Shtetl. The peasants put on a nice 
                        little show for him, and hide their 
                        starving children in the cellar! 
                        And I’m telling you, NASA’s hiding 
                        something--

                                 ROGERS
                             (cynical)
                        --According to a former MTI 
                        employee with a chip on his 
                        shoulder, who you can’t even reach 
                        on the phone.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        He wasn’t some nut job with an 
                        agenda! Something scared Roger 
                        Boisjoly enough to leave town!

                                 ROGERS
                        Maybe he needed a vacation. You 
                        might too-- it sounds like you 
                        might be catching a bit of this  
                        Boisjoly’s paranoia.  

           Feynman angrily gestures to Rogers with his notebook.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’ve been gathering testimony and 
                        information for weeks about 
                        engineers getting pressured, memos 
                        getting shredded, and you’re 
                        telling me I’m being paranoid??

           Rogers has reached the end of his patience. 

                                 ROGERS
                        For the last time, you will return 
                        to DC tonight along with everyone 
                        else. I’ll turn in your notebook to 
                        Keel so he can assimilate it--

           Rogers takes hold of the notebook, but Feynman pulls it back, 
           protectively. They have a little tug of war over it.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You’ll get it when I’m finished.
                                 ROGERS
                             (through gritted teeth)
                        We must gather testimony as a 
                        single body and make 
                        recommendations with one voice, in 
                        unison.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Well that’s a great way to get 
                        absolutely nowhere, in unison. 
                        These are my notes and they’ll be 
                        included when I’m good and ready!

           With that, he TUGS it out of Rogers’ hands. White-lipped with 
           anger, Rogers gets into the car.

                                 ROGERS
                        Lest you forget, this is the 
                        “Rogers Commission.” Not the 
                        “Feynman Commission.” No one will 
                        read your findings unless they’re 
                        included in my report. 

           With that, Rogers slams his car door closed. 

           INT. GRAHAM’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Graham is nervous. His door is open, and out in the hallway 
           we see his secretary buffing her nails as she eavesdrops.

                                 GRAHAM
                        I’m sorry Dr. Feynman, I can’t help 
                        you anymore. You’ll have to take up 
                        your concerns with Chairman Rogers.

           He glances up and makes eye contact with the GENTLEMAN 
           SENATOR we’ve seen at the club, who’s leaning on the 
           Secretary’s desk, ivory tipped cane by the door.  The 
           secretary and the Senator look over and smile at Graham.

           EXT. KENNEDY ROCKET GARDEN - SUNSET

           Feynman finds Kutyna in the Rocket Garden. The last of the 
           great rockets are propped up, mere husks now. Kutyna looks as 
           melancholy as we’ve yet seen him. As Feynman approaches, 
           Kutyna smiles and looks up at the Titan rocket.

                                 KUTYNA
                        These Titans launched ten 
                        successful manned missions for 
                        Gemini. Beautiful, aren’t they? 
           Feynman casts a dubious glance at the rocket.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sure, it’s a nice rocket.

                                 KUTYNA
                        My instructions are to make sure 
                        you get on that bus. I take it 
                        you’re staying behind.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Yes. I’ve got a rat trap to set.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (eyes still upwards)
                        Rogers is gonna wax my tail for 
                        this, so make it count.

           The bus HONKS. Kutyna claps Feynman on the shoulder, and 
           starts walking towards the waiting bus.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        When will I see you again?

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’re on my accident analysis team 
                        for Marshall and MTI. Until then 
                        you're going to want to 'check 
                        six.’ 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (calling after him)
                        Whaddya mean “check six?”

           Kutyna mimes “shooting” a gun over his shoulder.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Six o’clock-- airforce term. It 
                        means “watch your back.”  That’s 
                        where they get you-- your blind 
                        spot. 

           Feynman waves a hand in parting, then looks at the Titan, 
           trying to see the beauty that Kutyna saw.  

           BEGIN KENNEDY MONTAGE: 

           --Feynman, now completely on his own, walks the Kennedy 
           Center grounds, talking to people and writing in his Cal-Tech 
           notebook. We see him:

           --On the launchpad, talking to the Ice Team Captain. The 
           Captain points out where the icicles were.
           Feynman hands him a slip of paper, and the Captain scribbles 
           something on it. Hands it back. We don’t see what it is.

           --Feynman talks to a TELECOM ENGINEER who is repairing a 
           satellite dish on a radio tower. As he speaks, the engineer 
           hands him a slip of paper he’s just written something on.

                                 TELECOM ENGINEER
                        Sure, we musta checked the uplink 
                        ten times the night before launch. 
                        We couldn’t have the President 
                        talking to a bunch of static.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        The President?!

                                 TELECOM ENGINEER
                        Sure, that night was the State of 
                        the Union address, remember? Reagan 
                        was gonna chat with Ms. McAuliffe, 
                        broadcast live from space orbit. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No kidding? That would’ve been--

                                 TELECOM ENGINEER
                        ...Quite the show-stopper.

           -- Feynman speaks to an ENGINEER, who’s leaning up against a 
           massive CRAWLER. Feynman gives him a piece of paper, but this 
           engineer crumples it up, throws it away before he storms off.

           -- Feynman speaks to an female ASSEMBLY SPECIALIST high on 
           the catwalk, in the cavernous Vertical Assembly Building. 

           She hands Feynman a slip of paper, then suddenly hugs him. 
           He’s startled by the familiarity, but doesn’t pull away.

           --In an empty Launch Mission Control room, with all its 
           monitors dark, Feynman sits beside a young LAUNCH SPECIALIST. 
           The specialist reluctantly hands him a slip of paper. Then:

                                 LAUNCH SPECIALIST
                        People don't understand how hard we 
                        work. The Press ridicules us when 
                        we drop a wrench or spill some 
                        fuel. During Apollo we were 
                        respected for attempting the 
                        impossible. Now the impossible 
                        better happen, or else!

           Feynman listens, sympathetically.

           END MONTAGE.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Feynman is in the middle of a discussion with two ENGINEERS.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        It’s an important tool for the 
                        Commission, and I ought to have a 
                        copy.

                                 ENGINEER #1
                        Trust me, no one reads the PAS 
                        list.

                                 ENGINEER #2
                        It’s where people send their 
                        problems when they want to make 
                        them disappear.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No one reads the list of problems 
                        with the shuttle? I find that hard 
                        to believe. 

           The engineers exchange looks, as if to say “suit yourself.”

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Feynman sits impatiently at his desk. At last, a CLERK enters 
           the room pushing an office cart heaped with binders. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (heart sinking)
                        That whole thing’s the list?

           Suddenly five more trolley carts are noisily pushed into the 
           room, one after the other, each one heaped with binders.

                                 CLERK
                        THAT whole thing’s the list. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Not exactly bathroom reading, is 
                        it. I want to see your bosses.

                                 CLERK
                        I’m sorry- which bosses?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        All of them.

                                 CLERK
                        You’re going to need a bigger room.
           INT. KENNEDY CENTER AUDITORIUM - LATER

           A crowd of managers and engineers are gathered in front of 
           Feynman. They’re nervous, unsure why they’re there.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Are you an engineer, Sir?

           Feynman calls on the nearest man to him. The man nods.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Yes. I work in solid rocket motors.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Okay. Here’s what I want to know. 
                        Let’s say you found a problem. Who 
                        would you report it to?

                                 ENGINEER
                        Uh-- I’d report it to my program 
                        manager.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Well, where’s that guy? 

           An elegant older woman steps forward, the PROGRAM MANAGER.

                                 PROGRAM MANAGER
                             (defiant)
                        I’m that guy.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        My apologies. What would you do 
                        with that information, Ma’am?

                                 PROGRAM MANAGER
                        I’d report it to the Director of 
                        Shuttle Solid Rocket Motors at 
                        Marshall Space Center.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        OK. So who would he or she talk to? 

                                 PROGRAM MANAGER
                        Is this really necessary?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’m trying to understand where the 
                        line of responsibility ends. 
                                 PROGRAM MANAGER
                        It doesn’t end. Responsibility goes 
                        from us, to Marshall Space Center, 
                        to DC, and back again. It’s like 
                        musical chairs. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (he thinks)
                        OK. How about this: everyone line 
                        up and put your hand on the 
                        shoulder of the person you need to 
                        talk to when you see a big gaping 
                        hole in the side of your rocket.

           People hesitate.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on-- chop, chop!

           INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

           The NASA employees now stand in a snaking line, everyone with 
           their hands on another person’s shoulder.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Now who here in this conga line 
                        actually has the power to stop a 
                        launch? 

           No one raises their hand.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        What about to designate funds and 
                        manpower to fix a problem?

           Again, no hands. Feynman thinks for a second.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Well, here’s an easy one: who here 
                        was surprised when Challenger 
                        launched that day?

           A dreadful second. Nearly EVERYONE raises their hands, but 
           many lower their eyes.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB - AFTERNOON

           Chairman Rogers sits in the windowless wood-paneled back room 
           along with the same group of five Senators we’ve seen before. 
           The Gentlemen Senator nurses a scotch and watches Rogers like 
           a hawk. Beside him sits a wormy-looking BALD SENATOR. 
                                 BALD SENATOR
                        Yes but which facts are you 
                        allowing to come to light?

                                 ROGERS
                        All relevant findings will be 
                        included in the Rogers Commission 
                        Presidential report this spring. 

                                 GENTLEMAN SENATOR
                        I suppose what my colleague from 
                        Utah here wants to know is, whose 
                        side are you on?

           The Gentleman Senator gestures to the Bald Senator with his 
           ivory-tipped cane.

                                 ROGERS
                        This is an independent 
                        investigation. I’m not here to 
                        choose sides.

                                 BALD SENATOR
                        Chairman, we all have to choose 
                        sides. And it seems your rogue 
                        Commissioner certainly isn’t on the 
                        side of American jobs.

                                 ROGERS
                        I’m doing my best to keep him in 
                        line. 

                                 SENATOR #1
                        DC has a long memory. Your “best” 
                        wasn’t good enough for Nixon, and 
                        it’s not good enough now. 

           Rogers looks at the Senators, white-lipped.

           EXT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER OFFICES - DAY

           Exiting the building, Feynman walks right into the middle of 
           the press that has been lying in wait for him.

                                 REPORTERS  
                        Doctor Feynman! Any leads on who 
                        was responsible for the accident?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Who said it was an accident?

           Music to their ears. They scribble, crowding around Feynman.
                                 REPORTER #2
                        So whose fault was it, then?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        It’s a very complex system. It’s 
                        like asking whose fault it is you 
                        got cancer. Is it your DNA? Or that 
                        power plant you live near, or the 
                        type of food you eat? It could be 
                        all these things or none of them. 

           This is not making a good soundbite. The reporters try again.

                                 REPORTER #3
                        Could you clarify that for us, Sir?

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (irritable)
                        Clarify your questions, first. Ask 
                        an unclear question, you get an 
                        unclear answer.

           He tries to push past them.

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Could you tell us who might have 
                        had the power and motivation to 
                        push the launch?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Now that’s a good question. 
                        Everyone had the motivation. It 
                        could’ve the Department of Defense, 
                        or the Congressmen whose states 
                        depend on the space industry. Hell, 
                        even the President had a reason to 
                        get that shuttle launched on time. 

           There’s a dead silence. For a moment, the reporters can’t 
           believe their luck. Feynman stops in his tracks, realizing 
           what he’s just said. After a beat:

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        This is not for attribution, okay?

           EXT. DC STREETS - PRE-DAWN THE NEXT MORNING

           In the lavender morning we see newspaper trucks being loaded 
           up and driven through the streets around Capitol Hill. 

           A truck lumbers past the Capitol Building, and a NEWSPAPER 
           MAN dumps a bale of newspapers on the sidewalk, where we can 
           read the headline in bold: 
           INSERT: “NOBEL LAUREATE PONDERS, “POLITICOS TO BLAME?”

           A rough set of hands passes the stack to the doorman inside.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL OFFICES - LATER

           A mail clerk pushes a cart down a long hallway, tossing the 
           newspapers in front of one senatorial office after another.

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE - LATER

           Rogers stands by the window looking out at the Capitol 
           building. Keel sits at the desk reading the paper. In one 
           hand, he casually twirls his red pen.

                                 KEEL
                             (reading out loud)
                        “From a Nobel Laureate who wishes 
                        to remain anonymous.” 

                                 ROGERS
                        There’s our anthill, and our 
                        professor just took a stick to it.

           Rogers’s phone starts to ring, as does another down the hall. 
           Rogers flinches. Keel smiles cryptically.

                                 KEEL
                        If there’s one thing a physicist 
                        should know, it’s that every action 
                        has an equal and opposite 
                        reaction...

           EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT, HUNTSVILLE OFFICERS QUARTERS - NIGHT

           A whitewashed building with an American Flag out front. We 
           hear the sound of repetitive DRUMMING coming from inside.

           INT. OFFICERS QUARTERS BEDROOM- SIMULTANEOUS

           Neil Armstrong lies on his back on an army-issue bed, staring 
           up at the ceiling in what looks like utter exasperation. 

           After a moment, we hear the DRUMMING again, much louder now. 
           It’s coming from the bathroom.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Feynman sits on the closed lid of the toilet, playing drums 
           on an upended trash can. The acoustics are phenomenal.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Neil Armstrong seems to be developing a nervous twitch.

           INT. KUTYNA’S ASSIGNED ROOM - LATER

           Kutyna opens the door in response to a loud KNOCKING to 
           reveal a sheepish Feynman with his bag tucked under his arm.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry, General. It was this or 
                        sleep in the hall.

           Kutyna lets him in. 

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        I asked Ride if she wanted to bunk 
                        up, but she didn’t seem interested.

           INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

           Kutyna and Feynman, in their undershirts, brush their teeth. 

           INT. KUTYNA’S ASSIGNED ROOM - NIGHT

           Feynman and Kutyna each lie in separate beds in the dark. 
           Neither one can sleep. Feynman begins to speak, quietly. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Her name was Arline. We were just 
                        kids, but I was crazy for her. When 
                        she got Tuberculosis, my parents 
                        tried to get me to call off the 
                        engagement. But I didn’t. I figured 
                        even a couple years married to 
                        Arline was worth a lifetime missing 
                        her.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Was it?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        If you’ve ever been in love, you 
                        wouldn’t have to ask. 
           Kutyna thinks on this.

                                 KUTYNA
                        For me it was a high society 
                        blonde. There I was, a second 
                        generation Polack from Chicago. 
                        Talk about reaching above my 
                        station.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So what happened?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Well I had two things going for me: 
                        I had guts, and I had a great car. 
                        ‘51 Ford Deluxe. I polished that 
                        baby til it shone--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Get back to the blonde.

                                 KUTYNA
                        We started dating. I was over the 
                        moon for her-- to the point that my 
                        grades went south and I lost the 
                        Ford, and then the blonde, and my 
                        folks sent me off to West Point to 
                        straighten up and fly right.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (musing)
                        So that’s how you got your stripes. 
                        ...You ever see her again?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Every day of my life. I married 
                        that girl the day I graduated.

           Feynman smiles at this in the darkness, then changes the 
           subject.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Do you think Mulloy knew how risky 
                        that flight was going to be?

                                 KUTYNA
                        It’s possible, but he’d never admit 
                        it. No one’s willing to talk about 
                        what really happened in that last 
                        minute call.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Except for Boisjoly. 
                                 KUTYNA 
                        Too bad he’s gone into hiding. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        We’ve got to get to him... before 
                        someone else does.

                        What do you want me to do?

           INT. KEEL’S OFFICE, DC - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Keel has his feet up on his desk, spinning his red pen in his 
           hand.

                                 KEEL
                             (on phone)
                        Just show the old man a good time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAYS OF MARSHALL SPACE CENTER, ALABAMA - LATER

           We see a pair of gorgeous LEGS in heels striding down the 
           hallway. Attached to the legs is a well-stacked torso of a 
           REDHEADED SECRETARY, who carries a tray with coffee mugs.

           She knocks softly on a door marked “Lawrence Mulloy, Project 
           Manager” and enters.

           INT. MULLOY’S OFFICE, MARSHALL - SIMULTANEOUS 

           She quietly enters Mulloy’s office, and we see Feynman, Sally 
           Ride, General Kutyna and Neil Armstrong seated on couches 
           across from Mulloy, taking notes as he talks.

                                 MULLOY
                        MTI held a private caucus to 
                        analyze their data. When they came 
                        back online, they supported the 
                        launch.  
                                 FEYNMAN
                        So they gave you the green light, 
                        when it was completely within their 
                        power to scrub it.

                                 MULLOY
                        Sure, MTI scrubs all the time. They 
                        had scrubbed this particular launch 
                        three times already.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Didn’t it seem odd to you that just 
                        when they were about to delay the 
                        Challenger for a fourth time, MTI 
                        went ahead and changed their minds?

                                 MULLOY
                        I can’t tell you what happened 
                        during those 45 minutes MTI went 
                        offline. I was put on hold. 

           Meanwhile, Kutyna examines the wall of Mulloy’s office, which 
           is covered in framed, self-congratulatory photos. Kutyna 
           spots a photo of MULLOY flanked by the GENTLEMAN SENATOR and 
           the BALD SENATOR-- all of them in formal dress and laughing.

           A framed, yellowing NEWSPAPER ARTICLE hangs beside it.

           CLOSE ON the HEADLINE: “UTAH WINS BIG: NASA AWARDS ONE 
           COMPANY EXCLUSIVE ROCKET CONTRACT” 

                                 ARMSTRONG
                             (to Mulloy)
                        The New York Times referenced a 
                        history of memos and reports 
                        listing O-rings as a matter of 
                        prime importance. Where are they?

                                 MULLOY
                        The Commission has been given all 
                        existing paperwork.

           Feynman looks the redheaded secretary up and down 
           appreciatively. She smiles at him as she pours coffee. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (with a wink)
                        Thanks, doll.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                             (to Mulloy)
                        All the engineering reports? You’re 
                        sure?
                                 MULLOY
                             (with expansive gesture)
                        You’re welcome to talk to anyone at 
                        Huntsville, and have full access to 
                        our files.

           Feynman dismisses this with an impatient wave of his hand. He 
           stands up imperiously, perhaps for the secretary’s benefit.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Mr. Mulloy, is it or is it not true 
                        that NASA was under enormous 
                        political pressure to get 
                        Challenger launched on time?

           Mulloy chortles, coldly. 

                                 MULLOY
                        Does that come as a surprise to 
                        you, Dr. Feynman? That an 
                        underfunded government agency would 
                        be under pressure to perform?

           Feynman flushes. Now he means business.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Those MTI engineers must have been 
                        forced to go against their better 
                        judgement--

                                 MULLOY
                        There was nothing wrong with their 
                        judgement. Their launch decision 
                        process was not flawed.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Not flawed?? 

           Feynman looks to the other Commissioners to see if they’re as 
           flabbergasted by this statement as he is. 

                                 MULLOY
                        No one could have predicted this 
                        accident. How could we? MTI and 
                        NASA were in complete agreement 
                        regarding the safety of that 
                        flight. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Fine. Do me a favor. Write down for 
                        me what you all thought was the 
                        likelihood of losing a shuttle. 
                        Before you actually LOST the 
                        shuttle, I mean.
           He tosses Mulloy a pad of paper. After a moment, Mulloy 
           reluctantly jots a number down.

           Feynman takes out the stack of PAPER SLIPS we saw him collect 
           at Kennedy, and starts to lay them face down on the table in 
           a line in front of Mulloy, like a casino dealer.

           Kutyna shoots Feynman a warning glance, Feynman wordlessly 
           assures him there’s a point to this.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Mulloy, would you read what’s 
                        written on these papers for us?

           Mulloy, with a heavy sigh, gets up and starts flipping them 
           over and reads what’s written on them.

                                 MULLOY
                        “1/100,” 1/300,” “1/200...”

           He stops suddenly, realizing what they are. He’s red-faced. 

                                 MULLOY (CONT’D)
                        Who gave you these numbers?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Your top engineers at Kennedy. 
                        Those numbers are what they thought 
                        the chances were of disaster.

           Sally Ride flips over the remaining slips of paper on the 
           table. 

                                 MULLOY
                             (furious)
                        I want those engineers’ names.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You don’t GET their names, Sir. 
                        Now, will you read what you wrote 
                        out loud to the Commission?

           Mulloy holds the pad of paper to his chest.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (with an edge)
                        Unless you’d like to change your 
                        answer?

           Mulloy slowly lowers the pad of paper and reads.
                                 MULLOY
                             (tightly)
                        Probability of losing a flight is 
                        widely agreed to be --one in a 
                        hundred thousand.

           Sally Ride’s gaze shoots daggers, Armstrong looks down in 
           disgust. Even Kutyna is seething.

                                 RIDE
                        None of us astronauts had any idea 
                        of this.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No one did.

           The Secretary chooses this inopportune moment to poke her 
           head back in, coffee thermos in hand.

                                 REDHEADED SECRETARY
                        Can I warm anyone up?

           EXT. MARSHALL SPACE CENTER, ALABAMA - LATER THAT DAY

           Kutyna, Feynman and Armstrong exit the offices.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Some show you put on back there.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I was trying to prove a point, and 
                        I proved it.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        You can’t prove anything without a 
                        paper trail, and I’ve checked out 
                        all the official documents. 
                        Mulloy’s clean.

           Suddenly Mulloy’s Redheaded Secretary appears, taking 
           Feynman’s arm.

                                 REDHEAD SECRETARY
                        Let’s take my car.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’re not joining us for dinner?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry, got plans.

           He winks at the General in farewell and walks to her car. 
           Neil Armstrong shakes his head in disgust.
           EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Feynman and the redhead are seated near the large front 
           window, on the same side of the booth, like lovers. 

           PULL BACK to reveal a black TOWN CAR across the street, 
           watching.

           INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Feynman sketches the redhead on the back of his paper menu. 
           She poses for him.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Angle your head a bit-- that’s it. 

                                 REDHEAD SECRETARY
                        What you did today-- that was 
                        really something. But you shouldn’t 
                        be so hard on Larry. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (focused on his sketch)
                        No? Why not?

                                 REDHEAD SECRETARY
                        When a launch gets scrubbed, for 
                        whatever reason, NASA blames 
                        Marshall Space Center, and Marshall 
                        Space Center blames Larry. He was 
                        already three in the hole, and a 
                        fourth could’ve cost him his job.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (intrigued)
                        I see...
                             (immediately covering)
                        --Uh, I see, how much you care 
                        about him. He’s lucky to have such 
                        a lovely woman working for him.

           He finishes the sketch and presents it to her-- we see that 
           he has some skill.

                                 REDHEAD SECRETARY
                        Wow, that’s good. ...You really 
                        think I could model?

           Feynman just smiles.
           EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           We see them through the plate glass window, drinking wine. 
           Leaning towards each other, enjoying each other’s company. 
           She feeds him a bit cake on her fork.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - LATE THAT NIGHT

           He walks her to her car.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’m going to catch a cab, doll. 

                                 REDHEADED SECRETARY
                        You... don’t want to come see my 
                        place?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’d love to see it... if I didn’t 
                        love my wife so much. 

           She nods. Then throws her arms around his neck in a showy 
           hug, and plants a KISS on his cheek, which he accepts. She 
           holds onto him for a long moment. 

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Good night. It’s been a swell 
                        evening.

           He walks back towards the street, passing the black town car 
           which is parked nearby. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

           A SLAP of papers landing on Rogers’ desk. He doesn’t look up.

                                 ROGERS
                             (tightly)
                        If Feynman’s in that paper, I don’t 
                        want to see it. 

           We see a reverse shot of Keel, beaming.

                                 KEEL
                        You want to see THIS.

           He pushes a manila folder towards Rogers, who opens it.
           It’s filled with SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of Feynman and the 
           Redhead. Eating dinner. Laughing provocatively. Her kissing 
           him. Also Feynman with the two blondes at the Brazilian club.

           EXT. AIRSTRIP AT MARSHALL - FOLLOWING DAY

           A group of antsy REPORTERS keep their eyes peeled for the 
           approach of the Commissioners’ two town cars. 

           INT. LIMO ON THE MOVE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Kutyna has a legal pad, where he’s sketched out an escape 
           scenario.  Armstrong, Ride, and Feynman lean over it.

           We see Kutyna’s hand expertly sketching a tactical plan. He 
           delegates with the authority of a man who’s seen combat.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Chairman, you go left, Sally, you 
                        go right. I’ll stay in the car and 
                        block their approach until you’re 
                        safely aboard.

           Armstrong nods in approval.

                                 KUTYNA (CONT’D)
                        Professor-- just follow Sally and 
                        don’t say anything to anyone, okay?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        When are you going to stop telling 
                        me what to do, General?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Get ready to move.

           EXT. AIRSTRIP - CONTINUOUS

           The limo lets out Ride, Armstrong, and Feynman, then swerves 
           around with a SCREECH to act as a barrier between them and 
           the press. It’s a straight shot to the jet’s stairway.

           Armstrong and Sally stride quickly towards it, ignoring the 
           Press. Feynman makes as if to follow them...

           ...Then instead feints to the left and runs STRAIGHT TO THE 
           PRESS, who welcome him with SHOUTS of recognition.
           INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

           Kutyna watches this from inside the limo, in total 
           exasperation.

           EXT. AIRSTRIP - CONTINUOUS

           Feynman is surrounded by reporters.

                                 JOURNALIST
                        Sir, what can you tell us about 
                        your experiences this past week?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        NASA’s been living in a fantasy 
                        world, exaggerating their safety 
                        margins-- 

                                 JOURNALIST
                        No, we mean your experiences with 
                        your lady friend. Haven’t you seen 
                        the papers?

           He holds up the front page of that day’s paper.

           INSERT: A black and white photo of Feynman being kissed by 
           the redhead, outside the restaurant. 

           Speechless, Feynman forcibly SNATCHES the paper from the 
           journalist’s hand. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        How will this scandal affect your 
                        investigation? Are you planning to 
                        withdraw?

           Feynman backs away from their questions. He bumps into 
           Kutyna, who is suddenly there at his side.

                                 KUTYNA
                        The Professor has a plane to catch. 

           Taking Feynman’s arm, Kutyna guides him onboard the plane.

           INT. CHARTERED JET - MOMENTS LATER

           A severely rattled Feynman grabs some more copies of the 
           complimentary newspapers stocked on board the galley, and 
           sits heavily in his seat beside Kutyna.

           We see headlines like “STRIP CLUB PROFESSOR” and “NOBEL 
           WINNER NOT SO NOBLE?” 
                                 KUTYNA
                        I TOLD you to “check six!”

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I was set up! Oh my God, what’s 
                        Gwen gonna think...

                                 KUTYNA
                        All your press-mongering about 
                        Congress being to blame... You sure 
                        know how to pick your enemies.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 KUTYNA
                        I don’t suppose you caught those 
                        photos of Mulloy getting chummy 
                        with the Senators from Alabama and 
                        Utah... Two states that feed from 
                        NASA’s trough.

           The jet starts to taxi down the runway.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (skimming articles)
                        It’s a blatant smear campaign. The 
                        press even interrogated the 
                        strippers down at my local club! 
                        I can’t let these bastards get away 
                        with this. I gotta, you know, make 
                        a statement, refute this--

                                 KUTYNA
                        No, Professor-- you can’t say a 
                        word to the press. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I gotta clear my name--

                                 KUTYNA
                        They’ll skew everything you say. In 
                        their eyes the story isn’t the 
                        Challenger anymore-- it’s YOU.

           Feynman covers his face in his hands, humiliated and 
           helplessly enraged.

           INT. SALT LAKE CITY AIRPORT - LATER

           Feynman talks to Gweneth on a public payphone in the airport. 
           Nearby, we see PASSERSBY notice him and smile and whisper to 
           each other. He’s become a different kind of celebrity now.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (on phone)
                        I feel so violated...

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                        Can you imagine how we’re feeling? 

           Feynman closes his eyes, feeling terrible.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You KNOW nothing happened. I told 
                        you, they’re trying to discredit me-

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                             (icy fury)
                        And you certainly make it easy for 
                        them, Richard.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (helplessly)
                        I’m sorry.

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                        Don’t apologize to me, apologize to 
                        your children. 

           INT. FEYNMAN KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Overcome, Gweneth thrusts the phone at Michelle, who’s 
           sitting beside her. Michelle takes the receiver.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Hi Dad...

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Hi Sweetheart. How you holding up?

                                 MICHELLE
                        Better than Mom. When are you 
                        coming home?

           Gweneth is dabbing her eyes with a tissue.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Soon. There’s someone I gotta find, 
                        first...
           EXT. BRIGHAM CITY, UT - EARLY MORNING

           The Commissioners drive into Brigham City-- a small company 
           town in the arid beauty of the red desert. Snow-covered 
           mountains ring the valley.

           They pass by the same “Welcome to Brigham, Birthplace of the 
           Shuttle!” billboard we saw earlier. Only now it has been 
           spray-painted with the words: “MTI = Killers.”

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MTI CAMPUS, TESTING FACILITY - AFTERNOON

           We see a small ROCKET MODEL on the ground, spitting sparks 
           from its lit fuse. Feynman, Kutyna, Armstrong and Ride are 
           gathered around it, at the MTI rocket testing facility. They 
           stand alongside the MTI Managers we recognize from the 
           teleconference.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        We’re already testing out new 
                        escape mechanisms in case of future 
                        in-flight malfunctions. 

           Like a bottle rocket, the rocket SHOOTS UP into the sky. We 
           follow it a couple hundred feet up, until a small parachute 
           POOFS out, bringing the orbiter segment back to the ground. 

           As it returns to the ground, Feynman is no longer among them.

           EXT. MTI CAMPUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman turns a corner between buildings and notices a 
           JANITOR tossing white plastic bags into the back of a truck. 
           They are light enough to be lifted easily, two in each hand.

           The truck takes off, leaving strange debris fluttering in the 
           dust by his feet. He picks it up.

           CLOSE ON: Strands of professionally-shredded paper. 

           He hops up on the loading dock and slips inside.

           INT. MTI HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

           He walks down the hallway, reading the names on the doors. 
           INT. MTI HALLWAYS - MOMENTS LATER

           Feynman stops at a door marked “R. Boisjoly: Structural 
           Engineering.” Feynman opens the door, revealing a stripped 
           office. 

           Suddenly he hears a CLANK. The door’s hit something inside. 

           INT. BOISJOLY’S OFFICE

           Behind the door is a cardboard box filled with desk swag and 
           refuse. Feynman roots through it, and pulls out a MUG.

           CLOSE ON: A cheery cartoon waitress smiles big, and the words 
           “Diner of the Month” scrolled across it.  He turns it around 
           and sees in small print: “Idle Isle Cafe” and an address.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IDLE ISLE CAFE- THAT EVENING

           An aging WAITRESS who looks like a much more sour version of 
           the cartoon faces Feynman from behind the diner’s counter. 

                                 WAITRESS
                             (suspicious)
                        Why you wanna know about Roger?

           A couple CAFE PATRONS sitting at the counter notice her tone, 
           and peer around the corners of the booths.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’m on the Commission investigating 
                        Challenger. Do you know where we 
                        might find him?

           Suddenly she looks torn between fear and anger. A mean, heavy-
           set DINER, wearing a jacket embroidered with a picture of the 
           shuttle and a MTI logo, pipes up.

                                 DINER
                        You don’t have to tell him 
                        anything, Betty. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Excuse me?

                                 DINER
                        We know what you’re up to. You’re 
                        helping NASA put the blame on MTI. 
                        It’s all over the news. 
                                 FEYNMAN
                        I understand you’re worried about 
                        your jobs after the accident--

                                 DINER
                        Hell, our jobs were at risk even 
                        before that.

           Feynman is confused.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        What do you mean? You guys have had 
                        a monopoly on the shuttle boosters 
                        for the last twelve years.

                                 DINER
                        Some investigator. Doesn’t know 
                        we’re about to lose that contract. 
                        Congress just opened up the bid to 
                        outside competition. Said our 
                        rocket parts contract violated US 
                        anti-monopoly laws.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (stunned)
                        When did this happen?

           The cafe becomes very still. 

                                 DINER
                        A week before the accident.

           Feynman’s mind races, connecting the dots. In the awkward 
           silence another diner, an older woman this time, pipes up 
           with a quavering voice.

                                 WOMAN
                        If that plant shuts down, this 
                        town’s as good as dead! Put that in 
                        your report.

           Feynman looks to the waitress for another cup of coffee, but 
           she takes his mug and replaces it with the bill. Get out.

           INT. TELEPHONE BOOTH OUTSIDE CAFE - LATER

           Feynman flips through the phone directory until he gets to 
           Allan McDonald’s listing. Feynman tries to write down the 
           address, but his pen is dry. He rips out the page instead. 
           EXT. MCDONALD’S HOME - LATER THAT NIGHT

           McDonald opens the door, immediately wary when he sees 
           Feynman and Kutyna on his stoop.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Dr. Feynman. General Kutyna. What 
                        can I do for you?

           He doesn’t let them in. Feynman takes this in stride.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sorry to bother you so late at 
                        night--

                                 MCDONALD
                        I can’t help you. Were I to 
                        testify, I could lose more than my 
                        job.

                                 KUTYNA
                        We could protect you.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Look, you don’t have to say a 
                        thing. All we want you to do is 
                        listen.

           Off McDonald, wavering.

           EXT. MCDONALD’S PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           McDonald, Kutyna and Feynman sit on his front porch steps.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Mulloy was under even more pressure 
                        than usual from his bosses to make 
                        sure Challenger launched on time. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Reagan’s State of the Union address 
                        that night depended on Christa 
                        McAuliffe being in space. So when 
                        it looked like you guys were going 
                        to delay another launch, Mulloy had 
                        to use every bit of leverage he had 
                        to prevent a scrub.

                                 KUTYNA
                        But why cave in now, after your 
                        company refused to launch three 
                        times before?
           McDonald says nothing. Feynman clears his throat.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I can answer that. Without your 
                        monopoly, MTI now stood to lose 
                        their two-billion dollar contract 
                        to outside competition. They 
                        couldn’t risk alienating Mulloy any 
                        further.

           Kutyna digests this new bit of information. McDonald’s eyes 
           sharpen. Impressed with how much Feynman knows.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        On one hand, you’ve got Mulloy with 
                        all the weight of Washington and 
                        NASA coming down on him. On the 
                        other hand, you’ve got an aerospace 
                        giant, vulnerable for the first 
                        time. 

                                 MCDONALD
                        So you heard about the green ball 
                        theory. 

           Feynman’s intrigued.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        The what?

                                 MCDONALD
                        If you have a green ball in your 
                        left hand and a green ball in your 
                        right hand, what does that give 
                        you?

           Off of Feynman’s blank look.

                                 MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                             (deadpan)
                        Complete and absolute control of 
                        the Jolly Green Giant. 

           A moment of grim humor. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I know you want to protect your 
                        friend. But don’t you think it’s 
                        time he got to tell his side of the 
                        story? 

           Off McDonald’s wary expression.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           Kutyna sits beside McDonald in the front seat, who is driving 
           through mountain forest. Feynman sits in the back. 

                                 MCDONALD
                        It’s not much farther. 

           EXT. CAR - NIGHT

           McDonald turns the car off the road onto a dirt-packed drive. 
           He takes it up into the forest, to a tiny hunting cabin 
           tucked away from the road.

           Boisjoly is waiting for them, sitting on the steps in the 
           dark. As their headlights wash over him, he stands and 
           approaches the car, a ghost in their headlights. He looks 
           much worse for wear since we last saw him-- pale, poorly-
           rested-- a haunted man.

           INT. CAR - NIGHT

           McDonald rolls down the window.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        Don’t park. We’re not staying here.

           He opens the door and slides in next to Feynman in the back 
           seat.

           EXT. CAR - NIGHT

           The car pulls out of the driveway, turns around. Disappears 
           back into the darkness.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER

           They wind their way up a craggy mountain.  Below them lies 
           the glittering patch of Brigham City, surrounded by darkness. 
           A little ways off is a massive complex, lit up with sodium 
           lights-- MTI.

           They park at a deserted trail head parking lot.

           EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           The four men sit on a bench that looks out over the valley. 
           They listen to Boisjoly as if in a confessional, all of them 
           staring straight ahead, silent and respectful.
                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        When I heard they were still 
                        considering a launch, I couldn’t 
                        believe it.

           BEGIN FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT BEFORE LAUNCH

           The MTI managers sit on one side of a large table, Boisjoly 
           on the other, his file box on the floor next to his feet.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        But I convinced them to scrub the 
                        launch until it was warmer.

           INT. KENNEDY SPACE CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Mulloy is at Kennedy. We recognize the room from before. 
           Allan McDonald is there beside him, looking miserable.

                                 MULLOY 
                        This is no time to be getting cold 
                        feet, MTI. 

                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        Meanwhile at Kennedy, Mulloy was 
                        pressuring Allan to override my 
                        recommendation, but he refused. 

                                 MULLOY
                        There are other companies out there 
                        who can build us a solid rocket 
                        booster.

           Allan McDonald looks up sharply at this-- stunned at the 
           threat.

           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        I suggest you take another look at 
                        your data, MTI. 

           The two MTI Managers exchange looks. 

                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        They took us offline, fully aware 
                        what he was threatening to do.
           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           We watch Boisjoly getting increasingly upset as, without 
           sound, he gestures furiously to various charts, memos, and 
           reports, all of which he pulls from his box of documents.

                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        It was the most important 
                        presentation of my life.

           He writes quickly on the dry erase boards a series of dates 
           and shuttle numbers similar to Feynman’s hand drawn list.

           His attitude goes from outraged to fearful to pleading, and 
           yet the managers remain unmoved.

           INT. KENNEDY CONFERENCE ROOM - 45 MINUTES LATER

           Mulloy’s eyes are on the digital clock counting down until 
           the launch. McDonald is leaning his forehead against the 
           window which overlooks the shuttle.

           His patience at an end, Mulloy’s finger stabs at the 
           intercom.

                                 MULLOY
                        We’re eight hours to launch. I need 
                        your decision.

           INT. MTI CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Boisjoly is hunched over his paperwork, exhausted.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                             (grim)
                        Lockheed and United Technologies 
                        have been waiting for this day for 
                        12 years.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1 (CONT’D)
                             (to Boisjoly)
                        Boisjoly, Mulloy’s right.  Your 
                        research on cold weather affecting 
                        o-rings does seem inconclusive--

                                 BOISJOLY
                        It was conclusive enough for you an 
                        hour ago! And yesterday! And last 
                        week!
                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                        Last week, we had a monopoly on 
                        making NASA’s rocket boosters.
                             (slowly, to Boisjoly)
                        Now. Can you prove -beyond a doubt- 
                        that the Challenger will fail 
                        tomorrow?

           All the heads swing to look at Boisjoly. 

                                 BOISJOLY
                        You know protocol dictates we prove 
                        the shuttle will survive before we 
                        can recommend a launch...

                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                             (waving this off)
                        Can you prove it won’t survive?

           Long pause. Their gazes weigh heavily upon Boisjoly.

                                 BOISJOLY
                             (helpless whisper)
                        ...No. I can’t prove that.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        Then I think it’s time to take off 
                        our engineering hats and put on our 
                        managers’ hats. 

           The Managers look around the room, making sure this is 
           sinking in. After a long moment, Manager #1 presses the 
           intercom button.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1 (CONT’D)
                             (into intercom)
                        Mr. Mulloy, we’ve reanalyzed our 
                        data.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        And?

                                 MTI MANAGER #2
                             (into intercom)
                        Let’s go for it.

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        Are you all in agreement?

           Boisjoly meets no one’s gaze. His hands are shaking.

                                 MTI MANAGER #1
                        No objections on this end. Right, 
                        gentlemen?
           A long silence. No one looks at Boisjoly. 

                                 MULLOY (O.S.)
                        I want a launch directive as soon 
                        as possible. 

           Boisjoly slowly, inconspicuously gathers his charts under his 
           hands, as MTI Manager #2 begins to sign the launch paperwork.

                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        I could have called up the Launch 
                        Director at Kennedy. Or threatened 
                        to call the Press. Hell, I could 
                        have called the President. But I 
                        kept quiet.

           INT. MTI HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           MTI Manager #2 carries the launch directive down a long, dark 
           hallway, where a fax machine waits.

           Feeding the paper in. Pausing for a beat-- second thoughts?

           He presses the button. The paper disappears into the machine.

                                 BOISJOLY (V.O.)
                        We killed them. In the banality of 
                        that boardroom.

           We see a long shot of the manager from behind, stooped over 
           the fax.

           END FLASHBACK SEQUENCE.

           EXT. SCENIC OVERLOOK - NIGHT

           Boisjoly rises from his bench, raw with emotion.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        I could have stopped it. 

           McDonald speaks up, needing to believe his own words.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Those men had an agenda that was 
                        bigger than any of us. Nothing we 
                        could have said would have changed 
                        that.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        But my conscience would have been 
                        clean, Allan. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BOISJOLY (CONT'D)
                        In the moment I figured I’d let 
                        other men think about the 
                        consequences, more important men 
                        than me... But they’re not the ones 
                        falling apart over this. I can’t 
                        stop thinking about it. 

                                 MCDONALD
                        You’re being too hard on yourself.

                        There is so much in this world that 
                        is grey and unclear, but once in a 
                        while you are lucky enough to know, 
                        to truly KNOW, what is right and 
                        what is wrong. And if you don’t 
                        listen to that one voice that’s 
                        telling you the truth... 

           His voice trails off.

                                 BOISJOLY (CONT’D)
                        Then you’re lost.

           Feynman is deeply affected. Gazing out on the moonlit snow, 
           the cold desert below them resembles sunlit sand. 

                                 KUTYNA
                        You telling us this will help us 
                        change the Space Program. Because 
                        of you, the voices of engineers 
                        won’t get strangled by red tape 
                        again. You can go home, and go back 
                        to aerospace again. 

                                 BOISJOLY
                        I think it’s too late for me, Sir.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (with emotion)
                        It’s not too late.

           Boisjoly sees how Feynman’s eyes are bright with emotion. A 
           kindred spirit, with a shared reason to believe it will all 
           be okay.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        Wait here...

           Boisjoly goes to his sedan, unlocks the trunk and lifts out 
           the heavy box filled with files. He carries it to Feynman, 
           placing it in his arms, transferring the burden.
                                 BOISJOLY (CONT’D)
                        It’s all in there. Every 
                        correspondence, every screw-up, 
                        every name. All my research. That’s 
                        probably the only copy of those 
                        documents left anywhere.

           Kutyna opens the box and takes out the topmost sheet of 
           paper.  Kutyna read it by the light of the full moon.

                                 KUTYNA
                             (reading aloud)
                        “Sirs, it is my honest and very 
                        real fear that if we do not take 
                        immediate action to solve the o-
                        ring problem as our number one 
                        priority, then we stand in jeopardy 
                        of losing a flight. The result 
                        would be a catastrophe of the 
                        highest order-- loss of human 
                        life.”

           Kutyna lowers the memo, feeling the weight of responsibility 
           in what he’s holding in his hand. Feynman takes it from him.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (skimming it)
                        This memo pre-dates the launch by a 
                        year. And it was sent to the heads 
                        of NASA and MTI.

           Boisjoly shakes hands with Kutyna and Feynman in the drive.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Thank you, Doctor Boisjoly.

                                 BOISJOLY
                        “Mr.” I don’t have a Ph.D.

           Feynman bows his head in respectful farewell. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Well you do as far as I’m 
                        concerned... Doctor.

           And for the first time, we see Boisjoly smile.

           INT. AIRPLANE - EVENING

           Kutyna sleeps peacefully in the aisle seat. Feynman, by 
           contrast, is contemplative and sad by the window. On the seat 
           between them sits Boisjoly’s box of papers.

           Feynman leans his head against the window, bathing his face 
           in the red light of sunset, disturbed. 

           FEYNMAN’S POV: the dome of the setting sun seems to boil like 
           an atom bomb on the desert horizon, filling the frame 
           completely. 

           FLASHBACK:

           EXT. CANTINA, 1945 - NIGHT 

           The Los Alamos scientists are celebrating at picnic benches 
           in the back of a local Cantina. Local HISPANIC BEAUTIES serve 
           cocktails and dance with the slap-happy young men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           The ENOLA GAY flies above Hiroshima. Approaching its target.

           A moment of silence, then the ATOM BOMB EXPLODES, lighting up 
           the sky with white light. A wave of fire and death.

           The SCREAMS of delighted girls as they are dipped and spun by 
           the dancing scientists. They are in the midst of an 
           orgiastic, energetic celebration.

           The only one not celebrating is ROBERT OPPENHEIMER in his 
           broad-brimmed hat. He stares towards us with haunted eyes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The flames eat away at the metal, and into the external fuel 
           tank. The footage slowly burns to white as the shuttle 
           disintegrates. It’s devastating... And strangely beautiful.

                        Professor?

           INT. AIRPLANE - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Feynman is jerked out of his reverie, his face etched in 
           grief and regret. Kutyna is now awake, and looks at him with 
           some concern.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You okay?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Yeah. Just thinking about the 
                        things Boisjoly said. 
                             (lays his hand on the box)
                        We’ve got a lot of work to do.

           And he summons a smile for his friend’s benefit.

           BEGIN WASHINGTON DC REPORT-WRITING SEQUENCE:

           ...Feynman works in his hotel room, a typewriter in front of 
           him. Hunt-and-pecking his words. Impatient, he rips the paper 
           out and turns it over, handwriting his words instead.

           INSERT: We see his line: “NASA Management is playing Russian 
           Roulette...”

           ...Feynman goes over Boisjoly’s reports and charts, in the 
           cavernous Executive Building library. He absently swallows a 
           pain pill and keeps going, late into the night.

           ...Feynman in an office dictates to a SECRETARY, as he paces 
           around the room.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        “Obvious weaknesses are accepted 
                        again and again, without a 
                        sufficiently serious attempt to 
                        remedy them.”
           ...Feynman lies awake at night, racked with stomach pains 
           that have him curled up into fetal position.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        “For a successful technology, 
                        reality must take precedence over 
                        PR. Mother nature cannot be 
                        fooled.”

           ...Page after page of his report is placed carefully into a 
           three ring binder, topped off with the title page “Personal 
           Recommendations on the Reliability of the Shuttle, by Richard 
           P. Feynman.” Feynman closes the binder’s rings-- it’s done. 

           END SEQUENCE.

           INT. ROGERS’ OFFICE - MORNING

           Feynman KNOCKS on the open door to Rogers’ office, his report 
           in hand. He enters and is surprised to see Al Keel sitting 
           behind Rogers’ desk, working on something.

           Keel smiles warmly as Feynman double-checks to make sure he 
           has the right office.

                                 KEEL
                        Ah, Dr. Feynman! Alton Keel. So 
                        good to finally meet you formally.

           Feynman recognizes him as Keel shakes his hand with both 
           hands.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Sure, you’re a friend of the 
                        General’s. Military?

                                 KEEL
                             (sitting down)
                        Ah, no. I came from the White 
                        House’s Office of Management and 
                        Budget. I’m the Executive Officer 
                        on the Commission, helping the 
                        Chairman keep things on track. 

           He notices the binder tucked under Feynman’s arm.

                                 KEEL (CONT’D)
                        Are those your report findings?
                                 FEYNMAN
                        Yeah, some personal observations of 
                        mine I’d like included in the 
                        report. Will the Chairman be back 
                        soon? 

                                 KEEL
                        Don’t worry, I’ll make sure he gets 
                        it. I’ll give it to him personally.

           He takes the binder from Feynman and flips through it.

                                 KEEL (CONT’D)
                        Very impressive, Professor.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You don’t think it’s too much?

                                 KEEL
                        No no-- this kind of extra-
                        curricular sleuthing deserves a 
                        special place in the final report. 

           Keel stands up and pats Feynman on the back, steering him 
           towards the door. Feynman looks relieved and content.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC PARK - DAY

           The cherry blossoms are in bloom, and shower pink petals on 
           Feynman and Kutyna as they stroll through the park. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I’m really glad I did this, 
                        General. I’m glad you convinced me 
                        to stay.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Me too. I think we made a 
                        difference.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I KNOW we did.

           They reach the corner of the park where the CHESS BUMS sit, 
           engaged in timed chess matches. When they see Feynman, they 
           recognize him and wave him over.  

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        You play?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Not well enough to play these guys. 
                        I’d lose my wallet.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        Ah, it’s not so tough. Here, just 
                        watch.

           He takes a seat beside one of them.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           EXT. CHESS CORNER OF PARK - LATER

           Feynman and the Bum are deep in the game. Kutyna perches 
           nearby, watching their every move.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        When you’re trying to understand 
                        natural laws, a fun analogy is to 
                        imagine the Gods are playing a 
                        great game like Chess. Only we 
                        don’t know the rules, and we’re 
                        only allowed to look at a little 
                        corner of the board, and from just 
                        that we’re trying to figure out the 
                        rules of the whole game.

           The Bum pays no attention to him, and moves his Bishop, 
           hitting the timer.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        See-- right there! You might see 
                        that and think, “okay, so Bishops 
                        always move on the diagonal and 
                        maintain their color. It’s a fact.”

           Feynman mulls his move.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        But then one day, after this has 
                        been accepted for eons as truth, 
                        you see something strange: that 
                        when a Bishop is captured--

           He captures the Bum’s Bishop.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        --a Pawn can go all the way down to 
                        the Queen’s end and it can produce 
                        a new Bishop. And you’ve just 
                        discovered a new rule!  

           The clock is ticking. The bum thinks he's nuts, keeps 
           shooting Kutyna looks. Feynman holds onto the Bishop.
                                 BUM
                        ...Is that your move?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No. However, unlike in chess, where 
                        rules get more complicated as you 
                        go along, in physics when you 
                        discover new things, the rules seem 
                        simpler. Elegant.

           He moves his piece back on the board, setting up a new play.

                                 BUM
                        Is THAT your move?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No. Now, if the Bishop were to 
                        evade capture-- 

           The clock times out. Kutyna hides a smile behind his hand. 
           The Bum makes a move.

                                 BUM
                        Checkmate. You owe me twenty.

           Feynman is caught off guard. He fishes out his wallet.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (grumpy)
                        I’ve got a Nobel Prize, you know.

                                 BUM
                        Yeah and I’ve got a Pulitzer. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           POP! Keel opens a bottle of champagne for the entire 
           COMMISSION, reassembled and celebrating their final meeting. 

           Super: One month later

           They all take a glass, and laugh. The mood is light, like the 
           last day of school.

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Alright, settle down everyone. We 
                        have one last important order of 
                        business, which is the touchstone 
                        of the entire investigation.

           Commissioners exchange confused, slightly worried looks.
                                 ARMSTRONG (CONT’D)
                             (deadpan)
                        We need to choose the color for the 
                        cover.
                             (holding up two options)
                        Indigo blue? Or pomegranate red?

           They laugh.

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           Feynman chats with Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So did you agree with my 
                        recommendations?

                                 SALLY RIDE
                             (puzzled)
                        Recommendations?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        On how to fix the Space Program; 
                        how to re-organize management--

           He sees from her blank look she doesn’t know what he’s 
           talking about. Feynman turns to Armstrong.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you? Read about my findings?

                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Was it in the publisher’s copy?

           Without answering, Feynman crosses the room and grabs a copy 
           of the report out of a cardboard box. He pages through it. 
           Increasingly concerned.

           Feynman storms over to Keel, who’s chatting with Kutyna.

                                 KUTYNA
                        What’s wrong, Professor?

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (growling)
                        What happened to my findings, 
                        Keel?? And why doesn’t this look 
                        anything like the report I signed 
                        my name to?
                                 KEEL
                             (to Kutyna)
                        He must be referring to the 
                        “wordsmithing” I did before it went 
                        to press.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I didn’t write any of this!
                             (he reads from the copy)
                        “The Commission recommends that 
                        NASA continue to receive the 
                        support of the Administration and 
                        the Nation.” 

                                 KEEL
                        It doesn’t really mean anything.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Oh no? How about:
                             (continuing)
                        “We applaud NASA’s spectacular 
                        achievements of the past and 
                        anticipate impressive achievements 
                        to come?!”

                                 KEEL
                        It’s just motherhood and apple pie 
                        stuff. We have to keep the tone of 
                        our findings positive. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Where are all of my recommendations 
                        on how to change NASA? And where 
                        are all of Boisjoly’s memos and 
                        charts?! 

                                 KEEL
                        They were too wordy.

                                 KUTYNA
                        You’re out of line, Keel.

           Rogers draws near, and we see that the whole room is watching 
           their confrontation.

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (to Rogers)
                        What the hell are you trying to 
                        pull, here, some sort of trick you 
                        learned from Nixon??

                                 ROGERS
                             (tightly)
                                 (MORE)
                                 ROGERS (CONT'D)
                        I am trying to protect an honored 
                        American institution from your 
                        crass attempts to garner publicity. 
                        Unlike you, Dr. Feynman, I am not 
                        willing to sacrifice anything and 
                        anyone for my own vanity--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        This is a piece of propaganda!

                                 KEEL
                        The Commission voted to submit that 
                        version instead. It was sent to the 
                        printers last week.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        “Voted??” I didn’t vote on this! 

                                 KUTYNA
                             (angry)
                        Neither did I.

                                 KEEL
                        You two weren’t reachable, and we 
                        had a tight deadline. Look, your 
                        report WILL be published, just as a 
                        separate appendix.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        When will it be published?

                                 KEEL
                        In about...six months to a year.

           For a moment, Feynman is speechless. He knows that this is 
           just about as long as he’s got left to live. 

                                 ROGERS
                        Now that we’ve pinpointed the 
                        technical malfunction, the 
                        important thing is to get the 
                        Shuttle flying again as soon as 
                        possible.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        You’re not trying to protect the 
                        space program, you’re trying to 
                        protect the status quo. The public 
                        deserves to know why those 
                        astronauts died--

           Finally, other members of the Commission speak up. 
                                 ARMSTRONG
                        Rogers is right. Inflammatory 
                        statements will only hurt NASA’s 
                        funding, which won’t allow them the 
                        money they need to fix anything.

                                 SALLY RIDE
                        It’s going to cost billions of 
                        dollars to redesign the shuttle. If 
                        NASA comes across looking 
                        incompetent, Congress could just 
                        end manned space altogether.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        So you all agree with them? That 
                        it’s better to pretend it was the 
                        Shuttle’s o-rings, and not its 
                        managers, that killed those 
                        astronauts? 

           No one meets his eyes. Feynman, disgusted, throws the report 
           he’s holding in the trash and walks out of the room, slamming 
           the door behind him. An awkward silence.

                                 KEEL
                        Let’s move on, shall we?

           Kutyna grabs his coat and makes to follow Feynman.

                                 KEEL (CONT’D)
                        General, you can’t leave until we 
                        choose a color--

                                 KUTYNA
                        Screw the colors, Keel.

           He exits.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER  

           Kutyna catches up to Feynman. Feynman doesn’t stop walking.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Now the American people will never 
                        know what really happened; 
                        everything Boisjoly went through, 
                        and McDonald-- all the engineers I 
                        met who no one would listen to-- 
                        who’s going to hear their side of 
                        it now??

                                 KUTYNA
                        Maybe in time--
           Hearing this, Feynman spins to face Kutyna.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        “Time?” Don’t talk to me about 
                        time, General. You don’t know what 
                        it means, no more than I did at 
                        your age. Back then, “time” was 
                        purely theoretical. Nanoseconds or 
                        eons, it was all the same to me, 
                        just units of an inconceivable 
                        variant. 
                             (softer)
                        Now “time” is as tangible to me as-- 
                        a few more dinners with my wife. A 
                        few more hours to help a student 
                        grasp a slippery idea. It’s five 
                        minutes to complete one last 
                        sketch. A year, to see my daughter 
                        graduate. Time’s more real to me 
                        now than ever before, and I’m out 
                        of it. In the end, I traded five 
                        precious months for-- nothing. 

           With that, Feynman pushes through the doors, revealing a 
           crowd of hungry press and photographers who CLAMOR the moment 
           they spot him.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (throwing up his hands)
                        No comment!

           He pushes roughly through them.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - THAT NIGHT

           Feynman talks to Gweneth on the phone as he gets ready for 
           bed. He looks sallow and defeated. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Choosing the Commission over my 
                        family... I’m sorry. It was a 
                        mistake.

           Feynman shuts the curtains.

           INT. GWENETH’S BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS 

           INTERCUT with Gweneth getting ready for bed at the same time, 
           lowering the blinds.
                                 GWENETH
                             (into phone)
                        You felt a responsibility to see it 
                        through. I can understand that.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        It's a tricky thing, 
                        responsibility. I've spent most of 
                        my life trying to avoid it, and 
                        doing so has made me a very happy 
                        man. 

           She sits on the bed, pulling her hair into a bun.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Feynman sits on the bed at the same time, removing his 
           slippers.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        But something’s been bothering me, 
                        Gwen. I couldn’t put it into words 
                        until that Boisjoly guy did it for 
                        me. 
                             (a confession)
                        You know, back at Los Alamos, very 
                        few of us scientists were thinking 
                        about what would happen AFTER the 
                        war, about consequences.  I 
                        certainly wasn’t. All I was 
                        thinking was: We’d actually done 
                        it! Created fire from equations on 
                        paper, split atoms-- the building 
                        blocks of the universe! And so 
                        there we all were, celebrating our 
                        own genius, the night they bombed 
                        Hiroshima. At the same time as 
                        human beings were getting vaporized 
                        into dust. An entire city, all its 
                        buildings and works of art-- gone. 
                        We were dancing. 

           He violently tosses the oversized hotel pillows onto the 
           floor.

           INT. GWENETH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           She removes the decorative pillows in her bed aside too.

                                 GWENETH
                        There was nothing you could have 
                        done to stop it.
                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        No, but I could have thought about 
                        what I was doing. It never even 
                        occurred to me.

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                        By stopping the war, it probably 
                        saved more lives than it took.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He gets into the right side of the bed, spooning left. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        That’s not the point. I signed up 
                        to kill the Nazis. The bomb was 
                        used on Japanese civilians. On 
                        ordinary men and women, on children 
                        in schools. ...I was so naive.

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                        You were young. Now you know 
                        better.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Do I? I still got bamboozled by 
                        Rogers and his gang. I think that’s 
                        why standing up and being heard 
                        matters so much to me this time 
                        around, Gwen. Because last time I 
                        kept silent.

           He switches off his lamp.

           INT. GWENETH’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On the left side of her bed, she spoons left too, almost as 
           if she can feel his arms wrapped around her.

                                 GWENETH
                        Speaking up doesn’t mean much, 
                        unless you can find someone willing 
                        to listen.

           She turns off her bedside lamp.

           INT. FEYNMAN’S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           What she’s said strikes a strong chord in Feynman. He 
           switches the light BACK ON and grabs his wallet from the 
           bedside table drawer.
                                 FEYNMAN
                             (into phone)
                        You’re right...

           He takes out the folded up NAPKIN with a PHONE NUMBER WRITTEN 
           ON IT IN LIPSTICK.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                         ...What would I do without you, 
                        sweetheart?

                                 GWENETH (O.S.)
                        Probably make a lot more mistakes.

           Feynman smiles as he hangs up the phone. Looking thoughtfully 
           at the blonde's phone number, he picks up the phone again and 
           dials.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Hi Doll, Dick Feynman here. I never 
                        forgot your offer to shake this 
                        town up a little...

           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB BACK ROOM - EVENING

           Keel stands up from the table where all the Southern Senators 
           sit, happily lighting cigars.  The Gentleman Senator is 
           there, as is the Bald Senator.

                                 KEEL
                        How about a round on me, Gentlemen?

           The Senators clap him on the back, grinning. Keel leaves, and 
           we see the Secret Service Agent letting him pass.

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’ OFFICE LOBBY - SIMULTANEOUS

           Rogers, in an overcoat and carrying his briefcase, strides 
           across the marble lobby on his way out. As he passes the 
           SECURITY GUARD’S DESK, he hears the sound of a TV playing the 
           theme music to the McNeil-Lehrer Newshour. 

                                 JIM LEHRER (O.S.)
                        Welcome, sir. Was this an accident 
                        that did not have to happen?

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Yes, yes it was. 
           On hearing the familiar voice, Rogers stops walking. Wide-
           eyed, Rogers peers over the desk and sees the Guard watching 
           the Newshour on a tiny, black and white portable TV.

           ON TV: 

           We see Richard Feynman, sitting opposite Jim Lehrer.

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        NASA had many, many warnings that 
                        there was something wrong, but the 
                        warnings were disregarded.

           We see a reverse shot of JIM LEHRER’s serious face.

           INT. MACNEIL-LEHRER NEWSHOUR STUDIO BACKSTAGE- SIMULTANEOUS

           We see that off stage left on the set are the TWO BLONDES 
           FROM THE BRAZILIAN CLUB, now wearing HEADSETS and t-shirts 
           emblazoned with the McNeil Lehrer Newshour logo. They are 
           producers for the show.

           One of the blondes gives Feynman the ‘thumbs up.’

                                 JIM LEHRER
                        Disregarded out of incompetence, 
                        out of a faulty system, out of out 
                        of bad judgement? For what reason?

           Feynman winks at them in response over Lehrer’s shoulder.

           INT. FEYNMAN HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Gweneth and Michelle sit together watching the show.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                             (on TV)
                        Again and again I’ve heard this 
                        childish attitude at NASA of, 
                        “Nothing bad’s happened before, so 
                        these warning signs must be okay 
                        cause it was okay last time.” 
                        Sooner or later someone was going 
                        to get hurt. 

            Gweneth squeezes Michelle’s hand.

           INT. GRAHAM’S OFFICE - SIMULTANEOUS

           Graham watches him on TV. A half smile is frozen on his face.
                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Is it an accident, then? No, it is 
                        not an accident.

           Graham looks around the room, as if for someone to tell him 
           what to do next. 

           INT. MACNEIL-LEHRER NEWSHOUR STUDIO - SIMULTANEOUS

           Jim Lehrer hones in on Feynman with intensity.

                                 JIM LEHRER
                        What did Rogers mean when he said 
                        writing the report 'was more 
                        difficult than we thought it would 
                        be?’

           INT. KUTYNA’S LIVINGROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Kutyna is on the phone. Lucy is watching TV.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Hold on-- what channel?

           Kutyna hangs up and changes the TV channel. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                             (on TV)
                        What was difficult was the 
                        discovery of NASA’s extensive 
                        illogic about safety. It was hard 
                        for us to find out, in a sort of 
                        emotional way. We had to admit that 
                        the Wizard of Oz that everybody 
                        respects has nothing behind him.

                                 LUCY
                        Did you know about this?

           Kutyna shakes his head no, but grins. Lucy’s confused-- 
           Kutyna puts his arm around her and pulls her closer to let 
           her know everything’s okay. They continue watching.

           INT. NASA LABORATORY LOUNGE ROOM

           Various familiar engineers and scientists are crowded into a 
           room watching the show.
                                 FEYNMAN 
                             (on TV)
                        NASA’s most dangerous mistake was 
                        in setting up a system of 
                        communication which squelched the 
                        engineers who were screaming “No,  
                        we can’t make this work!” The 
                        people at the top who are talking 
                        to Congress don’t want to hear 
                        this, so they discourage 
                        information from moving up. 

           We see how profoundly this affects them, to have their side 
           of the story told.

           INT. CAPITOL HILL CLUB HALLWAY- MOMENTS LATER

           Keel, humming happily to himself, carries a tray of scotches 
           back from the bar via the hallway to the private room. As he 
           approaches, the Secret Service Agent doesn’t move aside.

                                 KEEL
                        Excuse me...

           The agent doesn’t move.

                                 KEEL (CONT’D)
                        They’re waiting for me!

                                 SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                        Not anymore they’re not.

           And we hear the faint sound of the SHOW’s music coming 
           through the other side of the door. 

           INT. CHAIRMAN ROGERS’S OFFICE LOBBY - SIMULTANEOUS

           The Security Guard’s television has been lifted onto the desk 
           so they can both watch. Other passersby have gathered as 
           well.

           ON LITTLE TV:

                                 JIM LEHRER
                        The New York Times this morning 
                        reported from an anonymous source 
                        that you had a clash with Chairman 
                        Rogers over an appendix.

           Rogers’s face is stony-- he knows what Feynman could say now 
           could ruin him forever. 
                                 FEYNMAN
                             (after a beat)
                        Well that's terribly exaggerated-it 
                        got into the news somehow and I 
                        have no control over news.

                                 JIM LEHRER
                             (digging for dirt)
                        So as far as you're concerned, this 
                        was a unanimous report from the 
                        Commission and you didn't go away 
                        with any scars and neither did 
                        Chairman Rogers?

                                 FEYNMAN
                        No Sir. I believe Chairman Rogers 
                        is an honorable man. We just have 
                        some differences of opinion. 

           Surprised, Rogers blinks, seeing Feynman differently for the 
           first time. The Security Guard smiles at Rogers.

           EXT. LAUNCH PAD - SIMULTANEOUS

           Meanwhile the Ice Captain oversees repairs on the launch pad.

                                 FEYNMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        What’s important here, is that the 
                        crew of the Challenger didn’t die 
                        because of rubber joint seals--

                        --or escaping hydrogen gas, or for  
                        any technical reason.

           INT. BOISJOLY’S CABIN - SIMULTANEOUS

           Boisjoly sits on his porch swing, looking up at the stars.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        Those astronauts died because NASA 
                        managers were as untruthful to them 
                        as they were to themselves about 
                        the reliability of their product.
           INT. MULLOY’S DEN - SIMULTANEOUS 

           Mulloy watches the show on TV, hollow-eyed.

                                 LEHRER  (O.S.)
                             (on TV)
                        So the NASA managers are to blame?

           INT. STUDIO - SIMULTANEOUS

           Back in the studio, Feynman leans back in his chair.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        At first I thought so, but I’ve 
                        come to realize that we’re ALL to 
                        blame. Because Americans demand 
                        perfection at any cost. We’ve come 
                        to expect it.  No one considers the 
                        consequences that come with 
                        unrealistic expectations, and in 
                        this case the consequences were 
                        human lives. We suffer from a 
                        national epidemic of short-
                        sightedness, willful naivete, and 
                        NASA suffers as well.

                                    JIM LEHRER 
                        That’s a rather heavy statement 
                        you’re making.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I'm a professor of physics and not 
                        of management and human relations. 
                        It might not be right, but you 
                        asked me for my theory. And there 
                        you have it.

           EXT. DC SKYLINE - EVENING

           The lights of the city twinkle against a deep-blue sky.

                        Thank you sir, it’s been a pleasure 
                        having you as our guest.

                                                              FADE OUT.
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           We see Feynman’s hands buttoning a crisp white shirt. 
           Knotting a perfect tie. Fixing cufflinks-- the uniform of the 
           perfect Commissioner. 

           Feynman grins, pleased in spite of himself at how well he 
           cleans up. Tucks the comb into his jacket pocket. He’s ready.

           INT. OVAL OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

           APPLAUSE from the audience, as Ronald Reagan finishes pinning 
           a medal on Kutyna, who stands next to Feynman and the others.

           Reagan moves on to Feynman, who stands a little straighter. 

                                 RONALD REAGAN
                        I saw you on TV the other night, 
                        Dr. Feynman. My, but that shook 
                        people up. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        That was the point, Mr. President.

                                 RONALD REAGAN
                        I’m looking forward to reading your 
                        appendix. 

           He shakes his hand.

                                 RONALD REAGAN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll fix NASA, I can promise you 
                        that. This will never happen again.

           And Reagan moves on to the next person. We see Feynman looks 
           vaguely disquieted by Reagan’s surety, but he shakes it off.

           EXT. WHITE HOUSE ROSE GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The Commissioners and Press file out into the Rose Garden 
           reception where there are refreshments and a string quartet. 

           Rogers catches Feynman’s eye from across the way. He begins 
           to make his way towards him.

           Feynman braces himself, unsure what to expect. When Rogers is 
           directly in front of him, he hesitates, then stiffly extends 
           his hand. Feynman takes it-- a moment of mutual respect. 
           EXT. WASHINGTON DC FREEWAY - DAY

           Driving like a fighter pilot, cutting in and out of freeway 
           traffic, Kutyna takes Feynman to the airport. They’re in 
           Kutyna’s newly-restored white Opel-- his “baby.” 

           The summer car rides like a dream, and they laugh as they 
           blast rock and roll out their rolled-down windows.

           INT. AIRPORT - LATER

           Kutyna walks Feynman to his gate. They are both quiet now, 
           pleased but tired. Feynman is back to his rumpled, windblown 
           self. They arrive at the gate.

                                 FEYNMAN
                        This has been one of my greatest 
                        adventures. 
                             (beat)
                        I couldn’t have done it alone.

           They shake hands.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Glad I could be your co-pilot.

           Feynman holds on to his for a moment. 

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Glad you could be my friend. 

           A beat before he lets go, then:

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        You deserve some more stars on that 
                        uniform of yours. That’s like the 
                        end-all be-all for you guys, right?

                                 KUTYNA
                        Co-pilot to pilot--

                                 FEYNMAN
                        Yeah?

           Kutyna reaches into his pocket and hands Feynman a comb.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Comb your hair.

           Laughing, Feynman takes it, then puts on a cranky air.
                                 FEYNMAN
                        When are you gonna stop telling me 
                        what to do?

           Feynman combs his hair, offers the comb back to the General.

                                 KUTYNA
                        Keep it. Until we meet again. 

           Bittersweet, Feynman nods, fully aware there won’t be a next 
           time. He salutes Kutyna, then walks down the jet way without 
           looking back.

           LONGSHOT off the silhouette of Kutyna, watching him go.

                                 FEYNMAN (O.S.)
                        I was born not knowing, and I’ve 
                        only had a little time to change 
                        that, here and there. 

           INT. PHYSICS X CLASSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

           Feynman takes up the front of the darkened auditorium like a 
           stage actor. His posture is softer, his voice, more gentle. 
           We see that the auditorium is PACKED for his last lecture.  

                                 FEYNMAN
                        I can live with doubt and 
                        uncertainty. I think it’s much more 
                        interesting to live that way than 
                        to cling to answers that might be 
                        wrong. I don’t feel frightened not 
                        having an answer, by being lost in 
                        a dark and mysterious universe. It 
                        doesn’t frighten me. 

           He pauses, then looks over to the back row of the auditorium, 
           where we see Michelle and Gweneth. Sandwiched in between the 
           two women is his son CARL, 20’s, wearing a MIT sweatshirt. 

                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        The trick is to be brave enough to 
                        look at something, and see it for 
                        what it really is. And TELL people 
                        what you see, even if they don’t 
                        wanna listen. As scientists, you 
                        must be prepared to stand up and be 
                        heard even in the face of willful 
                        ignorance.

           We see the faces of his hundreds of STUDENTS, past and 
           present, all held rapt by his words. 
                                 FEYNMAN (CONT’D)
                        I have just one wish for you all-- 
                        the good luck to be free to 
                        maintain the kind of integrity I’ve 
                        just described, where you do not 
                        feel forced by any financial, 
                        social, or political need to give 
                        up that integrity. May you have 
                        that freedom.

           He bows his head a little, and with great dignity makes his 
           way off the stage. We hold on the empty desk and blackboard 
           as the lights slowly dim.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           CARD #1

           In June 1986, President Reagan directed NASA to adopt the 
           recommendations in Feynman’s appendix. For the first time in 
           NASA history, personnel were able to report Space Shuttle 
           safety concerns without fear of reprisal.

           CARD #2

           Lawrence Mulloy resigned from NASA soon after the report came 
           out.

           Roger Boisjoly received the 1987 NSS Presidential Award for 
           Professional Integrity and Personal Courage.

           General Donald Kutyna went on to head the North American 
           Aerospace Defense Command and the US Space Command. He 
           received his third star in 1988, and his fourth in 1990.

           CARD  #3

           Richard Feynman died on February 15th, 1988. 

           In memory of the courageous crews of the Challenger and 
           Columbia shuttles.

                                 THE END
