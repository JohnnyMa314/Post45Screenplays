                          A KILLING ON CARNIVAL ROW

                               Travis Beacham
           EXT. SEWER TUNNEL -- NIGHT

           An archway at the end of an alley.  Broken and bent long
           ago, crusted with moss.  A trickle of water cuts through.

           A SCREAM from within.  Laboured BREATHING, the rapid SPLISH
           SPLASH of footfalls.

           AISLING COBWEB, beautiful and intense, bursts from the tunnel
           into the narrow alley.  

           Her body, petite, young, and frail, tense with fear.  From
           her back sprout a pair of large moth-like wings, fragile,
           intricate, frayed at the edges.

           Aisling Cobweb is a faerie.  And she's running for her life.

           She catches her tattered skirt on metal grating and stumbles
           face first.  She turns, panicked.  

           In the darkness, distant at first, an eerie WAIL.  Her eyes
           widen.

           Aisling, flexes her wings, and takes to

           THE AIR

           with frantic agility.  She flies, weaving between narrow
           alleys, dodging gas lanterns and sagging clothes-lines.

           Her papery wings carry her swerving around tight corners.

           She slams into the side of a steep inclined

           ROOF

           where she scrambles for a foothold on the slate shingles.

           A black clawed hand grabs her ankle.

           She kicks free and makes it to the pinnacle of the roof.

           She leaps, flaps her wings, and climbs again into

           THE NIGHT SKY

           Above the rooftops.

           Ahead of her, through the thick billowing fog, she sees the
           obscure shape of a tower bridge.  She heads for the nearest

           TOWER

           and alights at the top between two gargoyles.  Wincing, she
           stretches her wings.  She hugs her knees and shivers.
           She cautiously looks out over the city, gas lights diffused
           through the thick night fog.  She looks down towards the
           river.  No sign of her pursuer.

           No sound except the river LAPPING against the moorings of
           the bridge far below and nearby doves COOING softly.  

           In a fluttering whirlwind, the doves suddenly scatter.

           Aisling looks around.  She dares not breath.  

           Suddenly, A DARK SHAPE swoops in and snatches her from her
           perch.  Aisling's piercing screams echo in the night as the
           struggling pair melts into the murky fog.

           Rasping HISSES, the CRACKING of bones, and a ravenous wet
           SUCKING noise.  Her screams dwindle to a hoarsed MOAN.

           Like a rag doll, Aisling falls through the fog, limp, her
           wings raggedly shorn from her body.  She lands in 

           THE RIVER

           with a sickening SLAP.

           Her violated corpse floats face down, drifting with the
           current, trailing a sparkling rainbow viscus of faerie blood.

           Somewhere in the distance, a FOGHORN sounds.

                                                           TO BLACK

           EXT. THE BURGUE (AERIAL VIEW) -- MORNING

           An urban hodgepodge of crumbling rooftops, grimy belfries,
           and smoke-stained spires.  Chimneys and smokestacks pump
           towers of soot into a stone gray sky.

           CARD OVER:  "City of the Burgue" 

                                 PHILOSTRATE (V.O.)
                        The Burgue: city of soot and sorcery,
                        city of humans and monsters, of faerie
                        whores and drug peddling dwarves.

           (NOTE:  Labels and borders show various zones of the city 
           as each area is introduced.)

                        In the East, you have Argyle Heights,
                        the academic district.  In the North,
                        The Docklands, center of industry
                        and shipping, where the Selkies, the
                        seal folk, work the barges.

                        In the West, Carnival Row, the faerie
                        quarter, home of the sordid faerie
                        brothels.  In the South, Finistere
                        Crossing, the human zone.  That's
                        where I live.  All the underground
                        train lines lead to the center of
                        town, Oberon Square...

           (NOTE:  Lines snake out from the center of "the map," and
           become underground railways.)  

                                 PHILOSTRATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ...where the human controlled
                        government sits and spins its web
                        like a big goddamned spider.

           The "web" becomes a map painted on the wall of

           INT. UNDERGROUND TRAIN STATION -- CONTINUOUS

           INSPECTOR RYCROFT PHILOSTRATE leans against the wall next to
           the map.  He has a hard face, but kind eyes.  He wears a
           long coat and black bowler hat, and smokes a pipe.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (V.O.)
                        And that's The Burgue for you, A to
                        Zed, a melting pot just a few degrees
                        from boiling over.

           He reads a letter as he waits for the train.  

                                 PHILOSTRATE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Sometimes, I can make myself forget
                        about the whole mess.

           He holds it up to an oil lamp bolted to the wall to read the
           beautifully calligraphed handwriting.

           A soft smile crosses his face.

           EXT. TRAIN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Barreling through a tunnel, pistons pumping, wheels spinning,
           pipes spewing plumes of steam.  

           It comes into the gaslit subterranean station and stops right
           in front of Philostrate.  The passenger doors slide open. 
           He steps off into the car.   

           INT. PASSENGER CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate sits, crammed shoulder to shoulder with similarly
           dressed COMMUTERS in the dim car.  He wipes the sweat from
           his brow with a handkerchief.
           The darkness of the tunnel outside is interrupted by regular
           strobes of track-lights.

           A bit of the graffiti on the windows catches Philostrate's
           eye.  The words "The Screaming Banshee" next to the crude
           drawing of a ghost, mouth agape.

           The strobing track-lights illuminate the haunting picture in
           brief flashes.  Philostrate stares into the hollow eyes of
           the drawing as the train SCREAMS to a stop.

           EXT. OBERON SQUARE -- LATER

           Philostrate ascends the stairs of the underground station,
           out into a plaza of crumbling marble sculptures.

           He walks past TOURISTS feeding a thick flock of pigeons. 
           The black dome of Parliament looms in the distance.

           An OLD FAERIE with withered wings pushes a cart piled high
           with trinkets.  Laughing SCHOOLBOYS sneak up behind her and
           throw pigeon food at the her.  She totters to her knees.  

           The boys scatter as Philostrate gives them a reproachful
           look.  Philostrate moves to help the woman up.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You alright? 

           As she climbs to her feet, the contents of her bag spill. 
           Stacks of a rough home-made pamphlet printed on hard pulp
           grain paper.  A banner reads: "The Screaming Banshee"

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Dissident literature.  You know what
                        this is, don't you?  This is an anti-
                        human rag. 

           Philostrate scrutinizes one of the pamphlets then turns his
           hard eyes on the old woman.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Do you have any more? 

           Without looking up, she hands the rest over. 

           Philostrate stuffs the papers into a nearby dustbin and tosses
           a lit match in after them.  A small bonfire erupts.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry.  Just doing my job. 

           EXT. CENTRAL OPS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate walks past a plaque: "The Burgue Metropolitan
           Constabulary: Central Operations."
           EXT. PARLIAMENT STEPS -- LATER

           A powerful, well-dressed middle aged woman, DAME WHITLEY
           BONIFACE, stands at a podium before a clutter of microphones
           and wires.  Camera flashes shine in her fierce eyes.

                                 DAME
                        Today, more than one third of this
                        city is Faerie, Selkie, or Puck... 

           Her oratory echoes over the gathering throng of demonstrators -
           FAERIES, some HUMANS, and OTHER CREATURES.

                                 DAME (CONT'D)
                        Why does this same third represent
                        only 10% of the city's wealth?

           A MURMUR from the crowd, signs raised in approval.

                                 DAME (CONT'D)
                        Why does this element endure such
                        civil injustice?  Here's the reason... 
                        How much representation have you in
                        Parliament?

           The crowd ROARS and WHISTLES.

                                 DAME (CONT'D)
                        We must reform the suffrage laws of
                        our city.  But do not count on the
                        generosity of man.  Don't count on
                        my influence as the Mayor's wife...

           INT. PHILOSTRATE'S OFFICE -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate looks over papers at his desk.  The Dame's distant
           voice drifts across the Square and through the open window.

                                 DAME (O.S.)
                        The right to vote is not ours to
                        give.  It is a right of birth.  Stand
                        and claim what is yours! 

           A loud electric BUZZ startles Philostrate.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Bollocks.  I just got here.

           He flips a switch on a small metal box bolted to the desk.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Philostrate.

           MAGISTRATE FLUTE's voice flows from a brass horn mounted on
           the ceiling above Philostrate's head.
                                 FLUTE (O.S.)
                        Morning Philo.  Sorry but this one's
                        been on my desk ever since it came
                        through on the wire earlier.  No one
                        will touch it.  All my men are out
                        refereeing the Mayor's wife's rally.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (flips the switch)
                        What's the plot?

                                 FLUTE (O.S.)
                        Homicide.  Faerie.  Body washed up
                        in the Docklands.  Selkie girl dragged
                        it ashore.  Pretty cut and dry.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Alright.

                                 FLUTE (O.S.)
                        I have a carriage waiting.

           Philostrate looks out the window.  Waiting in the cobblestone
           street below is a black windowless carriage drawn by a regal
           GRIFFIN in chitinous black armour.

           SERGEANT BOTTOM, a stout constable waits. 

                                 FLUTE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Sergeant Bottom will back you.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (to himself)
                        Bloody hell.

           EXT. CARRIAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           The COACH DRIVER feeds the Griffin from a burlap feed sack. 
           Bottom paces.  Philostrate walks up.

                                 BOTTOM
                        'Bout time, Inspector.

           Philostrate climbs in.  Bottom waddles after him.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Hope you're planning on doing all
                        the talking.  I can't understand a
                        word of that sodding selkie-speak. 
                        Always singin' like bloody canaries,
                        they are.  Why can't they just talk?

           He heaves himself

           INSIDE THE CARRIAGE

           and settles his bulk into the seat across from Philostrate.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        It's just their language, Sergeant.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Right - 

           EXT. STREET -- CONTINUOUS

           The Coach Driver whips the reigns.  The animal breaks into a
           trot pulling the carriage down the narrow foggy street. 

           INT. CARRIAGE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bottom sits wedged uncomfortably.  Fatty jowls hang over his
           tight collar, rippling as he speaks.

                                 BOTTOM
                        All I'm saying - If you live among
                        humans, you bloody well learn to
                        speak the language.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Oh?  And you speak selkie, do you?

                                 BOTTOM
                        Do you?

           Philostrate looks out the window into the cold, bleak morning.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No...

           EXT. THE DOCKLANDS BEACH -- MORNING

           Aisling Cobweb's corpse lies on the shore.  Her dress
           shredded.  Her mouth frozen in a ghastly scream.  Two
           CONSTABLES slide the body into a black bag.  

           Philostrate looks over the fog-choked harbour, watching
           creatures move about the deck of a distant ship.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where's the girl who found the body?

                                 BOTTOM
                        Name's Moira.  She's in her skin, in
                        the water over there.

           A slick, supple seal-esque creature emerges from the tide. 
           It climbs up onto a rock in the distance.  Stretching,
           contorting, opening its mouth impossibly wide.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        This bit still gives me the creeps. 

           A human face pushes through the open mouth.  A whole head
           emerges.  Curly red hair.  A hand.  An arm.  A shoulder.  
           The girl underneath pulls off the dark sealskin as if she's
           sliding out of a tight leather skirt.

           MOIRA stands on the rock in her "human" form, completely
           nude.  Slim fair-skinned body flecked in a blizzard of light
           pink freckles.  Her ears pointed like a faerie's.

           Philostrate politely turns away.  Bottom stares slack-jawed
           with a mix of morbid fascination and disgust.

           EXT. BOULDER ON THE BEACH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Moira dresses herself from a heap of clothes strewn on the
           rock.  Philostrate and Bottom approach.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Good morning Miss Moira.  I'm
                        Inspector Philostrate.

           She meets him with sharp eyes, bright as emeralds.  Inhuman.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        You found the body, did you?

           Moira nods.  She picks up the shed sealskin, singing softly
           as she pets it.  The soft pelt purrs back.  Bottom grimaces.

                                 BOTTOM
                        A separate creature, is it?

           Another curt, silent nod.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Let's not waste the lady's time.
                         (to Moira)
                        You can feel free to talk.  I'm not
                        fluent in selkie-speak, but I can
                        muddle through.

           Finally, she speaks.  Her language, a song, a dozen voices
           in one, flowing eerie harmonies. 

                                 MOIRA
                        Corpse caught in backwards currents/
                        moth caught in the cobweb of creation/
                        clipped wings plucked from silken
                        firmaments/ sticky strands clinging/
                        sinister spider spinning/ poor poor
                        singless wingless pixie

                                 BOTTOM
                        You want me to write this bilge down?
                         (Philostrate nods)
                        Oh fine.

           He takes out a notepad.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What do you know about what did this? 

                                 MOIRA
                        Breezes whisper through silent
                        streets/ tales of some unseelie beast/
                        sublime song soundless to men's ears/
                        becomes the swelling music of faeries
                        fears 

           Bottom transcribes furiously, shaking his head in frustration.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Thank you for your time, miss.

           EXT. THE DOCKLANDS BEACH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate and Bottom walk back to the carriage.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Waste of time.  It's all gibberish.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You see, that's why you have to come
                        to work in the uniform and I get to
                        wear whatever I want.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Alright then, "professor," what did
                        you get out of all that nonsense?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        There's something new in town,
                        something the faeries are afraid of.

           They board the carriage.

           INT. PHILOSTRATE'S OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON

           Philostrate leafs through sepia tintypes of Aisling's corpse. 
           Bottom sits at the typewriter, filling out a report.

                                 BOTTOM
                        The coroner can't even examine the
                        body 'til tomorrow morning.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You just finish typing that report.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Bloody hell.  She's a faerie and
                        she's dead.  Who cares?

           Philostrate ignores him.  Bottom rolls a new paper into the
           typewriter.  
                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                         (as he types)
                        Name: Aisling Cobweb...  Age: 17

           Philostrate examines a photo of Aisling's bare back.  Two
           ragged wounds where her wings should be.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (to himself)
                        Clipped wings...

           Philostrate turns the page and inspects a detailed close-up
           of Aisling's neck, a strange puncture wound on the jugular.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Species: Faerie...  Sex: Female...

           Bottom stops typing.  He looks up at Philostrate.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Have you ever met a male faerie?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Pardon?

                                 BOTTOM
                        Cause I've never seen a male faerie.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Don't be absurd, Sergeant.

                                 BOTTOM
                        How do they reproduce?  They must. 
                        The Faerie Quarter gets more crowded
                        by the day.  I have a theory...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Oh, good Lord.

                                 BOTTOM
                        They keep the males locked in the
                        cellars - only bringing 'em out for
                        making babies?  Sex slaves, you know?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        That has to be the dumbest thing
                        you've ever said.  

                                 BOTTOM
                         (resumes typing)
                        Inspector.  You don't get out much. 
                        The Quarter's streets stink of rutting
                        faeries and black magics.

           Philostrate comes to the last photo.  Aisling's face,
           contorted with terror.  He dwells on it. 
                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        No wonder there's so many murders. 
                        Seedy places like that breed psychos
                        by the bushel.  Someone should really
                        go up to Carnival Row and cart the
                        lot of 'em off to the clink.

           EXT. THE FAERIE QUARTER, CARNIVAL ROW -- NIGHT

           Clotted with life.  Svelte FAERIES fly over the streets.

           LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAB

           stands tightly wedged in a row of buildings packed together
           like sardines.  A web of warped wooden beams embedded in old
           yellowed plaster hold the crooked thing up.

           Lithe winged silhouettes flutter behind closed curtains. 
           From inside, girlish giggles, cries of passion, sensual music.

           Philostrate stands in the street in front of the house.  He
           draws his long black coat tightly around himself, tips the
           brim of his bowler, walks up to the front door and into

           THE LOBBY

           where blood-red velvet tapestries line the walls.  Faeries
           lounge seductively on chez lounges.  All eyes on Philostrate.

           He climbs the stairs, treading lightly into the second story
           hall.  Sounds of passion drift from every room he passes.

           He comes to a door marked "Tourmaline La Roux."  He listens. 
           Silence.  He slowly pushes the door open. 

           INT. TOURMALINE'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate stands in the open doorway and looks over the
           small room.  A bed, a modest dresser, a nightstand.

           Scattered across the wall and floors, paintings and canvases
           of all sizes.  Mostly watercolors.

           TOURMALINE LA ROUX sits on a short stool at an easel,
           painting, back to the door.  She wears only an old flowing
           cotton apron soiled with colorful paint stains.

           Her golden curls cascade down her delicate porcelain-white
           shoulders, vibrant wings absentmindedly flexing as she works.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Don't move.

                                 TOURMALINE
                         (doesn't turn)
                        You going to arrest me?
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I just might.

           Tourmaline turns and smiles at the sight of Philostrate. 
           She daintily runs to him, but stops short of embracing.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Oh, I shouldn't...  I mean, I'd hate
                        to get paint all over your -

           Philostrate suddenly pulls her to him and kisses her
           passionately.  They part.  He smiles.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I have plenty of suits.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Still, all things considered -

           She pulls the drawstring in back of her apron.  It falls to
           her ankles.  She presses up against Philostrate.

                                 TOURMALINE (CONT'D)
                        I like it better this way.

           They kiss deeply as she awkwardly fumbles with the his shirt. 
           She reaches up and turns the valve on an oil lamp.  Darkness.

           INT. TOURMALINE'S ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Silver moonlight.  Philostrate falls on the bed.  Tourmaline
           climbs on top of him, wings fluttering excitedly.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I missed you so much.

           She holds him tight and rocks, sliding up and down, pushing
           and pulling, tenderly rubbing against him.

           He gingerly nibbles at the lobe of her pointed ear.

           Tourmaline shudders and stretches her wings, covering the
           bed.  She gasps as her wings shiver and flush with color.

           INT. TOURMALINE'S ROOM -- MORNING

           Sunlight streams over Tourmaline's naked body, asleep on top
           of the covers.  She opens her eyes.

           Philostrate stands by the window, putting on his pants, his
           bare back to Tourmaline.  She quietly reaches over to her
           nightstand, taking a sketchpad and charcoal pencil.  

           She sketches an oblivious Philostrate as he fixes on the
           canvas on her easel - 
           An unfinished art nouveau poster of a faerie dancer.  Bubble
           letters announce - Guinevere Cartier.  Her pale body and
           swirling watercolour wings fade into rough pencil lines.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I hope it's the brush strokes and
                        not the tits you're admiring.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        This poster - one of your old ones?

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Guinevere Cartier - I'm just touching
                        it up a bit for the Orpheum.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        And what have you got, there? 

           Tourmaline holds her pad to her chest in mock modesty.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Just a still life, darling.  A bowl
                        of fruit and a pitcher of water. 

           Philostrate grins and puts on his tie.  

           Tourmaline tosses the pad aside.

           She grabs his tie and pulls him to her, kissing him. 
           Philostrate indulges for a moment but finally pulls away.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I've got to go...

           She ties the sheets around her and gets out of bed.  She
           moves behind Philostrate, lacing her arms around his waist. 

                                 TOURMALINE
                        What could possibly be more important?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Now, we agreed.  We don't...

                                 TOURMALINE
                        ...talk about work.  Yes yes.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You don't want to know the things I
                        know.  And I don't want to know -

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I love you.

           Philostrate simply smiles.  He sits to put on his shoes.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I need to talk to someone familiar
                        with faerie biology.  Any ideas?

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I thought I taught you everything
                        you needed to know.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I was thinking of something a little
                        more academic.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Have you tried the Scholar's District? 
                        Argyle Heights.  Maybe someone in
                        the Natural History annex...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Right.  There's an idea...

           Philostrate puts on his coat and stands up to leave.  

           Tourmaline stands, opens her sheet, and wraps it around the
           both of them, holding him tight in a linen cocoon.  She gently
           kisses his neck, flexing her wings beguilingly.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Giving my boyfriend a proper send-
                        off.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I'm already late.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I can be quick.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I can't...  I'll see you tonight.

           He smiles and kisses her, then breaks away and goes to the
           door.  He stops and turns around.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Tourmaline...  Be careful...

           She smiles.  He leaves.

           Tourmaline sits at her easel and gets back to work on the
           half-finished Guinever Cartier poster.

                                 DAME (V.O.)
                        I've invited Guinevere Cartier to
                        perform for the Faeries' Rights Lobby.
           INT. MAYOR'S DINING HALL -- SAME

           A long, lavishly set breakfast table.  Dame Whitley sits at
           one end.  At the other, sits her husband, MAYOR MONTAGUE
           BONIFACE III - eyes like flint looking over the morning paper.   

                                 MAYOR
                        That pix singer?  Not here.

                                 DAME
                        Don't be so bourgeois.

                                 MAYOR
                        This fetish of yours was far more
                        interesting when we weren't married.

                                 DAME
                        They are a richly artistic people.

                                 MAYOR
                        Far as I can tell, their art consists
                        mainly of spreading their legs.

                                 DAME
                        In their homeland, the courtesans of
                        Tirnanog were considered artists.

                                 MAYOR
                        Well, here they're considered sluts. 
                        Welcome to the Burgue.

                                 DAME
                        I'm saying maybe you have little
                        reason to be so haughty about the
                        art of love-making.

           The Mayor slams the newspaper on the table and looks up.

                                 DAME (CONT'D)
                        She's not a slut.  She's a singer
                        and a dancer.

                                 MAYOR
                        Well, that is a rare distinction.

                                 DAME
                        She's already been invited.

           The Mayor smirks.  He gives her a patronizing nod.

                                 MAYOR
                        Women.  You must have your hobbies,
                        mustn't you? 
                                 DAME
                        They're our poets, painters,
                        musicians, and yes our sluts, as you
                        so drolly put it.

                                 MAYOR
                        Your little dilettante committee can
                        have your pixie show, dear.  

           He drops his napkin on his plate and rises to leave.

                                 DAME
                        Did you see the article?  A faerie
                        was murdered last night.

                                 MAYOR
                        What else is new?

                                 DAME
                        This one stands out.  This one'll
                        give you trouble... dear...

           EXT. FAERIE QUARTER, CARNIVAL ROW -- LATER

           Philostrate approaches the entrance to The Carnival Row
           Underground Station.  An uneasy CROWD OF FAERIES has gathered.  

           Philostrate pushes his way through.  He moves past a wall of
           uniformed CONSTABLES.

           INT. CARNIVAL ROW UNDERGROUND STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

           More CONSTABLES crowd the foyer.  Bottom spots Philostrate.

                                 BOTTOM
                        There you are.
                         (calling)
                        Magistrate!  The Inspector's here.

           MAGISTRATE FLUTE, an elderly man in a long coat, strides
           into view with a confident authority to his demeanor.  He
           spots Philostrate, and waves him over.  

           Philostrate approaches Flute.  Bottom follows.

                                 FLUTE
                        Another homicide.  Faerie.  Blood
                        drained.  Wings lopped off.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Same guy?

                                 FLUTE
                        We think so.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Why all the officers?
                                 FLUTE
                        Crowd control, Inspector.  Let's
                        just say the locals are spooked.

           They round the corner and enter

           THE MAIN VESTIBULE

           a bank of ticket kiosks with steal cage fronts line the wall.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        It's clear this time our man wanted
                        to make an impression. 

           A withered corpse hangs from the cage.  Arms spread-eagle,
           wrists impaled on the cage's spikes, crucifixion-style, head
           lolled over to one side, exposing gaping neck wounds.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        They found her right as the stations
                        opened.  She's "Marguerite Mignon."

           Philostrate paces in front of the hanging corpse.  He spots
           a crumpled wet flyer on the ground.  He picks it up.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        Considering the precision of the
                        work, we figured she was already
                        dead by the time he strung her up.

           ON THE FLYER

           in Philostrate's hands.  Watercolour faeries in carnival
           masques, dancing.  A signature reveals it to be Tourmaline's
           work.  Dried faerie blood spattered across the image. 

           Philostrate looks back up to Marguerite's corpse.  Her face
           contorted with pain.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Or too weak to fight back...

           Philostrate, unsettled, crumples the flyer and pockets it. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Can we get her down?

                                 FLUTE
                        We just thought you should see -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I've seen.  

                                 FLUTE
                        Sergeant?

           Bottom turns to a pair of CONSTABLES milling about.
                                 BOTTOM
                        Alright mates, let's get the pix
                        down and bagged.

                                 FLUTE
                        You seen the headlines this morning?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Not yet.

                                 FLUTE
                        They're calling him "Unseelie Jack."
                        Two murders and already the papers
                        have us chasing a serial killer.  

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        They could be right.

           The Constables finally manage to pry Marguerite down.  The
           corpse falls, knocking one of the Constables off his ladder.

           Bottom laughs inappropriately at the sight of the Constable
           wrestling with the limp corpse.

                                 FLUTE
                        Sergeant!

                                 BOTTOM
                         (stifling laughter)
                        Sorry, sir.

                                 HARUSPEX (O.S.)
                        Quiet.  All of you.

           A silence falls over the vestibule.  All eyes turn toward
           the entrance where a hunched figure, the HARUSPEX, stands
           silhouetted by shafts of morning sunlight.

           She hobbles into the room, an old crone, frazzled gray hair,
           bandaged eyes behind black spectacles.  A dark cloak flows
           behind her.  She leans on a crooked walking stick.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        You pollute the aether with your
                        banal thoughts.

           She approaches slowly and deliberately, the hollow echo of
           her wooden cane on the stone tiles stabs at the silence.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (whispers to Flute)
                        The Haruspex?   

           Flute gives a curt, wordless nod.
                                 HARUSPEX
                        Dependence on soothsayers, Magistrate,
                        will atrophy your inspectors.

           She throws Philostrate a wry grin.  He's met only by his own
           twin reflections in her black eyeglasses.  

           She kneels with great difficulty next to the body.  

           She wraps her spindly fingers around its face, the veins on
           her bony hands pulsate, taut as wires.  

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        Oh yes.  This one has things to tell. 
                        She has secrets in her little head.

                                 FLUTE
                        Would you be adverse to coming down
                        to Ops to conduct your reading?

                                 HARUSPEX
                        This is bound to be interesting. 

                                 FLUTE
                         (to Philostrate)
                        You need a ride?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No thanks.  I'm heading up to Argyle
                        Heights to follow up on a tip.

           INT. ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (LOBBY) -- LATER

           Suspended from a skylight hangs the fossilized skeleton of a
           gigantic winged dragon mid-swoop, an imposing centerpiece.  

           Below, a throng of uniformed SCHOOL CHILDREN point and gawk
           at the bones, as their CHAPERONES struggle to organize them.

           Philostrate enters via a set of revolving doors.  He crosses
           the gleaming marble floor emblazoned with the museum's seal,
           and goes to a large oak reception desk under the dragon.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Inspector Philostrate to see a
                        Professor Leopold Alcandre.  I wired
                        ahead.

           The Receptionist looks past Philostrate and nods.

                                 ALCANDRE (O.S.)
                        Ah Inspector...

           Philostrate turns.  PROFESSOR LEOPOLD ALCANDRE, an eccentric
           live wire of an old man, waddles up.  
           He wears oversized spectacles with extra lenses of various
           magnifications.  He exudes a sort of constant enthusiasm,
           stumbling over words and occasionally chuckling to himself.  

           He juggles a large leather instrument bag as he awkwardly
           reaches to shake Philostrate's hand.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Forgive me.  I just got your message. 
                        I've hardly had a chance to drop by
                        my office.  Shall we?

           And he's gone, before Philostrate can even get a word in. 
           Under the dragon's skeleton, Alcandre calls after Philostrate.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Impressive, isn't she, Inspector? 
                        Draconis ferox.  Hard to believe
                        they once ruled the skies.

           Philostrate pauses a moment to look into the gaping jaws of
           the fossilized beast. 

           INT. ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY (BASEMENT) -- LATER

           A long narrow dark passage.  Alcandre opens a door at the
           end and enters.  Philostrate stands behind him.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Of course, faerie physiology is one
                        of my areas of expertise.  But only
                        one.  

           He turns a knob.  With a GENTLE HISS, a bank of gaslights
           along the wall flares to life, illuminating the corridor.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        I dabble in so many fields.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I just have a few questions.

           Alcandre reaches the door to his office and fumbles with his
           large key ring.  He finds the proper key, disengages the
           lock and pushes the door open with a rusty creak.

           INT. ALCANDRE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           A large musty room with high ceilings, cluttered bookshelves,
           detailed charts and cross-sections of faerie anatomy.

           Alcandre tosses his keys on a table and squints into the
           hazy shadows of the office.  Philostrate enters behind.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Rupert...  Where are you, Rupert?
           Philostrate notices light pink flower petals on a shelf near
           his head.  He picks up the petals and curiously sniffs them.

           Suddenly, something not entirely unlike a cat jumps down on
           the shelf next to Philostrate's head and hisses.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        There you are, Rupert.

           Alcandre takes the creature in his arms.

           Small leaves, pink blossoms, and other foliage sprout
           sporadically from it's green skin.  It's tail, a leafy vine,
           whips casually back and forth as Alcandre strokes its head.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Rupert's a wee pet project of mine. 
                        Ha!  How do you like that?  "Pet
                        project."  One of my many
                        extracurricular dabblings, Inspector. 
                        Ever heard of theurgic amalgamology?

           Philostrate shakes his head, still trying to wrap his thoughts
           around the puzzling cat/plant creature in Alcandre's arms.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I imagine you get this a lot -

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Layman's terms?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Afraid so. 

                                 ALCANDRE
                        The manipulation of biology through
                        advanced technology and ancient
                        magics?  Commonly called "twining?"

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Oh, twining, yes.  Very controversial.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Every new science is.  Rupert, here,
                        is a cat twined with -

           Alcandre plucks a red fruit from Rupert's skin.  The cat
           MEWS harshly, leaps from his arms and darts into the shadows. 
           Alcandre turns the red fruit over in his fingers and grins.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        - a cherry tree.

           He pops it in his mouth and chews thoughtfully.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Professor, I need to know if you can
                        think of anything that feeds on faerie
                        blood. 

                                 ALCANDRE
                        This wouldn't have anything to do
                        with Unseelie Jack, now would it?

           Philostrate nods.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        How exciting!  I've never been asked
                        to consult on Constabulary business.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Any ideas?

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Well, faerie blood is notoriously
                        toxic.  They do have a few natural
                        predators in their native Tirnanog. 
                        But I'm talking about flesh-eaters,
                        not blood-suckers.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No chance of a breed of vampire -

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Faerie blood would burn a hole in a
                        vampire's gut faster than holy water.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Would there be any reason to siphon
                        a faerie's blood?

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Well, there are old wives' tales. 
                        Mostly hogwash.  The Selkies say
                        faerie blood can be a potent
                        aphrodisiac.  Some Eastern legends
                        say it's a cure for werewolfism. 
                        And there are some Elvish gypsies
                        who still believe it could be somehow
                        treated or diluted into a psychotropic
                        drug that promotes visions.  Hogwash.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        So, if I'm getting this right, the
                        only living thing that could stand a
                        stomach full of faerie blood is -

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Another faerie, Inspector.
           INT. CENTRAL OPS (BRIEFING ROOM) -- AFTERNOON

           Magistrate Flute stands at a podium towards the front,
           addressing a room full of officers including Philostrate,
           Bottom, and various Constables.

                                 FLUTE
                        Alright chaps, I spoke with the 
                        Mayor this afternoon.  He wants to
                        make a definitive statement about
                        who runs this city.  And it's not
                        Unseelie Jack.  Our directives are: 
                        1)  to maintain control of the
                        nonhuman element of the city, 2)  to
                        establish a visible presence in the
                        Quarter, and 3)  to apprehend the
                        killer known as Unseelie Jack.  Here's
                        how I want this to go down...

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           -- Bottom and a few other OFFICERS in riot gear stroll down
           a deserted street in the Faerie Quarter at night.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Sergeant Bottom will lead a patrol
                        of armoured constables, making sweeps
                        of the main drag.  We'll also have
                        the Special Loupgarou Units making
                        the rounds.  There's no full moon -

           -- A black police carriage pulls into an alley.  A team of
           BURLY CONSTABLES open the heavy barred back door.  Out step
           a row of emaciated YOUNG MEN in rags, shackled to one another.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        - we'll have to induce metamorphosis.

           -- The Burly Constables shove syringes into IV tubes in the
           Young Men's wrists.  The Young Men wail.  Eyes turn yellow. 
           Whiskers sprout.  Lips curl back from lengthening sharp teeth.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The wolves will keep mostly to the
                        sewers and tube stations.

           -- In a sewer tunnel, the Burly Constables restrain the Young
           Men/Werewolves at the end of control leashes.  The ravenous
           wolves bark and hiss, as they patrol.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        The Drakes will provide the bird's
                        eye surveillance.

           -- In the sky, a giant mechanical dragonfly hovers.  WHIRRING
           motors and the THROBBING BUZZ of beating translucent wings.  
           -- The PILOT sits in a cramped, open-air cockpit in the
           abdomen of the insect.  Behind him sits a GUNNER, scrutinizing
           the rooftops through the long scope of a Gatling gun.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And finally, my plain clothes officers
                        will be our unseen hand - 

           -- On a dark street corner outside Madame Mab's stands a
           figure in a long trenchcoat, collar turned up.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        - reaching into those dark corners
                        were no one else can reach.

           -- The figure turns, looking around, revealing himself to be
           Philostrate.  He crosses the street towards Madame Mab's.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAB (LOBBY) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate moves down the hall to Tourmaline's room.  Her
           door closed and locked.  He hears MUFFLED MOANS of ecstasy.

           Philostrate backs away from the door.

           The MOANS become girlish SQUEALS of delight, shuddering as
           if in a vain attempt to be held back.

           Philostrate grits his teeth, tries not to listen.

           The tittering SQUEALS become relentless SCREAMS of pleasure. 
           The rhythmic POUNDING of the headboard against the wall.

           Philostrate slams his fist into the wall.  The door across
           the hall opens.  A DAINTY FAERIE peers out into the hallway.

                                 DAINTY
                        Aw, if your girl's busy, squire, I
                        can fill in.  I guess you'd be the
                        one doin' the fillin' in, though.

           She smiles, giggling at her pun.  Philostrate glares at her.

                                 DAINTY (CONT'D)
                        No?  Fine then.  You just keep your
                        trousers on and behave yourself until
                        she's finished, alright?

           She shuts her door.

           From Tourmaline's room emerges a swarthy man, BARABBAS,
           braided beard, tangled dreads.  He fastens his trousers.  

           Barabbas winks at Philostrate and pushes past.
           INT. TOURMALINE'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           Tourmaline pulls on a delicate slip as Philostrate steps
           into the doorway.  She turns and smiles.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Oh, Philo.  I didn't expect to see
                        you so early, love.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Well I was in the neighborhood, what
                        with the hunt for the serial killer.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Yes.  Ugly business - all that.

           She goes to him and wraps her arms tightly around him.  He
           dismissively pats her on the back and pulls away.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Speaking of ugly business... I don't
                        suppose that surly chap was just
                        digging for pirate's gold in here.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        I know...  I'm so sorry, love.  I
                        never intended for you to cross paths -
                        He was just a client.  Completely
                        harmless.  Safe as houses.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        He looked rather like a wanted poster
                        waiting to happen.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        He's one of my regulars.  All bark
                        and no bite, I swear.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Come now, a good half of that bark
                        was yours.

                                 TOURMALINE
                        Philo stop.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Is he always that much fun?

                                 TOURMALINE
                        We've talked about this.  It's all
                        acting, love.  Smoke and mirrors.

           She reassuringly kisses Philostrate on the neck and whispers.

                                 TOURMALINE (CONT'D)
                        You get the real thing.
           Philostrate pushes her away, a little too hard.

                                 TOURMALINE (CONT'D)
                        Would you have me starve?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Right, one has got to make a living. 
                        May as well have your giggles while
                        your at it. 

                                 TOURMALINE
                        You could take me from this place.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Is this about money?  The minute
                        money comes up -

                                 TOURMALINE
                        The clock strikes midnight and I
                        turn back into a whore.  But I'm not
                        talking about money.  I'm talking
                        about you.  You're a shameful coward! 
                        We could be together if you weren't
                        so worried about what all your mates
                        would say if they saw you with a
                        pixie.

           Philostrate clenches his jaw and takes a deep breath. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        It's midnight.

           He pulls out a wad of bills, and tosses them at her feet.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Take a sodding bow.

           He storms out and slams the door.

           EXT. FAERIE QUARTER, CARNIVAL ROW -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate walks down the cobblestone sidewalk, hands stuffed
           in his pockets, head down.  He passes

           AN ALLEY 

           where he hears CHUCKLING.  

           He turns and sees Barabbas behind some crates facing the
           wall, pissing.  He sees Philostrate and smirks.

                                 BARABBAS
                        Was she good for ya, guv?

           Philostrate just glares.
                                 BARABBAS (CONT'D)
                        Wild little thing.  Like stickin'
                        your meat in a pail of greasy ferrets. 
                        Money well spent, don't you think?   
                        They're not people, you know?  Just
                        animals, mate.  I suppose that makes
                        me something of a pervert.  No matter. 
                        I just like the way they scream.

           Barabbas finishes and pulls his trousers up.

                                 BARABBAS (CONT'D)
                        You got something to say to me, mate?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I've read sleeping with faerie sluts
                        can be bad for one's health.

                                 BARABBAS
                        You're a priest, aren't you?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Not really, no. 

           Philostrate walks calmly up to Barabbas and clocks him in
           the jaw.  Barabbas reels back.  He wipes blood from his lip.

                                 BARABBAS
                        Bloody hell...

           He makes like he's going to punch Philostrate back, but
           Philostrate is too quick.  

           In the blink of an eye, Philostrate twists Barabbas's arm
           and shoves him on the ground.  Philostrate stands on the
           man's back with one foot.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Don't you ever go back there, do you
                        hear me?  Never!

                                 BARABBAS
                        Sod off!  I go where I want!

           Philostrate grabs the Barabbas's long braids, pulls his head
           back, and slams his face into the cobblestones with a loud
           wet CRUNCH.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Now.  I want to hear it.

           Barabbas weakly spits blood and tooth fragments.

                                 BARABBAS
                        I won't, you loon.  Leave me alone...
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Get out of here.

           Barabbas stumbles to his feet.  He scrambles off down the
           alley.  Philostrate's angry eyes soften to slight remorse.

           EXT. FINISTERE CROSSING -- LATER

           Philostrate weaves between carriages as he crosses the busy
           intersection in the human area of town.  He enters a tall,
           chateau-style apartment building.

           INT. PHILOSTRATE'S FLAT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate doesn't turn on the lights as he enters.  He
           moves through ghostly pools of gaslight from the city outside.

           In the kitchen, he grabs a dusty bottle of wine from a rack. 
           He pops the cork and takes a gulp.

           He hears a melodious WARBLING.  He goes to a wrought-iron
           birdcage next to the window where a large song-moth works
           its elegant black and purple wings and twitters peacefully.

           Philostrate fills the creature's water dish with a bit of
           wine from the bottle.  The song-moth eagerly laps it up.

           In the den, Philostrate pulls a wide black disk from a paper
           sleeve.  He gently puts the disk on a spinning turntable and
           sets the stylus in the groove. 

           He sits in the dark, perched on the edge of his chair, as a
           lush faerie opera - La Crimioara - crackles from a brass
           horn.  

           He listens intensely as a lonely mezzo-soprano trickles
           through the weeping violins.

           He looks down at the wine bottle in his hand.  He fiddles
           with the label and slowly peels it off.  He crumples the
           wine label in his hand and tosses it in the corner.

           As the music crescendos, he stands and goes to the kitchen. 
           He opens the window.  He slides the latch and opens the tiny
           door of the birdcage.  The song-moth hops to the threshold.

           Philostrate watches as the song-moth flutters into the night
           while the sounds of a somber aria in a lilting ancient faerie
           tongue fill the flat.

           INT. CENTRAL OPS (HALLWAY) -- MORNING

           The usually tidy Philostrate ambles past bustling constables
           and officers.  He wears the same rumpled clothes from the
           previous night.  His deep eyes grim and listless.

           A shrill POLICE KLAXON sounds.  A YOUNG CONSTABLE runs past.  
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Constable!  What is it?

                                 YOUNG CONSTABLE
                        Another murder, sir.  At number 16
                        Carnival Row.  Madame Mab's.

           The Constable continues away, leaving Philostrate paralyzed.

           INT. LE CHAMBRE DE MADAME MAB -- LATER

           Philostrate floats down the

           SECOND STORY HALLWAY 

           in horrified disbelief.  He weaves between CONSTABLES taking
           statements from sobbing FAERIE MADAMES.

           His eyes fix on Tourmaline's open door, where sporadic flashes
           of light from a camera throw long ominous shadows across the
           dark hallway.  He moves slowly towards the door.

           He hears voices from inside.

                                 PHOEBOTROPIST (O.S.)
                        ...Species: Faerie.  Wings sawed off
                        at the meta-scapula.  Completely
                        drained of blood via two puncture
                        wounds in the neck...

           He stops just outside the doorway and closes his eyes.

           Finally he opens them and steps into

           TOURMALINE'S ROOM

           where he sees Sergeant Bottom and Magistrate Flute talking
           in the corner.  The PHOEBOTROPIST moves skittishly, taking
           pictures of something on the floor obscured by the bed.

                                 FLUTE
                        Ah, Inspector.  Jack's getting a
                        little more courageous.  Not just
                        street faeries anymore.

           Dimly aware, he makes his way around the bed.  He follows a
           trail of wet faerie blood smeared across the hardwood floor.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        We're taking this one to the morgue. 
                        The Haruspex can read her there.  I
                        think we're making the locals nervous.

           A breeze from the window ripples the gauze drapes covering
           the body.  Philostrate stops in his tracks.  Scraps of paper,
           sketches and paintings dance at his feet.
                                 BOTTOM
                        Don't think that gets you off the
                        hook with the paperwork, mate.  I'm
                        not doing all this bilge on my own.

           The drapes fall, revealing...  Tourmaline.  Pale skin still
           faintly glittering with a hollow shadow of life.  Philostrate
           averts his eyes.

           The wind tosses a wad of bills over his boots.  Philostrate
           shuts his mouth tight and swallows hard.

           Flute scrutinizes Philostrate, concerned.

                                 FLUTE
                        Inspector?  What are you thinking?

           A flash from the Phoebotropist's camera.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        Are you alright?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Yes.  Yes, I'm quite alright.

           Philostrate slowly backs away from the body.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Let me know what you find. 

                                 BOTTOM
                        Whoa!  Where you going?  I told you,
                        you are not leaving the boring bits
                        to me, Inspector.  I won't have it.

           Philostrate ignores Bottom and goes out into the hall followed
           closely by Flute.

                                 FLUTE
                        Inspector...

           Philostrate keeps walking. 

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        What's going on with you?

           EXT. THE FIDDLIN' COCKATRICE -- NIGHT

           Philostrate approaches a door.  A mechanical EYE on the wall
           begins to CRACKLE with electricity.  The Eye opens.  WHISTLES
           and TICKS of internal mechanics.

                                 EYE
                        No humans allowed.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Stop puddlin' about and let me in.
                                 EYE
                        Right off, inspector.

           The door swings open, and Philostrate walks in.

           INT. THE FIDDLIN' COCKATRICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Hazy gaslight.  A bar.  Shelves of dusty bottles.  Low tables
           with oriental pillows instead of chairs.  On each table, a
           bulbous assembly of glass globes atop a gas burner.

           The few patrons watch Philostrate suspiciously.  An ELF twirls
           a cane.  A DWARF shifts in his seat.  The BARTENDER whispers
           to the big boss man -

           - KASMIR, a rakshasa (an Eastern vampire).  He has the face
           of a tiger, blue skin, narrow yellow eyes.  He strokes his
           fu manchu of braided whiskers as he puffs a pipe.  

           He draws up his silken oriental robe and gracefully strolls
           over to Philostrate, trying to remain discreet.

                                 KASMIR
                        You make my clientele nervous.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You're a vampire, aren't you Kasmir?

                                 KASMIR
                        I'm a rakshasa.  Not exactly the -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You suck blood.

                                 KASMIR
                        That's right...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where were you last night? 

                                 KASMIR
                        What are you getting at?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Tourmaline's dead.  Jack got her. 
                        She was completely dry of blood.  So
                        I'm asking - Where were you last
                        night?

                                 KASMIR
                        My friend.  I'm a rare breed of
                        vampire, yes, but faerie blood is
                        still poisonous to me.  But you know
                        that.  I don't think this is why
                        you're here.  Can I get you anything? 
                        A stiff bottle of Mabsynthe perhaps?
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I'm off that rubbish.

                                 KASMIR
                        Now, now.  It's not all rubbish. 
                        Memories of things lost made real
                        again.  Unbroken dreams.  I think I
                        know why you came here.  Even if you
                        don't. 

           Kasmir turns and checks the faded labels on the bell jars
           and bottles, squinting his yellow cat-eyes in concentration.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        Liqueur of Barbary Lamb, Will o'
                        Whisps Cocktail...ah, here we are.

           He selects the proper bottle and sets it in front of
           Philostrate who stares at the iridescent green syrup inside.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        Keep your guilders.  Compliments of
                        the management.

           Philostrate takes the bottle to a table.  He sits on a pillow
           and uncorks it.  He pours the green treacle into the glass
           globe assembly and screws the lid on.  

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        Catch this Unseelie Jack, won't you? 
                        Business just hasn't been the same
                        in any of my establishments.

           Philostrate ignores him, screws a rubber hose to the globe,
           and lights the burner.  A bright flash.  The Mabsynthe
           ignites.  Green flames lick the oily surface of the liquid.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        This is usually where people come to
                        forget their fears.

           The globe fills with a thick green vapor.  Philostrate takes
           the pipe at the end of the hose and inhales.  He holds it
           in, shuts his eyes, and exhales.

           BEGIN MONTAGE -- PHILOSTRATE'S HALLUCINATIONS

           A barrage of quick visions, all in an eerie green glow.

           -- A black egg cracks open.  A writhing grub slides out.  

           -- Faerie wings pinned to a giant board.  A young wingless
           faerie stands nude, her back to us.  Blood trickles down her
           spine.  She points to the board where a pair of wings flutter.

           -- The grub swells and hardens into a cocoon.  It glows with
           the faint outline of a human skeleton, inside.
           -- Kasmir grins with glistening fangs and wild yellow eyes. 
           His face dissolves to the Haruspex's face, old skin cracked
           and wrinkled, the blackness of her glasses. 

           -- The cocoon opens to a huddled toddler faerie.  Her crinkled
           wings begin to dry as she ages, maturing into a shapely form
           with curls of blonde hair.  She becomes Tourmaline.

           -- A vortex of newspapers caught in a breeze swirl and combine
           themselves into a mysterious figure in a long coat.  

           -- The huddled Tourmaline's wings turn black, then her whole
           body.  She breaks up into ash on the wind.

           BACK TO SCENE

           OUTSIDE THE FIDDLIN' COCKATRICE

           Philostrate stumbles.  He shuts the door behind him, clumsily
           dropping the empty bottle.  It shatters on the sidewalk. 

           EXT. FAERIE QUARTER STREET -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Philostrate walks alone.  His hollow FOOTFALLS sound through
           the deserted Faerie Quarter.  Suddenly, he becomes dizzy. 
           He braces himself against a wall and vomits into a gutter.

           A SCREAM issues from an alley.  Philostrate listens.  Another
           MUFFLED SCREAM.  Philostrate runs down the alley towards

           THE CLOSE

           at the end.  Philostrate stops.  In the center, a DARK FIGURE
           capers over a squirming young faerie, VIGNETTE.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Hey!

           The Dark Figure looks up, its face in shadows.  It hisses
           and backs away.  Philostrate runs to check on the faerie.

           Younger than Tourmaline.  Short dark hair, matted with sweat. 
           Her wings severed.  Glittering blood trickles from her neck. 
           Her eyes, weak and pained.

                                 VIGNETTE
                         (desperate whisper)
                        Help me...I can't feel my wings...

           Philostrate turns to glimpse a long billowing cloak slithering
           from shadow to shadow as if one with its wearer.

           Philostrate pulls a flintlock revolver from inside his coat. 
           He fires into the darkness.  The shape slinks quickly into
           the night.
           The wingless faerie, shivering on the ground, looks to
           Philostrate.  Her brittle voice cracks.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        I don't feel so good. 

           Philostrate wraps his coat around her and carries her out of
           the alley.

                                                          TO BLACK:

                        it, Magistrate.  Not one suspect has
                        been taken into custody.

                                 FLUTE
                        We have no leads.

                                 MAYOR
                        Finding killers in this city isn't
                        the hardest of things, Magistrate.  

                                 FLUTE
                        But finding one, sir-  If we arrested
                        everyone in the Quarter, the clink
                        would be full to the brim and Unseelie
                        Jack could very well not be among
                        the lot.  We can't trade fear of the
                        killer for fear of the police.  They
                        need to know they're safe.

                                 MAYOR
                        Feeling safe is more important than
                        actually being safe.  Security is an
                        illusion, Magistrate.  How many
                        faeries disappear any given night? 
                        How many bodies are floating face
                        down in the harbor?  The only reason
                        this time is any different is because
                        the papers have given him a name.  I
                        want someone in custody within the
                        next twenty four hours.  Do what you
                        must.  If I have to bring in my
                        Imperial Guardsmen to oversee this...

           Flute looks up, shaken by mention of the Guardsmen.

                                 FLUTE
                        In 24 hours, we'll have your man. 

           INT. MORGUE -- LATER

           Flute pushes open a set of doors followed by the Haruspex.  
           The MORTICIAN stands by a row of steel cabinets, an open
           cabinet and sliding examining tray before him.  Tourmaline's
           corpse lies on the tray, a sheet pulled up to her shoulders.

                                 FLUTE
                        Is everything ready?

                                 MORTICIAN
                        She's clean for the reading, sir. 
                        No one's touched her since the murder.

           The Haruspex places her hand on Tourmaline's forehead.  The
           veins in the Haruspex's hand turn black as they swell under
           her papery skin.  She takes a deep breath.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        A great pain clings to this corpse...

           THE HARUSPEX'S VISION

           Tourmaline's room.  The image rippling and distorted as if a
           reflection on the surface of a pond.  Tourmaline sobs and
           yells at someone, their face obscured.

           A wad of money lands at Tourmaline's feet.  She falls to her
           knees, devastated.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        A wad of money on the floor of her
                        room should yield fingerprints.

           Suddenly, Sergeant Bottom bursts into the Morgue, frantic.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Magistrate, I was just speaking with
                        eyewitnesses from Madame Mab's -

           The Magistrate cuts him off with a gesture. 

           THE HARUSPEX'S VISION

           The image pulsates and throbs.  A shadow falls over Tourmaline
           still crying.  She looks up and screams.  She scrambles back
           towards the window, wings fluttering desperately.

           She tries to take flight out the open window.  A hand tears
           the delicate wings from her body.  The hand drags Tourmaline
           squirming across the floor leaving a slick wet trail of blood.

           The hand grabs Tourmaline's head and pushes it back exposing
           her slender tense neck.  Her jugular vein throbs.
           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Feeds on her blood, it does.  All of
                        it.  It sucks her dry.

                                 FLUTE
                        We must have description.  What can
                        you tell us about anyone that may
                        have been in the room?

           THE HARUSPEX'S VISION

           The action rewinds in waves and swells...

           Back to the quarrel.  Back to Tourmaline sobbing on the floor. 
           A figure stands over her, his face obscured.  The figure
           turns.  Time freezes.

           The rippling image gradually calms.  The face becomes clear.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Inspector Philostrate.  He's the
                        source of her pain.

                                 FLUTE
                        Impossible.  The Inspector must have
                        accidentally contaminated the body
                        at the investigation.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Sir.  I just spoke with the pix from
                        across the hall.  Philostrate was
                        there right before the murder.  Angry.

                                 FLUTE
                        Get him down here right now.

                                 BOTTOM
                        He didn't come in this morning.

           BEGIN MONTAGE -- PHILOSTRATE CLEANS VIGNETTE

           -- Philostrate turns on a faucet, filling the cast iron tub.

           -- Philostrate lowers Vignette's unconscious body in.

           -- He leans her over and tenderly squeezes a sponge over her
           back washing off caked blood and grime.  Fresh blood still
           trickles from the ragged tears where her wings once were.

           -- Silken faerie blood spreads in the steaming water.

           -- Philostrate gingerly tilts Vignette's head to the side
           and gently sponges the deep holes in her neck.
           -- Philostrate opens a bottle of alcohol, soaks some cotton,
           then gently dabs the wounds in Vignette's back and neck.

           -- He tears bandages.  He wraps a short one around Vignette's
           neck.  He wraps one over the gashes in her back, around her
           the front of her torso, covering her breasts.

           END MONTAGE

           INT. PHILOSTRATE'S FLAT -- MORNING

           Philostrate stands by the window, looking down at the street. 
           He turns to his bed.  

           Vignette lies there, asleep, soft, clean.  A distant, recorded
           voice sings the aria from La Crimioara.

           She begins to stir, squinting at the unfamiliar room.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Good morning.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Where am I?  Who are you?  You...
                         (she remembers)
                        You saved me from...  What happened?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Unseelie Jack.

           Vignette looks under the sheets,

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm naked.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        So it would seem.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What did you do to me?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Cleaned you up, dressed your wounds.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I see.  And you couldn't just take
                        me to a hospital...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        One of those squalid faerie hospitals? 
                        You'd be better off left to Jack.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Where are my clothes?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I threw them out.
           Vignette gives him an annoyed look.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        They were soaked in blood.  If you're
                        so attached, I can fish them out -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What the sod am I supposed to wear?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I wasn't expecting you awake so soon.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Yes, well I'm just a little powder
                        keg of surprises, aren't I? 

           She throws the sheets off.  She stands up, stumbling, still
           a little dizzy from the blood loss.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Your closet?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        To your left.

           She takes a crisp white button up shirt, far too big for
           her.  She pulls it on.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                         (dry, exaggerating)
                        You lost about ten gallons of blood,
                        back there.  Can I get you an
                        antibiotic?  Maybe a glass of water?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Not bloody likely.  

           She takes a pair of black suit pants and pulls them on.  She
           looks down at the legs.  Too long.  She reaches down.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        I make a point not to stay put too
                        long, especially when I don't know
                        where I am.

           Philostrate turns to see what she is doing.  She grabs the
           trouser leg at the ankle and tears it.  

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Oh right, you can just go ahead and
                        tear those up.

           Vignette pauses and looks up from tearing the first leg. 
           She looks back down and resumes tearing the second leg.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Now that I'm earthbound, we can't
                        have me tripping over my trouser
                        legs the rest of my life, can we?

           She goes to Philostrate's front door.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for all you've done, but -

           Her pointed ear twitches.  She hears something.  The
           stealthful COCK OF A GUN.  She looks through the peephole.

           On the other side of the door, several ARMOURED CONSTABLES. 
           The front Armoured Constable holds up his hand and counts
           down silently with his fingers.  

           Vignette turns to Philostrate.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                         (confused)
                        The police...

           Philostrate looks out the window.

           The street below, crowded with a waiting convoy of sleek
           black police carriages.

           The sudden DEAFENING THUD of a battering ram against
           Philostrate's front door.

           Startled, Philostrate and Vignette both snap around.

           A second THUD.

           On the third IMPACT, the door splinters to pieces.  The
           Armoured Constables pour into and fan out.  Their flintlock
           rifles and muskets poised.  

           Sergeant Bottom steps in behind them and surveys the scene. 
           Other than the police, the room is empty.

                                 SQUAD COMMANDER
                        He's not here, sir.

           Bottom pokes his rifle in a dustbin and pulls something out
           on the end of his bayonet.  A wad of bloody clothes.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Not looking good for you, Inspector.

                                 ARMOURED CONSTABLE (O.S.)
                        Sir, look at this.

           Bottom goes into

           THE BATHROOM
           where he sees Philostrate's cast iron tub full of water,
           dark and murky, a film of faerie blood on the surface.

                                 BOTTOM
                        You think you know a bloke, then you
                        find a tub of pix blood in his loo.

           The Squad Leader comes in.

                                 SQUAD COMMANDER
                        We've searched the whole flat.  No
                        sign of him.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Alright mates, if he gets here and
                        sees a convoy of police coaches,
                        he's not ever comin' back.  We're
                        going to have to play this covert. 
                        We need to nab this guy before he
                        even knows he's guilty.  There is a
                        killer on the loose and the bad news
                        is he knows all our tricks.  So let's
                        make ourselves invisible.

           Everyone leaves.  Bottom hangs behind, staring at the faerie
           blood in the tub, mesmerized by the swirling colors dancing
           on the surface.  He reaches down and dips his gloved hand

           UNDER WATER

           where Philostrate and Vignette lie, desperately holding their
           breath.  They look up at Bottom's distorted image as his
           hand breaks the surface, reaching towards them.

           His hand comes mere centimeters away from Vignette's stomach. 
           She sucks in.  A bubble escapes from her mouth, while on

           THE SURFACE

           above, Bottom slowly pulls his hand out.  The colorful viscous
           clings to his fingers.  

           UNDER WATER

           the bubble slowly drifts up towards 

           THE SURFACE

           as Bottom curiously examines the syrupy blood/water solution
           thickening on his glove.  He makes a sour face.  He turns to
           wipe his hand on a towel.

           The bubble breaks the surface and pops, unseen.

           He leaves the bathroom.

           UNDER WATER
           Philostrate and Vignette listen.  The muffled sound of a
           DOOR SLAM.  Silence.  Seconds later

           ON THE SURFACE

           they both burst through, gasping for air.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What in the name of Saint Tit?!?

           Philostrate gets out of the tub and rushes to the window. 
           He opens it.  Vignette looks after him incredulously.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Why are the police are after you?

           Philostrate paces, searching his mind for a way out.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I don't know.  Tax evasion.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Right.

           He opens a drawer and withdraws a pistol.  He loads it.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        What?  You're going to shoot your
                        way out.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        If need be...

           Vignette hurries to the window and looks out.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        There's a fire escape about five
                        meters over.  If you'll follow me -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No.  You want no part of this.  You're
                        going to walk out of here and go
                        home.  Forget you ever met me.

           Philostrate holsters the gun.  Vignette grabs his wrist.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You saved my life.  I don't like
                        having unpaid debts, especially with
                        grotty humans.  So follow me, savvy?

           She climbs out the window.  Philostrate follows.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS -- LATER

           Philostrate and Vignette walk a rusty train bridge over the
           river.  Philostrate leads.  Vignette follows silently.
           She watches Philostrate.  His long coat billows in the wind. 
           She glimpses his gun holster. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You're a constable...  Standard issue
                        revolver.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Detective Inspector actually...
                        Rycroft Philostrate.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        My name's Vignette.  Why are they
                        after one of their own?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I suspect they think I'm Jack.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Why would they think that?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Wrong place, wrong time.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Twaddle.  I can just go tell them -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        They won't believe you.  You're -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm what?  A common street faerie?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        That's what they'll see. 

           Silence.  Vignette wonders aloud.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Why did you -  What do you care if
                        there's one less street faerie?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        A faerie's scream sounds just like a
                        human's, right?  

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Fair enough.  Where are you going?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Madame Mab's.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You'll be caught in an instant.  I
                        know a better way.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You really don't owe me a thing. 
                        And anyway I don't need your charity.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I know nooks and shortcuts in the
                        Quarter that they don't put on your
                        maps.  Which is why if you follow
                        me, the police won't find you.  So I
                        think you do need my charity.

           INT. TOURMALINE'S ROOM -- LATER

           A hand grabs the window sill.  Philostrate climbs up and
           into the room followed by Vignette, close behind.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I suppose no more daintily fluttering
                        in...  

           She stands and dusts herself off.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        This is the last crime scene?  Don't
                        you think the police would have
                        already taken anything important?

           No response from Philostrate.  He goes to the bed.  Vignette
           notices the easel and sketches on the floor around.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Was she some sort of painter?

           Philostrate runs his hand along the unmade sheets.  He frowns.

           Vignette starts to rifle through the drawings.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, some of these aren't bad.

           Philostrate takes the pillow in his hands.  He cradles it
           gingerly, his jaw clenched.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        I think I've seen these.  This one
                        looks like a poster at the Orpheum.

           Vignette comes to the sketch of Philostrate putting on his
           shirt in the morning.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Hey, this looks kind of like -  Wait. 
                        You and she were... 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I was a client.  That's all.  Let's
                        get out of here.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Hold on...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        There's nothing here!  Let's go!

           Vignette watches Philostrate go back to the window.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        We'd better stick to the roofs.

           EXT. FAERIE QUARTER ROOFS -- DAY

           Philostrate and Vignette scale the side of a steep roof. 
           Using the shingles as footholds.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        So did you love her?

           Philostrate ignores her.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Not going to tell me, eh?

           Philostrate walks a set of planks to the adjacent roof.  

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        This aloof thing you've got is really
                        quite boring.

           Philostrate quickly turns.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You are insufferable!

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm insufferable?!?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Yes!  These incessant questions! 
                        Babble babble babble!

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Oh, and you're so mysterious and
                        tortured.  How do the girls keep
                        their knickers on around you?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Child!

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Tragedian!

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Why are you even still here?
                                 VIGNETTE
                        I felt sorry for you.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I'm fine without your pity, thanks.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What's that?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What's pity?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        No...  That noise...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What -

           He hears it, a FAINT BUZZ.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Drakes...

           Suddenly, a giant mechanical dragonfly (a Drake), hovers 
           over the roof, wings beating furiously.  The PILOT in the
           abdomen/cockpit glares at Philostrate.  The GUNNER on top
           swings a turret-mounted Gatling gun around.

           The pilot speaks into a brass horn.  His amplified voice
           booms over the raucous sounds of the vehicle.

                                 PILOT
                        Rycroft Philostrate.  You are
                        instructed to surrender to the
                        Metropolitan Constabulary.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (to Vignette)
                        Run.

           He grabs her hand.  They make a run for it.

           The Gatling gun explodes to life, shattering slate shingles
           at their feet.  They make it to the edge of the roof, and
           leap over the alley to the next roof.  The Drake pursues.

           The gun punches fist-sized holes in the chimney next to them.

           They clamor over the rooftops, slipping on shingles, weaving
           between chimneys, jumping narrow alleys.  But the drake stays
           on their tail, spitting a steady stream of deadly shells.

           They come to another ledge, too wide to jump, and slide to a
           stop.  Pebbles fall to the alley bellow.

           The Drake comes up behind.  It doesn't fire.  Out of bullets. 
           The Gunner starts to load another magazine.
           Vignette looks down.  She steps forward and breaths deep.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Follow my lead.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You do remember you can't fly?

           She jumps.  Halfway down, she grabs a clothesline.  She
           shimmies over and drops to an awning.  She slides down the
           awning and lands on a pile of crates.  

           The Gunner finishes loading the Gatling gun.  Just as he
           takes aim on Philostrate's back, he jumps.

           Philostrate copies all of Vignette's maneuvers to end up in

           THE ALLEY 

           where he hits the ground running.  Vignette, already at the
           end, motions Philostrate to follow her around a corner into  

           A CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS

           out of the Drake's view.

           Philostrate huddles between the wall and Vignette, awkwardly
           close.  They wait for the Drake to pass by.  Both of them
           painfully self-conscious of this moment of forced proximity.

           She looks up.  Their eyes meet.  She gently brushes the hair
           off his forehead, then quickly withdraws her hand and lowers
           her eyes.  Slowly, she lets her head fall against his chest. 

           After a few moments, the Drake finally leaves.

           Philostrate and Vignette climb out of the crevice.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I need to talk to someone who knows
                        what goes on in the Quarter.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You know that you're not with the
                        police anymore?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Good.  That should make it easier.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I may know someone.

           They both run down the alley, Vignette leading the way. 
                                 BOTTOM  (V.O.)
                        The bloke's got a tub full of pix
                        blood in his flat and now he's runnin'
                        around with wingless faeries...

           INT. METROPOLITAN CONSTABULARY (BRIEFING ROOM) -- AFTERNOON

           Flute talks to Bottom over a large table with a map of the
           city sprawled across it.  The room buzzes with activity.

                                 FLUTE
                        Philostrate always seemed so above
                        board.  

                                 BOTTOM
                        This is the only lead we've got to
                        work with.

                                 FLUTE
                        Maybe.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Sir, I'd like Philo to be innocent. 
                        I truly would.  But if he's got
                        nothing to hide, why's he runnin'?

                                 FLUTE
                        Have the other Drakes spotted him?

                                 BOTTOM
                        No, sir.  But he hasn't left the
                        Quarter.  We've got it blocked off. 

           EXT. OLD FAERIE CEMETERY -- SAME

           Philostrate and Vignette negotiate a winding path through a
           cramped maze of crooked headstones.

           They come to a modest stone sepulchre with a leaning
           foundation, half sunken into the soft earth.

           Vignette unlocks the heavy iron door with her own key.  She
           pushes it open with a LOUD GRIND from rusty hinges.

           INT. SEPULCHRE -- CONTINUOUS

           The strange old bones of faeries scattered amidst dust and
           cobwebs.  Vignette slides the lid of a sarcophagus open and
           steps inside.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Come on.

           The floor of the sarcophagus has been replaced by a set of
           stone stairs leading further down.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What is this place?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        The Old Faerie Cemetery?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No, I mean -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Ever heard of The Screaming Banshee?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The anti-human paper?  The police
                        have a whole branch looking for the
                        print office.

           Vignette reaches the bottom and comes to a door. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Well, A - it's pro-faerie, and B -

           She opens the door.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        - Here it is.

           Spread out before them,

           THE SCREAMING BANSHEE PRINTING OFFICE

           a subterranean vault.  Candles cast flickering shadows on
           giant corkscrew printing presses.  Sounds of DRIPPING WATER. 
           A disembodied voice, QUILL, calls out to them.

                                 QUILL (O.S.)
                        Vignette, I don't like guests.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        It's okay.  I'll vouch for him.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Who are you?

           A figure silhouetted by the candlelight deftly hops up onto
           one of the presses.  He poses with a rebellious mystique.

                                 QUILL
                        Who am I?  Who am I?

           He hops down.  A youngish man, a Puck.  Goat horns poke from
           tousled hair.  His long coat flares revealing two agile goat
           legs in place of human ones.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Quilliam G.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Moses, dissident journalist at large. 
                        But you can call me Quill, Inspector.

           He eyes Philostrate.  His voice crackles with energy.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        It's only because of Vignette that
                        I'm allowing this.  She's my best.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Your best what?

                                 VIGNETTE
                         (to Philostrate)
                        Writer.
                         (to Quill)
                        I'm not your best.  You're just hoping
                        I'll forget you owe me thirty
                        guilders.

                                 QUILL
                        It's not for profit that we write,
                        but for the glorious revelation of
                        truth to the -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Speak for yourself. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (to Vignette)
                        You're a writer?

                                 QUILL
                        A pistol, she is.  Positively
                        incendiary.  Words like acid.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I've noticed. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Listen, while you two chat, I've got
                        business to take care of.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where are you going?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'll be right back.

           Vignette heads back upstairs as Quill turns to arrange letters
           on one of the presses. 

                                 QUILL
                        Did I hear correctly just now that
                        we have something to talk about?
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Perhaps we'll start with Unseelie
                        Jack.

                                 QUILL
                        I came up with the name- Unseelie
                        Jack.  Human rags, they read me. 
                        Ripping me all the time, they are.

           He thumbs through a stack of recent issues of Quill's
           Screaming Banshee.  He reads.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        All humans aren't as bad as you say. 
                        The Mayor's wife for instance -

                                 QUILL
                        She's not savvy to the streets. 
                        It's all a hobby to her.  We're all
                        pretty music and art.  Do you see
                        anything pretty down here?  Her brand
                        of parlour activism is sickening.

           The front pages all sport grainy black and white photos of
           the three murders -

           -- Aisling Cobweb on a pebbled beach.

           -- Marguerite strung up in the station.

           -- And finally Tourmaline.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where did you get these photos?

                                 QUILL
                        I know a loose girl in the police
                        darkroom.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No...  There's no evidence markers. 
                        This is before the police arrive.

                                 QUILL
                        Before they call the police, they
                        call me.  I'm their voice.  They
                        find a body and I'm their first call. 
                        I snap my pics, and I'm gone before
                        the murder bell tolls.  I don't like
                        being a vulture, but I do like being
                        a newshawk.  So, that's how it goes...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What do you know about the murders?
                                 QUILL
                        That they've been going on for years. 
                        Mysterious disappearances.  Rumors
                        of monsters.  Now, the human media's
                        got their paws on it.  Everyone's
                        got a reason to buy the papers. 
                        Here, it's a fact of life.  It's
                        like a serialized potboiler to your
                        people.  Everyone wants to know how
                        it will end.  Fetch me a "Zed" will
                        you?  The letter bin to your right.

           Philostrate turns.  He looks in a crate full of letter
           engravings.  He pulls out a "Z" and brings it to Quill. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        And how will it end?

           Philostrate holds the letter in place.  Quill hammers it.

                                 QUILL
                        Same way all stories on Carnival Row
                        end.  Death and misery.

           Quill spins a lever, lowering the gigantic press.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Blood is the currency of these
                        streets.  Literally.  I'm sure
                        Vignette can tell you about that.  

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Why?  Where exactly did she go?

                                 QUILL
                         (realizing his slip)
                        Nowhere.  I don't know.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You do know.  Quill.  Answer me.

           Philostrate grabs him by the collar and spins him about-face.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Quill.  Where is Vignette?

                                 QUILL
                        It's one of those things that sounds
                        worse than it is.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where?
           EXT. CABARET MU GONG -- LATER

           Tucked in the maze of cobbled back alleys, Philostrate comes
           to a rickety Oriental pagoda sitting on stilts above a
           stagnant, narrow canal.  Red neon sizzles and flickers.

           INT. CABARET MU GONG -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate moves through the dancing maze of blacklight
           faerie wings and glowing tattoos.

           FIRE-EATERS, BELLYDANCERS, and level upon level of lissome
           elvish, selkie, and faerie YOUTH writhing to the hot weird
           jazz of fiddles and sitars and glistening with sweat.

           INT. BACK HALLWAY OF CABARET -- CONTINUOUS

           Vignette lies in one of the cots that line the dim corridor. 
           A dizzy look on her face, eyes rolling back.  A hand pulls a
           needle from the taut blood vessels of her inner elbow.

           A dispassionate ROUMANIAN VAMP consults the syringe full of
           blood.  He puts the syringe in his leather sack and shoves a
           wad of cash notes into Vignette’s fist before leaving.

           Philostrate barges into the back hallway.  He pulls Vignette
           up and shakes her by the shoulders.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Hey!  Wake up.  What is this?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I don't need any more rescuing, I
                        just need a little cash.  Kasmir. 
                        He pays so well for our blood.

           He steadies her lolling head and brings her eyes to meet
           his.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Stay with me.  I thought vampires
                        couldn't drink faerie blood.  

                                 VIGNETTE
                        No.  Not drink.  What do you think
                        they make Mabsynthe from?

           He lays her back on the cot and storms down the hall.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?!?

           INT. KASMIR’S CHAMBERS -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate pushes through a set of bead curtains into the
           all shining lacquer, jade, and bronze office.  Kasmir stands.
           Two KOMODOS are upon Philostrate.  Kasmir’s bodyguards, Asian
           dragon-men, broad reptilian blokes with iron scales.  Constant
           threads of sulpherous smog seep from their jaws.

                                 KASMIR
                        Men, let go of him.  Can I help you
                        with something, Inspector?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You control the Mabsynthe trade in
                        this city.  A killer’s leaching
                        faeries and it happens that your
                        Mabsynthe is brewed from faerie blood. 
                        That sound dodgy to you?

                                 KASMIR
                        Friends shouldn’t talk to each other
                        like this.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        This whole building is a vampire! 
                        It’s a damned drug factory, swilling
                        faerie blood by the lorry-load.

                                 KASMIR
                        It’s simply a club where a lot of
                        young pixies come for some amusement.

           Philostrate charges Kasmir and grabs his collar. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        If I find that you had anything to
                        do with Unseelie Jack - well - there’s
                        a ball of hot lead just aching to
                        give your brain a kiss.

                                 KASMIR
                        In that case, my friend, having
                        partaken of the fruit of this “drug
                        factory,” with such rhapsody... you
                        should remember to save the last
                        bullet for yourself.

           The two Komodos pull Philostrate off of Kasmir.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        I could have killed you.  
                         (to Komodos)
                        Beat him senseless and lob him in
                        the creek.

           The Komodos drag Philostrate out to  

           THE VERANDA

           where he catches a passing glimpse of Vignette watching him
           from behind oriental lattice.  Their eyes meet.
           Philostrate holds his gaze as one Komodo steadies him while
           the other plants a heavy iron fist across his chin.

           BLACKNESS

           EXT. ARGYLE HEIGHTS (STREET) -- NIGHT

           Foggy and quiet.  Cleaner than the Quarter.  The human part
           of town.  Gothic houses hewn from marble and limestone.

           An armoured couch emerges from the swirling fog drawn by a
           robust coal-black unicorn.  The streetlights shimmer.  The
           unicorn SNORTS a silver plume of vapor into the night air.

           INT. MAYOR'S COACH -- CONTINUOUS

           Mayor Boniface scratches his neatly trimmed goatee pensively.

                                 MAYOR
                        Faeries.  Disease-carrying vermin,
                        the lot of them.  The only reason I
                        tolerate this infestation is because
                        even vermin are part of the ecosystem
                        of a city.  It's true.
                         (a venomous chuckle)
                        That and they sure do know how to
                        please a man.
                         (looks down)
                        No no no.  Keep at it, pet...
                         (closes his eyes)
                        I'm not finished with you.

           A moment of cool ecstasy.  He rolls his eyes and exhales.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        That's it.  That a girl.  Be a dear
                        for me and swallow the goods, will
                        you?  This upholstery's worth more
                        than your annual salary.

           A callous, detached grin as the Mayor finishes.

           A young faerie girl, ROAN BLUEBELLE, sits up, her skin a
           slight turquoise tint sprinkled with light violet freckles.

           The Mayor's smile slowly turns to a disgusted scowl.  He
           slaps his hand on the side of the coach.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Driver!  Stop the couch...

           The coach stops.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Get out.
                                 ROAN
                        But...  Sir, this is Argyle Heights. 
                        I can't fly clear across the city? 
                        What about Unseelie Jack...

                                 MAYOR
                        Close your eyes.

                                 ROAN
                        Sir?

                                 MAYOR
                        I said close your rutting eyes.

           She does.  

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Open your mouth.

           Her lips crack open.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Wider.

           She opens it wide.  He pulls a gold-finished musket from his
           overcoat and shoves the barrel in her open mouth.  He cocks
           the hammer.  She opens her eyes, shocked and terrified.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Let me tell you something.  I could
                        pull this trigger right now and split
                        that soft skull of yours.  And you
                        know what?  You'd cease to exist. 
                        No police investigation.  No obituary. 
                        No body washing up in the harbour.

           Roan trembles as the Mayor leans in.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                         (whispers)
                        I can erase you from history.  So
                        you see, there are better things to
                        be afraid of than "Unseelie Jack." 
                        Do we understand each other?

           Roan slowly nods her head.  The Mayor finally pulls the musket
           out of her mouth.  He straightens his overcoat.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Now.  Kindly get out.

           EXT. ARGYLE HEIGHTS (STREET) -- CONTINUOUS

           The coach takes off down the empty streets, leaving Roan on
           the curb in front of 

           THE ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY
           where she plops herself down on the wide stone steps under
           the majestic marble columns.  Her lip trembles.  She buries
           her face in her hands and shudders.

           She looks up and wipes her eyes.  She climbs to her feet and
           shakes her head.

                                 ROAN
                         (quiet, to herself)
                        I'm not going back to the Quarter. 
                        Not tonight.

           She flaps her bright blue translucent wings, fluttering up
           the tall regal columns to

           THE ROOF OF THE MUSEUM

           where she lands daintily on the ledge.  She looks over the
           city towards the Faerie Quarter, an indistinct blur in the
           fog across the distant river.

                                 ROAN (CONT'D)
                        I'm staying here tonight.

           She clenches her fists and grits her teeth.  She shouts at
           the top of her lungs.

                                 ROAN (CONT'D)
                        I'll sleep with the humans tonight! 
                        You like that?!?  This vermin's not
                        goin' back to her hole in the wall!

           Her voice cracks and decays to a whisper.

                                 ROAN (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna dirty up your pretty
                        upholstery tonight, you prat.

           She goes and huddles up next to the skylight.  She closes
           her eyes and tries to go to sleep.

           A breeze picks up.  It HISSES at Roan.  She opens her eyes.

           On the ledge of the roof stands a cloaked Dark Figure
           silhouetted by the silver full moon.  The long tattered black
           cloak whips in the breeze.

           Roan gasps.  She scrambles back onto the skylight.

           The Dark Figure makes no move towards her.

           Roan hears something.  TINK... TINK... She looks down.  A
           web of cracks shoots across the skylight at her feet.  She
           stands perfectly still.  She looks back to the ledge.

           The Dark Figure still doesn't budge from its perch.
           Roan makes a decision.  She flaps her wings.

           Too late.  The disturbance shatters the glass at her feet
           before her wings can get enough lift.

           She tumbles down into

           THE LOBBY OF THE MUSEUM

           past the giant fossilized skeleton of the dragon hanging
           from the ceiling.

           She lands with a BONE-CRUNCHING THUD on the polished marble
           floor.  Shards of glass bounce around her.  Her wings shredded
           nearly to ribbons, useless.

           A horrid WET COUGH.  Blood trickles from her mouth.  She
           tries to sit up but winces.

           She hears a CREAK and GROANING of steel.  She looks up.

           The steel cables holding the dragon above her SNAP.

           The whole skeleton crashes to the ground.

           As the dust clears, Roan sees she's trapped under the
           cavernous rib cage.  Shafts of moonlight stream down on her,
           the only light in the lobby.

           The FLAPPING of a cloak as a shadow quickly passes over her.

           She looks up.  Nothing but the broken skylight and the silver
           disc of the moon beyond.  She hears a RASPY HISS echo in the
           lobby around her.

           She gets a vague impression of the Dark Figure circling her,
           slowly, deliberately, through the shadows.  Slithering between
           the ancient stone monoliths and fossils.  Coming closer.

                                 ROAN (CONT'D)
                        Please...  Please, don't do this...

           The Dark Figure's voice seems to come from everywhere as the
           sound bounces from wall to wall of the large dark room.

                                 DARK FIGURE
                        Tore your pretty wings, did you?

           Roan peeks between the dragon's ribs into the darkness.  She
           sees the outline of someone standing the shadows.

                                 DARK FIGURE (CONT'D)
                        Tisk.  Such pretty wings.  A shame.

           Roan's eyes adjust to the darkness as she stares intently a
           the motionless humanoid outline in front of her.  
           It resolves itself into nothing more than a stone sarcophagus
           on a pedestal, an exhibit.

           Suddenly a clawed hand grabs her torn wings from behind and
           pulls her back against the rib cage.  RIP.  Her wings are
           gone.  She opens her mouth, too stunned to make a sound.

           The hand grabs her hair and yanks her head back, exposing
           her neck.

                                 DARK FIGURE (CONT'D)
                        Now.  Sing for me.

           Roan's PIERCING SCREAM tears through the silence of the lobby.

           EXT. CANALSIDE -- MORNING

           The mire of water and refuse laps Philostrate's battered and
           bruised body.  Slowly, he comes to.  He pulls himself up. 
           He shakes off the pain and climbs the bank to the street.

           INT. SCREAMING BANSHEE PRINTING OFFICE -- SAME

           Vignette sits at a small desk punching the keys of an
           antiquated typographer.  Quill works the press.

                                 QUILL
                        How's it coming?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Fine.

           The news wire sputters on.  Quill goes to inspect the the
           strip of paper spewing from the device.

                                 QUILL
                        You seem a bit preoccupied.  What
                        happened to your human friend?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I don't know.  Who cares.  He started
                        asking the wrong people the wrong
                        questions.

                                 QUILL
                        I see.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        He's so bloody self-righteous.  And
                        a little stupid and reckless.  He's
                        like the knight in shining armour
                        that forgets to put on the armour.

                                 QUILL
                        But you don't care.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Not a bit.  Let him get himself
                        killed.

           Realizing what she's said, she stops typing.  Quill hides a
           wry, knowing grin.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Okay...  Okay...  You know something. 
                        Do you know where he is?

           Quill holds up the strip of paper from the wire.

                                 QUILL
                        I have an idea.

           EXT. ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY -- MORNING

           A large crowd of HUMAN SPECTATORS gathered at the entrance. 
           All high class - the ladies with their broad hats and parasols
           and the gentlemen with their waistcoats and top hats.

           Magistrate Flute and Sergeant Bottom push through the crowd.

                                 FLUTE
                        The Mayor's livid.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Right, the first murder this side of
                        town.  How long before Jack start's
                        pickin' off people instead of pixies?

                                 FLUTE
                        Let's try not to blurt things like
                        that out, Sergeant.

           They enter the building.  Beyond the police blockade,

           THE MUSEUM LOBBY

           buzzes with OFFICERS and MUSEUM EMPLOYEES.

                                 BOTTOM
                        The Haruspex's already here.  Don't
                        see why.  We know who did this.

           Roan's body rests in the center of the fallen dragon skeleton.

           Philostrate stands near the body, trying to remain
           inconspicuous while he surveys the scene for any clues.

           His eyes dart from the puncture wounds on Roan's neck to the
           thin splatter of blood arcing from the tears in her back
           across the marble floor.

           He notices Bottom and Flute approaching. 
           He turns as they approach and tips his hat over his eyes. 
           He takes a few steps back and casually leans against the
           opposite side of a sarcophagus, close enough to eavesdrop.

                                 FLUTE
                        You know the law, Sergeant.  A
                        Haruspex's vision is as admissible
                        as eye witness testimony.  If she
                        can give us something else... 
                        Anything else...  Well then, I'd be
                        more than happy to drop this manhunt.

           The Haruspex hobbles to the body.  Philostrate watches from
           his hiding place as the old woman drops to one knee.  She
           rests her gnarled hand on Roan's face.

           Several feet down the exhibition aisle from Philostrate,
           Professor Leopold Alcandre looks up and recognizes him.  He
           calls after Philostrate.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Inspector.

           Philostrate doesn't notice.  He watches the Haruspex go into
           a trance.  Alcandre comes up behind Philostrate.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Inspector... "Philostrate" is it?

           Alcandre goes on, oblivious to Philostrate's "wanted" status. 
           Philostrate can't hide his discomfort.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Have you seen the body, Inspector? 
                        It's incredible.  Those neck wounds. 
                        They're rather like snake bites
                        wouldn't you say?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Yes.  Yes.  Rather.

           He looks after Flute and Bottom, but they haven't noticed
           his presence.  The Haruspex holds their attention for now. 

                                 BOTTOM
                        What was she doing in this part of
                        the city? 

           Meanwhile, Alcandre chatters excitedly to Philostrate.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Almost like a Gorgon or perhaps a
                        Basilisk...  

           Philostrate looks around, searching for a way out. 

           The Haruspex shakes her head distracted.
                                 HARUSPEX
                        No.  Not right.  Something here. 
                        Right now.  Someone's mind tremblin'. 
                        Cloudin' the aether.

                                 FLUTE
                        What do you mean?

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Someone doesn't belong... 

           Philostrate interrupts Alcandre.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Professor, I really must go...

           He quickly turns his back and heads for the exit.

           Head down, the Haruspex lifts her crooked finger, making
           small circles in the air with her long fingernail.  She slowly
           swings her arm back and forth, searching the lobby.

           Almost to the exit, Philostrate's pace quickens.  Alcandre
           calls after him.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Wait!  One more thing!  Inspector
                        Philostrate!

           The lobby goes silent.  All the Officers turn at the sound
           of the name.

           The Haruspex's swiveling finger stops, pointing right at
           Philostrate.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Him... 

           Philostrate breaks into a sprint out the door.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Don't just stand there, you ponces! 
                        Get the bugger!

           EXT. ROYAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate rockets down the steps, violently shoving his
           way through the crowd of Human Spectators.

           A wave of Officers and Constables not far behind, WHISTLES
           blowing wildly.

           Philostrate runs

           DOWN THE STREET
           as fast as he can with what seems like the whole Metropolitan
           Constabulary in hot pursuit.  He weaves between affluent
           HUMAN COUPLES out for morning strolls.  He comes to

           THE ENTRANCE

           of an underground train station.  He looks down and jumps an
           entire flight of stairs, tumbling hard on the landing.

           He climbs over the handrail and drops into

           THE UNDERGROUND STATION

           where he slips into the crowd of baffled COMMUTERS just as
           his pursuers enter the station lead by Sergeant Bottom.

           Bottom stops and looks around, but can't make Philostrate
           out in the sea of bowler hats and black suits.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Spread out.  Find him.

           Philostrate reaches one of the platforms.  He jumps the
           turnstile.  He turns and makes eye contact with Bottom.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Stop!

           Bottom awkwardly maneuvers through the crowd.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Get out of my way, you rut-weasels... 

           A train pulls up.

           Bottom reaches the platform.  

           The train doors slide open.

           Philostrate runs onto the train. 

           Bottom struggles to squeeze past the turnstiles.

           The train doors slide shut just as Bottom stumbles up.

           Bottom glares helplessly at Philostrate through the window.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Oh bugger all...

           With a HISS OF STEAM, the train takes off into the tunnels.

           INT. TRAIN (PASSENGER CAR) -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate lets out a sigh of relief.
           INT. UNDERGROUND TRAIN CONTROL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

           Magistrate Flute stands over the CONTROLLER in front of a
           panel with various knobs and cranks and a large window
           overlooking the whole underground station.

           Sergeant Bottom bursts in, sweating and breathing heavily.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Primrose Tube to the Quarter...

           Flute nods to the Controller.

                                 FLUTE
                        Stop the train.

           The Controller grabs a mahogany handle and spins the metal
           crank as fast as he can.  He shouts into a brass horn.

                                 CONTROLLER
                        All stop!

           INT. TRAIN (ENGINE ROOM) -- SAME

           The soot-stained CONDUCTOR pulls his goggles back over his
           greasy hair.  He grabs a long knee-high lever and pulls back.

           EXT. TRAIN -- SAME

           The wheels lock, sparks fly as the train SCREECHES to a halt.

           INT. TRAIN (PASSENGER CAR) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate's eyes open wide with dread as he feels the car
           lurch forward and come to rest.

           The lights flicker and go dark.

           EXT. TRAIN -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate pries the sliding door open and hops out into
           the dark empty tube.

           He hears a chorus of BOOTS ON GRAVEL.  He turns.

           A line of Constables run alongside the train, brandishing
           brilliant phosphorous torches.

           Philostrate bolts into the darkness.

           The line of Constables run after him, firing their muskets
           and SHOUTING for him to stop.

           The bullets ricochet off the stone walls.

           Philostrate rounds a corner into a
           MAINTENANCE ALCOVE

           Obviously expecting it to be an escape.  Instead, he finds
           himself trapped at a dead end.

           The Constables round the corner behind him, torches flaring.

           Philostrate squints, he lifts his hand trying to shade his
           eyes.  He can't see them for the glare but he does hear the
           sound of a dozen MUSKETS COCKING.  He prepares for the worst.

           Suddenly, a voice.

                                 FLUTE
                        Hold your fire, men.

           Magistrate Flute steps forward and addresses Philostrate.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Magistrate, you know I didn't do any
                        of this.  You have to know that.

                                 FLUTE
                        You always said the truth is in the
                        facts.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Magistrate...

                                 FLUTE
                        I'm bound by the facts, Philo.  
                         (to Constables)
                        Shackle him... 

           Philostrate steps back.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        If you don't come in peacefully,
                        they'll have to shoot you.

           Philostrate backs against the wall.  His boots CLANG on a
           metal grate.

           The Constable with the irons steps forward.

           Two girlish hands reach up between the grating, unnoticed. 
           The fingers wrap tightly around the bars.

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        You really have no other choice.

           The hands pull the grate open.  Philostrate falls into the
           dark opening.  

           Flute hurries to the open grate.
                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        Damn.  Where does this drain lead?

           INT. DRAIN PIPE -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate spirals down, coasting on a slick film of water
           and algae, rapidly gaining velocity.

           INT. SEWER TUNNEL -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate slides out the end of the drain pipe and lands
           on the wet concrete floor.

           Vignette climbs out of the drain pipe.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Are you completely nutters?!?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I was looking for clues... 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Did you really think you could just
                        march up to a crime scene?  The whole
                        place crawling with constables... 
                        And last night?  What was that? 
                        Kasmir is the crime boss of the Purple
                        Triad.  This bloke keeps mirrors in
                        his torture chamber just so his
                        enemies can see themselves die. 
                        You're acting like a man with a
                        deathwish.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I will not hide while there is a
                        killer out there having a jubilee. 
                        I have everything under control.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You could have died!

           The last words hang in the air.  Vignette's eyes betray her
           concern for Philostrate.  Philostrate starts away.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I don't care.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You don't mean that.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I AM dead!  I had a life.  And I had
                        her.  I had Tourmaline.  Jack's taken
                        both.  He doesn't get to do that.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Why?  You didn't love her.
           Philostrate spins around.  He runs to Vignette and slams her
           against the wall.  Furious.  Vignette braces herself.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You have no sodding idea!

           Vignette boldly stares him down.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I think I have an idea.

           Philostrate collapses on the brink of a breakdown.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I didn't.  If I did, she would be
                        alive right now, but I didn't.

           He sucks it up and nods with resolve. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I did not love her, but I owe her.

           Vignette kneels down to face him.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm not used to hiding underground
                        either.  I had wings, you understand. 
                        Jack took something from me too.  So
                        you've got my help whether you need
                        it or not.

           INT. SEWERS -- LATER

           Philostrate and Vignette climb a metal ladder.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        They've stepped up the Drake sweeps
                        in the area.  I know a place where
                        we can wait it out.

           Vignette reaches a small hatch at the top of the ladder. 
           She stops and turns down to Philostrate.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        This is a favorite little retreat of
                        mine.  But it's a sensitive place so
                        just remember to keep quiet.  Savvy?

           Philostrate nods.

           Vignette pushes open the hatch.

           They climb the ladder into

           THE NARROW CRAWLSPACE
           crisscrossed with giant ancient timbers and thin shafts of
           light from pinprick holes and cracks in the yellowed plaster.

           The sporadic sounds of APPLAUSE.  A silence.  Then the first
           chords of the faerie opera La Crimioara.  Philostrate pauses
           at the sound.  He tries to peek through the holes. 

           Vignette whispers after him.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Philo...  Come on...

           INT. THE ORPHEUM PLAYHOUSE (PROP ATTIC) -- CONTINUOUS

           Wide and sprawling but cramped with all manner of stage props
           and set pieces: backdrops, vibrant costumes, opulent
           furniture, various weapons, stage masques, etc.

           A trap door cracks open.  Vignette pokes her head out.  She
           climbs out and looks around.  Philostrate follows.

           Philostrate enters.  He looks around, bewildered by the motley
           assortment of props.  It finally occurs to him.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The Orpheum.

           Vignette smiles and nods.  She can't hide her enthusiasm.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        This is my little cloister.  We'll
                        be safe here.

           Philostrate fixes on an old art nouveau poster of Guinevere
           Cartier for the Orpheum Playhouse.  A version of the one
           that Tourmaline was touching up back in her room.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Find anything interesting. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Tourmaline painted this. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                         (without looking up)
                        Guinevere Cartier.  The faeries'
                        sweetheart.  Everyone in the Quarter
                        either wants to have her or be her. 
                        I know I did... when I first came
                        over.

           She rifles through the costumes.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        When you came over?
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Across the sea.  From Tirnanog.  I
                        lived in Hy-Brasil, the flower city.

           She looks over the costume rack and gazes into the distance. 

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Flowers everywhere.  Growing up the
                        walls of buildings right into folks'
                        houses.  So much colour.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Why'd you leave?

           She takes a deep contemplative breath and turns with an air
           of finality back to the piles of costumes. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        It's a big world out there.  There
                        was still quite a bit I'd never seen.

           She selects an emerald green frock and sets it over an
           Oriental screen.  She goes behind the screen to change.

           Philostrate looks away, past the wallpaper of theatre posters. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        That's a nice enough answer, but you
                        and I know the real reason.  The
                        only reason any came over.  The
                        Scourge of the homeland.  The faerie
                        plague.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Please, I appreciate your sympathy. 
                        Don't talk about things you don't
                        understand.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I understand a little.  I lived there. 
                        Hy-Brasil.  The city of flowers.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What? 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        My mother and father were officers
                        with the Burguish Imperial Navy
                        stationed in Tirnanog.  I lived  in
                        the Human Concession.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You are not serious.

           She absent-mindedly finishes unbuttoning her shirt and lets
           it slide to the floor as she listens. 
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I am.  I was only a boy when the
                        Scourge broke out.  The International
                        Human forces were the first to
                        withdraw.  My parents didn't make
                        it.  An old faerie opera singer found
                        me and took it upon herself to see
                        that I made it out of the country. 
                        We were caught in a flood of refugees
                        looking for a way out.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        An opera singer?  Is that why you -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Yes.

           Vignette steps into her clean costume trousers, her brow
           furrowed as she listens.  She can hardly believe her ears. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I must have been a terrible drain on
                        her resources.  At any time, she
                        could have done better to abandon
                        me.  Just as my people had abandoned
                        hers.  Just as I abandoned...

           Philostrate stops himself.  A long pause.  Vignette looks
           over the screen to make sure Philostrate is okay.  

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        But she didn't.  Finally, there was
                        a boat - a cramped Selkie Trawler,
                        slick with fish guts.  It carried
                        about a hundred of us across the
                        North seas to a smugglers' port just
                        outside of the Burgue, where we were
                        met by the coast police.  The Burgue
                        had enough of the faerie refugees. 
                        They'd let no one off.  Except me. 
                        The human.

           Vignette watches Philostrate from over the screen.  She bends
           to grab a clean shirt from the floor, but suddenly GASPS. 
           She grabs her back, agonized.

           She shoots up quick, knocking the screen over.  The screen
           SLAMS against the floor planks with a flourish of dust.  

           Philostrate turns and finally sees her standing there in
           nothing but the emerald-green pants and the old bandage across
           her chest and back.  She winces, doubled over in pain.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        What are you doing?
                                 VIGNETTE
                        I was just changing and - Oh bloody
                        hell, my back!

           Philostrate rushes over.  He turns her around to get a good
           look at her back.  Dark bloodstains show through the bandage.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        We have to change your bandages.

           A LITTLE LATER

           Vignette sits on a short stool in front of Philostrate. 
           Philostrate cuts the bandage and slowly unwraps it.  He drops
           the soiled bandage to the floor.

           He reaches up and gingerly traces the tear-shaped gashes on
           her back.  They sparkle with crystallized faerie blood, eerily
           beautiful.  Her back muscles twitch slightly.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Sometimes it feels like they're still
                        there.  Like if I just concentrate
                        hard enough...  But it's not real. 
                        I just want to feel something...

           She looks up into his eyes.  Slowly, she reaches up and
           unbuttons the bottom of Philostrate's shirt.  She slides her
           hand across his stomach.  Philostrate closes his eyes.

           Vignette gently kisses his abs.  She moves up.  With swelling
           excitement, she feverishly unbuttons the rest of his shirt
           with her teeth.  She kisses and nips at his chest.

           Face to face, she stops.  She sees something like fear in
           Philostrate's eyes.  She starts to pull back.

           Philostrate grabs her and holds her close, pressing her bare
           chest to his own.  The skin to skin contact galvanizes them. 
           Their lips and tongues meet in a tangled deep kiss.

           Vignette hops up and wraps her legs around him.

           Philostrate spins her around and pins her against the wall. 
           Their bodies heaving, their hands roaming wildly.

           Philostrate kisses her neck.  Vignette throws her head back,
           gasping.  Philostrate notices an old poster on the wall just
           over her shoulder.  He recognizes the signature: "Tourmaline."

           He pushes himself away, staggering back.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        What...  What is it?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I can't.  I'm sorry.
           For the first time, Vignette seems awkwardly self-conscious.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Oh...  Of course.  It's alright.

           She sheepishly covers her breasts and turns away.  She notices
           the poster on the wall.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                         (whispering)
                        How callous of me...

           Philostrate sees a trickle of fresh blood sliding down her
           naked back.  He grabs a white cloak from a costume rack.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Here.  Put your arms up.

           She does.  Philostrate wraps the new bandage around her.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I think we opened that gash a little.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I suppose I'm going to have to be
                        more careful from now on.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        It'll heal.  It'll take some time
                        and there will be a fair amount of
                        scarring.  But it'll heal.

           He finishes wrapping the bandage.  Vignette gives him a soft
           sympathetic smile.

           INT. PARLIAMENT ANTECHAMBER -- AFTERNOON

           Armed GUARDS pull a set of tall doors open.  In the doorway,
           silhouetted against the gray daylight, stands a figure draped
           in flowing fabric - GUINEVERE CARTIER.

           Dame Whitley steps forward to greet her.

                                 DAME
                        Miss Cartier.  Such an honour...

                                 GUINEVERE
                        The honour is mine.

           INT. PARLIAMENT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Guinevere's silken gown at once modest and seductive clings
           and billows like liquid as she walks.  A translucent veil
           marked by silver moons and stars covers her face.

           Her wings, the same shade of brilliant purple and pink as
           the silk fabric, flex gracefully.
           Dame Whitley keeps stride next to her.

                                 DAME
                        I apologize that you must suffer my
                        husband's paranoid security before I
                        may escort you to the ballroom.

                                 GUINEVERE
                        Not at all.

                                 DAME
                        The entire Faeries's Rights Lobby is
                        here as well as many of the undecided
                        moderates in Parliament.  I can't
                        tell you what a benefit this outreach
                        will be for your people. 

           Behind them, an ASSISTANT wheels a player-harpsichord,
           polished and lacquered to a mirror shine.

                                 PHILOSTRATE  (V.O.)
                        Where are we?  We are nowhere.

           INT. ORPHEUM PLAYHOUSE (PROP ATTIC) -- SAME

           Philostrate thinks out loud.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The only individual I've met who has
                        use for faerie blood is Kasmir. 
                        Tell me about the Purple Triad.

           Vignette responds from behind the screen as she finishes
           changing.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Kasmir's narcotics ring?  They've
                        got their fingers in everything. 
                        It's really the whole underworld. 
                        But Kasmir isn't who you're looking
                        for.  He pays for blood.  It's all
                        voluntary.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Yeah, but why pay for what you can
                        take for free?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Not the Triad's style.  Besides,
                        Quill would know.  He keeps up with
                        all the underworld goings-on.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Quill would know, wouldn't he?
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Come on, now.  You don't honestly
                        think Quill has anything to do with
                        Unseelie Jack?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I can't rule anything out.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Then what about the State?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Are you saying Jack could be - what? 
                        The Mayor's insane cousin?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Or at least on the Mayor's payroll. 
                        It's well known what he thinks of
                        the Quarter.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The Mayor is a Roc's arse and a bigot,
                        but a genocidal despot?
                         (sighs)
                        Yeah, we are nowhere.  I can't go on
                        fighting this war on two fronts. 
                        Running after Unseelie Jack and
                        running from the police.  There's a
                        big picture here that I just can't
                        see from where I stand.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Hey.  Take a look at this.

           She steps from behind the screen wearing a garish green frock
           coat and vest, a ruffled silk cravat, and a scarlet bandanna.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Why is it always the strange ones I
                        get stuck with?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I don't know.  Love is blind?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Wait...

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Oh.  You know what?  I didn't mean
                        "love" like -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No, hold on.  You just gave me an
                        idea.
           INT. PARLIAMENT SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Guinevere stands at a kiosk before a crew of Guardsmen - A
           COMMODORE with a clipboard and a LEFTENANT inspecting an
           unrolled spool of music for the automatic harpsichord.

           Dame Whitley stands to the side, arms crossed impatiently.

                                 COMMODORE
                        Lift your veil, please.

           Guinevere complies.  Her dark almond eyes betraying no ill
           will.  The Commodore reaches to touch the starburst of jewels
           fixed to her pale forehead.  She flinches back for a moment.

                                 DAME
                        Come on, now.  Leave her alone. 
                        It's jewelry, not poison.

                                 GUINEVERE
                        It is my religion.  I may not remove
                        it.  I apologize.

                                 DAME
                        See, there you are.

           The Commodore makes a note in his clipboard.  The Leftenant
           opens the lid of the harpsichord to go over the insides. 

                                 COMMODORE
                        Alright, Miss Cartier, If you would
                        kindly just disrobe...

                                 DAME
                        What?

                                 COMMODORE
                        Standard security protocol.

                                 DAME
                        You are not strip-searching her!

           Unnoticed, the Leftenant covertly attaches a device - a pair
           of glass canisters - to the inside of the harpsichord.

                                 GUARD
                        All due respect, Dame, but she could
                        be hiding anything under that gown.

                                 DAME
                        She is a guest.  Now you end this
                        ridiculous posturing or I will have
                        you mopping griffin shit in the
                        stables for the rest of your days.

           The Commodore turns to Leftenant.  The Leftenant nods.  The
           Commodore turns back to Guinevere.
                                 GUARD
                        I'd say that does it.  Have a lovely
                        performance.

           The Leftenant closes the harpsichord with the device inside. 

           EXT. MIDSOMER MARKET -- MOMENTS LATER

           A street lined with canvas tents.  Display cases with beaded
           jewelry, bushels of bright tropical fruits, exotic sea
           creatures on beds of ice, roasted beasts hang from meat hooks.

           The thick crowd of shoppers (FAERIES, PUCKS, DWARVES, SELKIES,
           and many OTHERS) pulsates and flows down the street, haggling
           prices, dropping coins into scales, etc.

           Vignette weaves through the crowd.  Philostrate follows
           wearing a gentlemen's cloak, his face hidden in the shadow
           of a broad slouch hat.

                        You sure Quill can help us with the
                        plan?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Oh yes.  He lives for these sorts of
                        suicidal ideas.

           She leads Philostrate around a corner into

           AN ADJACENT ALLEY

           Philostrate notices the way Vignette's bandanna covers the
           tips of her pointed ears.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You know something?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You could almost pass for a human.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm sorry.  What?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        With your ears covered like that and
                        no...  no wings.  If you wanted, you
                        could move to the human side of town.

                                 VIGNETTE
                         (gravely offended)
                        What the bilge makes you think I
                        would want that?
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Now wait.  That didn't come out right -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Let me tell you something, you
                        arrogant part.  Those wings were
                        part of me.  How'd you feel if someone
                        lopped off your legs?

           She storms away, enraged.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Stop.  Wait.  Vignette.

           He grabs her shoulder and spins her around.

                        Look, faeries get an awful sour
                        shuffle in this city.  There's no
                        reason why you can't live with the
                        privileges afforded to humans.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        This is my bloody life you're talking
                        about!  This is my world!  I'm not a
                        rutting human.  And if you have a
                        problem with all...
                         (gesturing around her)
                        ...all this.  This whole "sour
                        shuffle..."  Then you have a problem
                        with me.  Because it's part of me. 
                        And I won't pretend otherwise.

           Vignette glares at Philostrate.  Hurt.  Her eyes shimmering
           with angry tears.

                        Come on.  Let's get out of here.

           INT. PARLIAMENT BALLROOM -- SAME

           STATE OFFICIALS in tuxedos and formal gowns finish taking
           their seats as the lights dim.

           The Mayor and Dame Whitley sit in the front row.

           Onstage, the Assistant winds the harpsichord with a starter. 
           Guinevere steps into the amber glow of the footlights.

           A sleek, gleaming brass microphone descends on wire and stops
           in front of Guinevere's mouth.  She lifts her veil.

           The Dame leans to the Mayor.

                                 DAME
                        You behave yourself.
           The Mayor smirks. 

           The harpsichord begins to play itself.  The spool of music
           feeds into the instrument.  The twittering metallic MUSIC -
           a familiar tune - the aria from La Crimioara.

           Guinevere sings the prelude in a smokey soulful voice.

           We follow the path of the scroll of sheet music as it unwinds
           itself into the harpsichord’s inner workings.  Sprockets and
           pins ride the punch holes in the paper.

           The motion translates to tiny hammers that bounce on the
           metal strings that produce the sound.  A copper trigger wire
           clamped to a single string runs to the planted device.

           Guinevere delicately holds the gleaming microphone.  She
           sings softly, with her lips pressed to the mic.

           A HARSH CHORD.  Inside the instrument, the strings vibrate,
           but the trigger remains undisturbed.  The tempo quickens.

           In the audience, the Mayor looks at his watch.  He stands up
           and moves towards the exit.  The Dame shoots him a cross
           look but remains in her seat.

           Guinevere spreads her glorious wings in - an explosion of
           colour.  She dances, flitting about the stage like something
           between a ballet dancer and a fluttering moth.

           The black and white keys undulate.  Inside, the hammers pound
           the strings in a wave of motion.  The last hammer lands
           squarely on the trigger.

           The planted device bursts to life.  Glass cylinders SQUEAL,
           their liquid contents boiling as they mix.  Rubber hoses
           spew a vile green gas into the harpsichord.

           Noxious clouds spill from the sides of the harpsichord. 
           Guinevere stops dancing.

           The audience murmurs nervously.  The Dame stands.

           As the gas overtakes Guinevere, she drops to her knees.  She
           gags and fitfully grabs the air with fingers twisted by pain. 
           Her once colourful wings blacken and wilt.

           The Dame turns and tries to outrun the spreading gas.  The
           cloud engulfs the bewildered audience behind her.

           The Dame reaches the back of the Ballroom where Guards in
           gas masks block the exits.

           She turns to see dim human shapes convulsing in the unnatural
           haze, dropping one by one.  The cloud swallows her while in

           THE LOBBY
           just outside, the Mayor watches through sealed glass.  He
           lights a cigar and blows a casual plume of smoke against the
           window as his wife grabs her chest, coughing and falls.

           The only sound in the room issues from the player-harpsichord,
           still playing that light, jazzy tune.

           INT. SCREAMING BANSHEE PRINTING OFFICE -- LATER

           Quill greets Philostrate and Vignette at the door.

                                 QUILL
                        You must have heard already.  I'm
                        just getting the news myself.  I
                        just checked the wire.  I can't
                        believe -  

           He stops, noticing their costumes.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        What in the name of Saint Tit are
                        you wearing?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What happened?

                        The Mayor's wife was assassinated. 
                        Why?  What was it the two of you
                        wanted?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        To talk to you about an idea I have.

                                 QUILL
                        Well, now, this is where it starts
                        looking bad.  They're saying it was
                        Guinevere Cartier.

           EXT. PARLIAMENT STEPS -- NIGHT

           Flute comes bounding down the stairs to meet Bottom.

                                 FLUTE
                        They're saying it was a suicide germ-
                        bomb.  That it was faerie retaliation
                        for the city-state's sluggishness to
                        end the Unseelie murders.

                                 BOTTOM
                        An insurgency faction in the Quarter? 
                        What did the Mayor say?
                                 FLUTE
                        He's shut in with his advisors.  His
                        release says the ballroom samples
                        test proof-positive for Scourge.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Pix plague.  Using their own worst
                        nightmare against us.  That's bloody
                        frightening, Magistrate.

           They pass the Parliament gates and head out into the wide
           plaza of Oberon Square.  They talk in hushed tones. 

                                 FLUTE
                        Except it wasn't Scourge.  Not a
                        naturally occurring strain.  Our lab
                        had a look at some sample spores
                        from the ballroom.  Highly virulent,
                        but not contagious.  Like it was
                        made to be self-contained.

                                 BOTTOM
                        You think the pixies cooked it up in
                        one of their drug labs?

                                 FLUTE
                        Sergeant, we have to find Philo. 
                        Fast.  The Mayor's cutting the police
                        out of the loop and I don't know
                        why.  He's handing the reigns to his
                        personal secret service.

                                 BOTTOM
                        The Inspector won't be caught by a
                        drag-net.  He knows every -

           They stop.  Flute thinks. 

                                 FLUTE
                        I know.  Sergeant, I want you and a
                        skeleton team in the Quarter tonight. 
                        We've tried being the fire.  Let's
                        be the fox.  Find him.

           Flute walks away.  Bottom calls after him. 

                                 BOTTOM
                        And what of you, sir?

                                 FLUTE
                        I'm going to the city archives to do
                        some searching of my own.
           INT. SCREAMING BANSHEE PRINTING OFFICE -- SAME

                                 QUILL
                        That's a truly mad idea, mate.  The
                        Haruspex?

           Philostrate puts on a pair of headphones. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The only person who can look into my

                                 QUILL
                        She works for the police.

           He plugs the headphones in to a telegraph key. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You sure this thing can't be traced?

                                 QUILL
                        Nothing here can.

                        She doesn't work directly under the
                        Constabulary.  They contact her
                        through the Seer's Guild.  There's a
                        special police authorization code.

                                 QUILL
                        What if you set off a red flag? 
                        Lead the police right to us.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Then we're rutted proper.  But I
                        don't think they've covered that.

           Philostrate taps out the transmission on the telegraph key.

           EXT. UNDER A RAILROAD VIADUCT -- LATER

           A CLATTERING train passes overhead, throwing strobes of light
           on the indigent shanty-town below.

           PAUPERS and TRAMPS wander aimlessly amidst the rusted iron
           pylons.  MATCHSTICK FAERIES, brittle-winged young girls,
           selling matches.  URCHIN SELKIES strung out on Mabsynthe.

           Philostrate, cloaked in the rags of a beggar, warms his hands
           at a bonfire.  Vignette, similarly disguised, sits behind
           him in the charred frame of a long-ago wrecked train engine.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        How long do you usually have to wait?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You'll be rid of me soon enough.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'm not cross with you.

                        Right.

                        My entire life I've taken care of
                        myself just fine, thank you.  I'm a
                        survivor.  And one night you had to
                        come along and save my bloody life.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I apologize?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Bugger that.  Just listen to me, you

                         (quieter)
                        I find myself thinking about you.

                        alive.  And wanting you to be happy.

           THROUGH A SPYGLASS:

           Philostrate turns to Vignette.  From

           THE WINDOW OF AN ADJACENT WAREHOUSE

           Bottom squints through a spyglass, watching.  He takes his
           eye away and passes the spyglass to a CONSTABLE next to him.

                                 CONSTABLE
                        You sure it's him?

                                 BOTTOM
                        Whoever it is used the Inspector's
                        ID code to summon the Haruspex.  So
                        we'll see. 

           The Constable takes a peak while

           BELOW

           Vignette looks away, not letting her eyes meet Philostrate's. 

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I used to like being alone.  Now I

                        It occurs to me, you'll never see me
                        as more than "another faerie..." 
                        Not your fault.  You just - You don't
                        know any better.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Vignette, listen -

           She becomes distracted and nods over Philostrate's shoulder.

           Philostrate turns to see the Haruspex hobbling towards them. 
           The Haruspex stops.  She plants her cane and lifts her chin. 

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Are you going to shoot me, Inspector?

           THROUGH A SPYGLASS:

           Philostrate steps towards the Haruspex with a pistol drawn. 
           Bottom turns from

           THE WINDOW

           and quickly pockets the spyglass as

           BELOW 

           Philostrate coaxes the Haruspex with his weapon.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        There's a coach parked under the
                        bridge.

           The Haruspex totters slowly towards the shabby coach.  Hitched
           to the front, a GREEN ROC (a tall flightless bird) shakes
           its shaggy plumage.  Quill sits in the driver's seat.

                                 QUILL
                         (whispering)
                        Let's pick it up, Philo.

           The Haruspex lifts herself into the coach.  Vignette climbs
           in behind her.

           Just as Philostrate puts his foot on the step to enter the
           coach, Sergeant Bottom bursts from the warehouse.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Hey!

           Philostrate jumps into the coach and slams the door.

           Quill whips the reigns.  The Roc breaks into a lightning
           sprint.  The coach barrels away.
           INT. COACH -- CONTINUOUS

           Philostrate keeps his gun pointed across to the Haruspex. 
           Vignette eyes Philostrate.  His eyes meet hers.

                                 QUILL (O.S.)
                        We've got company!

           Philostrate and Vignette look out

           THE BACK WINDOW

           where they see a black police carriage drawn by an armoured
           Griffin pursuing them at high speeds.

           IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

           Quill whips reigns intensely.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        No fear, mates!  Hold onto your
                        pantaloons.

           He steers the coach sharply into a

           NARROW ALLEY

           barely wide enough.  The coach kicks up sparks, grinding
           against the tight alley walls.  

           The police carriage follows, scraping the bricks.

           Quill pulls sharply on the reigns, rounding a turn on one
           wheel.

           He drives the coach straight into the crowded

           MIDSOMER MARKET

           with the police carriage in hot pursuit.

           The crowd parts, leaping out of the careening coach's path.

           The police carriage matches Quill's every move.

           INSIDE THE COACH

           Philostrate turns from the back window and yells to Quill.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        We'll never lose them, like this!

           IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT

                                 QUILL
                        We're all square, mate!
           The coach speeds towards a

           SIDE STREET

           Where an OLD MERCHANT pushes a buggy.

           Quill's coach rockets past

           The Old Merchant guides his cart out in front of the pursuing
           police carriage.

           The police carriage tries to stop.  Too fast.  The armoured
           Griffin falls.  

           The police carriage topples on it's side as it slides into
           Kasmir's cart.  Bottles of wines and spirits fall out of the
           cart and shatter on the street.

           Quill's coach speeds safely away.  Unchallenged.

           INT. CITY ARCHIVES -- LATER

           A PIPED-IN WALTZ hisses through the dank sub-basement from a
           warped speaker.  

           Towering shelves seemingly without end.  Contents relentlessly
           unorganized.  Stacks of papers bursting from twine.  Bible-
           thick water-stained files.

           Flute sits on the bottom rung of a ladder as he sifts through
           stacks of wilted records.  His eyes dart quickly over the
           faded type, searching.

           The waltz stops short.  A SHRILL TONE suddenly blares from
           the speaker.  Flute looks up.

           A dispassionate ANNOUNCER's voice cuts in.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        The following is an alert from the
                        Crisis Bulletin Service.  Stay tuned
                        for a special address from the Mayor
                        for more information.

           The SHRILL TONE resumes. 

                                 FLUTE
                        Oh, God no. 

           INT. THE MARZIPAN INN -- SAME

           A dusty haze hangs in the stagnant air.  Dimly lit, flaking
           wallpaper, crooked landscape paintings over the sheetless
           beds, mottled off-white stains on the bare mattress.

           The Haruspex sits, tied to a wooden chair in the center of
           the room.  A slight self-satisfied smile on her face.
           Vignette stands leaning against the wall, her arms crossed. 
           Quill sits on the dresser by the window.  Philostrate paces.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I suppose you know why you're here.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I can only assume you want me to
                        read you.  To prove your innocence. 
                        The curious irony is that in your
                        efforts to do so, you've become guilty
                        of kidnapping.

           She laughs.  A dry, grinding chuckle. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Did you know we were coming?

           The Haruspex's smile grows wider.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                         (to Quill)
                        How are we out there?

           Quill glances out the window.

                                 QUILL
                        We're square, mate.  Not a bobby in
                        sight.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Not for long, it would seem.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Turn on the Vox-Box.

           Philostrate nods.  Quill turns a nob on a dusty contraption
           next to him.  The word "Voxagraph" carved on it's surface.

           The brass horn on the device emits a SHRILL TONE.  Then softly
           crackling silence.  The Mayor speaks across the aether.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.)
                        My friends.  By now, you must all
                        know the unspeakable tragedy which
                        has rent our fair city.  Members of
                        Parliament and my own wife cut down
                        in a craven act of violence. 

           Quill moves to open window.  A distant THROBBING sound carries
           through the streets on the night wind.
                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        In response to this and possible
                        future threats from a growing
                        anarchist junta in the Faerie Quarter,
                        as I speak, my personal security
                        forces are on the move...

           The sound becomes clearer.  FOOTSTEPS.  MARCHING. 

           BEGIN MONTAGE

           -- Row after row of black boots on rain-slick cobblestone.

           -- Wolfish muzzles sniff the ground.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        ... With orders to detain every
                        faerie, puck, dwarf, vampire, selkie,
                        and others classified as non-human.

           -- Lead by the harnessed werewolves, the regiments of IMPERIAL
           GUARDSMEN in their fine uniforms flow into the narrow alleys
           and avenues of the quarter.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        If you fit these criteria, I encourage
                        you not to resist.  

           -- A troop of Guardsmen kick in a flimsy wooden door and
           rush into a small kitchen surprising a FAERIE MOTHER and her
           TWO DAUGHTERS at the modest dinner table.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        This detention is for your own
                        protection - from the few in your
                        midst who have today made themselves
                        enemies of order and peace -

           -- On the sidewalk, a pair of werewolves have a terrified
           SELKIE FIDDLER on the ground.  The wolves tug hungrily on
           his clothes as two Guardsman aim their weapons and shout.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Also from the murderer at large,
                        Unseelie Jack -

           -- In Le Chambre de Madame Mab, Guardsmen lead FAERIE
           PROSTITUTES through the halls in shackles.  More Guardsmen
           tear through their mattresses with bayonets.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And finally from angry humans who
                        would seize this as an opportunity
                        for vengeful retribution.

           -- In the streets, The Guardsmen hustle CREATURES OF ALL
           RACES shackled together into iron prison carriages.
           BACK TO SCENE

           Philostrate stands at the window.  The night explodes with
           sounds of MARCHING, SCREAMS, and GUNSHOTS.  A wolf HOWLS.

                                 MAYOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Effective immediately, the Quarter
                        is closed and all residents are to
                        be relocated to state containment at
                        Bleakness Keep until further notice.

           Quill quickly turns off the Voxagraph.

                                 QUILL
                        An anarchist junta in the Quarter. 
                        I am the anarchist junta in the
                        Quarter.  And I was home that night.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        The Guardsman are coming.  Get her
                        to read you and let's get out of
                        here.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Absurd.

           They all slowly turn.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        I don't need to read the Inspector
                        to know he's innocent...

                                 QUILL
                        What?

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I know who Unseelie Jack is.

                                 QUILL
                        Who is it?

           Philostrate stealthily reaches for his gun.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        You've all been quite entertaining.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Wait...  There's something familiar
                        about you...

                                 QUILL
                        If you know who the killer is, why
                        wouldn't you tell the police?

           A PISTOL COCKS.  Quill turns.  Philostrate has taken aim. 
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Because she's Unseelie Jack.

           The Haruspex's ancient wrinkled visage slowly stretches into
           a villainous grin.  She slowly nods.

                                 QUILL
                        What?

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You knew?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I suspected.  I just had to get her
                        in front of me.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Bravo, Inspector.  You set me up. 
                        How very sharp.  There's just one
                        problem.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What's that?

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I knew you would.

           With blinding speed, the Haruspex snaps her restraints and
           leaps to her feet.  

           She whips around, her long black cloak a swirling vortex.  

           In the blink of an eye, she lunges.  With one hand, she
           effortlessly throws Quill

           OUT THE WINDOW

           plummeting three stories.  He hits

           THE ROOF

           of a canvas tent in the market below.  

           He rolls down and lands in

           THE STREET

           knocked unconscious.  While in

           THE ROOM

           the Haruspex grabs Vignette by the neck and moves behind
           her.

           Philostrate aims his pistol.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Let her go.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Not this time, Inspector.  She and I
                        have business to attend to.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I don't think so.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I'll slice her pretty neck wide open.

           The Haruspex's nails dig into the soft skin under Vignette's
           jaw, drawing a single drop of blood.  The Haruspex sniffs
           the air.  She licks the blood with a purple forked tongue.

           Vignette winces, trembling with terror.

           The Haruspex licks her lips.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        Mmmm, sweet.

           The Haruspex inches towards the door with Vignette.

           Philostrate keeps his pistol trained on her.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Philo, I -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Vignette, don't you dare say your
                        goodbyes...

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Such confidence, Inspector. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                         (to Haruspex)
                        Last chance.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        No thank you, Inspector.  We have
                        other plans for this one.

           The Haruspex darts out the door, knocking it off its hinges.

           Vignette's terrified SCREAM shrinks down the hallway.

           Philostrate runs into

           THE HALLWAY 

           just in time to see the end of the Haruspex's cloak whipping
           around a corner.  Impossibly fast.
           He rounds the corner.  A long hall lined with numbered doors
           and flickering gas lamps and garnished with rusted suits of
           armour and chinked shields - ornaments of a faded era.

           A horrid CACKLING echoes through the long dark halls.

           Philostrate sneaks down the hall with his pistol poised.  He
           listens as he passes every door.

           He hears SCREAMING.  He turns and kicks the door in, quickly
           taking aim.

           IN THE ROOM 

           a YOUNG COUPLE startled out of their lovemaking desperately
           cover themselves.  Philostrate pulls back into

           THE HALLWAY 

           A voice from behind.

                                 BOTTOM
                        Philostrate!  Don't move!  I have a
                        rifle aimed at your head!

           Philostrate stops.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Do not turn around!  Get on your
                        knees and put your pistol on the
                        ground to your left!  Very slowly!

           Philostrate doesn't move.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Do it!

           He slowly gets on his knees and lays his pistol on the ground.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        Put your hands behind your head.

           He does.  Bottom comes up behind him.  He presses the barrel
           of the long rifle to the back of Philostrate's neck.  He
           reaches for his shackles with his other hand.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        You're in a bilge-load of trouble.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Sergeant, listen to me.  You're making
                        a terrible mistake.  The Haruspex's
                        the killer.  She's in one of these
                        rooms.  If you'll just search -
                                 BOTTOM
                        Shut your gob.  Do I look daft to
                        you?

           Suddenly, a door at the end of the hall splinters to pieces. 
           The Haruspex leaps out.  She hovers above the ground with
           Vignette kicking and screaming under one arm.

           The Haruspex speeds down the hall towards them, cackling.  

           She stretches out one of her arms and lets her claws drag
           along the wall, gouging the plaster, shattering the gas lamps.

           As the lamps break a mantle of darkness follows her. 

           Philostrate grabs his pistol.

           Bottom manages to hit the deck at the last minute.  The
           Haruspex soars over his head.

           Philostrate whirls to fire, but she's too quick.  She breaks
           through the window at the other end of the hall.

           Philostrate hurries to the broken window and looks

           OUTSIDE 

           as the Haruspex deftly vaults from roof to roof. 

           Bottom hobbles down the hallway after Philostrate. 

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        That was the Haruspex?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I don't know what it is.

                                 BOTTOM
                        That old crone always gave me the
                        shivers. 

           Bottom aims his rifle through the broken window.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Sergeant, she has a hostage...

                                 BOTTOM
                        Relax, Inspector.  I can hit the
                        ticks of a griffin's rump with this.

           Bottom squints.

                                 BOTTOM (CONT'D)
                        There you are...

           Philostrate notices a funny smell.  He surveys the hallway. 
           He hears a steady HISS from the gouged walls.  
           He moves closer and sees

           A RUPTURED PIPE

           spewing rippling gas into the hall.  He glances at 

           BOTTOM'S RIFLE 

           just in time to see him pull the hammer back with his thumb.  

           Bottom's finger tightens around the trigger.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Sergeant, no!

                                 BOTTOM
                        Take this, you spooky old bitch...

           He pulls the trigger.

           The hammer sparks.

           Philostrate pulls a metal shield from one of the ornamental
           suits of armour and hits the floor.

           EXT. THE FAERIE QUARTER -- SAME

           Quiet and still until

           THE MARZIPAN INN

           explodes in a brilliant fireball.  Splinters of blazing planks
           and shards of glass rain down on the street as a tower of
           flames and billowing black smoke rises into the night sky.

                                 FLUTE (V.O.)
                        Philostrate is dead.

           INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- LATER

           Flute stands before the Mayor's desk.

                                 MAYOR
                        What?

                                 FLUTE
                        He died in the explosion of the
                        Marzipan Inn.

                                 MAYOR
                        Well.  That's that.  Case closed. 
                        This calls for a little celebration.

           He strolls to a cabinet and withdraws a bottle and glasses.
                                 FLUTE
                        Sir.  I don't believe Unseelie Jack
                        is dead.

           The Mayor stops.  He forces a chuckle as he pours two drinks.

                                 MAYOR
                        Now Magistrate...

           Flute drops some papers on the Mayor's desk.  The Mayor turns.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        What's all this, then?

                                 FLUTE
                        A budget for the Mayor's Defense
                        Consulate.  With provisions for an
                        "eggs for vouchers" program.  "Donate
                        biological material to the census
                        and walk away with bread vouchers. 
                        Emphasis on faeries and vampires."

           The Mayor, still smiling, but with controlled fury in his
           eyes.  Flute becomes even more bold. 

                                 FLUTE (CONT'D)
                        Harvesting samples from faeries and
                        vampires?  Do you know what Unseelie
                        Jack is?

                                 MAYOR
                        A test tube genocide?  

                                 FLUTE
                        Maybe that was the idea.  But what
                        if it became impractical.  You can't
                        set an army of monsters on the city. 
                        But you can use one to steer your
                        agenda.  Scare the faeries.  Make
                        them angry enough.  They become a
                        plausible threat and then...  

                                 MAYOR
                        You've had your nose in one too many
                        penny dreadfuls.

                                 FLUTE
                        It's been a good week for you, sir,
                        hasn't it?  Carnival Row is empty. 
                        Your wife has been silenced.

                                 MAYOR
                        That seems to happen to those who
                        get in my way, doesn't it, Magistrate?

           The Mayor drinks his glass in one gulp and turns.  He crumples
           the records and tosses them in a dustbin.
                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Dismissed.

           Flute doesn't move.  The Mayor glances over his spectacles,
           glaring at Flute.

                                 MAYOR (CONT'D)
                        Dismissed, Magistrate.

           Flute takes a deep breath.

                                 FLUTE
                        Yes, sir.

           He leaves and shuts the door.

           EXT. FAERIE QUARTER -- SAME

           The entire block where once stood the Marzipan Inn, now a
           smoldering pile of rubble. CONSTABLES and MEDICS probe the
           ruins, searching for survivors and bodies. 

           Quill climbs amidst the debris, calling out in a whisper,
           trying to avoid the attention of the authorities.

                                 QUILL
                        Vignette...  Philostrate...

           He lifts sections of scorched plaster and timbers.  Nothing.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Hello.

           He hears a PAINED MOAN from a nearby pile of charred bricks. 
           Quill digs, desperately tossing the bricks.  He finds a scored
           and blackened knight's shield and heaves it aside. 

           He uncovers a semi-conscious Philostrate caked in soot,
           peppered with small shards of brick and glass.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Oh bloody hell, are you alive?

           He MOANS weakly.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Close enough.

           Quill throws him over his shoulder and hurries away.

           INT. SCREAMING BANSHEE PRINTING OFFICE -- LATER

           Philostrate lays on a table, cleaned and bandaged.  He opens
           his eyes and sits up.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Vignette!
                                 QUILL
                        I couldn't find her.

           Philostrate touches his temple.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        How long have I been out?

                                 QUILL
                        A while. 

           Philostrate gets out of bed, stumbling, still a little groggy.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        The Haruspex took Vignette.

                                 QUILL
                        Where are you going?

           Philostrate grabs his coat and struggles to put it on.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        You're in no bloody condition to -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Stop me.

                                 QUILL
                        Wait...

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        We have no time for these sodding
                        games!  Did you hear a word I said? 
                        The Haruspex has her right now!

                                 QUILL
                        And what if she's dead.

           Philostrate stops.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        What if she's not.  How long do you
                        think she has?

                                 QUILL
                        You'll never find her in time.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I have to try!  I can't just - 

                                 QUILL
                        Listen!  I'm saying there's a way. 
                        But I -

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Show me.
           INT. CABARET MU GONG (BACK HALLWAY) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate lays on a cot.  Quill and Kasmir stand over him. 
           Kasmir is flanked by his two Komodo bodymen.  One holds a
           leather case.

                                 KASMIR
                        The visions you have when you're on
                        Mabsynthe.  They're caused by the
                        faerie blood.

                                 QUILL
                        I imagine that's how the Haruspex
                        gets her powers.

                                 KASMIR
                        Whenever I brew a new batch, I usually
                        include samples from several different
                        donors.  That's why the visions are
                        all jumbled.

           Kasmir snaps his fingers.  The Komodo withdraws a full
           syringe.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        Here she is.  Vignette.

           He flips the syringe and squeezes the air bubbles out.

                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        But, if one was to take a solution
                        from the blood of a single donor... 
                        One would enter the present mind of
                        that donor.  See what she sees. 
                        Feel what she feels.  It is... a
                        unique experience.

                                 QUILL
                        But Philo, you have to understand. 
                        If she's dead...

                                 KASMIR
                        You'll die a very ugly, painful death.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Lets just get this over with.

           Kasmir kneels.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Aren't you going to need to find a
                        vein?

                                 KASMIR
                        Well, that's the other thing, really.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KASMIR (CONT'D)
                        The solution must be injected directly
                        into the subject's brain.  Hold him
                        down.  

           The two Komodos and Quill grab Philostrate's wrists and
           ankles.

           Kasmir holds Philostrate's head down with one palm and with
           his other hand, he slowly pushes the needle through
           Philostrate's temple.  Philostrate grits his teeth and shakes.

           Kasmir squeezes the contents of the syringe into Philostrate's
           brain.

           Instantly, Philostrate tenses.  He goes into convulsions. 
           He arches his back and SCREAMS.  His eyes completely white.

           BEGIN MONTAGE -- PHILOSTRATE'S VISION

           (The images come in erratic bursts.  Speeding up and slowing
           down alternately.  In Vignette's POV.)

           - Rushing through a long dark tunnel.

           - Into a grimy subterranean vault.

           - Cluttered with tall glass chambers.  Ghastly beasts, tangles
           of tentacles and claws suspended in murky preservatives.

           - Chains hanging from the ceiling.

           - A wall plastered with severed faerie wings. 

           - Part of a sign on the wall: "Dalrymple Street"

           - Iron shackles snap around Vignette's wrists.  A meat hook
           catches the chain.

           - The Haruspex turns a crank.  A chain winds around the
           spindle as she hoists Vignette into the air.

           - Vignette's feet dangle above the blood-smeared tile floor. 

           - The Haruspex's face.

                                 HARUSPEX
                         (distorted)
                        Now comes the fun bit, poppet.

           - The Haruspex's wicked claws shred Vignette's clothes off.

           - The Haruspex turns the nozzle of a hose and sprays down
           Vignette's hanging naked body with a hard stream of water. 
           BACK TO SCENE

           Philostrate twists and contorts.  He turns away from the
           imaginary stream of water.  He shuts his eyes tight.

                                 QUILL
                        He can't take this.

                                 KASMIR
                        He has to.  It must run its course.

           Philostrate's contortions end.  His body still, but tense.
           His white eyes open, fixated on something unseen.

                        PHILOSTRATE
                                                VIGNETTE (V.O.)
               What are you?
                                         What are you?

           PHILOSTRATE'S VISION

           - The Haruspex stands before the wall of faerie wings, her
           back to Vignette.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I am not a prophet.

           - She takes off her sunglasses and unwraps her blindfold.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        I don't merely see the future.

           - She drops her cloak and spreads an enormous pair of twisted,
           hideously majestic wings.  Tiny veins pulsate through the
           frayed leathery membrane.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        I am the future.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Philostrate recoils in disgust.  He goes into a brief seizure. 
           Quill and Kasmir hold him steady.  He stiffens and regains
           some control.

                        PHILOSTRATE
                                                VIGNETTE (V.O.)
               You're... You're a
               faerie...
                                         You're...  You're a
                                         faerie...

           PHILOSTRATE'S VISION

           - The Haruspex slowly turns.  Two dark empty eye sockets. 
           She cackles.  Two slithering black vipers emerge from her
           hollow eye sockets, snapping at the air.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        Not exactly...

           - A silhouetted FIGURE leans on the handrail of a loft above.
                                 FIGURE
                        She is many things.

           - The Figure descends a spiral staircase.

                                 FIGURE (CONT'D)
                        A faerie, yes.  Some selkie.  Some
                        gorgon.  And just a dash of vampire.

           - The Figure steps into the light.  Professor Leopold
           Alcandre.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Philostrate gasps with recognition.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You...

           He goes into one final seizure.  His whole body falls limp
           on the cot.  He opens his bloodshot eyes.

                                 QUILL
                        Who?  Who did you see?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Professor Alcandre.

           Philostrate winces and sits up quickly.  He holds his stomach,
           nauseated.  He wipes the sweat from his brow and thinks.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        He told me he was into twining.

                                 QUILL
                        Wait.  What?  Twining?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Using magic and bio-technology to
                        create hybrids.

           Philostrate pushes himself off the examination table.

                                 QUILL
                        You're saying the Haruspex is some
                        kind of artificial creation?  

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        It was a laboratory.  There was a
                        sign.

           Philostrate shuts his eyes, concentrating.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        "Dalrymple Street." 

           Quill shakes his head.
                                 QUILL
                        Doesn't make any sense.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Isn't that in Argyle Heights?

                                 QUILL
                        They gutted it years ago to build
                        the Museum Annex.

           Quill paces.

                                 QUILL (CONT'D)
                        Hold on.  Does this Professor of
                        yours work for the museum? 

           Philostrate looks up, a revelation.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Quill.  Would the Dalrymple Street
                        tube station still be under the annex? 

           INT. DALRYMPLE STREET STATION -- SAME

           Flooded train tracks cut through.  Glass chambers with
           floating monstrosities preserved within.  A web of chains
           hangs from the dark ceiling.

           Vignette dangles in midair, suspended from a meat hook in
           front of the wall of trophy faerie wings.

           Alcandre hums a tune as he pushes a surgical instrument cart
           in front of Vignette.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        You're lucky to be alive.  That's
                        why you're here.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Who are you?

                                 ALCANDRE
                        I am the Twiner.  The Almighty
                        Alchemist of Chaos.

           Alcandre pulls a sleek black glove out of a metal canister. 
           He slides the glove on.  It snaps itself skin-tight to the
           contours of his hand.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What are you going to do with that?

           Alcandre speaks with the bedside manner of a friendly doctor.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        This lets me reach inside you.
           He holds her steady with his bare hand while he slowly reaches
           for her stomach with the black glove.  The air CRACKLES with
           a mysterious ELECTRIC HUM.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        This is going to hurt quite a bit.

           He touches her stomach.  Her skin yields to his fingertips
           and ripples as if it were only water.  He reaches inside.

           Vignette chokes on a scream.  Her face contorts with
           unbearable pain.

           Alcandre reaches deeper.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        A faerie lays an egg.  A grub hatches,
                        eats, and becomes a cocoon.  Under
                        normal circumstances what emerges
                        from the cocoon ressembles a healthy
                        human toddler with wings.  But while
                        in the cocoon, a faerie's biology
                        becomes soft and pliable like clay.

           Vignette spasms and convulses.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Ripe for the tender touch of a
                        sculptor.

           Alcandre slides his hand out slowly.  Her skin closes itself
           behind the glove.  No blood or cuts.  Vignette shudders.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        But before cocoons...

           Alcandre looks down at the handful of tiny pearl-white faerie
           eggs in the palm of his hand.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        ...there are eggs.

           He gently spoons the eggs into a beaker.

                                 VIGNETTE
                         (trembling)
                        You...  You sick rutter...

                                 ALCANDRE
                        Such a strong-willed girl.

           Alcandre reaches inside her stomach.

           Vignette explodes into body-wrenching seizures.

           Alcandre bites his lip with concentration as he probes
           Vignette's innards.
                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Just relax those muscles, dear. 
                        They're jelly in my hands.  You're
                        only making it difficult for yourself.

           He reaches deeper.

           Vignette writhes and gags.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        You are quite the remarkable specimen. 
                        To survive an attack from the
                        Haruspex.

           He withdraws his hand clutching another small handful of
           eggs.  He spoons them into a container.

           Vignette hangs in midair, shivering.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Most faeries who lose their wings
                        commit suicide within the first day.

           He reaches back inside.

           Vignette's eyes roll back as she shakes.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Yet here you are.  Even now, still
                        clinging to consciousness when others
                        would have surely passed out.

           He pulls another handful of eggs out and examines them with
           his fingertip.  Vignette falls limp, still shaking.

           Vignette looks up, her eyes filled with hate.  A trickle of
           bile at the corner of her mouth.  She wheezes heavily.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Those eyes.  So determined.

           Alcandre gestures to the monsters preserved in the glass
           chambers all around.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        So many of my experiments never live
                        more than a few days.  But you're a
                        survivor.  Your children will be
                        survivors too.  The Haruspex was
                        just a prototype.  My employer only
                        needed one.  He doesn't know what
                        I'm really making.  The Haruspex was
                        the first of a perfect race that
                        will eat and replace your kind.  A
                        race that will call me God.  Smile,
                        you get to play mother to the newest
                        most dominant species on the planet.
           Suddenly, a GUNSHOT.

           Alcandre's eyes widen.

           He pulls his hand out of Vignette's abdomen and touches his
           chest.

           A spreading bloodstain darkens his shirt.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                         (looking down curiously)
                        How strange...

           His eyes roll back.  He collapses.

           Behind him, Philostrate climbs up from the flooded train
           tracks followed by Quill.  He holsters his smoking revolver.

           They hurriedly untie Vignette.

                                 QUILL
                        Bloody hell.  What was he doing?

           Vignette falls into Philostrate's arms, limp.  Eyes closed.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Vignette.  Are you okay?

           No response.  He shakes her.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        Vignette!

           She weakly opens her eyes.  Philostrate sighs with relief. 
           She hugs him with all her strength.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        It's okay.

           She lets go.  Quill wraps a cloak around her.  She lowers
           her eyes to Alcandre's body, disgusted.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Give me your gun.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        He's dead.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I know!  I said give me your sodding
                        gun!

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Listen.  The Haruspex is still around. 
                        Did you see where she went?
           Without tearing her hateful gaze from Alcandre's body, she
           shakes her head.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                         (to Quill)
                        Keep an eye on her.

           Quill nods.

           Philostrate pulls out his revolver and stealthily stalks
           through the abandoned station.

           Only the soft sounds of FLOWING WATER and the CRUNCHING of
           broken glass under Philostrate's boots.

           He looks slowly back and forth.

           He hears the GENTLE CLINKING of chains swaying overhead.

           Philostrate looks up.

           The Haruspex hangs bat-like from the ceiling.  She twists
           her head to look down.  Her eye-snakes poise to strike.  She
           lets herself plummet, talons outstretched, cackling.

           She lands on Philostrate, pinning him down.  Her enormous
           wings beat the air as she slashes at him in a flurry of claws. 
           Philostrate dodges as best he can.

           Quill smacks the back of her skull with a steel tray.

           In a single quick motion, she grabs Quill, throws him over
           her shoulder.

           Philostrate rolls away, aims, and fires.  The Haruspex
           SCREECHES and slinks around a corner.  Silence.

                                 QUILL
                        Did you hit her?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I think so.

           Vignette limps to Philostrate.  She touches the nicks and
           cuts that crisscross his face.

                                 PHILOSTRATE (CONT'D)
                        I'm okay.

           He motions for her to move behind him.  He walks towards the
           shadows, his revolver raised.  He turns a corner.

           He trains his gun on a dark heap on the ground as he
           approaches.  He kneels cautiously.

           The Haruspex's wrinkled face stares blankly at him from amidst
           the heavy dark folds of her cloak.  Her eye sockets empty.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Is she dead?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Something's wrong.

           He slowly reaches out and touches her face.  He prods the
           dark cloak.  Nothing solid.  He grabs her gray hair and picks
           the face up.  Skin only - a hollow husk.

                                 QUILL
                        Maybe she melted?

           Philostrate looks around.  Something suddenly occurs to him.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Where's Vignette?

           INT. FLOODED TUBE TUNNEL -- SAME

           Alcandre stumbles through the knee-deep water.  The SPLASHING
           of his labored running echoes through the long dark tunnel.

           He stops to catch his breath.  He grabs his bleeding chest
           and laughs a little to himself.

           He hears the slow SPLASHING of someone approaching.  He turns
           and stares into the darkness, frightened.

           Vignette limps into view.  She stops and glares at Alcandre.

                                 ALCANDRE
                         (chuckling)
                        I thought you were your Inspector
                        friend.  A crack shot - he hit me
                        right in the heart.  Well, one of
                        them.  It never hurts to have a spare.

           Vignette slowly moves closer.  Alcandre backs away.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Little one.  It was just a job.

           Vignette comes closer still.  Alcandre scrambles back.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Your kind.  You choke the streets
                        and the very skies above our heads. 
                        You spread disease and immorality -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        You violated nature and me.

                                 ALCANDRE
                        I improved on nature.  I wanted to
                        make faeries better, stronger.  My
                        creations are works of art.
           He backs against a brick wall, cornered.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        I'm just a scientist...

           Alcandre's hand trembles as he reaches for the steel handle
           of a curved surgical blade clipped to his belt.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        Just wanted to study you.  Just wanted
                        to see what you're made of... inside!

           He quickly whips out the curved scalpel and makes a wide
           swipe at Vignette.  She gets back just in time with a fresh
           shallow cut on her cheek.

           Vignette pulls back her cloak and lifts her hand.  She wears
           the black surgical glove.  Alcandre's eyes widen.  

           He lunges for her, flailing the scalpel.  Alcandre has
           Vignette against the wall.  She holds his wrist as he tries
           to bring the scalpel down.

                                 ALCANDRE (CONT'D)
                        You don't know how to use that glove.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I'll muddle through.

           She plunges her gloved hand through Alcandre's chest. 
           Alcandre's muscles lock up as he squeals in agony.

           Vignette slowly pulls her hand out.  She holds Alcandre's
           heart in her fist.

           Alcandre musters a weak smile as he slowly slides down the
           brick wall and falls face first into the water.

           Vignette drops his heart.  She rips off the black glove and
           tosses it to the side.

           A hand touches her shoulder.  Vignette jumps, startled.  She
           looks up and sees Quill.

                                 QUILL
                        Let's get out of here.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Where's Philo?

           INT. DALRYMPLE STREET STATION (LOFTSPACE) -- MOMENTS LATER

           Philostrate quickly looks through the makeshift lab - various
           vials and beakers, books, papers, etc.  Vignette and Quill
           stand aside.  Waiting for him.
                                 VIGNETTE
                        What are you looking for.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I don't know.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        What about the Haruspex?

                                 QUILL
                        Gone.  Shed her skin.  I get the
                        feeling whereever she is, she's a
                        lot less pretty than usual.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        But where is she?

           Philostrate finds an envelope.  Inside, he finds a set of
           tintypes.  He looks over the images.

           -- Failed experiments.  Twisted faeries sprouting extra limbs.

           -- Rows and rows of monstrous embryos growing in vitro.

           -- And the last photo.  The Mayor poses next to Professor
           Alcandre amidst all the entrapments of the secret lab.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        This is it.

           He tucks the envelope into his coat pocket.

                                 QUILL
                        If they really were breeding an army
                        of these things, why would the Mayor
                        bother clearing the Faerie Quarter? 
                        The faeries are gone.  There's no
                        need for a horde prowling the night.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Not a horde.  The professor was a
                        madman who got carried away with his
                        own agenda.  He wanted to make a
                        whole new race.  But the Mayor only
                        wanted one Haruspex from him.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        There it is.  All the faeries are
                        locked up.  When you've got the whole
                        herd corralled, you don't need an
                        army to slaughter them.  You just
                        need one.

                                 QUILL
                        Oh godspit, Philo, you're right. 
                        The Haruspex.  She's gone to feed. 
                        To finish the job.
                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        We need to get to Bleakness Keep,
                        before -

                                 QUILL
                        Allow me.  You don't get to my level
                        of ill-repute without knowing the
                        ins and outs of prison. 

           EXT. BLEAKNESS KEEP PRISON -- NIGHT

           A broken medieval citadel converted to a prison clings to
           crags of rock high above the rumbling sea.  A light drizzle.

           Glum members of the PRESS stand outside the iron gate and
           file routine reports on the faerie incarceration.

           INT. THE CLINK -- SAME

           A dank, sunken rotunda clotted with FAERIES and other non-
           humans.  A long gutter-toilet splits the room.  Harsh light
           from hissing arc lamps lazily crisscrosses the crowd.

           ARMED GUARDS patrol on metal catwalks above.

           In the crowd, a FAERIE MOTHER holds her YOUNG GIRL close. 
           The Young Girl whispers to her mom.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I have to go plink.

           The Mother points to the gutter.

                                 FAERIE MOTHER
                        That's the potty over there, hon.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I know.  I can't go in front of
                        everybody.

                                 FAERIE MOTHER
                        It's alright.  I'll hold your hand.

           The Mother leads her Young Girl to the gutter.  The Young
           Girl stands on the metal lattice.  She nervously bunches the
           hem of her skirt and starts to squat down.

           She stops when she hears movement from the darkness below. 
           She squints past the metal grate.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I think there's someone down there,
                        mum.

           The arc lamps above flicker and go out.  The catwalks suddenly
           empty.  Scattered sounds of doors shutting and locking.  The
           restless murmur of the crowd dims to a whisper.
           The silence is broken by the lilting humming of an old woman. 
           The tune echoes from the dark under the Young Girl's feet.

           The Young Girl strains to see past the shadows.

           Suddenly, the Haruspex's eye-vipers strike from between the
           lattice. 

           The Young Girl screams and falls back. 

           Talons reach up, shredding the lattice.  A ghastly form
           explodes from the twisted metal hole and takes flight.

           Looming above is the Haruspex's true form.  Gleaming black
           scales, spindly talons, dark wings.  She grins with rows of
           shark-like teeth.  Her eye-vipers giddily snap at the air.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        I will eat for days.

           She advances on the screaming crowd of Faeries, backing them
           helplessly against the wall.

           She nears the Faerie Mother and her Young Girl.

           The Mother holds her daughter close, shuts her eyes tight,
           and readies for the worst.

           From out of nowhere, Philostrate jumps onto the Haruspex's
           back and puts a strangle-hold on her neck.

           Quill and Vignette emerge from the hole in the gutter.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Philo, don't do anything stupid.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        No problem.  Get these people out of
                        here!

           The Haruspex tries to shake Philostrate off.  She zigzags
           and slams him into the walls of the rotunda.  

           Her uneven flight forces him to use both arms to hold on. 
           He can't reach his revolver.

           She flies at the ceiling, beating him against the wire mesh.

           EXT. BLEAKNESS KEEP PRISON -- CONTINUOUS

           The Haruspex bursts from the roof in a shower of glass and
           metal.  Philostrate clings as the monster whirls and bobs
           around the building, locked in a mortal aerial struggle.

           The Press beyond the gate snap pictures.
                                 PRESS #1
                        What the deuce is it?

                                 PRESS #2
                        It's a monster!  It's Jack!

           The Haruspex quickly soars straight up.  

           The fight spirals higher.  The ground grows distant.

           As they climb, Philostrate watches the prison shrink in a
           mist of rain and swirls of low clouds.  

           He makes a grab for his gun as he holds on with one hand.  

           He buries the barrel under the Haruspex's chin.

           The Haruspex cackles as the clouds overtake them.  Philostrate
           shuts his eyes against the pelting rain and wild winds.  

           His clenched knuckles turn blue from the piercing cold.

           He chokes and gags on the lack of oxygen.

                                 HARUSPEX
                        The air is thin, Inspector?  Go to
                        sleep.  Go to sleep.

           Lightning CRACKS the air around them.  The wind SCREAMS and
           still they move higher.  

           Philostrate's eyes flutter.  His grip loosens.

           The Haruspex smiles.

                                 HARUSPEX (CONT'D)
                        Goodnight.  Inspector.

           Philostrate musters one last burst of strength.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Goodnight.

           He pulls the trigger.  A POP and a flash of light.

           Philostrate and the lifeless Haruspex fall, tumbling through
           the storm.

           EXT. ROOF OF BLEAKNESS KEEP -- SAME

           Vignette, Quill, and the crowd of Faeries search the night
           sky.  Vignette spots Philostrate's falling body.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        I think I see - He's falling!  Someone -
           But before she can finish her plea, a group of Faeries take
           to the air.  

           They catch Philostrate.

           Cradling his limp body, they descend back to the roof.

           Vignette runs to him.  She grabs his shoulders and shakes
           him, barely holding back tears.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Philo.  Wake up, Philo.  Wake up!

           Philostrate doesn't move.  The crowd of faeries watch with
           baited breath.  The Young Girl tugs on her mom's sleeve.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        You stupid prat, wake up!  That was
                        the daftest thing I've ever seen! 
                        Why'd you do that?!?  Why'd you do
                        that?!? Please wake up...  Gods, I
                        don't even know how to tell if -

           She looks around.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        Does anyone know resuscitation for
                        humans?!?  Help me!

           Quill puts a hand on Vignette's shoulder.  Vignette violently
           shrugs the hand off.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        No!  He's alive!  I know it!  Philo,
                        wake up!  Don't leave.  Please.

           Philostrate finally coughs.  Relieved sighs and applause
           from the crowd.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Good morning, luv.

           Vignette laughs, tears on her cheeks.  She embraces him.

           EXT. BLEAKNESS KEEP FRONT GATE -- SAME

           The Press gathers around the grim Rorschach of blood and
           entrails, a violent inhuman silhouette that was once the
           Haruspex, burned onto the sidewalk.  Cameras POP and FLASH.

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MAYOR'S OFFICE -- MORNING

           Flute leads two marching UNIFORMED CONSTABLES.  In his hand -
           Philostrate's envelope with the incriminating tintypes.
           INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

           Flute bursts in.  The Mayor looks up from his desk.

                                 MAYOR
                        What is the meaning of this?

                                 FLUTE
                        Mayor Boniface, you are hereby
                        indicted by the authority of the
                        Metropolitan Constabulary on two
                        counts of Conspiracy - to assassinate
                        a state official and to commit mass
                        genocide.

                                 MAYOR
                         (laughing)
                        You're arresting me?

                                 FLUTE
                        You are relieved of your office.

           The Mayor stands, his veil of self-control gradually slipping.

                                 MAYOR
                        You sneak.  You turncoat.  You would
                        betray your own people.  I'm a bloody
                        hero.  This city used to be something
                        before those creatures -  They aren't
                        even human!  Have you seen their
                        babies?  They're born as fat squirming
                        maggots.  You would sell-out humanity
                        for what?  For maggots?  The Quarter
                        is gangrene and all I'm doing is
                        chopping it off.  So don't you sodding
                        tell me that it hurts when I bring
                        the knife down.  You don't know what's
                        good for this city.

                                 FLUTE
                        Men, put him in irons.

                                 MAYOR
                        Try it and they'll never find your
                        bodies.  You won't get me halfway
                        down the hall before my Imperial
                        Guardsmen -

                                 FLUTE
                        The Guardsmen have been detained. 
                        It's over.

                                 MAYOR
                        Like hell...

           The Mayor quickly opens a rosewood box on his desk and whips
           out his gold-finished musket.
           Startled, the two Uniformed Constables drop their shackles
           and reach for their own weapons.

           The Mayor aims his musket at Flute, lifts the hammer, and...

           ...does not beat Flute to the draw.  A GUNSHOT rings.  A
           trace of smoke climbs from the barrel of Flute's gun.

           The Mayor staggers back, clutching his chest with one hand. 
           Dying, but not ready to go alone, he grits his teeth and re-
           aims at Flute.

           By now, the two Uniformed Constables have drawn their weapons. 
           Flute and his two men unload on the preternaturally determined
           Mayor until he falls to the floor.

           INT. AXIS ZEPPELIN-PORT -- SAME

           A crowded terminal under a vaulted canopy of wrought iron
           and glass.  TRAVELERS hurry to and from their gates.

           The headlines at a newsstand variously proclaim - "Mayor
           Dies in Police Standoff," "Unseelie Jack Conspiracy," "Faeries
           Freed," "Faeries' Voting Rights Bill Before Parliament."

           A hand takes a copy and slides coins to the CLERK. 
           Philostrate opens the paper and begins to read.

           Flute ambles by, grabs a copy of his own, and leans on the
           counter as he pretends to read.

                                 FLUTE
                        Thanks for the tip.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I didn't know who else to send it
                        to.  Someone who was in the position
                        to stand up to the Mayor.

                                 FLUTE
                        You think things are going to be
                        different around here?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Someday.  It's a step, isn't it?

                                 FLUTE
                        You don't have to run, you know. 
                        You're exonerated now.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I need a change of scenery.

                                 FLUTE
                        This city.  It gets in your veins,
                        doesn't it?
           A nearby destination board CLATTERS as the numbers rotate.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        That's me. 

                                 FLUTE
                        If you ever come back this way, you
                        can have my job.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You're an honorable man, Magistrate. 
                        The city's not going to really change
                        without men like you.

                                 FLUTE
                        And men like you?

           Philostrate grabs his luggage, puts on his hat, and smiles.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Me?  I'm not all that great.

                                 FLUTE
                        You've got company, do you?

           Philostrate looks to the two tickets in his breast pocket.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        Like you said, it gets in your veins.

           INT. PASSENGERS CABIN -- LATER

           Upper class HUMANS sit in the rows of wide posh seats.  The
           dim cabin lights flicker.  The steady DRONE of propeller
           engines beats the air outside.  

           The CONDUCTOR strolls down the aisle punching tickets.  

           Philostrate glances at an empty seat between him and the
           window.  He looks down at the two tickets.  He takes a quick
           swig from a stout glass. 

           A tap on the shoulder.  He turns.  Vignette, radiant, in a
           long gypsy skirt and pretty blouse, hair brushed behind her
           pointed ears.  She sticks out as a faerie despite no wings.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        How was the loo? 

           She scoots in and plops herself into the empty window seat.  

           The ENGINE DRONE swells.  The flames in the cabin lamps tilt. 
           The liquid in Philostrate's glass leans to one side.

           Vignette quickly grabs Philostrate's hand. 
                                 VIGNETTE
                        Oh, sorry.  I'm no good with heights.

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        You're a faerie -

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Yeah.  What are the odds? 

           She catches scornful glances from Humans.  Suddenly aware of
           being the only faerie, she lets go of Philostrate's hand.

                                 VIGNETTE (CONT'D)
                        I'll just dig into the armrest.

           She turns to the window.  Philostrate takes her hand in his
           own.  She shoots him a bewildered look. 

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        I'm afraid of heights too.

                                 VIGNETTE
                        Where are we going?

                                 PHILOSTRATE
                        It's a big world out there.  There's
                        still quite a bit we've never seen.

           OUT THE WINDOW

           to the sweeping aerial view - tangled streets in a pale haze
           of fog, dark spires, crooked roofs, dusky smokestacks.

           EXT. ZEPPELIN -- CONTINUOUS

           Vignette stares out the portal of the vast airship as it
           rises above the swirling clouds, held aloft by a canvas
           balloon, shining against the crisp blue sky.

                                                          FADE OUT.
