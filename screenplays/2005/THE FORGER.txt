                                             WHITE:  August  30,  2013
           INT. CUTTER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY      

           A  PAINTING  -  of  a  winged  boy,  Icarus,  flying  out  of  a  prison 
           labyrinth  where  a  slain  Minotaur  lies  dead  on  the  island  of 
           Crete  below.   Soaring  through  the  sky  in  front  of  him  is  his 
           father,  Daedalus,  but  instead  of  following  him,  Icarus  is 
           heading  too  close  to  the  sun  and  his  wings  are  melting.

           The  painting  is  a  tour  de  force...  the  details,  the  shading, 
           the  colors,  the  movement,  the  emotional  depth...  it  must  be 
           the  work  of  a  master.

           But  as  we  PULL  BACK  we  reveal  the  little  hand  manning  the 
           brush...

           RAY  CUTTER

           A  10  year  old  prodigy.   Ray’s  painting  is  tacked  up  to  the 
           kitchen  door.   A  man-made  easel  of  sorts.   The  paints  Ray  are 
           using  are  old  and  cracked  and  probably  came  from  a  yard  sale, 
           but  you’d  never  know  it  from  what  he’s  created  with  them...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  EAST  BOSTON,  MA  -  DAY  -  1970’S

           Ray  puts  the  finishing  touches  on  his  work  and  steps  back.  
           He  makes  a  face,  clearly  not  satisfied  with  the  outcome.

           He  places  the  paints  on  the  kitchen  counter  and  washes  his 
           hands.   The  kitchen  reveals  we’re  in  the  early  70’s,  with 
           wood  paneled  cabinets,  wallpaper  and  a  chrome  kitchen  table.  

           That’s  when  his  father,  JOSEPH  CUTTER,  38,  a  tough  Irish  blue 
           collar  guy,  enters  the  kitchen  killing  his  beer.  

           He  drunkenly  places  the  empty  beside  a  half-dozen  more  on  the 
           counter,  right  next  to  an  overflowing  sink  filled  with  dirty 
           dishes.   He  grabs  another  beer  from  the  fridge,  opens  it.

           He  stops  when  he  sees  what  Ray  has  painted.   Now,  any  normal 
           father  would  heap  praise  on  something  so  beautiful... 

           But  not  Joseph...  who  bursts  out  laughing.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Jesus  Ray...   Why  are  you  still 
                        wasting  time  with  this?   You  can’t 
                        make  a  living  painting.   Artists  die 
                        penniless,  remember  that.

           Joseph  gets  an  idea.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You  want  to  see  how  to  make  money?  
                        Come  with  me.

                                 RAY
                        Dad,  no.
           CONTINUED:

           But  Joseph’s  already  grabbed  their  coats  from  the  closet.

           EXT.  MACY’S  -  DOWNTOWN  BOSTON  -  DAY 

           Joseph  parks  in  front  of  the  store  in  a  1965  Buick  Skylark.   
           He  leaves  Ray  in  the  car  with  the  motor  running  and  gets  out.  

           Ray  looks  up  from  doodling  an  impressive  jungle  scene  his 
           SKETCH-BOOK  (which  he  always  carries  around  with  him)  to  see 
           his  father  enter  the  store.  

           INT.  MACY’S  -  DAY

           Joseph  makes  a  beeline  to  a  MALE  MANNEQUIN  in  the  storefront 
           window.

           Without  a  care  in  the  world,  Joseph  pulls  off  the  MANNEQUIN’S 
           LEFT  ARM  and  carries  it  out  of  the  store.

           EXT.  MACY’S  -  DAY

           Joseph  tosses  the  left  arm  into  the  back  seat  of  the  Buick, 
           climbs  into  the  driver’s  seat  and  they  drive  off... 

           ...just  as  a  MACY’S  WORKER  comes  running  out  after  him.

           INT.  JEWELRY  STORE  -  DOWNTOWN  BOSTON  -  DAY

           Joseph  and  Ray  are  looking  at  GOLD  CHAINS  inside  a  glass 
           cabinet  as  the  MANAGER  approaches.

                                 MANAGER
                        Can  I  help  you?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yeah,  my  son’s  looking  to  buy  his 
                        mother  a  birthday  gift.   Do  you  like 
                        any  of  these  Ray?

           Ray  stands  holding  Joseph’s  left  hand.   He  looks  up  at  his 
           father.   He  knows  this  is  his  part  in  the  scam  but  he’s  just 
           reluctant  to  participate.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ray.

           Ray  relents  and  points  at  two  gold  chains.   The  Manager 
           gladly  pulls  them  out.   He  lays  them  on  a  black  felt  fabric.

           Joseph  holds  one  of  the  chains  up  to  the  light  with  his  right 
           hand,  then  he  looks  down  at  Ray.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What  do  you  think?   You  like  it?
           CONTINUED:

           Ray  nods  at  his  father.   Joseph  places  the  chains  back  down 
           on  the  black  felt.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What  about  that  one?   Could  we  see 
                        that  chain  also?

           The  Manager  eagerly  bends  down  to  reach  that  chain...

           ...and  lightning  fast,  Joseph’s  REAL  LEFT  HAND  shoots  out 
           between  the  opening  in  his  coat  and  switches  two  fake  gold 
           chains  with  the  two  real  ones,  which  look  very  similar.

           The  Manager  straightens  back  up  with  the  third  gold  chain... 
           but  Ray  now  TUGS  at  his  father’s  left  hand,  which  we  realize 
           now  is  the  mannequin’s  fake  left  hand. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        What  is  it  son?

                                 RAY
                        I’m  hungry.   Can  we  go  eat?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Eat?   But  we’re  picking  out  your 
                        mother’s  gift.
                          (sighs  dramatically  to  Manager)
                        I  guess  we’ll  be  back.   Thanks  for 
                        your  time.

           The  Manager  nods,  disappointed  he’s  not  going  to  make  a  sale. 
           He  puts  the  chains  back  into  the  case,  unaware  they’re  fake.

           INT.  IVAN’S  PAWN  SHOP  -  DAY

           Joseph  places  two  gold  chains  on  the  counter.   The  Russian 
           proprietor  IVAN  (37)  examines  them,  then  looks  at  Joseph.

                                 IVAN
                        Where’d  you  get  these?

                                 JOSEPH
                        My  wife  passed  away  and  we  went 
                        through  her  jewelry  box.   There  a 
                        problem?

           Ivan  takes  this  in  a  beat,  then  he  peels  off  a  wad  of  bills 
           to  buy  them.   Joseph  pockets  the  money  and  smiles.

           Joseph  heads  out  of  the  store,  tugging  at  Ray  to  follow,  but 
           Ray’s  admiring  an  ARTIST’S  PAINTING  PALETTE  on  the  wall.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        Let’s  go.

           Ray  tears  himself  away  from  it  and  trails  after  his  father 
           carrying  his  well  worn  SKETCH-BOOK  in  his  hand.
           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  and  Ray  return  home  after  a  long  day.   Joseph  peels 
           off  his  coat  and  plops  on  the  couch.   Ray  starts  upstairs. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hey  Ray,  you  did  good  today.

           Ray  stops  on  the  stairs  and  looks  at  his  old  man  as  Joseph 
           turns  on  the  TV  and  surfs  the  channels.  

           PUSH  IN  on  Ray’s  innocent  young  face,  as  he  closes  his  eyes, 
           and  then...

                                                     DISSOLVE  TO:

           INT.  PRISON  -  RAY’S  CELL  -  MORNING

           Ray’s  face...  now  in  his  50’s.   He’s  lying  on  a  cot  staring 
           up  at  the  ceiling  in  the  dark,  remembering,  when  the  lights 
           go  on.   Ray  sits  up  and  we  take  in  his  surroundings... 

           INT.  RAY’S  PRISON  CELL  -  WALPOLE,  MA  -  MORNING  -  PRESENT  DAY

           Ray  stands  in  his  cramped,  6  x  8  cell.   PRISON  SOUNDS  now 
           begin  to  fill  the  air.   He  grabs  his  orange  prison  shirt  off 
           the  chair  and  slips  it  on.   Buttons  it.   

           Ray  washes  his  face  at  a  small  sink.   As  he  brushes  his 
           teeth,  we  PAN  his  cell  to  see... 

           ...a  few  of  his  paintings,  books  on  art  masters  from  Degas  to 
           Rembrandt  and  an  OLD  PHOTO  taped  to  the  wall  of  him  with  his 
           own  10  year  old  son  WILLIAM.  

           Ray  places  the  toothbrush  back  in  a  cup.   He  steps  out  of  his 
           cell  for  breakfast,  going  through  the  motions  of  life.

           INT.  PRISON  MESS  HALL  -  MORNING

           Ray  gets  his  breakfast  in  line  with  many  other  inmates.   The 
           food’s  terrible.   The  other  cons  angrily  complain.   The  place 
           is  full  of  animals.   Everyone’s  on  edge.  

           Except  Ray.   No  one’s  paying  him  any  attention.   It’s  like 
           he’s  invisible,  and  that’s  how  he  prefers  it.  

           He  walks  around  with  his  tray  looking  for  a  place  to 
           disappear.   He  finds  a  table  with  a  few  scary  white  cons.  
           He’s  about  to  take  a  seat  when  one  of  them  acknowledges  him 
           with  a  nod.   Ray  stops,  decides  not  to  sit  there  now.  

           Instead,  he  sits  down  at  another  table  filled  with  rowdy 
           Black  and  Mexican  cons  yelling  and  laughing.   Ray  sits  in  the 
           center  seat,  vanishing  into  this  busy  table.
           EXT.  PRISON  YARD  -  DAY

           Ray  walks  the  yard.   The  other  cons  mill  about  in  groups, 
           lift  weights,  shoot  hoops,  but  Ray  stays  by  himself.  

           Two  cons  get  into  a  shoving  match  nearby  but  Ray  passes  them 
           without  flinching.   A  basketball  bounces  in  front  of  him  but 
           Ray  ignores  it  and  keeps  walking.  

           A  PRISON  GUARD  approaches  him...

                                 PRISON  GUARD
                        Cutter,  you  got  a  visitor.

           INT.  PRISON  -  VISITOR’S  AREA  -  MINUTES  LATER  -  DAY

           The  Prison  Guard  leads  Ray  down  a  row  of  booths  to  the  end, 
           where  an  older  Joseph  Cutter  is  waiting.   Joseph,  now  in  his 
           80’s,  looks  skinnier  and  worn  down  from  the  last  few  years.  

           Ray  takes  a  seat  and  grabs  the  phone.

                                 RAY
                        It’s  Tuesday  Pop.   What’re  you  doing 
                        here?  

           Joseph  removes  an  ENVELOPE  from  his  pocket. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  brought  you  some  photos.  

           A  beat,  as  Joseph  places  the  envelope  on  the  window  shelf.

                                 RAY
                        I  told  you  about  that.   You  know  what 
                        it’s  like  in  here.   No  strings.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        Will’s  not  doing  good  Ray.

           Ray  sighs.

                                 RAY
                        I’ve  got  ten  months  left  Pop.   Just 
                        tell  Will...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ray.   Listen  to  me.   Will  won’t  be 
                        around  when  you  get  out.

                                 RAY
                        What  are  you  talking  about?  

                                 JOSEPH
                        He  has  a  tumor.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Huh?

                                 JOSEPH
                        In  his  head.

           Ray  looks  at  his  father.   Joseph  nods  back  at  his  son,  it’s 
           true.   Ray’s  world  comes  crashing  down  around  him.

                                 RAY
                        But  he’s  15.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Fifteen  year  olds  can  get  tumors  too.

           Ray  shifts  in  his  seat,  the  walls  seem  like  they’re  closing 
           in  on  him  for  the  first  time  in  four  years.

                                 RAY
                        Can’t  they  do  something?   Operate? 

           Joseph  just  shrugs.   Ray  leans  back  in  his  chair.

                                 RAY
                        Can  I  see  him?

                                 JOSEPH
                        He  doesn’t  want  to  come.  
                          (off  Ray’s  look)
                        Anyway,  I  thought  you  should  know.

           Joseph  holds  up  the  envelope.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’ll  leave  these  with  the  guard.

                                 RAY
                        Pop...

                                 JOSEPH
                        See  you  next  week  Ray.

           Joseph  gets  up  and  drops  the  receiver  back  on  the  hook.         

           HOLD  ON  Ray  a  moment,  trying  to  process  the  news,  then...

           INT.  PRISON  -  RAY’S  CELL  -  NIGHT

           Ray  lies  awake  on  his  cot.   He  looks  at  the  envelope  a  long 
           beat,  then  he  removes  the  photos  inside...  they  are  all  shots 
           of  his  son  Will  -  at  Christmas,  in  his  baseball  uniform, 
           getting  a  Karate  trophy,  events  Ray  missed  out  on.  

           Ray  stares  at  them,  the  guilt  eating  away  at  him.
           INT.  PRISON  -  PHONES  -  MORNING

           Ray  makes  a  call  on  the  payphone.   The  line  rings  and 
           rings...  until  finally...

                                 WILL  (V.O.)
                        Hello?

           Ray  has  a  lump  in  his  throat  after  hearing  his  son’s  voice.

                                 RAY
                        Will.   It’s  me.

           A  long  agonizing  beat  follows,  then...

                                 WILL  (V.O.)
                        What  do  you  want?

                                 RAY
                        I...  wanted  to  check  on  you.

           Another  long  awkward  beat,  then...

                                 WILL  (V.O.)
                        Don’t  call  here  anymore.

           Click.   Dial  tone.   Ray  doesn’t  move. 

           INT.  PRISON  -  VISITOR’S  AREA  -  DAY

           Ray  sits  across  from  his  sleazy  lawyer,  MARTIN  DAVIS,  50’s.

                                 MARTIN
                        There’s  nothing  I  can  do  Ray.   Your 
                        appeal  was  denied.   You  only  have 
                        eleven  months  left,  just  ride  it  out.

                                 RAY
                        Ten  months.

                                 MARTIN
                        Ten  months  then,  even  better.

           Ray  considers  this,  not  willing  to  accept  it...  he  knows 
           there’s  another  way,  but  he’s  hesitant  to  go  down  that  road.

                                 MARTIN
                        You  gotta  do  the  time  Ray.

           Ray  checks  the  guards,  he  knows  they’re  listening.   He  leans 
           close  to  the  glass  and  blocks  the  receiver,  then  he  mouths...

                                 RAY
                        Get  in  touch  with  Tommy  Keating.

           Martin  reacts,  he  knows  the  name.
           CONTINUED:

                                 MARTIN
                        Keating?   You  don’t  want  to  do  that 
                        Ray.   As  your  attorney  I  advise  you 
                        to  wait  the  eleven  months.

                                 RAY
                        It’s  Ten.   Now  call  him  Martin.  
                        Today.

           Ray  hangs  up  and  walks  away,  sealing  a  deal  with  the  Devil.  

           EXT.  WALPOLE  PRISON  -  FRONT  GATE  -  DAY 

           Ray  steps  outside  and  the  prison  door  shuts  behind  him.   He 
           takes  his  first  breath  of  fresh  air,  glad  to  be  free.

           A  Cadillac  convertible  is  parked  across  the  street  with  his 
           childhood  pal  inside...  CARL,  41,  an  ex-Marine  with  a  Special 
           Forces  tattoo  on  his  arm.   Ray  smiles  and  heads  over. 

                                 RAY
                        You’re  moving  up  in  the  world.

                                 CARL
                        All  class,  baby.

           Ray  climbs  in.   Carl  drives  off,  still  trying  to  wrap  his 
           head  around  why  his  friend  opted  to  get  out  early.

           INT.  CADILLAC  -  DRIVING  -  DAY

                                 CARL
                        So  what  happened?   You  were  in  the 
                        red  zone.

                                 RAY
                        I  just  wanted  out,  that’s  all.

                                 CARL
                        So  you  get  back  into  bed  with 
                        Keating.   Don’t  bullshit  me.   What 
                        did  you  do?

                                 RAY
                        Nothing.

           Carl  looks  at  him,  waiting  for  more.  

           Ray  opens  the  window,  enjoying  the  breeze. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m  just  glad  to  be  out.
           EXT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  EAST  BOSTON,  MA  -  EVENING

           Carl  parks  across  the  street  from  Ray’s  old  childhood  house.  
           The  last  four  years  haven’t  been  kind.   The  paint’s  chipped 
           and  faded.   Joseph’s  Buick  sits  in  the  driveway.  

           Ray  grabs  his  duffle  bag.   Then  he  just  sits  there  not 
           wanting  to  get  out.   Carl  knows  what  he’s  thinking.

                                 CARL
                        How  long’s  it  been  since  you’ve  seen 
                        him?

                                 RAY
                        Few  years.   He  used  to  visit  a  lot  in 
                        the  beginning.  

           Carl  reaches  over  and  opens  the  glove  box.   Takes  out  a 
           silver  flask.   Beside  it  is  a  9MM.

                                 CARL
                        It’ll  smooth  out  the  edges.

           Ray  takes  a  couple  of  swigs  from  the  flask,  hands  it  back.  
           He  gets  out  and  Carl  drives  off.  

           Ray  stares  at  his  house.   The  lights  are  on.   He’s  more 
           nervous  about  going  inside  than  he  was  about  going  to  prison.

           A  police  helicopter  flies  by  overhead.   Sirens  in  the 
           distance.   Ray’s  now  more  aware  of  these  sounds  after  his 
           prison  stint.   It’s  not  how  he  remembered  it.  

           He  finally  picks  up  his  bag  and  heads  across  the  street.

           EXT./INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  CONTINUOUS  -  EVENING

           Ray  appears  at  the  side  door.   He  can  see  Joseph  through  the 
           screen  door  fixing  supper  in  between  beers.  

           Ray  knocks,  startling  him.   Joseph  unlocks  the  screen  door  to 
           let  Ray  in.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        The  hell’re  you  doing  here?  
                          (stiffens)
                        You  didn’t  escape,  did  you?

                                 RAY
                        Yeah,  I  tunneled  out.   Don’t  tell 
                        anyone. 

           Ray  tosses  his  bag  in  the  corner.   The  kitchen  is  old,  wood 
           paneling  from  the  80’s,  faded  wall  paper,  old  appliances.   He 
           can’t  help  but  feel  guilty  for  doing  this  to  Will.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOSEPH
                        Good  to  see  you  haven’t  lost  your 
                        sense  of  humor,  you’re  gonna  need  it.

                                 RAY
                        How’s  he  doing?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Today  was  a  bad  day.

                                 RAY
                        Where  is  he?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Upstairs.

           FOLLOW  Ray  as  he  walks  through  his  old  house  and  up  the 
           creaky  wooden  stairs  to  the  second  floor...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  WILLIAM’S  BEDROOM  -  CONTINUOUS  -  EVENING

           WILLIAM  CUTTER,  15,  is  in  the  process  of  building  a  model 
           version  of  the  Apollo  13.   He  glues  the  edge  of  the  solar 
           panel  with  razor  sharp  precision. 

           All  around  the  room  are  models  of  rockets  and  space  stations.  
           Plus  Red  Sox  memorabilia,  and  an  electric  guitar.  

           A  KNOCK  at  the  door,  he  looks  up.   Ray  peers  into  the  room.  
           Will  is  surprised  to  see  him.  

                                 RAY
                        Hey,  I  didn’t  mean  to  startle  you.

                                 WILL
                        How’d  you  get  out?

           Ray  steps  into  the  bedroom.

                                 RAY
                        They  let  me  out.

           An  awkward  beat.   Will  doesn’t  say  anything.   Ray  walks 
           around  the  room,  admiring  Will’s  models.   He  also  notices  a 
           wastebasket  beside  the  bed  for  sickness.

                                 RAY
                        You  got  some  real  talent.

           Will  looks  down  at  the  model  piece  in  his  hand,  his  father’s 
           trying  too  hard  and  it’s  coming  off  as  phony.  

           Nothing  Ray  says  now  would  seem  genuine  and  he  knows  it.

           Ray  picks  up  a  framed  picture  off  the  bureau  of  an  infant 
           Will  with  his  mother,  a  beautiful  tom-boyish  brunette,  KIM.  
           A  painful  memory  for  Ray.   He  puts  it  back  down.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Listen,  Will...

                                 WILL
                        Let’s  not  do  this,  alright?

                                 RAY
                        Do  what?

                                 WILL
                        The  whole  apology  thing.  

           Another  awkward  beat,  Ray  doesn’t  know  what  to  say.   Will 
           finally  turns  around  and  goes  back  to  gluing  the  model.  

           Ray  just  stands  there,  wondering  if  he’s  lost  his  son  for 
           good.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  HALLWAY  -  CONTINUOUS  -  EVENING

           Ray  exits  and  leans  against  the  wall.   The  door  slams  shut 
           beside  him,  capping  off  the  failed  conversation.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  DOWNSTAIRS  -  CONTINUOUS  -  EVENING

           Joseph  turns  off  the  TV  as  Ray  comes  downstairs.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Goodnight  

           Joseph  heads  up  to  his  bedroom.   Ray  walks  into  his  old 
           bedroom  on  the  first  floor.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  RAY’S  BEDROOM  -  EVENING

           Nothing’s  been  moved.   He  sits  on  the  bed.   Some  of  his  old 
           paintings  are  piled  in  the  corner.   He  opens  a  bedside  drawer 
           and  all  of  his  personal  items  are  still  there,  untouched.

           Hip  Hop  music  slowly  builds,  then  Ray  turns  and  heads  out... 

           EXT.  THE  PALACE  -  NIGHT

           A  massive  dance  club.   Three  floors  of  gigantic  rooms,  each 
           with  its  own  style  of  music.   Hard  Rock.   Disco.   Rap.

           This  is  where  everyone  from  21  on  up  goes  to  meet,  drink  and 
           do  drugs.   The  line  to  get  in  goes  around  the  block.  
           Everyone  passes  through  a  metal  detector  to  enter.

           Ray  drives  up  in  Joseph’s  Buick,  but  quickly  spots  two  BOSTON 
           PD  CRUISERS  parked  in  front  to  keep  any  violence  from 
           escalating.   He’d  rather  not  to  be  seen  in  this  environment, 
           so  he  drives  past  the  police  and  pulls  around  back.
           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  SIDE  DOOR  -  NIGHT

           Ray  picks  the  lock  and  enters.   A  SILENT  FLASHING  RED  LIGHT 
           goes  off  above  the  door  inside,  signalling  an  alarm.  

           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  NIGHT
        A26
                                                                    A26

           Ray  closes  the  door  behind  him.   The  place  is  packed.  
           Scantily  dressed  girls  and  gangsta  dressed  guys  are  all 
           trying  to  impress  and  intimidate.  

           Ray  zeros  in  on  the  security  cameras,  making  sure  his  face  is 
           seen  as  he  heads  up  the  staircase.

           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  2ND  FLOOR  -  NIGHT 

           By  this  time,  two  intimidating  Irish  bouncers,  FINN  and 
           COLLIN,  have  been  informed  in  their  earpieces...

           ...they  follow  Ray  as  he  weaves  his  way  through  the  party-
           goers,  catching  glimpses  of  drugs  being  passed  around  and 
           sexual  acts  being  performed  in  dark  corners.

           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  3RD  FLOOR  -  NIGHT

           Ray  spots  a  BLACK  DOOR  in  the  corner.   He  looks  up  at  the 
           camera  above  the  door  and  a  BUZZER  buzzes  him  in... 

           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  TOMMY’S  OFFICE  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           Ray  is  followed  in  by  Finn  and  Collin. 

           A  large  desk  sits  in  front  of  floor-to-ceiling  tinted  windows 
           overlooking  the  dance  floor.   Black  leather  couches  in  front 
           of  it.   Sports  memorabilia  scattered  around.   And  a  bank  of 
           TEN  SECURITY  MONITORS  keep  a  roaming  eye  on  the  place. 

                                 KEATING  (V.O.)
                        I  knew  you’d  come.

           TOMMY  KEATING,  late  40’s,  a  scary  and  unpredictable  ex-boxer 
           turned  businessman/drug  supplier,  with  a  short  fuse  and  even 
           less  patience,  exits  the  bathroom  zipping  his  pants.  

                                 KEATING
                        They  all  thought  you’d  run.   But  I 
                        said  Ray  Cutter’s  old  school,  you 
                        watch,  he’ll  walk  through  that  door 
                        within  twenty-four  hours  of  being  a 
                        free  man.   And  here  you  are.

           Keating  gestures  for  Ray  to  sit.   Ray  does.   Keating  pours 
           two  glasses  of  Scotch  at  the  bar.   He  hands  one  to  Ray.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEATING
                        So  why  the  claustrophobia?

                                 RAY
                        Just  got  tired  of  it  all.  
                          (changing  the  subject)

                        ‘Bout  a  year  ago.  

           A  BOUNCER  suddenly  appears  in  the  doorway,  gestures  to  Tommy.

                                 KEATING
                        Unbelievable.   Never  a  dull  moment 
                        ‘round  here.   I  gotta  deal  with  this.

           The  Bouncer  motions  for  Keating  to  check  out  Monitor  #4.

           ON  MONITOR  #4  -  We  see  a  MALE  BARTENDER,  27,  being  taken  away 
           by  two  Bouncers.   The  Bartender  looks  scared.

                                 KEATING
                        Look  at  this  Raymond.   What  do  you 
                        see?   What’s  wrong  with  this  picture?

           ON  MONITOR  #1  -  The  video  is  from  a  previous  day  catching  the 
           Bartender  skimming  money  from  the  register  during  closing.

           Keating  stops  the  video  and  shakes  his  head.

                                 KEATING
                        Entitlement.   That’s  what’s  wrong 
                        with  this  generation.   They  believe 
                        everyone  owes  them  something.   What 
                        happened  to  good  old  fashioned  hard 
                        work?   I  compensate  them  well, 
                        empower  them,  nurture  their  talents, 
                        and  in  return...  they  embarrass  me.

           Keating  now  notices  Ray  staring  at... 

           MONITOR  #6  -  which  shows  the  back  alley  where  the  Bartender 
           is  left  barely  alive  after  his  violent  beating.

           Keating  turns  back  to  Ray,  who’s  staring  at  him  now.

                                 KEATING
                        Don’t  look  at  me  like  that  Ray,  with 
                        that  holier  than  thou  stare.   I  can 
                        end  you.  

           Ray’s  not  looking  for  trouble,  he  finishes  his  drink  and 
           places  his  empty  glass  on  the  table.  

                                 KEATING
                        So  let’s  discuss  our  new  partnership.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 RAY
                        Listen  Tommy,  I  appreciate  what  you 
                        did.   And  you  know  I’ll  pay  you  back.  
                        But  I  need  some  time.

           Keating  stares  at  Ray  a  tense  moment...  then  he  gets  up  and 
           removes  an  ART  BOOK  from  the  bookshelf.   Hands  it  to  Ray.  

                                 KEATING
                        Time’s  one  thing  I  don’t  have  Ray.

           Ray  opens  the  book  to  the  page  marked  off  and  sees  the  RENOIR 
           PAINTING  that’s  circled.

                                 RAY
                        A  Renoir?   You’re  out  of  your  mind.

                                 KEATING
                        Not  just  any  Renoir...  “Woman  At  The 
                        Piano”.

                                 RAY
                        It’s  too  high  profile.   Besides,  last 
                        I  checked  it  was  at  the  Art  Institute 
                        Of  Chicago.

                                 KEATING
                        That’s  right.   But  in  three  weeks 
                        it’ll  be  on  display  here  at  the 
                        Museum  Of  Fine  Arts.  

                                 RAY
                        Three  weeks?   That’s  impossible.  
                        Nobody  can  make  that.

                                 KEATING
                        You  can.   And  I’ve  got  the  museum 
                        schematics,  security  codes,  guard 
                        shifts,  everything  you’ll  need.

                                 RAY
                        I’m  not  a  thief  Tommy.

                                 KEATING
                        You’ll  figure  it  out.  

                                 RAY
                        Look  Tommy,  I  wish  I  could  help,  but 
                        I  can’t  do  this  right  now.

           Keating  closes  his  eyes,  like  he’s  losing  his  patience.

                                 KEATING
                        Okay  Ray,  if  you  really  can’t  do  it, 
                        then  I  make  a  phone  call  and  you  go 
                        back  to  prison.

           Ray  stares  at  Keating,  he  knows  he’ll  do  it.  
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 KEATING
                        I  need  an  answer.

           Ray  looks  at  the  art  book.  

                                 KEATING
                        You  have  forty-eight  hours.  

           Ray  gets  up  and  heads  out  the  door,  not  happy  with  himself.  

           INT.  THE  PALACE  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           Ray  exits  and  approaches  the  staircase.   At  the  bottom  of  the 
           stairs,  CATHERINE,  32,  in  a  short  skirt  and  tank  top,  spots 
           Ray  exit  Tommy’s  office  and  walk  down  the  stairs.

           She  cuts  Ray  off  as  he  heads  for  the  side  door.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Hey.   Want  to  buy  me  a  drink?

           Ray  takes  in  her  mascara  and  bright  red  lipstick  and  he  feels 
           sorry  for  her.

                                 CATHERINE
                        I  haven’t  seen  you  around  here 
                        before.   I’m  Catherine.

                                 RAY
                        Ray.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Nice  to  meet  you  Ray.

           She  slips  her  arm  under  his.

                                 CATHERINE
                        You  know  Tommy?  
                          (off  Ray’s  look)
                        I  saw  you  come  out  of  his  office.

                                 RAY
                        How  do  you  know  Tommy?

                                 CATHERINE
                        He  likes  to  have  pretty  girls  around 
                        here.   Treats  us  well.   You?

                                 RAY
                        He’s  an  old  friend.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yeah?   How  about  you  and  I  get  out  of 
                        here  and  have  some  fun?

           Ray  considers  the  offer,  looks  around,  then  he  nods  and  leads 
           her  out  the  side  door  of  the  Palace.   Catherine  smiles.  
           EXT.  THE  PALACE  -  SIDE  DOOR  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           But  once  outside,  Ray  removes  her  arm  and  looks  at  her.

                                 RAY
                        This  really  the  life  you  want? 

                                 CATHERINE
                          (taken  aback)
                        What?   Who  are  you  to...

           He  turns  her  around  to  face  his  driver’s  side  window  and  see 
           her  own  reflection.   Catherine  looks  at  her  overly  made  up 
           reflection,  then  she  pulls  away  from  him,  clearly  upset.

                                 RAY
                        Go  home.  

           She  stands  there,  rattled,  as  Ray  drives  off.   Once  he’s 
           gone,  she  tries  the  side  door  and  she’s  locked  out.   That’s 
           what  he  wanted,  to  get  her  out  of  there.  

           Off  her  look,  we...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  MORNING

           Will  walks  into  the  kitchen.   Ray’s  making  pancakes.

                                 RAY
                        You  hungry?

                                 WILL
                        Not  for  pancakes.

                                 RAY
                        Alright.   How  about  eggs?

           Will  ignores  him  and  pours  himself  a  bowl  of  cereal.

                                 WILL
                        Where’s  grandpa?

                                 RAY
                        Out.   I’ll  be  taking  you  in  today.

           Will’s  disappointed.   He  starts  shoveling  sugar  onto  his 
           cereal.

                                 RAY
                        Too  much  sugar’s  not  good  for  you.

           Will  shoots  him  a  look  like,  I’m  dying  you  idiot.
           INT.  BOSTON  MEMORIAL  HOSPITAL  -  DAY

           DR.  ANNE  WALLACE,  40’s,  shows  Ray  Will’s  test  results.   She 
           circles  a  dark  mass  on  the  MRI  scan.

           In  the  b.g.,  Will  can  be  seen  undergoing  tests.   Ray  can’t 
           help  tossing  him  a  look  every  once  and  a  while.

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        Because  of  its  location  in  the 
                        cranial  nerves  we’re  unable  to  remove 
                        it  surgically.

           Ray  studies  the  MRI,  trying  to  process  it  all.

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        We  believe  chemotherapy  might 
                        decrease  its  size,  but  it  won’t 
                        eradicate  the  tumor.   And  before  we 
                        can  proceed  we  do  need  your  parental 
                        consent. 

           Ray  nods.   Still  staring  at  the  MRI.   All  he  can  do  is  nod. 
           Dr.  Wallace  isn’t  sure  he’s  understanding  it  all.

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        I’m  sorry  Mr.  Cutter,  I  know  this  is 
                        difficult.  Do  you  have  any  questions? 

                                 RAY
                        So  what’s  the  game  plan?

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        The  game  plan?  

           She  looks  at  him  blankly  and  he  gets  his  answer  in  her  eyes. 
           Ray  feels  like  he  was  just  kicked  in  the  gut.   He  looks  back 
           at  Will.   The  reality  of  what  she’s  saying  is  now  sinking  in.

                                 RAY
                        Will  he  be  in  pain?

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        We  have  medication  for  that.   But  it 
                        could  also  be  very  peaceful.   One  day 
                        he  might  just  go  to  sleep  and  not 
                        wake  up.   Just  make  him  comfortable.

           Off  Ray,  nodding  again...

           INT.  BUICK  -  DRIVING  HOME  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  sit  in  silence  at  a  red  light.  

                                 WILL
                        What  did  Dr.  Wallace  say?  
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        About  what? 

           Ray  hits  the  car  horn  to  signal  the  vehicle  in  front  of  him 
           but  no  sounds  comes  out.

                                 RAY
                        What  the  hell  happened  to  the  horn?

                                 WILL
                        Grandpa  took  it  out.   He  hit  it  so 
                        much  he  sprained  his  wrist.

                                 RAY
                        Why  doesn’t  that  surprise  me.

                                 WILL
                        About  the  chemo,  will  it  cure  me?

                                 RAY
                          (caught  off  guard)
                        Well,  she  said  it  all  depends  on  you.  
                        You  need  to  stay  positive  and  strong.  

           Will  considers  this  and  looks  out  the  window.   Ray  feels 
           guilty  for  lying,  but  he  doesn’t  know  what  else  to  say.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  LIVING  ROOM  -  NIGHT

           Joseph,  Ray  and  Will  are  watching  “Angels  With  Dirty  Faces”  
           on  TV.   Ray  and  Joseph  are  drinking  beers.

           ON TV - It’s  near  the  end  when  Father  Connolly  (Pat  O’Brien) 
           visits  Rocky  Sullivan  (James  Cagney)  in  his  prison  cell 
           before  his  execution  to  persuade  him  to  go  out  “yella”  in 
           order  to  sway  idolizing  kids  away  from  a  life  of  crime.

           Joseph  downs  the  rest  of  his  beer  then  pulls  another  one  from 
           the  mini-cooler  beside  the  recliner.   He  cracks  it  open.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll  take  one  of  those.

           Joseph  digs  another  beer  out  and  tosses  it  to  Will.   Ray 
           catches  it  in  mid-air.   Gives  his  father  a  look.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What  are  you  doing?   Let  the  kid  have 
                        a  beer  for  Christ’s  sake.

           Will  stares  at  Ray,  waiting  for  him  to  make  up  his  mind.   A 
           beat,  then  Ray  twists  off  the  cap  and  hands  Will  the  beer.  
           The  teenager  takes  a  sip.   Settles  back  into  the  movie.

           ON TV - Rocky  Sullivan  goes  to  the  electric  chair  crying  and 
           sobbing,  and  we  don’t  know  if  it’s  an  act  or  not.

                        That  ending  always  gets  me.

           Ray  and  Will  take  another  pull  off  their  beers.

           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  LATE  NIGHT

           It’s  last  call  at  an  upscale  Irish  restaurant/pub.   Ray  and 
           Carl  are  closing  the  place.   They’ve  had  a  lot  to  drink.

                                 CARL
                        Fifteen  years  old.   Damn.   His  life 
                        hasn’t  even  begun  yet.

           Carl  takes  another  swig  off  his  beer.   DAPHNE,  36,  Carl’s 
           girlfriend,  enters  the  restaurant  to  close  out  the  register.  

           She  wears  an  OLD  PAIR  OF  BEAT  UP  GLASSES  and  her  eyes  light 
           up  when  she  sees  Ray.   She  walks  over  and  gives  him  a  hug.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Raymond  J.  Cutter.   What  are  you 
                        doing  here?  

                                 RAY
                        Thought  I’d  come  by.   You  look  great.

                                 DAPHNE
                        So  do  you.   I  can’t  believe  they  let 
                        you  out  early.

                                 RAY
                        Good  behavior.

                                 DAPHNE
                        You?   Good  behavior?   Ha.  
                          (beat,  becoming  serious)
                        I  heard  about  Will,  Ray.   I’m  truly 
                        sorry,  if  there’s  anything  I  can  do, 
                        please  don’t  hesitate. 

           Ray  nods,  thanks.

                                 DAPHNE
                        Are  you  hungry?   Can  I  make  you 
                        something? 

                                 RAY
                        No  thanks.   I’m  good.

                                 CARL
                        I’ll  have  a  hamburger.

           She  doesn’t  even  acknowledge  Carl.
           CONTINUED:

                                 DAPHNE
                        Holler  if  you  change  your  mind.  

           Daphne  ignores  Carl  and  walks  off,  heading  into  her  office.

                                 RAY
                        What  was  that  about?

                                 CARL
                        She’s  still  angry  about  last  night.

                                 RAY
                        What  did  you  do  to  her  last  night?

                                 CARL
                        I  drank  her  contacts.

                                 RAY
                        You  what?

                                 CARL
                        They  were  in  a  glass  of  water  beside 
                        the  bed.   She  said  she  told  me  three 
                        times  they  were  there.   I  was  drunk, 
                        I  don’t  remember.   I  woke  up,  it  was 
                        late  and  I  was  thirsty.   I’ve 
                        apologized  like  fifty  times  already.

           Ray  can’t  help  but  laugh.

                                 CARL
                        That’s  it,  laugh  it  up.   Aren’t  you 
                        supposed  to  see  Keating  tomorrow, 
                        isn’t  that  what  you  told  me?

                                 RAY
                        Let  him  wait.

                                 CARL
                        You  know  you  can’t  trust  him.

                                 RAY
                        I  can’t  think  about  that  right  now.  

                                 CARL
                        Alright,  well,  is  there  anything  Will 
                        wants  right  now?  What  would  you  want?

                                 RAY
                        What  I’ve  always  wanted.   To  lie  in  a 
                        hammock  on  a  tropical  beach  and  drink 
                        Mai-Tai’s  all  day.

                                 CARL
                        Maybe  that’s  what  he  wants  too.  

           Ray  kills  his  beer,  considering  this. 
           INT.  BOSTON  MEMORIAL  HOSPITAL  -  WAITING  ROOM  -  MORNING

           Ray  sits  with  Will  waiting  for  his  first  chemo  treatment.  
           Other  sick  children  sit  around  with  their  parents.   They 
           aren’t  lost  on  Ray  but  he  tries  to  shut  them  out  emotionally. 

           Then  the  Make-A-Wish  Foundation  gathers  outside  a  YOUNG 
           GIRL’s  room  down  the  hall.   The  Press  are  taking  pictures  of 
           the  SICK  GIRL  with  her  idol,  a  Lady  Gaga-like  Pop  Star.  

           Ray  gets  a  kick  out  of  it.

                                 RAY
                        Look  at  that.

           Will  tosses  a  quick  glance  in  the  girl’s  direction  down  the 
           hall,  then  goes  back  to  his  magazine.  

                                 RAY
                        That’s  a  nice  thing  they  do.
                          (turns  to  Will,  awkwardly)
                        There  anyone  famous  you’d  like  to 
                        meet?

           Will  looks  up  at  Ray,  puts  two-and-two  together.

                                 WILL
                        Don’t  even  think  of  signing  me  up  for 
                        that.

                                 RAY
                        Why  not?   Seems  nice.

                                 WILL
                        It’s  not,  it’s  embarrassing.   I  don’t 
                        want  to  go  to  Disney  World,  or  meet 
                        Tom  Brady.   That’s  just  pathetic.

                                 RAY
                        Okay,  is  there  anything  you  want  to 
                        do  then?

                                 WILL
                        No,  and  don’t  ask  me  any  more  stupid 
                        questions.  

           Ray  leans  back,  shut  down.   He  realizes  the  apple  doesn’t 
           fall  far  from  the  tree.  

           An  ATTRACTIVE  NURSE  approaches  Will.

                                 NURSE
                        Hi  handsome.   You  been  waiting  long?

           Will  shakes  his  head,  blushing.   He  has  a  crush  on  the  Nurse. 
           He  follows  her  into  the  room.  
           CONTINUED:

           Down  the  hall,  the  Pop  Star  starts  singing  “Happy  Birthday” 
           to  the  Sick  Girl.   The  Sick  Girl’s  all  smiles,  having  fun.  
           Giving  her  a  brief  moment  of  relief  from  her  problems.

           Off  Ray,  trying  to  figure  out  how  he  can  do  that  for  Will...

           INT.  BUICK  -  DRIVING  HOME  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  sit  in  silence.   Will  seems  weaker  from  his 
           first  chemo  treatment.   Ray  feels  the  need  to  say  something.

                                 RAY
                        Hey...  What  if  I  did  that  wish  thing?  

                                 WILL
                        Not  this  again.

                                 RAY
                        I  mean  it.   What  if  I  gave  you  a 
                        wish?   Or  three.   Like  a  genie.

                                 WILL
                        A  genie?   Jesus  Christ.

                                 RAY
                        Hey,  come  on.   I’m  serious.   Anything 
                        you  want.

           Will  laughs  at  the  absurdity  of  his  father’s  request.

                                 WILL
                        You’d  never  follow  through  with  it.

                                 RAY
                        Let  me  surprise  you.  

           Will  decides  to  call  his  father’s  bluff.

                                 WILL
                        Alright,  I  wish  I  didn’t  have  cancer.

           Will  looks  at  Ray  for  him  to  fulfill  this  and  Ray  doesn’t 
           know  how  to  respond. 

                                 WILL
                        That’s  what  I  thought.

           Off  Ray,  frustrated  and  embarrassed,  that  didn’t  work  out.

                        Maybe,  but  we  need  more  evidence  to 
                        put  him  away.   He’s  slippery,  he’s 
                        got  money  and  lots  of  friends  hiding

                        solid.

           INT.  DENNY’S  RESTAURANT  -  AFTERNOON

           Ray  and  Will  are  having  lunch  in  silence.   Will  eyes  a  FAMILY 
           laughing  at  a  nearby  table.   A  little  envious  of  them.

           While  at  the  same  time  two  cute  GIRLS  in  the  next  booth  are 
           checking  him  out.   The  girls  giggle  and  gossip  about  him.  
           Flirting  the  way  teenagers  do.  

           Will  ignores  them,  uninterested.   Ray  remembers  the  nurse.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Those  two  girls  are  checking  you  out.

                                 WILL
                        Let  it  go,  dad.   It’s  not  like  I’m 
                        gonna  ask  them  out  on  a  date.

                                 RAY
                        Who  said  anything  about  a  date?

           Will  looks  up  at  his  father  wondering  if  he’s  implying  what 
           he  thinks  he’s  implying.   Ray  raises  his  eyebrows.   He  is.  

           Will  shakes  his  head  and  goes  back  to  eating.

                                 RAY
                        C’mon,  lighten  up,  I  was  just  joking.
                        Whatever  happened  to  that  girlfriend 
                        of  yours?   What  was  her  name?   Tracy?  

                                 WILL
                        How  do  you  know  about  her?

                                 RAY
                        Your  grandfather  told  me.   I  asked 
                        about  you  all  the  time  when  I  was 
                        away.

           Will  considers  this  a  beat,  then...

                                 WILL
                        Tricia.  

                                 RAY
                        How  long  did  you  and  Tricia  go  out?

                                 WILL
                        Dad...   Can  we  drop  it?

           ANGLE  -  OPPOSITE  BOOTH

           Finn  and  Collin  slide  into  the  booth.   Ray  almost  chokes  on 
           his  burger  when  he  spots  them.   Finn  motions  for  Ray  to  join 
           him  in  the  Men’s  Room.

           BACK  WITH  WILL

           Will  lowers  his  head,  gathering  up  the  courage  to  ask  his 
           father  something.

                                 WILL
                        Dad...

                                 RAY
                        I’ll  be  right  back.

           Ray  gets  up,  cutting  Will  off.   Will  is  left  sitting  there 
           red-faced. 
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Ray  follows  Finn  through  the  restaurant.   He  notices  Finn 
           shift  his  GUN  to  the  front  of  his  waistband.   

           INT.  DENNY’S  RESTAURANT  -  MEN’S  ROOM  -  CONTINUOUS  -  AFTERNOON

           Finn  is  waiting  at  the  sink,  his  gun  is  in  clear  view 
           sticking  out  of  his  pants  waist  when  Ray  walks  in.

                                 FINN
                        Guess  what  day  it  is,  Cutter?  
                        Keating  wants  to  see  you.   Now.

                                 RAY
                        I’m  having  lunch  with  my  son.   Tell 
                        Tommy  I’ll  come  by  later  today.

           Ray  turns  to  leave,  but  Finn  grabs  his  arm,  and  that’s  it... 

           ...Ray  SLAMS  Finn’s  face  into  the  wall.   Finn  fights  back  and 
           it’s  messy  in  this  cramped  space.   Missed  punches,  elbows, 
           knees...  Ray  finally  gets  his  arm  around  Finn’s  neck  and 
           squeezes.   Finn’s  turning  blue,  the  gun  drops  from  his  hand.  

                                 RAY
                        I  ever  see  either  of  you  around  my 
                        kid  again  I’ll  break  both  your  necks.  

           Finn  blacks  out  and  slumps  to  the  floor.   Ray  drags  him  into 
           a  stall  and  then  exits.

           INT.  DENNY’S  RESTAURANT  -  CONTINUOUS  -  AFTERNOON

           Ray  sits  down  like  nothing’s  wrong,  picks  up  his  hamburger.

                                 WILL
                        What  happened?   That  guy  followed  you 
                        into  the  bathroom.   Who  was  he?

                                 RAY
                        What  guy?

           Will  sighs.   He  picks  up  his  tray  and  stands.   Ray  feels 
           horrible  for  lying.   He  gets  up  and  follows  Will  over  to  the 
           trash  bin.   As  Will  empties  his  tray,  Ray  comes  clean.

                                 RAY
                        Alright.   I  owe  his  boss  money.   He 
                        came  by  to  remind  me.

           This  gets  Will’s  attention,  he  turns  to  Ray.

                                 WILL
                        How  much  money?

                                 RAY
                        Forty  thousand.
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Holy  shit.   Where  is  it?

                                 RAY
                        I  had  him  use  it  to  bribe  a  judge  so 
                        I  could  get  out  early  to  see  you.

           Will  processes  this  as  he  stacks  his  empty  tray.  

           EXT.  DENNY’S  RESTAURANT  -  PARKING  LOT  -  CONTINUOUS  -  AFTERNOON

           Ray  opens  the  car  door  of  the  Buick  for  Will.   Will  just 
           stands  there.   He  doesn’t  get  in.   He  turns  to  his  father.

                                 WILL
                        I  want  to  meet  my  mother.

                                 RAY
                        Your  mother?   C’mon  Will,  the  two  of 
                        us  just  didn’t  work  out.   It  was  no 
                        one’s  fault.   Your  mother  loved  you  a 
                        lot.   She  just  couldn’t  stick  around.

                                 WILL
                        Okay,  but  I  still  wanna  meet  her.

                                 RAY
                        I  don’t  have  a  clue  where  she  is.

                                 WILL
                        You  said  she  married  a  doctor  in  New 
                        York.  

                                 RAY
                        Exactly.   New  York.

                                 WILL
                        Well  find  her.   That’s  my  first  wish.

           So  that’s  what  this  is  about.

                                 RAY
                        Listen,  Will...  when  I  offered  you 
                        the  wishes,  I  meant...

                                 WILL
                        I  knew  you  didn’t  mean  it.

                                 RAY
                        I did  mean  it.

                                 WILL
                        Then  that’s  my  first  wish.   I’m  not 
                        changing  it.

           Now  Will  gets  into  the  car.   Ray  shuts  the  door.
           EXT.  BOSTON  POLICE  STATION  -  PARKING  LOT  -  EVENING

           Det.  Paisley  is  leaving  for  the  night.   She  approaches  her 
           car,  when  Det.  Dougherty  hurries  over  with  a  file. 

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        Hey,  here’s  your  guy...  

           Paisley  takes  the  file  and  sees  a  MUG  SHOT  of  a  young  Raymond 
           Cutter  paper-clipped  to  the  front.

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        Name’s  Raymond  Cutter.   Served  time 
                        for  forging  art.   Hit  the  street  a 
                        few  days  ago.   Got  out  ten  months 
                        early  on  good  behavior.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        A  forger?   Now  there’s  something  you 
                        don’t  see  every  day.   So  what,  he 
                        paints  paintings?

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        I  guess.   His  father  Joseph  was  a 
                        petty  thief.   Did  stretches  all  over 
                        the  Eastern  Seaboard. 

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Nice  family.   So  what’s  his 
                        connection  to  Keating?  

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        No  idea,  but  didn’t  he  break  his 
                        parole  just  by  being  in  Keating’s 
                        presence?   Couldn’t  we  leverage  him 
                        to  flip  on  Keating?  

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        It’s  too  early.   We  don’t  know 
                        enough.   But  let’s  stay  close  to 
                        Cutter.  

           Off  Paisley,  staring  at  Ray’s  rap  sheet...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  WILL’S  BEDROOM  -  HALLWAY  -  NIGHT

           Ray  walks  by  Will’s  door,  sees  the  light  on.   He  peers  in  and 
           Will  is  lying  on  the  bed,  staring  at  the  ceiling.   He’s 
           unable  to  sleep,  there’s  a  lot  on  his  mind.

           Ray  wants  to  go  in  and  talk  to  him,  but  he  hesitates,  not 
           knowing  what  to  say.   He  stand  there  a  beat.   Uncomfortable.  

           Then  he  walks  into  his  old  bedroom...
           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  RAY’S  BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

           Ray  opens  his  closet  to  reveal  an  old  locker.   He  opens  it 
           and  inside  is  his  old  painting  equipment...  professional 
           brushes,  paints,  palette,  scraping  tools,  an  easel,  etc. 

           He  looks  at  everything...  almost  like  an  alcoholic  staring  at 
           an  open  liquor  bottle.   He’s  tempted.   Scared.   Distrustful.

           Finally,  he  closes  the  locker,  takes  his  keys  out  of  his 
           pocket  and  heads  out...  his  mind  made  up.

           INT.  KEATING’S  PENTHOUSE  -  DOWNTOWN  BOSTON  -  NIGHT

           Finn  opens  the  door  and  Ray  enters.   He  glares  at  Ray, 
           wanting  to  finish  the  fight  they  started  earlier.   But  Ray 
           ignores  him  as  he  steps  into  the  living  room.  

           The  place  is  spectacular.  Ray  admires  the  view  of  the  city...

           ...just  as  the  bedroom  doors  open  and  Keating  walks  out 
           wearing  a  silk  bathrobe  and  smoking  a  joint.   He’s  followed 
           by  two  half-naked  ATTRACTIVE  CLUB  GIRLS,  stoned  and  having 
           fun  dancing  to  hip-hop  music  coming  from  the  bedroom.  

                                 KEATING
                        Raymond.   Come  in...  sit...

           Ray  sits  on  the  couch  across  from  Keating.  

           The  girls  head  over  to  the  bar  and  mix  themselves  a  drink, 
           laughing  and  not  paying  them  any  attention.

                                 KEATING
                        My  apologies  about  today.   I  can 
                        assure  you  Finn  acted  on  his  own  and 
                        I  don’t  blame  you  for  setting  him 
                        straight.  

                                 RAY
                        This  buyer,  how  solid  is  he?

                                 KEATING
                        Very.   Don’t  worry  about  him.

                                 RAY
                        I  am  worried.   This  is  a  Renoir, and 
                        if  he  runs  a  traffic  light  with  that 
                        painting  in  his  trunk,  we’re  fucked.  

                                 KEATING
                        He’s  a  professional.  

                                 RAY
                        Then  why  not  just  steal  it?   Why  do 
                        you  have  to  forge  it?
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEATING
                        You  know  how  these  eccentric  rich 
                        guys  are.   They  like  their  secrets, 
                        and  they  also  don’t  like  looking  over 
                        their  shoulder.   So  he  sits  in  his 
                        hidden  room  in  his  Italian  Villa  and 
                        masturbates  to  his  secret  art 
                        collection.   All  I  know  is  he  wants 
                        that  painting  without  anyone  knowing. 

                                 RAY
                        So  why  can’t  he  wait  a  few  months?

           Keating  sighs,  avoiding  answering.   Ray  now  gets  it.

                                 RAY
                        You’re  the  one  who  can’t  wait.   Why?  
                        What  happened?  

           Keating  knows  Ray’s  not  going  to  let  this  go.

                                 KEATING
                        One  of  my  delivery  men  got  busted 
                        with  a  heavy  shipment  and  lost  the 
                        entire  load.   Now  I  owe  for  it.  

           Ray  considers  this,  he  has  no  other  angles  to  play  and  he  has 
           no  choice  but  to  do  this...  he  finally  relents...

                                 RAY
                        I’ll  need  a  painting  of  the  same  size 
                        and  from  the  same  year.   So  when  I 
                        find  it,  I’ll  let  you  know  the  cost 
                        and  you  be  ready  to  buy  it.  

           Keating  nods,  pleased.   Ray  gets  up  and  heads  for  the  door.

           The  girls  turn  the  music  up  and  start  dancing  with  each  other 
           seductively.   They  pull  Keating  off  the  couch  to  join  them.

                                 KEATING
                        You  sure  you  don’t  want  to  stay  Ray?  
                        You  can  take  your  pick.

                                 RAY
                        I’ll  get  back  to  you  with  the  other 
                        details.   Just  be  ready.

           Keating  smiles,  relieved,  like  a  weight  has  just  been  lifted.  

                                 KEATING
                        Feels  like  old  times  again,  doesn’t 
                        it  Ray?

           Ray  walks  out,  hating  himself  for  getting  back  into  business 
           with  this  snake.
           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  RAY’S  BEDROOM  -  MORNING

           Ray  wakes  up  with  an  art  book  on  Renoir  lying  on  his  stomach.  
           The  book  is  open  to  a  page  on  the  “Woman  At  The  Piano”.   He 
           fell  asleep  reading  about  the  painting.   He  gets  up...

           Ray’s  on  the  phone...

                                 RAY
                        Is  this  the  Copley  Art  Gallery?

                                 ART  GALLERY  MANAGER  (V.O.)
                        It  is.   How  can  I  help  you?

                                 RAY
                        I  heard  you  carry  a  few  pieces  of 
                        French  art.   I’m  looking  for 
                        something  specific,  the  year  1875.  
                        It’s  for  my  wife.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  BATHROOM  -  MORNING

           Will’s  brushing  his  teeth,  but  stops  when  he  hears  Ray  say, 
           “It’s  for  my  wife”.   He  peers  out  of  the  bathroom  to  listen.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  MORNING

                                 RAY
                        Great.   I’d  appreciate  it.   Call  me 
                        back  if  you  find  something.

           Joseph  appears  behind  Will,  sees  him  listening  in.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Let’s  go.   You  ready?

           Will  quickly  finishes  up.

           EXT.  GROCERY  STORE  -  PARKING  LOT  -  DAY

           Joseph  and  Will  exit  the  store  with  bags  of  groceries  and  a 
           case  of  beer.   As  they  walk  through  the  parking  lot...

                                 WILL
                        What  was  Grandma  like?

           Joseph  is  caught  off  guard  by  the  question.
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOSEPH
                        Your  grandmother  was  a  saint.   She 
                        never  lied,  never  gossiped,  and  she’d 
                        give  you  the  last  dime  in  her  pocket 
                        if  you  needed  it.   I’ve  never  met  a 
                        nicer  human  being.   She  didn’t 
                        deserve  to  suffer  as  bad  as  she  did.

           Will  considers  this  as  they  stop  at  their  car.

                                 WILL
                        How  old  was  my  dad  when  she  died?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Four.  

                                 WILL
                        Then  he  never  knew  her?

           Joseph  shakes  his  head,  regretting  this.   He  opens  the  trunk 
           and  places  his  bags  inside.

                                 WILL
                        So  it  was  just  you  two?   Did  you  guys 
                        get  along?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yeah,  it  was  a  constant  party.   What 
                        is  this?  

                                 WILL
                        Nothing,  just  wondering.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Wondering  what?

                                 WILL
                        I  never  see  you  guys  hug  or  say  you 
                        love  each  other.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Guys  don’t  do  that.   He  already 
                        knows.

                                 WILL
                        You  sure?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hell,  I  never  even  told  your 
                        grandmother  that.   But  she  knew.  
                        Words  don’t  mean  shit  in  this  world.  
                        Remember  that.   It’s  what  a  person 
                        does  for  you  that  counts.

           Will  places  his  bags  inside.   Joseph  slams  the  trunk  shut.
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WILL
                        What  about  my  Mom?   You  ever  meet 
                        her?

           This  stops  Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Is  that  what  this  is  about?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah,  Dad  asked  what  I  wanted  and  I 
                        said  I  wanted  to  meet  her  but  he  blew 
                        me  off.

           Joseph  shakes  his  head.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Get  in  the  car.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Carl  have  schematics  on  the  Museum  Of  Fine  Arts 
           spread  out  on  the  coffee  table.

                                 CARL
                        This  looks  difficult.   How  much  time?

                                 RAY
                        Two  weeks  from  now.   Your  opinion?

                                 CARL
                        Well  my  opinion  is  you  need  my  help.  

           The  back  door  opens,  Will  and  Joseph  enter  with  groceries...  

           Ray  does  his  best  to  ditch  the  plans,  but  Will  spots  the  Art 
           Book  and  Museum  schematics  before  Ray  hides  them. 

                                 RAY
                        You  guys  are  back  early.

           Joseph  shoots  Ray  a  look,  it’s  obvious  Ray’s  up  to  no  good 
           once  again.   Joseph  takes  the  groceries  from  Will.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        Will.   Upstairs.   Now.

           Will  can  sense  the  serious  tone  in  his  grandfather’s  voice, 
           so  he  hurries  upstairs.   Carl  knows  Ray’s  in  deep  shit.  

                                 CARL
                        Give  me  a  call  tomorrow.

           Carl  quickly  exits  out  the  front  door.
           EXT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  OUT  BACK  -  DAY 

           Ray  and  Joseph  are  outside  so  Will  doesn’t  hear  them.   Ray 
           just  finished  admitting  his  situation  to  Joseph...

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  knew  you  were  up  to  something,  Ray.  
                        And  now  you  tell  me  it’s  Tommy 
                        Keating!   Of  all  the  fucking 
                        people...

                                 RAY
                        What  was  I  supposed  to  do  Pop?   Tell 
                        me.

           Joseph  paces  the  backyard,  he  knows  Ray  had  no  choice,  but  he 
           still  doesn’t  want  to  accept  it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Take  Will  and  go.   Get  out  of  town.

                                 RAY
                        I  can’t,  Keating’s  got  people 
                        watching  every  move  I  make.  

           Joseph  runs  his  hand  through  his  hair,  trying  to  control  his 
           anger.   Finally,  he  stops  pacing  and  gives  Ray  a  look.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        You  should’ve  stayed  inside.   Now 
                        you’re  just  gonna  hurt  him  more.

                                 RAY
                        I  can  handle  this.   It’s  not  gonna 
                        affect  Will.

                                 JOSEPH
                        No?   Well  what  about  offering  to  find 
                        his  mother?   Think  that’s  gonna 
                        affect  him  when  you  don’t  deliver?

           Ray  is  floored  by  this,  he  has  nothing  to  say  to  that.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Four  years  I  been  here  Ray,  and  now 
                        you  walk  back  in  and  crush  what 
                        little  dreams  he  has  left.

           Ray’s  about  to  defend  himself,  but  Joseph  shakes  his  head.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  don’t  want  to  hear  it.

           Joseph  heads  into  the  house,  ending  the  conversation.

           Ray  looks  up  and  catches  Will  pull  away  from  the  window  out 
           of  sight.   He  just  heard  everything.   Ray  feels  awful.  
           CONTINUED:

           He’s  about  to  head  inside  to  talk  to  Will...  when  his  CELL 
           RINGS.   He  sees  the  number  and  has  to  answer  it.  

                                 RAY
                        Yeah.

                                 ART  GALLERY  MANAGER  (V.O.)
                        Mr.  Chambers? 

                                 RAY
                        Speaking.

                                 ART  GALLERY  MANAGER  (V.O.)
                        This  is  Gerry  at  the  Copley  Art 
                        Gallery.   I  found  a  collector  in 
                        Connecticut.   His  name’s  Jonathan 
                        Durance.   He  has  a  painting  that  fits 
                        your  description  and  for  a  reasonable 
                        price.   Here’s  his  number...

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  SOUTH  BOSTON  -  EVENING

           Ray  parks  the  Buick  in  front  of  a  trashy  tattoo  parlor  next 
           to  a  strip  mall.   He  gets  out,  looks  nervous.   He  doesn’t 
           want  to  re-open  this  chapter  of  his  life  again.

           INT.  THE  INKWELL  -  CONTINUOUS  -  EVENING

           Ray  enters.   The  only  one  here  is  a  tough  looking  tattoo 
           artist  wiping  down  the  counter.   He’s  covered  with  ink  up  and 
           down  his  arms  and  neck.   Meet  RODNEY.  

                                 RODNEY
                        We’re  closed,  pal.

                                 RAY
                        Rodney?   I’m  Ray,  Kim  Cutter’s  ex-
                        husband.   You  remember  me?

           Ray  holds  his  hand  out  for  Rodney  to  shake.   Rodney 
           recognizes  him  and  scoffs.  

                                 RODNEY
                        What  the  hell  do  you  want?

                                 RAY
                        I’m  looking  for  Kim.

                                 RODNEY
                          (a  little  too  fast)
                        I  haven’t  seen  that  bitch  in  years.

           Ray  sighs,  he  knows  he’s  lying.   He  tries  to  reason  with  him.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        C’mon  Rodney,  I  just  need  to  know 
                        where  she  is.  

                                 RODNEY
                        Get  the  fuck  outta  here.

                                 RAY
                        I’m  not  going  anywhere  until  you  tell 
                        me  where  I  can  find  my  ex-wife.

           Rodney  WHISTLES  and  THREE  OF  HIS  BUDDIES  walk  out  of  the  back 
           room.   These  guys  are  big  and  crazy  looking.  

                                 RAY
                        Look,  I  don’t  want  any  trouble.

           Rodney  pulls  a  sawed-off  shotgun  from  behind  the  counter  and 
           aims  it  at  Ray.  

                                 RODNEY
                        Too  late.

           Buddy  #1  grabs  Ray.   Ray  KNOCKS  HIM  DOWN  with  one  punch.  

           Buddy  #2  makes  a  move  and  Ray  ELBOWS  him,  sending  him 
           sailing.   Unfortunately,  Buddy  #3  and  Rodney  wrestle  Ray  to 
           the  floor.   They  hold  him  down  while  the  others  pummel  him.

                                 RODNEY
                        I  never  liked  you  Ray.

           Rodney  delivers  a  crushing  BODY  BLOW,  Ray  doubles  over.

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  OUT  BACK  -  EVENING

           They  drag  a  beaten  Ray  outside  and  toss  him  to  the  ground.  
           Laughing,  the  four  of  them  head  back  inside.

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  OUT  BACK  -  EVENING

           Moments  pass.   No  movement  from  Ray.   Then  we  hear  a  GROAN.  
           Ray  struggles  to  stand.   There’s  a  gash  over  his  eye. 

           The  weight  of  the  world  is  hitting  him  from  all  angles  and 
           he’s  beyond  the  point  of  losing  it.  

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  EVENING 

           Ray  fishes  his  car  keys  out  of  his  pocket  and  opens  the 
           trunk.   Pulls  out  a  BASEBALL  BAT.
           INT.  THE  INKWELL  -  BACK  DOOR  -  EVENING

           Ray  storms  in  with  the  bat.   Buddy  #1  spots  him  and  can’t 
           believe  it. 

                                 BUDDY  #1
                        You  gotta  be  kidding  me...

           The  three  Buddies  converge  on  Ray,  but  three  strikes  and 
           they’re  all  out,  lying  unconscious  on  the  floor. 

           Rodney  backs  up  against  the  counter.   His  smile  gone.

                                 RAY
                        Where  is  she?

           Rodney  reaches  over  the  counter  for  his  sawed  off  shotgun, 
           but  Ray  SMASHES  his  hand  with  the  bat.   Rodney  HOWLS.

           He  goes  for  it  with  his  other  hand,  but  Ray  WHACKS  that  one 
           too.   Rodney  falls  to  the  floor,  his  swollen  hands  pressed 
           against  his  chest.

                                 RAY
                        Where  is  she  Rodney?   Don’t  make  me 
                        ask  you  again!

           Rodney glances up at Ray with an insane look in his eyes.            
           And  then  the  crazy  bastard  actually  starts  LAUGHING. 

           Ray  sighs.   He  knows  hitting  this  asshole  again  won’t  do  any 
           good.   He’ll  have  to  try  another  approach.

           His  eyes  land  on  the  TATTOO  GUN  behind  the  counter.   Ray 
           grabs  the  gun  and  kneels  on  Rodney’s  chest.   He  begins 
           tattooing  something  onto  Rodney’s  forehead.  

                                 RODNEY
                        What  the  fuck!   Stop!

           But  Ray’s  not  stopping.

                                 RODNEY
                        Prescott  Road!   It’s  in  Braintree!  
                        That’s  where  she  is!   I  swear! 

           Ray  stops.   He  studies  him.   Rodney  drops  the  tough  guy  act.

                                 RODNEY
                        Dude.   I’m  telling  you  the  truth.    
                        She  left  me  a  few  months  back. 

           Ray  tosses  the  tattoo  gun  back  on  the  counter,  he  picks  up 
           his  bat  and  walks  out.

           Once  he’s  gone  Rodney  grabs  a  MIRROR.   He  realizes  Ray  didn’t 
           tattoo  anything  on  his  forehead.
           EXT.  KIM’S  TRAILER  -  PRESCOTT  ROAD  -  NIGHT 

           Ray  pulls  up  in  front  and  gets  out.   The  cuts  on  his  face  are 
           cleaned  up  but  visible.

           EXT./INT.  KIM’S  TRAILER  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           Ray  sneaks  around  back  and  peers  into  the  trailer’s  window.

           KIM  CUTTER,  47,  is  passed  out  on  the  bed.   Ray  stares  at  his 
           ex-wife.   Old  memories  come  flooding  back.   Her  beauty  is 
           still  there  but  it’s  now  hidden  under  some  rough  years. 

           Ray  goes  around  front  and  opens  the  trailer  door.

           INT.  KIM’S  TRAILER  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           The  place  is  a  mess.   Clothes  strewn  about.   Dirty  dishes 
           lying  around.   Empty  liquor  bottles  on  the  floor.  

           Ray  steps  over  the  debris  and  enters  the  back  bedroom.   He 
           shakes  Kim  but  she  still  doesn’t  wake  up.  

           He  spots  a  prescription  bottle  next  to  the  bed  which  explains 
           the  reason  for  her  deep  sleep.   He  covers  her  with  a  blanket.

           INT.  KIM’S  TRAILER  -  MINUTES  LATER  -  NIGHT

           Kim  stirs.   She  sniffs  the  air,  smells  something.   She  comes 
           out  of  the  bedroom  to  find  Ray  at  the  table,  he’s  cleaned  up 
           the  place,  made  coffee  and  has  a  bag  of  ice  over  his  eye. 

                                 KIM
                        I  hope  I’m  still  dreaming.

           He  pours  her  a  coffee.   She  ties  her  hair  back  and  sits  down.

                                 KIM
                        How’d  you  find  me?

                                 RAY
                        Rodney.

                                 KIM
                        Didn’t  think  he’d  give  me  up  so 
                        easily. 

                                 RAY
                          (re:  his  bruises)
                        Does  it  look  like  it  was  easy?

           Kim  tops  off  her  coffee  with  some  liquor.   Ray  notices  her 
           bare  feet.   There’s  a  RING  on  her  middle  toe.

                        Your  son.   He  wants  to  see  you.

                        Does  he  remember  me?

           Ray  shakes  his  head.

                                 KIM
                        What  did  you  tell  him?

                        Don’t  worry,  I  made  you  look  like  a 
                        saint.

                                 KIM
                        Then  I  don’t  need  to  see  him  Ray.  
                        Don’t  drag  me  into  this.

                                 RAY
                        Drag  you  into  this?  

           Kim  shakes  her  head,  she  doesn’t  want  to  do  it.  

                                 RAY
                        Listen  to  me,  Kim.   Our  son  is  dying.  
                        He  has  a  Stage  4  brain  tumor.   Now 
                        you’re  gonna  clean  yourself  up,  put 
                        on  your  best  face  and  meet  him.   I’ll 
                        pick  you  up  at  noon  tomorrow.

           Kim  stares  at  Ray  as  he  stands.

                                 KIM
                        I  can’t  do  it  Ray.

           Ray  walks  out  and  lets  the  screen  door  slam  shut  behind  him.  
           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  LATE  NIGHT 

           Ray  lies  on  the  couch.   One  of  Joseph’s  retired  doctor 
           friends,  DR.  SHEEHAN,  60’s,  finishes  stitching  the  gash  over 
           Ray’s  eye.   Joseph  watches  on  in  his  sweats  and  t-shirt.

                                 DR.  SHEEHAN
                        That  should  do  it.   Can  I  ask  who  did 
                        this?

                                 RAY
                        Some  bad  guys.

           Joseph  ushers  the  Doc  towards  the  door.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Thanks  for  coming  by  George.

                                 DR.  SHEEHAN
                        He  should  get  some  rest.

           Joseph  hands  the  Doc  an  envelope  of  cash,  then  opens  the  door 
           for  him  to  leave.   Then  Joseph  returns  to  the  couch.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Keating?

                                 RAY
                        Rodney.

           Joseph  gets  it,  Ray  went  looking  for  Kim.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Christ  Ray.

                                 RAY
                        You  were  right.

           Joseph  sits  down  on  the  recliner,  considering  this.   He  rubs 
           his  brow,  making  a  decision.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What  can  I  do?

                                 RAY
                        Nothing.   I’m  taking  care  of  it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hey,  I  introduced  you  to  that  prick 
                        Keating,  remember?

                                 RAY
                        So  what...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Just  tell  me  what  you  need

           Ray  thinks  about  this  a  moment,  then...

           Joseph  sighs,  Ivan’s  the  last  person  he  wants  to  see.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Of  course,  that  Russian’s  like  a 
                        cockroach.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  RAY’S  BEDROOM  -  LATE  NIGHT

           Ray  removes  a  suit  from  his  closet,  tosses  it  on  the  bed.

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  DAWN

           An  AMBULANCE  and  a  Boston  PD  CRUISER  block  the  street  in 
           front.   EMT’s  work  on  the  badly  wounded  three  Buddies,  while 
           the  officer  in  charge,  MORETTI,  questions  Rodney. 

           Detectives  Paisley  and  Dougherty  pull  up  in  an  unmarked 
           vehicle.   Officer  Moretti  approaches  them.

                                 OFFICER  MORETTI
                        I  called  you  because  there’s 
                        something  you  should  see.

           INT.  THE  INKWELL  -  BACK  OFFICE  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAWN

           The  SECURITY  VIDEO  replays  last  night’s  battle  for  them.  

           ON  SCREEN  -  Ray  is  getting  beaten  to  a  pulp.   The  video  is 
           fast  forwarded  to  show  Ray  return  with  the  bat.

                                 OFFICER  MORETTI
                        Is  that  who  you  were  asking  about?

           Dougherty  exchanges  a  glance  with  Paisley.

           EXT.  THE  INKWELL  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAWN

           The  Detectives  exit  with  Moretti.   Moretti  points  at  Rodney, 
           who’s  in  the  ambulance,  having  his  hands  tended  to.

                                 OFFICER  MORETTI

                        cocaine  possession.

           Paisley  gestures  for  the  EMT’s  to  give  them  some  privacy.

           INT.  BUICK  -  DRIVING  ON  THE  FREEWAY  -  EARLY  MORNING

           Ray  drives  past  a  sign  that  reads:   Entering  Connecticut

           EXT.  DURANCE  MANSION  -  MORNING

           The  Buick  negotiates  a  long,  circular  drive  to  a  magnificent 
           Mansion.   Ray  is  met  on  the  steps  by  Jonathan  Durance’s 
           butler,  PALMER,  70’s,  a  stern  man  in  a  thousand  dollar  suit.

                                 PALMER
                        Mr.  Chambers,  Mr.  Durance  is 
                        expecting  you.

           INT.  DURANCE  MANSION  -  MOMENTS  LATER  -  MORNING

           Palmer  leads  Ray  down  the  grand  hallway  to  the  study, 
           impressive  artwork  and  antiques  are  on  display  all  around.

           INT.  DURANCE  MANSION  -  PRIVATE  STUDY  -  MORNING 

           Palmer  opens  the  door  to  let  Ray  in.   Waiting  for  him  is 
           JONATHAN  DURANCE,  60’s,  an  eccentric  old  man.  

                                 JONATHAN
                        Mr.  Chambers,  nice  to  meet  you.   I 
                        have  what  you  asked  for  on  the  phone.

           Jonathan  brings  Ray  over  to  his  desk.   He  puts  on  cloth 
           gloves,  then  carefully  unveils  a  gorgeous  old  OIL  PAINTING  of 
           a  brunette  woman  holding  a  colorful  fan.

                                 JONATHAN
                        Berthe  Morisot’s  “At  The  Ball”.

           Jonathan  hands  Ray  another  pair  of  cloth  gloves.   Ray  slips 
           them  on  and  carefully  takes  the  painting.   He  studies  the 
           size,  the  frame,  the  canvas...  it’s  exactly  what  he  needs.

                        It’s  the  year  you  requested.   May  I 
                        ask  why  that  year?

           Ray  studies  the  subtle  aging  cracks  in  the  canvas.

                                 RAY
                        The  year’s  personal  to  my  wife.   It’s 
                        the  year  her  great-grandmother  was 
                        born  in  Paris.

                                 JONATHAN
                        I  see,  then  she’ll  be  happy  with 
                        this.  

           Jonathan  hands  Ray  a  piece  of  paper.   Ray  glances  at  the 
           figure  written  on  it.

                        He  did.

           Ray  removes  an  envelops  from  his  pocket  and  hands  it  to 
           Jonathan.   Jonathan  opens  it  and  glances  at  the  cash  inside. 

           Off  his  satisfied  nod...

           EXT.  DURANCE  MANSION  -  AN  HOUR  LATER  -  MORNING

           Ray  exits  carrying  a  LEATHER  CASE  with  the  painting  inside 
           over  to  his  Buick.   He  opens  the  trunk  and  lifts  up  the  floor 
           to  reveal  the  spare  tire  compartment.  

           The  compartment’s  been  cleaned  out  to  make  space  for  the 
           painting.   Ray  gently  places  the  leather  case  inside  and 
           straps  it  down.  

           He  closes  the  compartment  and  then  the  trunk  lid.

           INT.  IVAN’S  PAWN  SHOP  -  MORNING

           Joseph  enters.   The  RUSSIAN  THUG  sitting  in  the  security  cage 
           behind  the  counter  is  watching  “Price  Is  Right”.   He  looks  up 
           as  Joseph  approaches  the  cage  window. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Tell  Ivan  Joe  Cutter’s  here  to  see 
                        him.

                                 RUSSIAN  THUG
                        Ivan’s  not  here.

           But  Joseph  can  hear  Ivan  on  the  phone  in  the  back  room.
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  hear  him  back  there.  

                                 RUSSIAN  THUG
                        Take  a  walk  old  man.  

           Joseph’s  eyes  narrow  at  the  old  man  comment.   He’s  not  one  to 
           be  intimidated  by  anyone.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Tell  you  what... 

           Joseph  puts  his  right  elbow  on  the  cage  window  counter  to 
           challenge  the  Thug  to  arm  wrestling.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        ...I  win,  you  tell  Ivan  I’m  here.  
                        You  win,  you  get  this.

           Joseph  slaps  a  $100  on  the  counter.   The  Russian  Thug 
           considers  the  wager  a  beat,  amused.

           He  gets  to  his  feet  and  grabs  Joseph’s  hand,  placing  his  own 
           thick  elbow  next  to  Joseph’s.   

                                 JOSEPH
                        On  three.   One...  two... 

           But  Joseph  doesn’t  even  get  to  three.   He  YANKS  the  Thug’s 
           upper  body  through  the  cage  window...

           ...and  then  SLAMS  the  METAL  SLIDE  WINDOW  down  on  the  Thug’s 
           head  repeatedly,  until  the  Russian  is  knocked  out. 

           Joseph  pockets  the  $100,  grabs  the  keys  off  the  Russian’s 
           belt,  unlocks  the  cage  door  and  enters  the  back  room. 

           INT.  IVAN’S  PAWN  SHOP  -  BACK  ROOM  -  CONTINUOUS  -  MORNING

           IVAN,  70’s,  is  in  the  middle  of  a  phone  call,  when  he  sees 
           Joseph  standing  in  the  doorway.   He  swears  in  Russian  and 
           slams  the  phone  down,  enraged. 

                                 IVAN
                        You  son  of  a  bitch.   I  told  you  never 
                        to  come  here  again,  Cutter.  

           Ivan  sees  the  Thug  hanging  out  of  the  cage,  unconscious,  and 
           he  reaches  under  the  desk  for  a  gun.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Whoa  Ivan,  relax,  this  is  me,  Joseph.  
                        Is  this  any  way  to  treat  an  old 
                        friend?   Especially  after  all  the 
                        money  I’ve  made  you  over  the  years.
           CONTINUED:

                                 IVAN
                        How  about  how  much  you  cost  me  with 
                        those  phony  clay  chips  you  sold  me?  
                        I  had  muscle  from  six  casinos  in  here 
                        after  I  cashed  them  in.

           Joseph  holds  up  a  piece  of  paper  with  a  list  of  items  on  it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  got  something  here  that’ll  make  up 
                        for  all  that.   I  need  colored 
                        minerals.   Specifically  from  the 
                        1800’s.   Here’s  a  list.

           This  gets  Ivan’s  attention,  he  takes  the  list  from  Joseph.  
           Studies  it,  intrigued.   Money  always  trumps  animosity. 

                                 IVAN
                        Blue,  red,  yellow,  green...  sterling 
                        silver  nuggets...  this  is  expensive.

           Joseph  peels  off  a  few  hundreds  and  lays  them  on  the  desk.

           Ivan  places  the  list  on  top  of  the  bills.   Reconsidering.

                                 IVAN
                        Call  me  tomorrow.

           Joseph  tips  his  scally  cap  and  exits.  

           EXT./INT.  KIM’S  TRAILER  -  NOON

           Ray  pulls  up  and  knocks  on  the  door.   No  answer.   He  opens  it 
           and  looks  inside.   No  sign  of  Kim.   He  sighs,  disappointed.

           When  he  angrily  steps  back  out...  he  spots  Kim  nervously 
           standing  in  front  of  the  Buick.   A  beat  as  he  takes  her  in.

           She’s  done  her  best  to  clean  up,  but  everything  about  her, 
           her  hair,  dress,  make  up,  all  seem  clumsily  put  together.

                                 RAY
                        You  look  nice.

           Ray  opens  the  car  door  for  her.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  RAY’S  BEDROOM  -  DAY

           Will  sneaks  into  Ray’s  bedroom  and  sees  Ray’s  locker.

           He  opens  it  and  peers  inside.   He  removes  a  handful  of  OLD 
           PHOTOS.   Most  of  them  are  from  Ray  and  Kim  during  happier 
           times  in  their  relationship.   They  appear  in  love.

           Will  flips  through  them,  until  one  stops  him  cold...  it’s  a 
           photo  of  him  as  an  infant  in  his  mother’s  arms.
           CONTINUED:

           Will  stares  at  it  a  long  beat...  when  he  hears  the  front  door 
           open.   He  quickly  returns  the  photos  to  the  locker  and  then 
           nervously  takes  a  deep  breath...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  LIVING  ROOM  -  DAY

           Ray  brings  Kim  in  the  house.   Joseph  smiles  when  he  sees  her.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Kim,  it’s  good  to  see  you.

           He  kisses  her  on  the  cheek.   She  kisses  him  back.

           Kim  senses  someone  behind  her.   She  turns  to  see  Will  in  the 
           doorway  wearing  his  Red  Sox  cap.   Will  stares  at  her  in 
           shock,  he  can’t  believe  his  mother  is  here.   Kim  smiles.

                                 KIM
                        Hi.  

           A  big  smile  forms  on  Will’s  face.

                                 WILL
                        Hi.

           An  awkward  beat,  then  Ray  looks  at  his  watch.

                                 RAY
                        We  better  get  going  or  we’ll  be  late.

           INT.  CALLAHAN’S  RESTAURANT  -  DAY

           A  four  star  steak  house.   Ray,  Kim  and  Will  sit  in  a  booth 
           overlooking  the  Charles  River.   They  all  look  uncomfortable.

                                 WILL
                        Where  in  New  York  do  you  live?

                                 KIM
                          (caught  off  guard)
                        Umm...  near  Times  Square.

                                 WILL
                        I  hope  you’re  not  a  Yankees  fan.

                                 KIM
                          (laughs)
                        Not  really. 

                                 WILL
                        Good.   Because  I  couldn’t  be  your  son 
                        anymore  if  you  were.

           They  share  a  smile.   Will  removes  his  baseball  cap.   Puts  it 
           in  his  jacket  pocket.   His  hair  is  slightly  thinning.  
           CONTINUED:

           Kim  can’t  help  but  notice.

                                 KIM
                        So,  do  you  have  a  girlfriend?

           Will  shakes  his  head.   More  silence  follows.  

           The  waitress  fills  their  water  glasses.   Kim  takes  a  sip  of 
           hers.   Her  hands  are  shaking.   She  tries  to  hide  it.

                                 KIM
                        Excuse  me  a  minute.

           INT.  CALLAHAN’S  RESTAURANT  -  LADIES  ROOM  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           She  wets  her  face  at  the  sink.   Pulls  out  a  pill  bottle  from 
           her  purse.   Takes  one.   Thinks  about  it.   Takes  another.

           INT.  CALLAHAN’S  RESTAURANT  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  have  been  waiting  for  her  for  a  while.   Kim  sits 
           back  down  a  little  wobbly.   Ray  can  tell  she’s  taken 
           something  to  loosen  up.   She  tries  to  focus  on  the  menu.  

                                 KIM
                        I’m  starving.   What’s  good  here?

                                 WILL
                        The  filet.

                                 KIM
                        Is  that  what  you’re  getting?

           Will  nods.   She  closes  her  menu.

                                 KIM
                        Then  that’s  what  I’ll  have  too.

           They  exchange  a  smile. 

           EXT.  BOSTON  COMMON  -  DAY

           The  park’s  crowded  with  tourists.   Will  and  Kim  sit  on  a 
           bench.   Ray’s  at  a  food  truck  buying  them  pretzels.   He  takes 
           the  pretzels  over  to  the  condiments  shelf  and  squirts  mustard 
           on  them.   Getting  some  on  his  shoe.

           He  grabs  a  napkin  and  kneels  down  to  wipe  it  off...  when  he 
           catches  a  glimpse  of  “Catherine”  from  the  Palace  through  the 
           crowd  standing  by  a  tree  with  another  man.  

           Ray  recognizes  her...  but  when  she  turns  he  notices  her 
           Detective  Shield  on  her  belt.

           Ray’s  almost  knocked  over,  as  he  realizes  Catherine’s  a  cop. 
           CONTINUED:

           He  stands  and  walks  back  over  to  the  bench  to  deliver  the 
           pretzels  to  Will  and  Kim.   A  bit  shaken.   But  when  he  looks 
           back  at  the  tree,  Paisley  and  Dougherty  are  now  gone.

           Ray  sits  down  beside  Will,  eyes  now  peeled.

                                 WILL
                        What’s  New  York  like?

                                 KIM
                        It’s  similar  to  Boston  only  bigger.  
                        No  one  drives.   Everyone  takes  a  taxi 
                        or  the  subway.

                                 WILL
                        Do  you  live  in  a  nice  building?

                                 KIM
                        I  like  it.   We  have  a  game  room,  and 
                        a  jacuzzi  on  the  roof.  

                                 WILL
                        A  jacuzzi  on  the  roof?   Wow.   I’d 
                        love  to  see  that.

                                 KIM
                        Well  when  you  get  better  you  should 
                        come  visit.

                                 WILL
                          (knows  that  might  never  happen)
                        Okay.   I  will.

           EXT.  BOSTON  COMMON  -  DAY

           The  three  of  them  are  strolling  around  the  duck  pond.   Ray 
           hangs  back  a  few  steps,  giving  them  a  moment.   His  eyes  scan 
           the  area.   No  sign  of  the  cops.

           Kim  tosses  some  pretzel  pieces  to  the  ducks.   They  go  nuts.  

           Will  kneels  down  and  holds  a  piece  in  his  hand.   The  ducks 
           feel  comfortable  enough  to  eat  out  of  his  palm.  

           Kim  watches  her  son  feed  the  ducks.   The  image  affects  her.  
           We  can  see  she’s  choked  up.  

           INT.  AMTRAK  TRAIN  STATION  -  EVENING

           Ray,  Kim  and  Will  wait  for  the  train  to  New  York.

                        How  come  you’re  not  flying?

                        I  hate  planes.   I  just  can’t  get  past 
                        the  fact  it’s  a  rocket  with  wings.

           Will  smiles.   The  PA  system  announces  the  New  York  Train.

                                 RAY
                        That’s  the  one.

           Kim  and  Will  look  at  each  other.

                                 KIM
                        Goodbye  William.   I  had  a  great  day.

                                 KIM
                        So  did  I.

           Kim  gives  him  a  hug.   Will  holds  on  tight.   They  separate.  
           Kim  is  still  holding  his  hand.  

                                 RAY
                        Wait  here  while  I  walk  her  to  the 
                        platform.

           Will  nods.   Kim  goes  to  leave  but  Will  still  holds  her  hand, 
           knowing  he’ll  never  see  her  again.   He  finally  lets  it  go.

           EXT.  AMTRAK  TRAIN  STATION  -  PLATFORM  -  EVENING

           Ray  and  Kim  stop  by  the  tracks.

                                 KIM
                        Think  he  bought  it?

           Ray  nods.   They  stand  there.   Kim  wants  to  say  something.

                                 KIM
                        Ray.   I  wish  we  could’ve  helped  each 
                        other  more.

                                 RAY
                        Me too.  

           Another  beat.   Neither  of  them  knows  what  else  to  add.

                                 KIM
                        It  was  really  a  nice  day.

                                 RAY
                        I’ll  let  you  know  what  happens.

                                 KIM
                        Let’s  just  leave  it  like  this.

           Kim  pretends  to  walk  over  to  a  train  pulling  into  the 
           station.   Ray  watches  her  a  moment,  then  leaves  the  platform.
           INT.  BUICK  -  DRIVING  HOME  -  NIGHT

           Ray  and  Will  drive  in  silence.   Will  has  a  smile  on  his  face.

                                 WILL
                        She’s  nice,  Dad.

                                 RAY
                        I  told  you.

                                 WILL
                        Thanks  for  pretending.

                                 RAY
                        Pretending?

                                 WILL
                        About  her  living  in  New  York.   And 
                        not  being  a  drug  addict.  

           Ray  looks  at  his  son,  he’s  much  wiser  than  he  thought.   It 
           makes  Ray  feel  ashamed  and  regretful  of  all  the  times  he’s 
           lied  to  the  boy.   It  breaks  his  heart.

           He  doesn’t  know  how  to  respond,  so  he  just  nods  and  keeps 
           driving.   Will  glances  out  the  window,  smiling,  content.

           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  MORNING 

           Ray  enters  to  find  Carl  sitting  at  the  bar.   Ray  sits  next  to 
           him  on  a  stool.

                                 RAY
                        What’d  you  find?

           Carl  places  a  photo  on  the  bar  of  Detective  “Catherine” 
           Paisley  in  her  Boston  PD  uniform,  along  with  her  info.

                                 CARL
                        That  her?

           Ray  picks  up  the  photo,  studies  it  a  beat...  and  nods.

                                 CARL
                        Her  record’s  impressive.   Made 
                        Detective  by  thirty.   Father  was  a 
                        cop.   She’s  a  pitbull.

                                 RAY
                        Great.

                                 CARL
                        But,  I  think  I  have  a  solution.  
                        Follow  me...
           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  OFFICE  -  MORNING 

           Carl  brings  Ray  to  a  bookcase  in  the  corner  of  the  office.

                                 CARL
                        All  these  old  restaurants  have  hidden 
                        rooms  left  over  from  prohibition. 

           Carl  pulls  back  the  bookcase  to  reveal  a  HIDDEN  DOOR,  which 
           he  opens  to  show  a  set  of  OLD  WOODEN  STAIRS  leading  up.  

           Carl  leads  Ray  up  the  cobwebbed  covered  stairs  and  into...

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           It’s  an  EMPTY  HIDDEN  LOFT  above  Daphne’s  restaurant.   From 
           the  outside  you  would  not  know  it  existed.   The  ceiling  has 
           two  skylights  which  brighten  the  room.

                                 CARL
                        And  the  basements  on  these  blocks 
                        have  old  tunnels  that  run  from  one 
                        building  to  the  next.   So  I  can  bring 
                        everything  in  through  the  building  on 
                        the  corner  and  up  through  our 
                        basement  without  anyone  noticing.

           Ray  looks  around.   Lots  of  light.  

                                 CARL
                        Figure  you  can  come  and  go  whenever 
                        you  want,  and  the  cops  won’t  even 
                        know  you’re  working  up  here.

           Ray  peeks  out  the  slats  of  the  shutters  to  see  a  view  of  the 
           Charles  River.   Perfect  place  to  paint  a  masterpiece.   

                                 CARL
                        Well,  what  do  you  think?

           A  beat,  then  Ray  turns  and  smiles  to  Carl,  it’s  perfect.

           INT.  HOSPITAL  ELEVATOR  -  BOSTON  MEMORIAL  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  step  out  of  the  elevator.   Will’s  out  of  breath 
           from  his  2nd  chemo  treatment.  

           A  pretty  GIRL  standing  with  her  mother  smiles  at  Will.   Will 
           blushes  and  shyly  half-smiles  back.   Ray  catches  this.  

           EXT.  HOSPITAL  PARKING  LOT  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  exit  the  hospital.   They  reach  their  car.   Ray 
           opens  the  door  but  Will  doesn’t  get  in.   Like  before  he 
           stares  at  Ray.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Oh,  no...  I  feel  something  important 
                        coming.   What  is  it? 

                                 WILL
                        Don’t  laugh.

                                 RAY
                        I  won’t  laugh.

           A  beat  passes.   Ray  can  tell  Will  is  self-conscious.

                                 RAY
                        Hey.   I’d  never  laugh.   What  is  it?

                                 WILL
                        I  want  to  have  sex.   That’s  my  second 
                        wish.

           Ray  can  tell  it  took  a  lot  for  his  son  to  say  this.   Ray 
           sighs  as  Will  gets  in  the  car.   Ray  closes  the  door.

           EXT.  APARTMENT  BUILDING  ON  THE  CORNER  -  DAY

           Ray  pulls  the  Buick  around  the  corner  quickly  and  parks  in 
           front  of  the  building.   He  jumps  out  and  runs  around  back  to 
           a  basement  door  in  the  alley.  

           EXT.  APT.  BUILDING  ON  THE  CORNER  -  DETECTIVE’S  CAR  -  DAY

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  turn  the  corner  and  pull  up  alongside 
           the  Buick.   Paisley  gets  out,  looks  inside...  it’s  empty,  she 
           scans  the  street.   No  idea  where  Ray  went.  

           INT.  BASEMENT  TUNNELS  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  walks  through  the  underground  tunnels.   He  finds  the 
           basement  steps  to  Shamrock’s  restaurant  and  heads  up  them...

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  LATER  -  DAY

           Ray  sets  up  his  studio.   He  moves  boxes  against  the  wall, 
           sweeps  the  floor,  opens  the  windows  to  air  the  place  out... 
           getting  everything  ready.

           Then  he  erects  his  old  easel  in  the  corner  under  a  light.  
           Places  the  Morisot  painting  on  it.

           He  pulls  a  table  over  and  neatly  places  his  painting  tools 
           down,  carefully  giving  every  item  it’s  place.

           Once  he’s  finished,  he  steps  back  and  takes  it  all  in.   He’s 
           still  not  psychologically  ready  yet  to  begin  painting,  but 
           he’s  getting  there...  
           CONTINUED:

           The  hidden  door  suddenly  opens  and  Carl  enters.   He  takes  in 
           the  new  workshop  and  nods  to  Ray,  impressed.  

           He  unrolls  a  BLOWN  UP  PHOTO  of  Renoir’s  “Woman  At  The  Piano” 
           on  the  floor.  

           It’s  huge,  so  Ray  can  study  the  colors,  the  angle  of  every 
           brush  stroke,  the  shading,  etc.  

           Ray  examines  the  painting  with  a  jewelers  eyepiece.  

           Carl  stands  off  to  the  side,  thinking,  as  he  attaches  his 
           iPhone  to  a  laptop  on  the  table.

                                 CARL
                        You  know  Ray,  you  really  gotta  admire 
                        the  kid,  he  wants  to  go  out  a  man.  

                                 RAY
                        I  don’t  wanna  talk  about  it  Carl.

                                 CARL
                        If  you  want,  I  know  someone...

           Ray  gestures  to  the  TV,  changing  the  subject.

                                 RAY
                        Just  show  me  what  you’ve  got.

           Carl  presses  PLAY  on  the  video  from  his  iPhone...

           ON  SCREEN  -  A  shaky  video  plays  from  the  inside  of  the  Museum 
           Of  Fine  Arts,  taken  from  Carl’s  hidden  iPhone. 

                                 RAY
                        Bad  news  first.

                                 CARL
                        The  bad  news  is  that  they  have 
                        GalleryMaster,  which  is  rated  the 
                        highest  security  system  by 
                        Underwriters’  Laboratories.   They 
                        gave  it  a  Grade  “AA”. 

                                 RAY
                        Can  you  get  past  it?

                                 CARL
                        Maybe,  but  all  the  doors  and  windows 
                        are  also  protected  by  wire  free 
                        sensors,  those  sensors  send  their 
                        alarm  signals  directly  to  the  police, 
                        and  are  encrypted  for  added  security 
                        with  their  own  unique  ID  stamp. 

                                 RAY
                        What  about  hacking  the  radio 
                        frequency?
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 CARL
                        Four  years  ago  I  could.   But  not  now.  
                        They  have  a  “Protected”  line 
                        security.   Any  frequency  break  and 
                        it’ll  register,  then  we  got  about  a 
                        six  minute  response  time.

                                 RAY
                        Is  that  it?

                                 CARL
                        I  wish.   Then  if  I  do  get  you  inside 
                        each  painting  is  equipped  with  a 
                        battery  operated  magnetic  sensor  
                        behind  the  frame.   If  it’s  moved  the 
                        detector  will  set  off  the  alarm.  

                                 RAY
                        What  about  guards?

                                 CARL
                        Five  at  night.   Top  of  the  hour  they 
                        take  turns  doing  rounds  on  foot.

                                 RAY
                        Where’s  their  office?

           Carl  rewinds  the  video  to  show  Ray.

                                 CARL
                        Right  there.   On  the  second  floor.  
                        Next  to  the  Men’s  Room.

           Ray  considers  all  the  information  a  beat.

                                 RAY
                        Any  ideas?

                                 CARL
                        I  need  a  few  more  days.   I’ll  call 
                        you  later.

           Carl  gets  up  and  heads  for  the  door.

                                 CARL
                        By  the  way,  her  name’s  Melanie.  
                        She’ll  take  good  care  of  Will.   I’ll 
                        text  you  her  number.

           Off  Ray,  examining  the  painting  again  with  the  eyepiece...

           EXT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  APARTMENT  BUILDING  -  BRISTOL  AVE.  -  DAY

           The  brownstone  is  a  four  story  brothel  located  downtown.    
           Ray  pulls  up  with  Will.   Will  looks  at  the  building.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        So  she’s  a  friend  of  Carl’s?

           Ray  nods.   Will  seems  nervous.

                                 RAY
                        Look  at  me.   You  don’t  have  to  do 
                        anything  you  don’t  want  to.

           Will  nods  and  gets  out.   Ray  follows.

           ANGLE  -  ALLEY  BESIDE  THEATRE

           An  unmarked  Cop  Car  is  parked  there  with  Paisley  and 
           Dougherty  inside.   They  followed  Ray  here.   They  watch  Ray 
           and  Will  cross  the  street  and  enter  the  building.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY

           INT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  MELANIE’S  APT.  -  DAY

           Ray  knocks  on  an  apartment  door.   MELANIE  answers.   She’s  a 
           petite  beauty,  early  20’s,  with  pony  tails.  

                                 MELANIE
                        You  must  be  Raymond.   I’m  Melanie.  
                        Carl  explained  everything.   Come  in.

           Ray  steps  inside,  Will  hesitantly  walks  in  behind  him.  

                                 MELANIE
                        And  you  must  be  William.   Hi.

                                 WILL
                        Hi.

                                 MELANIE
                        Have  a  seat.

           Will  sits  on  the  bed.   Melanie  turns  to  Ray.

                                 MELANIE
                        We’ll  be  fine.   We’ll  see  you  in  an 
                        hour.

           She  ushers  Ray  out  and  closes  the  door  behind  him.  
           INT./EXT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  LOBBY  -  DAY

           Ray’s  about  to  exit  the  building  when  he  spots  Paisley  and 
           Dougherty  crossing  the  street  and  heading  towards  the 
           apartment  building.   Ray  runs  back  up  the  stairs.

           EXT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  MELANIE’S  APARTMENT  DOOR  -  DAY

           Ray  knocks  quietly.   No  answer.   He  glances  down  the  center 
           staircase  and  sees  the  Detectives  entering  the  lobby.

                                 RAY
                        Melanie.   It’s  Ray.   Open  up.

           The  door  opens  to  reveal  Melanie  in  a  lace  bra  and  panties.

           INT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  MELANIE’S  APARTMENT  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  rushes  in.   Will’s  on  the  bed  in  his  underwear.   The  huge 
           smile  on  his  face  vanishes  when  he  sees  his  father.

                                 WILL
                        Dad!

           Ray  tosses  Will  his  clothes.

                                 RAY
                        Get  dressed.

                                 MELANIE
                        You  don’t  need  to  feel  guilty  Ray.   I 
                        have  fathers  who  bring  their  sons  to 
                        me  all  the  time.

                                 RAY
                        What?   The  cops  are  on  their  way  up.

                                 WILL
                        The  cops!

                                 RAY
                        That’s  right.   And  if  you’re  caught 
                        up  here  I’ll  have  to  answer  a  lot  of 
                        questions  I  can’t  answer.

           Will  finishes  getting  dressed  and  follows  Ray  out  the  door. 
           Melanie  shuts  it  behind  them  and  cleans  up  her  apartment.

           INT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  BACK  STAIRS  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  peer  down  the  stairwell  and  see  the  Detectives 
           running  up  the  stairs.   Will  panics.   Ray  calms  him  down.   He 
           grabs  Will’s  hand  and  leads  him  up  to  the  roof.
           EXT.  OLD  BROWNSTONE  -  ROOF  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  emerge.   Ray  looks  for  a  way  off.   There  is 
           none.   Will  looks  like  he’s  about  to  pass  out.   Ray  walks 
           over  to  the  edge  and  glances  across  the  gap  in  the  buildings.  

           It’s  about  a  five  foot  jump  to  the  neighboring  rooftop  and  a 
           four  story  fall  to  the  alley  below.   He  looks  at  Will,  who 
           seems  too  weak  to  make  it.

                                 WILL
                        What?   I  can  make  that.

                                 RAY
                        We’re  not  jumping.

                                 WILL
                        Why  not?   You  scared?

                                 RAY
                        No,  I’m  not  scared.

                                 WILL
                        Then  you  don’t  think  I  can  make  it.

           Ray  looks  for  another  solution...  WHEN  HE  HEARS  RUNNING 
           FOOTSTEPS  BEHIND  HIM  AND  A  SMALL  YELL,  FOLLOWED  BY  FEET 
           HITTING  THE  TAR  ROOF.

           Ray  turns  to  see  Will  on  the  neighboring  rooftop  breathing 
           heavy.   Will  smiles  proudly  back  at  him.

                                 WILL
                        See,  told  you  I  could  make  it.

           Ray  now  has  no  choice.   He  makes  a  running  start  and  jumps... 
           landing  hard  on  the  rooftop  and  scraping  his  knee.  

                                 WILL
                        And  you  were  worried  about  me.

           Ray  shoots  him  a  look.   They  head  for  the  roof  door.

           EXT.  NEIGHBORING  BUILDING  -  ROOFTOP  DOOR  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           They  reach  the  roof  door  but  it’s  locked.   

                                 WILL
                        We’re  trapped.

           Ray  sees  a  THIN  METAL  WIRE  holding  the  grate  together  on  the 
           air  conditioning  unit.   He  unravels  the  wire  and  twists  it 
           into  a  hook.   He  sticks  the  end  into  the  lock.

                                 WILL
                        You’re  joking... 
           CONTINUED:

           Ray  works  the  lock  and  within  seconds  -  POP.   It  opens.  
           Will’s  eyes  widen,  impressed.

                                 WILL
                        Wow.   That  was...  fast.

           INT.  NEIGHBORING  BUILDING  -  BACK  STAIRWELL  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  run  down  the  stairs.   Ray  hears  something  above 
           and  stops  Will.   They  glance  up  the  stairs  and  spot  Paisley 
           entering  the  stairwell  from  the  roof.   She  must  have  jumped 
           also.   They  can’t  keep  running.

           Ray  pulls  Will  over  to  an  APARTMENT  DOOR.   He  knocks.   Waits.  
           No  answer.   Paisley  is  on  her  way  down  the  stairs.   Ray 
           quickly  works  the  lock.   The  door  opens  and  they  slip  in.

           INT.  NEIGHBORING  BUILDING  -  EMPTY  APARTMENT  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Will  move  away  from  the  door,  as  Paisley  runs  down 
           the  stairs,  and  they  back  into  the  living  room... 

           ...where  they  come  face  to  face  with  a  growling  GERMAN 
           SHEPHERD.   Will  freezes,  petrified.   Ray  stays  calm.

                                 RAY
                        Don’t  move.   Don’t  show  any  fear.

           But  the  dog  moves  forward  and  Will  steps  back,  bumping  into 
           the  table  and  knocking  over  the  lamp.   And  that’s  it.

           The  dog  growls  and  LUNGES  at  him!   Ray  jumps  in  front  of  Will 
           and  sticks  his  left  arm  out  --

           The  dog’s  jaws  CLAMP  down  on  Ray’s  forearm  just  as  Ray  GRABS 
           the  animal  by  the  throat  with  his  other  hand.   He  picks  the 
           dog  up  and  SLAMS  him  against  the  wall.  

                                 RAY
                        Fuuuck!

           Ray  tries  to  pull  his  arm  out  but  the  dog’s  grip  is  like  a 
           vice.   Ray  gets  an  idea.

           He  tosses  the  dog  on  the  bed  and  wraps  him  up  in  the 
           bedspread.   The  dog  struggles  but  Ray  sits  on  him.   The  jolt 
           of  weight  causes  the  dog  to  release  Ray’s  arm.

                                 RAY
                        Open  the  closet!

           Will  nervously  hurries  over  and  opens  the  closet  door. 

           Ray  picks  up  the  struggling  and  growling  dog  in  the  ball  of 
           sheets  and  tosses  him  into  the  closet.   Will  slams  the  closet 
           door  shut  and  Ray  wedges  a  chair  under  the  doorknob.
           CONTINUED:

           The  dog’s  going  crazy  inside  the  closet.   Will  and  Ray 
           exchange  a  relieved  look,  then  a  nervous  laugh.

           Will  now  notices  his  father’s  bloody  forearm. 

                                 WILL
                        You  okay?

           Ray  nods.   He  pulls  Will  towards  the  door.   He  peers  out  and 
           checks  the  hallway.   Paisley’s  gone.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  LATE  NIGHT 

           Ray  lies  on  the  couch  again.   And  Dr.  Sheehan  is  back.   Will 
           watches  the  doc  give  Ray  a  rabies  shot. 

                                 DR.  SHEEHAN
                        This  will  definitely  hurt.

           He  injects  Ray.   Ray  cringes  in  pain.

                                 RAY
                        I  never  got  this  messed  up  in  prison.

                                 DR.  SHEEHAN
                        I’m  going  to  give  you  a  sedative  so 
                        you  can  sleep.

           He  gives  Ray  another  shot.   Joseph  comes  back  into  the  room 
           with  a  handful  of  rope.

                                 WILL
                        What’s  that  for?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m  gonna  tie  him  up  in  case  he  wakes 
                        up  foaming  at  the  mouth.

           Will  smiles.   Ray  grabs  Joseph’s  arm,  startling  him.

                                 RAY
                        Have  Carl  pick  up  the  Buick.

           Joseph  nods,  then  he  hands  the  Doc  another  envelope  of  cash 
           as  they  head  for  the  door.   Will  sits  beside  Ray.   Ray’s  eyes 
           are  starting  to  get  heavy  from  the  sedative.

                                 RAY
                        Sorry  about  Melanie.

                                 WILL
                        Are  you  kidding  me...  that  was  the 
                        coolest  thing  I’ve  ever  seen.   You 
                        kicked  that  dog’s  ass. 

           Ray  stares  at  his  son  like  he’s  insane.  
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Man,  my  stomach’s  still  doing 
                        somersaults.   But  you  were  so  calm.

                                 RAY
                        Not  on  the  inside  I  wasn’t.

           A  moment  passes  between  them.   Ray  looks  at  his  son.

                                 RAY
                        Why’d  you  and  that  girl  break  up 
                        anyway?

                                 WILL
                        Tricia?

           Ray  nods.   Will  hesitates  a  beat,  then...

                                 WILL
                        She  used  to  smile  at  every  boy  who 
                        walked  by.   Right  in  front  of  me.   It 
                        drove  me  nuts.   I  felt  like  a  fool.

                                 RAY
                        She  smiled  at  them.   That’s  it?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.   Like  she  was  trying  to  make  me 
                        jealous.

           Ray  gets  a  kick  out  of  this.

                                 RAY
                        Maybe  she’s...  just  friendly...   

           Will  considers  this  as  Ray’s  eyes  slowly  begin  to  close.   The 
           sedative’s  kicking  in.   Will  covers  him  with  a  blanket,  he’s 
           starting  to  look  at  his  Dad  in  a  new  light.  

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  MORNING

           Ray  enters,  pours  a  coffee.   Will’s  just  finished  making 
           pancakes  for  him.   He  has  Ray  sit  and  fixes  him  a  plate. 

                                 RAY
                        What’s  the  occasion?

                                 WILL
                        I  figured  out  my  third  wish.

                                 RAY
                        Will,  I  haven’t  even  fulfilled  your 
                        second  one  yet.

                                 WILL
                        We’ll  come  back  to  it.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Okay.   Lay  it  on  me.

                                 WILL
                        Well.   I  know  you’re  planning 
                        something.   Some  kind  of  heist  to  get 
                        the  money  to  pay  that  guy  back.

                                 RAY
                        Did  Pop  tell  you  that?

                                 WILL
                        I  saw  the  art  books  the  other  day.

                                 RAY
                        Look,  Will...

                                 WILL
                        I  want  to  help  you.

           Ray  shakes  his  head.

                                 RAY
                        No.   Meeting  your  mother  and  getting 
                        you  laid  is  one  thing,  but  this  is  my 
                        problem. 

                                 WILL
                        You  have  this  problem  because  of  me.

                                 RAY
                        That’s  not  true.   I  was  in  this  hole 
                        long  before  you  came  around.

                                 WILL
                        Dad,  I’ve  never  done  anything  so 
                        exciting  as  what  we  did  yesterday.  
                        You  and  grandpa,  you  guys  have  lived 
                        and  I  wanna  experience  that.

                                 RAY
                        We  haven’t  lived.   We’ve  wasted  years 
                        of  our  lives  in  a  box.   Trust  me, 
                        being  a  criminal  is  not  living.   What 
                        you’re  facing,  as  bravely  as  you’re 
                        facing  it,  I  could  never  do  that.

           Will  puts  the  pan  down  and  sits  across  from  him  at  the  table.

                                 WILL
                        Let  me  pull  this  off  with  you.  

                                 RAY
                        It’s  too  dangerous.

                                 WILL
                        Are  you  kidding  me?   I’m  dying.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Off  Ray,  taken  aback  that  Will  knows  the  truth.   Will  waits 
           for  his  answer,  then...

                                 RAY
                        I’m  sorry  Will,  I  just  can’t.

                                 WILL
                        I  knew  you  wouldn’t  follow  through 
                        with  the  wishes.   You’re  a  liar  and  a 
                        fake,  all  you  know  how  to  do  is  trick 
                        people.  

           Will  storms  out  of  the  kitchen.   Ray  watches  him  go.    

           Seconds  later,  he  HEARS  a  door  SLAM  upstairs.   Then  CRASH.  
           Will  is  DESTROYING  his  room.   The  anger  inside  him  finally 
           building  to  a  crescendo  over  everything  he’s  experienced.

           Ray  listens  to  the  commotion  upstairs.   He’s  not  sure  how  to 
           handle  it.   He  sits  there.   Then  the  destruction  stops.

           Silence.   Ray  looks  down  at  his  plate  of  pancakes.   He  takes 
           a  bite.   Not  bad.   He’s  about  to  take  another  when  he 
           suddenly  feels  guilty.   He  puts  his  fork  down.   Gets  up.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  2ND  FLOOR  -  CONTINUOUS  -  MORNING

           Ray  knocks  on  Will’s  door.   No  answer.

                                 RAY
                        Will,  open  up.   Let’s  talk.  

           No  answer.

                                 RAY
                        Will?   Open  the  door.   Will?

           Still  no  answer.   Ray’s  gut  tightens.   He  throws  his  shoulder 
           against  the  door  and  pops  it  off  it’s  hinges.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  WILL’S  BEDROOM  -  CONTINUOUS  -  MORNING

           It’s  destroyed.   The  models  are  in  pieces.  

           Ray  spots  Will’s  foot  sticking  out  from  behind  the  bed.   Ray 
           hurries  over  and  sees  he’s  unconscious.   He  scoops  Will  up.

           INT.  BUICK  -  DRIVING  -  DAY

           A  frantic  Ray  races  through  traffic  on  his  way  to  the 
           hospital  with  an  unconscious  Will  in  the  passenger  seat. 

                                 RAY
                        Will...   Focus  on  my  voice.   We’re 
                        almost  there.
           INT.  HOSPITAL  -  WILL’S  ROOM  -  HALLWAY  -  DAY

           Will  lies  in  bed  with  an  IV  and  an  oxygen  mask  over  his  face.  
           Ray’s  beside  him.   Dr.  Wallace  checks  Will’s  pulse.

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        He  had  a  seizure.   Could’ve  been  from 
                        stress  or  anxiety.   I  think  we’re 
                        going  to  stop  the  chemotherapy.  

                                 RAY
                        And  do  what  instead?

           A  beat,  then...

                                 DR.  WALLACE
                        Spend  time  with  him.

           Dr.  Wallace  leaves  the  room,  passing  an  anxious  Joseph  in  the 
           hallway.   Ray  looks  at  Will.   Takes  his  hand  in  his  own. 

           Joseph  appears  in  the  doorway.   Nervous  to  come  in.

           INT.  HOSPITAL  -  WILL’S  ROOM  -  AN  HOUR  LATER  -  DAY

           Will  slowly  comes  to.   He  looks  over  at  Ray.   Ray  brushes  the 
           hair  our  of  his  face.

                                 RAY
                        Hey.

                                 WILL
                        Hey.

           Ray  smiles,  getting  emotional,  glad  his  son  is  awake.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  LATE  NIGHT

           Ray  sits  down  in  front  of  the  Morisot  painting  resting  on  the 
           easel.   He  stares  at  it  and  at  his  tools  a  long  beat,  then...  

           He  removes  some  items  from  a  HARDWARE  STORE  BAG...  a  bottle 
           of  acetone,  a  bottle  of  rectified  petroleum,  a  bottle  of 
           hydrogen  peroxide,  a  package  of  cotton  wool  and  some  cloths 
           and  puts  them  all  on  the  table.

           Ray  carefully  places  the  Morisot  painting  on  a  towel  on  the 
           floor  and  kneels  beside  it.

           He  soaks  one  cloth  with  acetone  and  another  with  the 
           petroleum  and  he  starts  in  the  lower  right  corner.  

           He  presses  the  acetone  on  the  canvas,  carefully  wiping  away 
           the  paint,  then  quickly  patting  it  down  with  the  peroxide  so 
           as  not  to  go  too  deep.
           CONTINUED:

           The  mixture  of  chemicals  begins  eating  away  the  paint... 
           cleaning  off  the  top  layer  and  leaving  a  white  base  under  it.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  MORNING

           The  sun’s  coming  up  and  Ray  leans  back  exhausted.   All  around 
           him  are  paint  stained  cotton  pieces.  

           He  struggles  to  stand,  his  back  is  stiff  and  he  stretches.  

           He’s  worked  all  night  and  the  paint  on  the  lower  half  of  the 
           painting  is  gone.

           Ray  opens  a  window  to  get  some  air  in  there  and  then  checks 
           his  watch.   He  decides  to  take  a  break.

           INT.  BOSTON  POLICE  STATION  -  MORNING

           Dougherty  hands  a  SCHOOL  PHOTO  of  Will  to  Paisley.      

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        William  Cutter.   Ray  pulled  him  from 
                        school  last  month.   Apparently  he  has 
                        an  inoperable  brain  tumor.  

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        He’s  dying?
                          (off  Dougherty’s  nod)
                        My  God...  that’s  why  he  brought  him 
                        there.

           Dougherty  shares  a  silent  look  with  Paisley.  

           Paisley’s  eyes  land  on  a  photo  of  her  with  her  7  year  old 
           daughter,  DANIELLE.   She  dusts  off  the  frame. 

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           Joseph  fills  four  bowls  with  RED,  GREEN,  YELLOW  and  BLUE 
           colored  minerals  he  got  from  Ivan.   He  polishes  a  pile  of 
           STERLING  SILVER  NUGGETS  and  drops  them  into  another  bowl.

           Carl’s  making  notes  off  the  Museum’s  security  video.

           That’s  when  Ray  walks  in  with  Will.   Will’s  feeling  better, 
           he  looks  a  bit  pale,  but  he’s  excited  as  hell  to  be  here.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Mary  Mother  of  God,  what’s  he  doing 
                        here?

                                 RAY
                        He’s  joining  the  team.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What?   Ray.   No.

                                 WILL
                        Grandpa--

                                 JOSEPH
                        Silence.  
                          (to  Ray)
                        Outside.

                                 RAY
                        Don’t  bother,  I’ve  made  my  decision.   

                                 JOSEPH
                        You  outta  your  mind?   I  can’t  be  a 
                        part  of  this.   You’d  do  this  to  him?

                                 RAY
                        You  have  some  nerve  to  tell  me  how  to 
                        raise  my  son. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Your  son?   I  practically  raised  him!

                                 RAY
                        And  whose  fault  is  that?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m  tired  of  you  using  that  excuse.

                                 RAY
                        Excuse?   I  had  a  gift  Pop.   But  you 
                        used  me.   Forging  phony  licenses, 
                        credit  card  scams,  creating  fake 
                        checks  to  kite...  what’d  you  expect?   

           Will  now  looks  at  Joseph.   The  boy  is  starting  to  understand 
           how  his  father  became  who  he  is.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        He’s  the  one  good  thing  left  in  this 
                        family  Ray.   Don’t  do  this  to  him.

                                 RAY
                        Don’t  you  think  I  know  that!  

                                 WILL
                        Grandpa...  this  is  what  I want.  
                        Enough  about  the  two  of  you.   This  is 
                        about  me.  

           Ray  and  Will  wait  for  Joseph’s  answer.   Finally,  he  groans, 
           giving  in.   Will  puts  his  arm  around  him.  

                                                     DISSOLVE  TO:
           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  DOOR  -  DAY

           Ray  pulls  two  chairs  over  in  front  of  the  blown  up  copy  of 
           the  Renoir.   He  sits  in  one  and  has  Will  sit  in  the  other.

                                 RAY
                        So  Pierre-Auguste  Renoir.   Late 
                        eighteen-hundreds.   People  love  his 
                        work.   Look  at  the  brush  strokes,  the 
                        flow  of  it,  the  energy...

           Ray  impulsively  takes  Will’s  hand  and  runs  it  over  the  copy.  
           A  moment  of  awkwardness  -  but  Will  goes  along  with  it,  caught 
           up  in  his  father’s  passion.

                                 RAY
                        It’s  not  like  a  photograph.   He’s 
                        trying  to  paint  the  feeling of 
                        something.   Maybe  a  moment  from  his 
                        life,  a  memory.

                                 WILL
                        It’s  beautiful.

                                 RAY
                        Yeah.   It  is.   Almost  perfect.

                                 WILL
                        So  it’s  gonna  be  hard  to  fake?

           Ray  nods  and  stands,  starting  to  confront  the  task  facing 
           him. 

                                 RAY
                        Can’t  just  copy  it.   You  have  to  get 
                        inside  the  painting.   To  feel  what  he 
                        was  feeling.

           Which  we  sense  will  be  hard.   Ray  picks  up  the  half-stripped 
           Morisot  painting,  happy  to  find  something  easier  to  tackle, 
           and  he  places  it  on  a  towel  on  the  floor  again.

                                 RAY
                        But  before  that,  come  over  here.  
                        See...

           Ray  grabs  the  chemicals  and  pours  them  in  a  bowl  beside  it.  
           It’s  time  to  finish  stripping  the  painting.

                                 RAY
                        They  can  straight  away  tell  the  age 
                        of  the  painting  by  x-rays  and  carbon 
                        dating.   So  to  get  around  that,  we 
                        take  a  canvas  from  the  same  year, 
                        same  country,  and  clean  off  the  old 
                        paint.   Like  this.
           CONTINUED:

           Ray  takes  two  cloths  in  his  hands.   Once  again,  he  dips  one 
           in  the  acetone  and  the  other  in  the  petroleum  and  starts 
           wiping  away  the  rest  of  the  paint.

                                 RAY
                        See  how  it  comes  off.   We’re  going 
                        down,  layer  by  layer,  until  we  get  to 
                        the  original  old  canvas.   And  that’s 
                        what  we  paint  on.

           Ray  hands  Will  the  cloths.

                                 RAY
                        Here,  you  try.

           Will  hesitates.   He’s  surprised  Ray  is  letting  him  help.

                                 RAY
                        We’re  doing  this  together,  right?

           Will  smiles  and  nods.   He  takes  the  cloths  and  dips  them  in 
           the  bowls.   He  shares  a  cautious  smile  with  Ray.

                                 RAY
                        Very  slowly.   Very  gently.

           Will  nods.   He  gingerly  applies  the  chemicals  to  a  small  area 
           of  the  painting.   With  a  cloth,  he  rubs  at  it,  removing  a 
           first  smear  of  paint,  then  pats  it  down  with  the  other.

           As  the  paint  comes  off,  he  looks  at  his  father  and  smiles.  
           Ray  smiles  back,  loving  Will’s  care  and  seriousness.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  EVENING

           As  night  falls,  Will  is  still  working  on  the  Morisot.   By  now 
           the  old  painting  is  just  about  gone.  

           On  the  other  side  of  the  loft,  Ray  has  finished  grinding  the 
           colored  minerals  that  will  make  the  paint.  

                                 RAY
                        Next  is  the  paint.   Once  pollution 
                        kicked  in,  from  factories  and  cars, 
                        black  specs  began  soaking  into  the 
                        minerals  and  they  now  show  up  in 
                        tests.   So  we  needed  to  get  pure 
                        minerals  from  back  in  the  day  that 
                        haven’t  been  affected  by  this 
                        pollution  yet.  

           Will  can  tell  his  father’s  nervous,  chatting  away.   Will 
           leans  in  and  blows  away  the  last  remaining  specks  of  paint, 
           checking  to  see  if  he’s  missed  any.

                                 WILL
                        Dad?
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Want  me  to  take  a  look?

           Will  nods,  as  Ray  comes  over.   Picking  up  the  canvas,  Ray 
           examines  it  intently  for  any  traces  of  left-over  paint.

                                 RAY
                        Yeah,  this  is  good.

           We  know  these  words  mean  everything  to  Will,  not  that  he’s 
           giving  anything  away.

           And  now  Ray  puts  the  blank  canvas  on  the  easel,  the  task  in 
           front  of  him  hanging  heavy  in  the  gloomy  studio  space.  

           Will  reads  his  apprehension...

                                 WILL
                        Call  it  a  day?

           ...Ray  glad  for  a  way  out.

                                 RAY
                        Great  idea.

           Which  suits  them  both.

           INT.  RAY’S  CAR  -  NIGHT

           Ray’s  driving,  wired.   Will’s  asleep  next  to  him,  the  day  has 
           drained  what  was  left  of  his  energy.   But  there’s  a  new 
           contentment  about  him  that  Ray  senses.   He  smiles.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  KITCHEN  -  EARLY  MORNING

           Bang,  bang,  bang.   Ray  noisily  clears  breakfast.   He’s  like 
           the  singer  backstage  before  a  gig,  wanting  to  get  on  with  it.  
           Will’s  still  eating,  as  clattering  plates  hit  the  sink.

                                 RAY
                        Ready?

                                 WILL
                          (through  a  mouthful  of  toast)
                        Uh-huh.

           Will  puts  on  his  Red  Sox  cap  as  Joseph  enters,  still  in 
           pyjamas,  wondering  at  the  commotion.

                                 RAY
                        Carl  will  give  you  a  ride  Pop.   Call 
                        him,  yeah?

           Will  and  Joseph  exchanging  amused  glances,  as  the  screen  door 
           slams  shut.
           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  MORNING

           And  this  is  it...   The  moment  we’ve  been  waiting  for.   The 
           artist  squaring  up  to  the  blank  canvas  on  the  easel  -  with 
           hope  and  fear  in  equal  measure.

           Ray’s  stick  of  charcoal  hovers  over  the  arctic  white,  which 
           is  beside  the  blown  up  Renoir.   And  then...

           ...he  starts.   Strong,  confident,  strokes.   Sketching  the 
           Renoir...  all  across  the  canvas.

           On  his  face,  the  first  flicker  of  trance-like  pleasure.   This 
           is  what  he  does,  who  he  really  is.  

           Will  is  keeping  his  head  down,  quietly  making  himself  busy  at 
           the  back  of  the  loft,  glancing  up  as  his  father  sketches  in 
           the  outline  of  “Woman  At  The  Piano”.

           As  the  outline  begins  to  take  shape,  we...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  MORNING

           A  roped-off  area  in  the  Impressionist  Section,  where  museum 
           technicians  prepare  to  hang  the  real  painting.

           “Woman  At  The  Piano”  is  slid  from  the  aluminium  flight  case, 
           surrounded  by  museum  officials  and  security  guards.

           Nervous  white-gloved  assistants  wield  digital  temperature 
           gauges,  and  all  manner  of  shiny  technical  equipment.

           From  the  other  side  of  the  rope,  museum  visitors  look  on, 
           excited  to  be  part  of  this  moment.   Among  them,  but  not  too 
           curious,  Joseph  and  Carl.

           And  then  we  see  the  REAL  PAINTING  lifted  up...  in  all  it’s 
           breath-taking  glory.   A  buzz  ripples  through  the  growing 
           crowd.

           Match  cut  from  the  real  thing  to...

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           ...Ray’s  canvas.

           The  charcoal  outline  is  now  fully  sketched  in,  the  first 
           layers  of  background  color  roughly  blocked  out.

           But  no  detail,  no  magic  yet  -  and  for  Ray,  still  a  mountain 
           to  climb.   He’s  talking  quietly  to  himself.

                                 RAY
                        Got  to  be  fast...

           Ray’s  struggling  to  get  into  the  zone,  and  Will  can  tell.
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Coffee,  Dad?   I’m  going  downstairs.  
                        Something  to  eat?

                                 RAY
                        No,  thanks.

           Explaining  to  himself  as  much  as  to  Will...

                                 RAY
                        I  have  to  be  fast.   Keep  the  flow.  

                                 WILL
                        Sure,  Dad.

           Will  leaves,  as  Ray  attacks  his  canvas  with  renewed  energy, 
           calling  out...

                                 RAY
                        Actually,  yes.   Americano,  lots  of 
                        sugar.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  EVENING

           Later  still,  the  painting  is  starting  to  come  together...  

           The  mysterious  woman’s  pale  face.   The  hesitancy  of  her  hands 
           poised  over  the  ivory  keys.   The  gleaming  mahogany  of  the 
           piano.

           Ray’s  fighting  for  it  every  inch  of  the  way.   Slugging  it 
           out,  brush  stroke  by  brush  stroke,  alone  in  the  loft.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  NIGHT 

           The  finished  painting  on  the  easel.   Ray  pacing  as  Will 
           stands  in  front  of  it.

                                 WILL
                        Wow.

           Ray  looks  at  him  closely,  feeding  off  his  reaction.

                                 WILL
                        Amazing.

                                 RAY
                        Yeah?   You  think  so?

                                 WILL
                        I  do... 

           Ray’s  staring  at  Will’s  innocent,  honest  face.  

                                 RAY
                        What?   Not  good  enough?  
           CONTINUED:

                                 WILL
                        Dad,  don’t  say  that.   It’s  amazing.

                                 RAY
                        You  think  I  should  start  again?

                                 WILL
                        Do  you  think  you  should?

           Ray  considers  the  painting  again  in  an  unbiased  light.  

                                 RAY
                        I  can  do  better. 

                                 WILL
                        Do  we  have  time?

                                 RAY
                        There’s  always  time.

           But  really...  there  isn’t...

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  WILL’S  BEDROOM  -  NIGHT

           Will  gets  into  bed.   Ray  stands  by  the  door.

                                 RAY
                        We’ll  start  fresh  again  in  the 
                        morning.

           Will  nods,  Ray  turns  off  the  light,  a  bit  panicked.

           EXT.  SHOPPING  MALL  PARKING  LOT  -  LATE  NIGHT

           The  mall’s  a  bit  rundown.   Some  late  night  shoppers.   Half 
           the  stores  are  boarded  up.   It’s  not  a  wealthy  area.  

           The  lights  in  the  “.99  Cent  Store”  go  out,  it’s  closing.   A 
           cute  16  YEAR  OLD  GIRL  exits  the  front  door  putting  on  her 
           coat.   She  heads  over  to  her  parked  Taurus.  

           EXT.  SHOPPING  MALL  PARKING  LOT  -  TAURUS  -  CONTINUOUS  -  NIGHT

           As  the  girl  removes  her  keys,  she  senses  someone  behind  her 
           so  she  turns  and  sprays  him  with  PEPPER  SPRAY.   Ray  yells.

                                 RAY
                        Tricia,  stop!

           Startled,  Tricia  lowers  the  spray.   Ray  rubs  his  eyes. 

                                 TRICIA
                        Who  the  hell  are  you?
           CONTINUED:

                        I’m  William  Cutter’s  father.

                        car  crash  when  he  was  eleven.

           Ray  struggles  to  look  at  her,  hurt  by  the  comment.   From  his 
           reaction  she  now  believes  him.   She  hands  him  a  water  bottle.

           They’re  sitting  on  the  hood  of  the  Taurus.   A  frustrated  Ray

                        Look  Tricia,  Will  would  kill  me  if  he 
                        knew  I  was  here.

                        Why  are  you  here?

                                 RAY
                        Because  he  misses  you.

                                 TRICIA
                        Give  me  a  break  Mr.  Cutter,  he 
                        thought  I  was  screwin’  around  behind 
                        his  back. 

                                 RAY
                        No,  he  never  thought  that.  

                                 TRICIA
                        Then  I  don’t  get  it.   All  I  did  was 
                        smile.   I’m  just  a  friendly  person.

                                 RAY
                        Listen,  Will  knows  you  did  nothing 
                        wrong.   He  was  just  being  insecure.

                                 TRICIA
                        He  has  nothing  to  be  insecure  about.
                        I  love  the  jerk.

           Ray  looks  at  her,  she’s  blushing.   They  share  a  smile.

           Ray  and  Will  working  together  in  silent  understanding... 
           carefully  stripping  off  the  new  paint...  as  fast  as  they 
           possibly  can...  back  to  the  original  blank  canvas.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  NIGHT

           Ray  paints  like  a  man  possessed.   More  serious...  focused... 
           determined.   Will’s  dozing,  curled  up  on  a  mattress  on  the 
           floor.

           But  now  the  painting  is  coming  to  Ray  again  -  the  dress  of 
           the  woman  at  the  piano  glowing  white  and  translucent.

           The  picture’s  blurry,  dreamy  atmosphere,  radiating  magic.

           Ray  turns,  hearing  something.   And  he  sees  Will  has  woken.  

           His  son  is  sitting  up,  his  back  to  Ray,  staring  off  at  the 
           window...  his  mind  a  million  miles  away.

                        Hey...

           Will  turns  and  sees  Ray  looking  at  him.   Both  know  what  the 
           other  is  thinking.   And  what  is  there  to  say?   What  words?

           Moonlight  through  the  window...  and  outside,  the  low  sounds 
           of  the  night  time  traffic,  the  sleeping  city  at  night.

                                 RAY
                        Are  you  scared?

           Will  thinking  carefully.

                                 WILL
                        No.   A  little  bit.   But  not  too  much.

           Ray’s  blind-sided  by  Will’s  courage,  he  walks  over  to  him.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Will,  I’m  sorry...

                                 WILL
                        Dad,  it’s  ok.   It’s  ok.

           And  they  hold  each  other.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  MORNING

           Ray  and  Will  stand  in  front  of  the  finished  painting.   This 
           time  it’s  the  one  and  Ray  knows  it  -  there’s  a  confidence  and 
           an  energy  exuding  from  him  that  Will  picks  up  on.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           Will  sits  on  a  stool  in  front  of  a  white  sheet  as  Carl  takes 
           FOUR  PHOTOS  of  him.   Ray  turns  to  Joseph  next.

                                 RAY
                        You’re  up,  Pop.

           Joseph  switches  place  with  Will  on  the  stool.   Carl  snaps  off 
           more  photos  of  him.  

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           Ray  directs  Will  on  how  to  carefully  glue  the  PASSPORT  PHOTO 
           of  Will  onto  a  COUNTERFEIT  PASSPORT,  just  like  Will  did  with 
           the  toy  model.

           Ray  peers  over  Will’s  shoulder  to  make  sure  he  does  it  right.  
           Will  has  a  very  steady  hand.

           Will  finishes  gluing  the  passport.   He  looks  up  at  Ray.   Ray 
           pats  him  on  the  back  approvingly.   Will  beams.

           Ray  places  Will’s  fake  passport  next  to  Ray’s  and  Joseph’s  on 
           the  table  to  let  them  all  dry.

           Ray’s  new  name  on  his  phony  passport  is:  Robert  Chambers

           Will’s  new  name:  Wyatt  Chambers

           Joseph’s  name:  Bernie  Chambers

           INT.  CRIMINAL  COURTS  BUILDING  -  DAY

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  search  through  prisoner  release  records

                        wants  to  get  out  early.   Maybe  he 
                        calls  Keating  for  help.   Keating  buys 
                        off  Stone  and  now  he  wants  something 
                        in  return.

           Ray  carries  the  painting  downstairs  into  the  empty,  closed 
           restaurant,  followed  by  Will.   He  slides  the  painting  into 
           the  big  pizza  oven.

                                 RAY

                        should  harden  the  paint  and  take  it 
                        back  to  1875.

           EXT.  TIFFANY’S  JEWELERS  -  DOWNTOWN  BOSTON  -  DAY

           Ray,  Joseph  and  Will  pull  up  in  front.   They  get  out  of  the 
           Buick  wearing  baseball  caps  and  sunglasses.   Will’s  carrying 
           a  SHOPPING  BAG  and  all  three  wear  gloves.

           EXT.  TIFFANY’S  JEWELERS  -  UNDERCOVER  COP  CAR  -  CONTINUOUS

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  are  parked  down  the  street,  out  of 
           sight.

                        You  think  he’s  gonna  do  something 
                        now?   In  broad  daylight?  

           Joseph  and  Will  enter  the  jewelry  store.   Before  Ray  goes  in 
           he  glances  around  the  street  to  see  if  anyone  noticed  them.  

           A  few  seconds  go  by,  as  Paisley  and  Dougherty  wait,  then... 
           Tiffany’s  ALARM  GOES  OFF.

           INT.  TIFFANY’S  JEWELERS  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  burst  into  the  store  with  guns  drawn.  
           But  stop  in  their  tracks  when  they  see  --  Will  on  the  floor 
           with  Ray  and  the  SALESWOMAN  fanning  him.  

           It  looks  like  he  had  a  sudden  attack  of  nausea  and  dropped 
           his  shopping  bag  with  a  toolbox  inside  onto  the  glass 
           counter,  shattering  the  glass  and  setting  off  the  alarm.

                                 WILL
                        I’m  okay...  I  was  just  dizzy...

           Ray  and  the  Saleswoman  help  Will  up.   His  baseball  cap  falls 
           off  and  his  thinning  hair  is  visible.

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  holster  their  weapons.  

           Paisley  makes  eye  contact  with  Ray  and  a  knowing  look  passes 
           between  them.

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  lean  against  their  car.

                        made.

           Ray,  Will  and  Joseph  exit  the  store.   Ray  helps  Will  into  the 
           Buick,  then  he  turns  to  Paisley.  

                                 RAY
                        Hey  Catherine.

           They  stop  at  an  outside  cafe  and  take  a  seat  at  an  empty 
           table.  

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        What’s  on  your  mind  Ray?   What  do  you

                        Why  are  you  tailing  me?

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Because  you’re  hanging  around  Keating 
                        as  he’s  a  bad  guy.   Are  you  a  bad  guy 
                        Ray?

                                 RAY
                        Depends  on  who  you  ask.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        I’m  asking  you.

                                 RAY
                        Of  course  I  am.   I  just  got  out  of 
                        prison.   That’s  where  bad  guys  live.

           Paisley  opens  her  wallet,  shows  Ray  a  photo  of  her  daughter.

                        Her  name’s  Danielle.   Hardest  job  in 
                        the  world  being  a  parent.   You  never 
                        want  to  let  them  down.

           Ray  shifts  in  his  seat.

                        When  I  became  a  cop  I  arrested  this 
                        college  kid.   He  was  drinking  with 
                        his  girl  when  this  drunk  grabbed  her 
                        ass.   The  two  start  brawling  and  the 
                        drunk  trips  and  hits  his  head.   Goes 
                        into  a  coma.   He  survives,  but  now 
                        the  college  kid  gets  three  years  for 
                        assault.   Fast  forward  three  years 
                        and  he  has  two  weeks  left  on  his 
                        sentence  when  his  mother  dies.   The 
                        courts  won’t  let  him  out  early,  so  he 
                        escapes.   I  pick  him  up  at  his 
                        mother’s  funeral.   He  just  wanted  to 
                        pay  his  respects.   The  judge  gives 
                        him  three  more  years.   One  week  into 
                        his  new  sentence  he’s  stabbed  to 
                        death  in  his  cell.   Now,  do  I  think 
                        about  him  every  day?   Yes.   But  it 
                        was  my  job  to  arrest  him.

                                 RAY
                        Maybe  he  felt  like  he  let  her  down 
                        and  that  was  the  only  way  he  could 
                        make  it  up  to  her.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        I  feel  even  worse  for  him  then.

                        Me?   No.   I  promised  my  daughter  I’d

                        her  birthday  in  March,  it’s  now 
                        October  and  I  still  haven’t  bought 
                        the  tickets.  

                                 RAY
                        Then  what’s  your  point?

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        My  point  is,  don’t  become  collateral 
                        damage.   My  sights  are  on  him.   He’s 
                        a  virus,  and  I  will  take  him  down.   

           A  beat  passes  between  them,  it’s  not  lost  on  Ray  that  Paisley 
           likes  him  and  is  trying  to  give  him  a  break.

                                 RAY
                        Are  we  done?

           She  leans  forward.   Gestures  to  Ray’s  paint-stained  fingers.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Looks  like  you’re  painting  again  Ray.

           Ray  doesn’t  hide  his  fingers.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Maybe  we  can  help  each  other.   You 
                        fill  me  in  and  I  make  sure  you  walk.

           Ray  considers  this...  then  regretfully  shakes  his  head...

                                 RAY
                        I’m  sorry  Detective,  I  can’t  help

                        I  won’t  ask  again.

           Ray  nods  appreciatively.   Paisley  accepts  this,  so  be  it.

           Joseph,  Will,  Carl  and  Ray  stand  in  front  of  Ray’s  completed

           and  perfect  it  looks. 

           Will  glances  at  his  father.   Ray  winks  at  him.

                        Tricia?

           Joseph  nods.   Will  glances  over  at  his  father  suspiciously.

                        Don’t  look  at  me,  I  didn’t  have 
                        anything  to  do  with  it.   Give  her  a 
                        call.

           Off  Will,  considering  this,  as  a  smile  spreads  on  his  face...

                                 KEATING
                        I  see  not  much  has  changed  around 
                        here,  Ray.

                                 RAY
                        What  are  you  doing  here  Tommy?

                                 KEATING
                        Checking  on  your  progress.

           Joseph  sneaks  in  the  back  door  and  appears  in  the  kitchen 
           doorway,  right  behind  Finn  and  Collin.  

           In  one  fluid  move  he  snatches  both  of  their  guns  from  their 
           holsters...  it’s  an  amazing  display  of  sleight  of  hand  from  a 
           master  pickpocket.

           Finn  and  Collin  spin  around  reaching  for  their  guns  but  their 
           holsters  are  empty...  they  see  Joseph  aiming  their  guns  at 
           them  and  back  up,  embarrassed.  

           Keating  starts  laughing  and  clapping.   Impressed.

                                 KEATING
                        You  still  got  the  touch  Joseph.
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Pop,  give  them  back  their  guns.

           Joseph  considers  this  a  beat...  then  he  hands  them  back  to 
           Finn  and  Collin.

                                 RAY
                        Outside.

           Keating  gets  up  and  follows  Ray  out  the  back  door.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  BACKYARD  -  CONTINUOUS  -  DAY

           Ray  and  Keating  sit  at  a  picnic  table.   Finn  and  Collin  are 
           off  to  the  side.

                                 RAY
                        We’re  a  go  for  tomorrow  night.  
                        Museum  closes  at  9:45,  I’ll  be  at 
                        your  place  at  midnight  with  the 
                        painting.  

                                 KEATING
                        Excellent.   How  are  you  gonna  do  it?

                                 RAY
                        Let  me  worry  about  that.   This  buyer 
                        you  have  lined  up  Tommy.   How  much  is 
                        he  paying?

                                 KEATING
                        Ray...  come  on...

           Ray  eyes  him  hard,  waiting...   Keating  hesitates,  then...

                                 KEATING
                        Twelve.

                                 RAY
                        I  want  two.   Not  including  expenses.

                                 KEATING
                        No  way  Ray.

                                 RAY
                        This  is  a  Renoir Tommy.   And if I get 
                        caught  I’m  looking  at  twenty  years.  
                        So  deal  with  it.   Or  call  Stone  and 
                        get  someone  else.   I  mean  it.  

           A  tense  moment...  Keating  knows  he’s  not  able  to  negotiate 
           with  Ray.   He  finally  nods,  agreeing.

                                 RAY
                        Have  my  money  ready  to  be 
                        transferred,  I’ll  give  you  the 
                        account  number.
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEATING
                        Fine.   Anything  else  I  should  know 
                        about?

                                 RAY
                        Yeah,  two  detectives  came  down  hard 
                        on  me  today.   They  got  it  in  for  you.  
                        They  wanted  me  to  set  you  up.

           Keating  smiles,  he  knew  that  already.

                                 KEATING
                        I’m  glad  you  told  me.

                                 RAY
                        Why?   You  already  knew.

                                 KEATING
                        That  I  did.

           Ray  leans  in  close  to  Keating  to  emphasize  what  he’s  about  to 
           say  next.

                                 RAY
                        Don’t  fuck  me  over  tomorrow  Tommy.  
                        Whatever  happened  before  is  in  the 
                        past.  

                                 KEATING
                        Don’t  worry  Ray,  I  won’t  stand  in  the 
                        way  of  what  little  time  you  have  left 
                        with  your  son.

           Keating  gets  up  and  exits  the  yard  with  Finn  and  Collin.  

           Once  they’re  gone,  Ray  turns  to  see  Joseph  standing  in  the 
           doorway  with  a  worried  look  on  his  face.

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  BACK  BAY  -  DAY

           Carl  has  just  finished  briefing  Ray,  Will  and  Joseph  on  the 
           plan.   In  front  of  them  are  drawings,  sketches  and  models  on 
           the  museum.   Everyone’s  a  bit  on  edge.   Tense.   Keyed  up.

                                 CARL
                        ...and  that  should  pretty  much  cover 
                        it.   Any  questions?

           Ray  and  Joseph  exchange  a  satisfied  look,  then  turn  to  Will.

                                 RAY
                        Will,  you  good?

                                 WILL
                        Yeah...

           Off  Will,  still  unsure  about  the  plan. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOSEPH
                        What’d  you  expect,  us  crawling  under 
                        red  laser  beams?

           Ray  and  Carl  get  a  chuckle  out  of  this.   Carl  approaches  Ray.  
           He  hands  Ray  a  THIN  PLASTIC  WHITE  MASK.

                                 CARL
                        Here’s  that  mask  you  wanted.

           Ray  slips  the  clear  plastic  mask  on  his  face,  it’s  held  on  by 
           a  rubber  band  and  form  fits  to  Ray’s  features  like  a  glove.

                                 RAY
                        Perfect. 

           Joseph  removes  FOUR  CIGARS  from  his  pocket,  hands  them  out.

                                 WILL
                        I  thought  we  celebrated  after the 
                        heist?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Who  says  we’ll  be  free  after  the 
                        heist.   This  is  for  good  luck.

           Joseph  lights  Will’s  cigar.   Will  takes  a  puff,  coughs.   The 
           guys  smile.   Joseph  pats  his  grandson  proudly  on  the  back.

           EXT.  OAK  GROVE  CEMETERY  -  GRAVE  HEADSTONE  -  DAY

           A  PAIR  OF  HANDS  brushes  away  the  leaves  to  reveal... 

                              Rita  Cutter 
                         Loving Wife and Mother
                              1940 - 1967

           Joseph  places  a  bouquet  of  Lilies  on  the  grave.  

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  remember  Lilies  were  your  favorite.

           He  removes  his  scally  cap.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m  sorry  I  haven’t  come  in  a  while.  
                        I  guess  I  just...  didn’t  feel  worthy.  
                          (awkward  beat)
                        Ray’s  doing  good.   God  knows  I  didn’t 
                        give  him  a  great  foundation  to  start 
                        with.   But  thankfully,  he’s  become  a 
                        better  father  than  me.

           Joseph  clears  his  throat.
           CONTINUED:

                                 JOSEPH
                        And  your  grandson  is  just  as  tough  as 
                        you  were.   He’s  a  great  kid.   You  two 
                        would  really  hit  it  off.

           His  eyes  well  up.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  don’t  know  how  this  is  gonna  turn 
                        out.   But  do  me  a  favor,  when  you 
                        meet  Will,  take  good  care  of  him.  
                        Like  you  took  good  care  of  us.  

           Joseph  wipes  his  eyes.

                                 JOSEPH
                        So  long  honey...
                          (voice  cracking)
                        ...and  in  case  I  never  told  you,  I 
                        always  loved  you.

           As  Joseph  turns  and  heads  back  to  his  car...

           EXT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  EVENING

           This  is  it...   Ray  exits  his  house.   Takes  a  deep  breath.   
           He  gets  into  the  Buick  and  drives  off.  

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  follow  him  in  the  unmarked  car.

           EXT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  EVENING

           Ray  parks  the  Buick  out  front.   He  leaves  it  running  and 
           heads  into  the  restaurant.   Paisley  pulls  to  a  stop,  waits.

           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  EVENING

           FOLLOW  Ray  as  he  hurries  through  the  restaurant  and  out  the 
           back  door... 

           EXT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  OUT  BACK  -  EVENING

           ...where  Carl’s  waiting  in  his  Caddy  in  the  back  alley.   Ray 
           jumps  in  and  they  drive  off.

           EXT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  MINUTES  LATER  -  EVENING

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  are  still  waiting  in  front.   More  time 
           goes  by  and  Paisley  senses  something’s  wrong.   She  gets  out 
           of  the  car  and  hurries  into  the  restaurant.
           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  EVENING

           Paisley  runs  inside  followed  by  Dougherty.   The  restaurant  is 
           semi-full  with  a  lunch  crowd.   But  no  sign  of  Ray.   She 
           confronts  Daphne,  pulls  out  her  badge.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Where  is  he?

                                 DAPHNE
                        Who?

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Do  you  want  me  to  shut  you  down?   I 
                        will  close  this  place  right  now  and 
                        take  away  your  license.   Tell  me 
                        where  Ray  Cutter  is. 

           Daphne  just  shakes  her  head.

                                 DAPHNE
                        I  don’t  know  who  you’re  talking 
                        about.

           Paisley  looks  around  and  notices  the  BARTENDER  glancing  at  a 
           bookshelf  in  the  corner,  like  he’s  signalling  her.

           Paisley  approaches  him  and  then  steps  up  to  the  bookshelf.

           Daphne  eyes  the  Bartender,  he’s  definitely  fired.

           Paisley  pulls  the  bookshelf  out,  revealing  the  hidden  door...

           INT.  LOFT  ABOVE  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  EVENING  

           Paisley  heads  upstairs  into  the  loft...  which  is  now 
           completely  cleaned  up.   No  sign  of  the  workshop  anywhere.

           Dougherty  appears  behind  Paisley.  

                                 DET.  DOUGHERTY
                        Smells  like  bleach.

           Paisley  kneels  down  and  examines  the  wood  floor.   She  looks 
           closer  and  sees  very  slight  traces  of  paint.   She  jumps  up...

           EXT.  SHAMROCK’S  REST.  -  BACK  ALLEY  -  MOMENTS  LATER  -  EVENING

           Paisley  digs  through  the  dumpster.   She  rips  open  garbage 
           bags,  tosses  them  out.   Dougherty  tries  to  sort  through  them.

           She  finds  a  bag  with  torn  up  paperwork  and  then  spots...  the 
           top  half  of  a  torn  pamphlet  on  the  Museum  Of  Fine  Arts.

           She  holds  it  up...  and  everything  starts  falling  into  place.
           CONTINUED:

           As  she  jumps  out  of  the  dumpster  with  renewed  energy,  we...

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  ESTABLISHING  -  NIGHT

           The  gorgeous  two  story  museum  sits  before  us  all  lit  up.

           Cyrus  Dallin's  statue  “Appeal  to  the  Great  Spirit”,  stands 
           outside  the  Museum's  south  entrance.   The  impressive  bronze 
           equestrian  statuette  is  of  a  Native  American  Indian  on 
           horseback  with  his  arms  outstretched.   

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  NIGHT

           The  place  is  semi-crowded.   Patrons  are  clogged  in  front  of 
           each  piece  of  art  listening  to  its  history  on  headphones.

           Ray  and  Will  stroll  through  the  exhibits.   Will  wears  a 
           KNAPSACK.  

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  IMPRESSIONIST’S  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Ray  and  Will  arrive  at  the  Impressionist’s  section,  where  the 
           Renoir  is  displayed  along  with  paintings  by  Monet,  Sisley, 
           and  Bazille.

           Will  admires  all  the  artwork.   He’s  never  seen  anything  like 
           it  before.   They  stop  at  Renoir’s  “Woman  At  The  Piano”.    

           They  both  stand  there  a  beat  taking  in  the  real  thing...

           Then  Ray  and  Will  leave  the  Impressionist  Section  and  enter 
           the  hallway,  heading  for  the  Men’s  Room.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  EGYPTIAN  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  enters  the  Egyptian  section  at  the  same  time.   He 
           approaches  one  of  the  statues  and  removes  a  CAN  OF  SODA  from 
           his  jacket  pocket.

           When  no  one’s  looking  he  SHAKES  the  soda  can  vigorously.   
           Then  he  waits  for  a  GUARD  #1  to  enter  the  room.  

           He  opens  the  can  and  SPRAYS  carbonated  soda  all  over  the 
           floor.   Guard  #1  runs  over  and  takes  the  can  from  Joseph.

                                 GUARD  #1
                        You’re  not  allowed  drinks  in  here!

           Joseph  tries  to  take  the  soda  back,  but  Guard  #1  grabs  him  by 
           the  arm  and  leads  him  out  of  the  Museum.
           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  FRONT  DOOR  -  NIGHT

           Guard  #1  roughly  ejects  Joseph  out  of  the  museum.  

           As  Joseph  angrily  walks  off,  he  glances  down  at  GUARD  #1’S 
           KEYS,  which  are  now  in  his  hand.

           Guard  #2  comes  in  to  see  Ray  at  the  sink.

                                 GUARD  #2
                        Sir,  it’s  nine-thirty,  we’re  closing 
                        in  fifteen  minutes.

           Ray  wipes  his  hands  and  follows  Guard  #2  out.

           PUSH  IN  on  a  ceiling  grate...  and  we  see  Will  hiding  inside.

           INSIDE  GRATE

           Will  settles  into  the  vent.   He  removes  an  iPod  from  his 
           knapsack.   Leans  back  and  listens  to  some  tunes.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  9:45  PM  -  NIGHT

           Ray  exits  with  the  last  remaining  patrons.   Carl  is  parked 
           across  the  street  in  a  rented  van.   Ray  gets  in.   Joseph  is 
           in  back.   Nobody  says  anything  as  they  drive  around  back.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  OUT  FRONT  -  MINUTES  LATER  -  NIGHT

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  race  to  a  stop  in  front  with  THREE  MORE 
           POLICE  CARS.   Paisley  jumps  out  and  runs  up  the  front  steps, 
           followed  by  Dougherty.   She  bangs  on  the  front  door.  

           Guard  #1  peers  out,  sees  her  shield,  and  opens  the  door...

                        going  to  be  a  robbery  here.   May  we 
                        take  a  look  around?

           Guard  #1  lets  them  in.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  LOADING  DOCK/CARL’S  VAN  -  NIGHT

           Ray,  Joseph  and  Carl  get  dressed  in  black.   Ray  checks  his 
           watch,  10:00  PM,  then  he  makes  a  call...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  MEN’S  ROOM  -  SAME  TIME  -  NIGHT

           Still  inside  the  vent,  Will’s  cell  vibrates  in  his  pocket.  
           He  answers  it,  whispering...

                                 WILL
                        Yeah.

                                 RAY  (V.O.)
                        Museum’s  closed.   The  guard’s  first 
                        shift  change  should  be  any  minute.  
                        Set  your  watch.

           Will  and  Ray  set  their  watches  for  a  SIX  MINUTE  COUNTDOWN.  

           Then  Will  snaps  the  phone  shut,  he  pries  up  the  metal  grate 
           and  lowers  himself  out  of  the  vent  into  the  bathroom.

           He  slips  on  a  ski  mask  then  he  removes  an  ELECTRIC  SCREW  GUN 
           from  his  knapsack.   He  peers  out  of  the  bathroom  to  see...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  NIGHT

           ...the  museum’s  closed  and  Guard  #3  is  finishing  his  rounds.  
           Guard  #3  enters  the  Security  Office  not  too  far  down  the 
           hallway.

           Will  inches  out  of  the  bathroom,  sneaking  towards  the  door.

           He’s  about  to  reach  it,  when  he  hears  FOOTSTEPS  approaching. 
           He  quickly  ducks  into  the...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  EGYPTIAN  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Will  hides  behind  a  statue. 

           Coming  around  the  corner  is  Paisley,  Dougherty  and  Guard  #1. 
           CONTINUED:

           They  walk  around,  searching  for  anything  out  of  place,  and 
           stop  on  the  other  side  of  the  statue,  just  miss  seeing  Will.

                                 GUARD  #1
                        Right  here.   We  already  mopped  it  up.

           Paisley  looks  around.   A  few  feet  away,  a  nervous  Will  begins 
           breathing  heavy,  his  heart  racing.   He’s  on  the  verge  of 
           hyperventilating...

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  LOADING  DOCK/CARL’S  VAN  -  NIGHT

           The  van  door  opens  and  Ray,  Joseph  and  Carl  get  out  wearing 
           ski  masks.   Ray  has  a  DUFFLE  BAG  and  a  ZIP  UP  LEATHER  CASE 
           strapped  to  his  back.   Joseph  has  a  FANNY  PACK  around  his 
           waist.   And  Carl  carries  a  TOOL  BOX.

           Ray  and  Joseph  head  for  the  side  door  of  the  museum,  while 
           Carl  approaches  the  Telephone  Junction  box  on  the  corner.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  BACK  DOOR  OF  LOADING  DOCK  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  stops  by  the  back  door.   He  takes  out  Guard  #1’s  Keys 
           he  lifted.   He  finds  the  right  one  and  unlocks  the  back  door.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  BACK  DOOR  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  and  Ray  hurry  inside.   There’s  a  NUMERIC  KEYPAD  ALARM 
           on  the  wall  counting  down  from  30  seconds.   They  need  to 
           punch  in  the  alarm  code  within  that  time  or  it  will  sound.

           Moving  fast  and  precise,  Joseph  digs  into  his  fanny  pack  and 
           pulls  out  a  SPRAY  CAN  OF  BARIUM,  a  BLACKLIGHT  and  a  pair  of 
           MAGNIFYING  GLASSES.

           Ray  checks  his  watch...  00:24...00:23...00:22...

           Joseph  sprays  the  keys  with  the  barium,  then  he  slips  on  the 
           magnifying  glasses.   He  aims  the  blacklight  at  the  keypad.

           JOSEPH’S  POV  -  The  keys  are  now  illuminated  in  the  blacklight 
           from  the  barium.   Four  of  the  worn-out  numbers  have  GREEN 
           FINGERPRINTS  glowing  on  them.

           Ray  glances  at  the  time...  00:14...00:13...00:12...

           Joseph  starts  with  the  least  prominent  print,  which  is  on  the 
           4,  then  he  follows  the  green  smudge  as  it  leads  slightly  to 
           the  second  number,  8,  then  the  third,  6,  and  lastly,  7.

           Ray  eyes  his  watch...  00:07...00:06...00:05...

           Joseph  punches  the  four  numbers  in  order,  and...  BEEP!      
           The  alarm  shuts  down.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  TELEPHONE  JUNCTION  BOX  -  NIGHT

           Carl  has  the  TELEPHONE  JUNCTION  BOX  open  on  the  sidewalk.    
           He  checks  the  different  phones  lines  with  an  alligator  clip 
           to  see  which  ones  are  connected  to  the  museum...  finds  them. 

           He  pulls  out  a  WIRELESS  HANDSAW  and  checks  his  watch... 
           waiting...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  VARIOUS  SECTIONS  -  NIGHT

           Ray  and  Joseph  walk  through  the  museum.   Ray  hears  Paisley’s 
           VOICE  nearby,  he  pulls  Joseph  around  the  corner.

           RAY’S  POV  -  PEERING  AROUND  CORNER

           He  sees  Paisley,  Dougherty  and  Guard  #1  looking  around  the 
           Egyptian  Section,  talking.   Shit.   She’s  onto  him.

           Then  Ray  unbelievably  spots  Will  hiding  behind  the  statue  a 
           few  feet  away.   Will’s  covered  in  sweat  and  breathing  out  of 
           control.   He  looks  at  his  father,  panicked.

           Ray  holds  up  his  hands,  gesturing  for  him  to  calm  down.   Will 
           nods.   Ray  mimes  for  him  to  take  a  deep  breath.

           Will  follows  Ray,  as  they  both  breath  in  from  across  the 
           museum  with  Paisley,  Dougherty  and  Guard  #1  feet  away.

           Will  begins  to  calm  down  and  regain  his  bearings.   He  shares 
           a  nod  with  his  father.

           Then  Paisley,  Dougherty  and  Guard  #1  walks  off,  leaving  the 
           Egyptian  section.  

           As  they  do,  Ray  moves  closer  to  Will,  he  lifts  him  up  and 
           checks  him.   Will  nods,  he’s  okay,  just  weak.   Ray  hugs  him.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  FRONT  DOOR  -  NIGHT

           Guard  #1  leads  Paisley  and  Dougherty  out  the  front  door, 
           joining  the  other  officers.   Frustrated,  Paisley  hands  Guard 
           #1  her  business  card.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        You  have  any  problems,  call  me 
                        immediately.

           Guard  #1  nods  and  takes  her  card.   After  closing  and  locking 
           the  front  door,  he  heads  into  the  stairwell.  
           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  STAIRWELL  -  NIGHT

           Guard  #1  removes  a  FLASK  from  his  pocket  and  takes  a  swig.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  EGYPTIAN  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  taps  Ray  on  the  shoulder,  reminding  him  they  need  to 
           move.   Ray  breaks  the  hug,  moving  back  from  Will.  

           Joseph  hands  Will  a  can  of  BLACK  SPRAY  PAINT,  then  Joseph  and 
           Will  hurry  into  the  Impressionist  Section.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  OUT  FRONT  -  NIGHT

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  approach  their  car.   She  releases  the 
           other  cop  cars.   They  all  start  driving  off.

           Humiliated,  Paisley  tosses  one  last  look  at  the  Museum.   Her 
           gut’s  telling  her  something’s  not  right.   She  doesn’t  want  to 
           get  back  in  the  car.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  IMPRESSIONIST  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Joseph  and  Will  begin  spraying  the  TWO  SECURITY  CAMERAS  in 
           that  section,  blinding  them.

           While  Ray  runs  over  to  the  Security  Office  door  with  Will’s 
           knapsack  and  ELECTRIC  SCREW  GUN.

           Carl’s  watch  beeps...  he  starts  up  a  WIRELESS  HANDSAW  and 
           cuts  through  the  wires,  rendering  the  entire  block  without 
           telephone  lines.

                        Look  at  this.

           ON  THE  MONITORS  -  Two  of  the  monitors  in  the  Impressionist

                        fine.  

           Guards  #4  and  #5  approach  the  office  door,  hearing...  the 
           ELECTRIC  SCREW  GUN  on  the  other  side  of  the  door.

           Ray  drills  screws  into  the  door  and  door  frame,  sealing  the

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  IMPRESSIONIST  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Ray  hurries  in  and  kneels  in  front  of  the  Renoir.   Joseph  and 
           Will  give  him  room.   He  unzips  the  leather  case  and  carefully 
           slides  the  forged  painting  out.

           Next  he  removes  a  12V  CAR  BATTERY  from  the  duffle  bag  and 
           connects  the  battery  cables  to  the  wires  holding  up  the  real 
           Renoir  painting.  

           This  will  make  sure  the  connection  never  breaks  so  no  one 
           will  know  the  painting  was  ever  switched.

           Ray  then  unhooks  the  real  Renoir  painting  from  the  magnets.  
           He  quickly  pries  the  real  painting  out  of  its  wooden  frame. 

           Then  he  removes  the  real  Renoir  from  the  wooden  board  and 
           replaces  it  with  the  forged  Renoir.   He  places  the  old  frame 
           onto  the  forged  Renoir.

           Then  he  re-connects  the  magnets  to  the  old  wooden  frame  and 
           unclips  the  battery  cables.  

           Now  the  fake  Renoir  is  hanging  on  the  wall  in  its  place.

           Will  exchanges  a  look  with  his  grandfather...  less  than  a 
           minute  has  gone  by...  impressive...

           The  BANGING  SOUND  coming  from  the  Guard’s  Office  gets  their 
           attention.   The  Guards  are  trying  to  break  the  door  down.

           Ray  places  the  real  Renoir  onto  a  thin  piece  of  wood  and 
           slips  it  back  into  the  leather  case.

           Panicked  that  the  door  won’t  open,  Guard  #4  hits  the  ALARM.

           Guard  #5  pulls  out  his  cell  phone  to  call  911.

           Guard  #1  with  the  flask  hears  the  ALARM  and  jumps.   He  drops 
           his  flask,  picks  it  up  and  hurries  out  into  the  museum.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  IMPRESSIONIST  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           The  ALARM  SOUNDS!   Will  looks  nervously  at  his  father.

                                 RAY
                        Stay  calm.

                                 WILL
                        I  am  calm.   Don’t  worry  about  me.

           Ray  smiles,  then  turns  to  Joseph.

                                 RAY
                        I’ll  meet  you  at  the  door.

           Joseph  leads  Will  out  of  the  Impressionist  Section.

           Ray  puts  the  battery  back  into  the  duffle  bag  and  gathers  up 
           the  rest  of  his  stuff.

           But  before  Ray  leaves...  he  removes  another  smaller  painting 
           off  the  wall  without  using  the  battery,  Monet’s  “The  Water 
           Lily  Pond”  (16”  x  20”).

                        Call  it  in!

           Paisley  rushes  over  to  a  museum  window  to  peer  inside...

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  OUTSIDE  GUARD  OFFICE  -  NIGHT

           Guard  #1  reaches  the  Guard’s  Office  door.   He  tries  to  pull 
           the  door  open,  but  notices  the  nails.  

           He  KICKS  at  it  with  all  his  might,  cracking  it.
           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  HALLWAY  -  NIGHT

           Holding  the  Monet  painting,  Ray  steps  out  of  the 
           Impressionist  Section  into  the  hallway  and  hears  the  Guard 
           door  being  broken  down... 

           ...he  lifts  up  his  ski  mask  to  look  down  the  hall  at  Guard  #1 
           kicking  the  door  in.   But  then  notices  the  SECURITY  CAMERA 
           aimed  right  at  him.  

                                 RAY
                        Shit...

           Ray’s  face  (which  from  behind  we  cannot  see)  is  in  full  view 
           of  the  uncovered  security  camera  in  the  hallway.

           Guard  #1  suddenly  spots  Ray  and  gives  chase.   Ray  quickly 
           pulls  the  mask  back  down  and  runs  for  the  back  door.

           EXT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  BACK  DOOR  OF  LOADING  DOCK  -  NIGHT 

           Ray  burst  out  of  the  museum  and  shuts  the  door.   Carl  pulls 
           up  in  the  van.   Joseph  and  Will  climb  in.   Ray  hops  in  last 
           beside  his  son.  

           The  van  peels  away,  and  once  it  turns  the  corner,  driving  out 
           of  sight...

           ...the  museum’s  back  door  FLIES  OPEN  AGAIN  and  the  Drunk 
           Guard  emerges... 

           ...just  as  Paisley  and  Dougherty  come  running  around  the  back 
           of  the  museum.   They  both  look  around,  out  of  breath,  but 
           there’s  no  one  in  sight  anywhere.

           EXT./INT.  VAN  -  DRIVING  -  NIGHT

           Will  is  all  smiles.   Ray  looks  at  his  son,  who  is  admiring 
           the  skyline  of  the  city  lit  up  across  the  Charles  River.  

           It’s  truly  an  awesome  sight,  and  Will  is  on  top  of  the  world.

           INT.  KEATING’S  PENTHOUSE  -  MIDNIGHT  -  NIGHT

           Keating’s  having  a  drink  with  the  buyer  MICHAEL  DEMARCO  and 
           his  large  BODYGUARD,  while  they  wait  for  Ray.

           The  doorbell  rings.   Keating  tosses  a  relieved  glance  at  the 
           clock,  it’s  Midnight  exactly.

                                 KEATING
                        How’s  that  for  punctual?

           Finn  opens  the  door  for  Ray.   Ray  walks  in  with  the  leather 
           case  in  his  hand  and  his  jacket  slung  over  his  shoulder.
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEATING
                        Are  we  happy?

           Ray  tosses  his  jacket  on  the  couch.   He  opens  the  leather 
           case  and  slides  out  the  real  Renoir.

           Demarco  gives  an  excited  breath  as  he  caresses  the  painting.  
           He  pulls  out  an  eyepiece  and  examines  it.  

           Ray  takes  a  seat  on  the  couch  while  Keating  waits  for  Demarco 
           to  confirm  its  authenticity.   He  motions  to  their  drinks.

                                 RAY
                        Think  I  could  get  one  of  those?

           Keating  nods  for  Finn  to  make  Ray  a  drink.  

           Everyone’s  distracted  at  the  moment,  and  that’s  enough  time 
           for  Ray  to  slide  the  rolled  up  Monet  painting  out  of  his 
           jacket  sleeve,  walk  over  and  slip  it  into  the  book  shelf.

           Finn  turns  around  and  Ray  is  now  standing  behind  him.   He 
           takes  the  drink  from  Finn.

           At  the  desk,  Demarco  removes  the  eyepiece  and  holds  his 
           chest,  overwhelmed  with  emotion  from  the  artwork. 

                                 KEATING
                        Well,  is  it  real  or  not?

                                 DEMARCO
                        It’s...yes...I’m  sorry,  I  can’t  even 
                        speak...  I  don’t  know  what  to  say...

           Ray  hands  him  a  piece  of  paper.

                                 RAY
                        Start  by  transferring  my  share  into 
                        that  account.

           Demarco  hands  the  paper  to  his  Bodyguard,  who  makes  the  wire 
           transfer  to  Ray  and  Keating’s  accounts  on  a  laptop.

                                 DEMARCO
                        I  am  truly  impressed.

                                 KEATING
                        I  told  you  you’d  be.

           Demarco  returns  the  painting  to  the  leather  case.   The 
           Bodyguard  signals  Demarco  that  the  transfer  is  complete. 

           Ray  makes  a  call  on  his  cell  to  confirm  the  funds  are  there.  
           After  he  gets  his  answer,  he  shuts  his  cell.

                                 RAY
                        Gentlemen,  it  was  nice  doing  business 
                        with  you.
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Ray  starts  for  the  door.   Finn  and  Collin  cut  him  off.

                                 KEATING
                        Ray,  hold  on  a  second.   Demarco, 
                        Collin  will  show  you  out.

           Demarco  shakes  hands  with  Keating,  then  exits  the  Penthouse 
           with  the  leather  case  and  his  Bodyguard.  

           Keating  now  approaches  Ray,  suspicious.

                                 KEATING
                        Nice  job,  Ray.   Really  nice.
                        So  what  now?

                                 RAY
                        Now  I  leave  here  and  we  never  see 
                        each  other  again.

           Keating  stares  at  Ray  a  beat,  studying  him.

                                 KEATING
                        See  Ray,  I  wish  I  could  believe  you.   

                                 RAY
                        I  don’t  understand.

                                 KEATING
                        What  are  you  planning  for  me?
                          (off  Ray’s  look)
                        Don’t  look  at  me  like  I’m  fucking 
                        crazy.   We  both  know  I  ratted  you 
                        out.   I’m  sure  you’ve  been  thinking 
                        about  my  retribution  for  the  last 
                        four  years.   But  I  had  no  choice,  I 
                        was  looking  at  ten  years  on  that  drug 
                        charge.   So  you  see  Ray  I  can’t  let 
                        you  leave  here  until  you  tell  me  what 
                        you  have  up  your  sleeve.

                                 RAY
                        We  just  made  millions  and  you  think 
                        I’m  gonna  stick  around  here  to  settle 
                        an  old  score  with  you.

           Ray  starts  for  the  door  again,  but  Finn  and  Collin  grab  him. 

                                 RAY
                        Tommy,  you  don’t  wanna  do  this.

                                 KEATING
                        You’re  right,  I  don’t.   So  tell  me.

                                 RAY
                        There’s  nothing  going  on.

           Keating  nods  to  Finn.   Finn  breaks  one  of  Ray’s  fingers 
           behind  his  back.   Ray  grimaces  in  pain.
           CONTINUED: (3)

                                 KEATING
                        C’mon  Ray,  y’know  I’ll  break  ‘em  all.  
                        Just  tell  me  and  I’ll  let  you  go.

           Sweat  has  broken  out  on  Ray’s  forehead.   He  looks  at  Keating. 

                                 RAY
                        I’m  telling  you  the  truth  Tommy.

                                 KEATING
                        Maybe  you  are,  but  I  still  don’t 
                        believe  you.

           Finn  and  Collin  hold  Ray  tight.   Keating  jabs  Ray  twice  in 
           the  face.   Ray’s  head  snaps  back  and  his  nose  trickles  blood.  
           But  Ray  still  keeps  silent.  

           Keating  is  furious.   He  throws  another  combination  and  Ray’s 
           stitched  eyebrow  is  re-opened.  

           Ray  falls  to  his  knees  and  he  hears  a  hammer  COCK  BACK,  then 
           a  GUN  is  pressed  against  the  back  of  his  head.

                                 KEATING
                        FUCKING  TELL  ME  RAY  OR  I  SWEAR  I  WILL 
                        SHOOT  YOU  RIGHT  HERE!

           Ray  wipes  the  blood  off  his  nose,  when...  a  RED  DOT  suddenly 
           appears  on  his  hand  (out  of  view  of  Keating  and  the  others).

           Ray  looks  up  at  the  big  picture  window,  AND  HE  SLIGHTLY 
           SHAKES  HIS  HEAD.

           PULL  BACK  to  reveal  we’re  watching  him  through  a  rifle  scope 
           from  the...

           EXT.  KEATING’S  PENTHOUSE  -  ROOFTOP  ACROSS  STREET  -  NIGHT

           ...where  Carl  is  there  as  back  up  with  a  TELESCOPIC  RIFLE  on 
           a  tripod  stand,  itching  to  kill  this  son-of-a-bitch.

           But  he  sees  Ray  signal  for  him  NOT  to  shoot  and  he 
           reluctantly  loosens  his  finger  on  the  trigger.

           INT.  KEATING’S  PENTHOUSE  -  NIGHT

           The  Red  Dot  disappears  from  Ray’s  hand.   Ray  struggles  to 
           stand  and  face  Keating.   The  gun  is  right  in  his  bloody  face.  
           Keating  is  enraged  and  desperate.

                                 RAY
                        I  just  wanna  see  my  kid  again  Tommy.

           Keating  stares  at  Ray  a  long  beat.   He  doesn’t  know  what  else 
           to  do.   Even  if  he  shoots  him  it  won’t  solve  anything.   A 
           beat  passes...  then  Keating  finally  lowers  his  gun.
           CONTINUED:

                                 KEATING
                        Get  him  out  of  here.

           Finn  and  Collin  grab  Ray.   He  shoves  them  off.   He  fixes  his 
           clothes  and  walks  out  the  door.

           INT.  MUSEUM  OF  FINE  ARTS  -  IMPRESSIONIST  SECTION  -  NIGHT

           Paisley  studies  the  crime  scene  around  the  Monet.  

           Forensic  Specialists  dust  the  area  where  the  Monet  is 
           missing.   No  one’s  paying  any  attention  to  the  forged  Renoir.

           Dougherty  hurries  over  to  Paisley.

           Paisley  follows  Dougherty  into  the  Guard’s  Office...

           INT.  KEATING’S  PENTHOUSE  -  DAWN 

           Keating  has  a  bag  of  ice  on  his  swollen  knuckles  from  the 
           beating  he  gave  Ray  and  is  sipping  from  a  glass  of  whiskey.  
           Finn  and  Collin  are  there.

                                 KEATING
                        That  fucker  has  one  hard  head.

           He  takes  another  sip  of  whiskey,  just  as...  THE  FRONT  DOOR  IS 
           SUDDENLY  KICKED  IN!

           Detectives  Paisley  and  Dougherty  storm  in  with  OFFICERS.   She 
           flashes  a  Search  Warrant  as  the  Officers  surround  Keating.

                        For  what?

           The  Officers  fan  out,  scouring  every  inch  of  the  Penthouse.

                        What  the  hell  are  you  looking  for?

           The  Officers  rip  the  place  apart,  tossing  things  on  the 
           floor,  making  a  mess. 

                                 KEATING

           Everyone  turns  to  see  Dougherty  pull  the  stolen  Monet 
           painting  out  of  the  book  shelf.

           Paisley  handcuffs  Keating.   The  other  Officers  cuff  Finn  and 
           Collin  also.

                                 KEATING

                        Yeah,  then  who’s  this  asshole?

           Paisley  holds  up  an  ENLARGED  SECURITY  PHOTO  from  the  Museum 
           hallway...

           CU:  SECURITY  PHOTO  --  It’s  a  color  image  of  Tommy  Keating’s 
           face,  with  his  ski  mask  pulled  up,  holding  the  stolen  Monet 
           painting  in  the  museum  hallway.

           Keating  stares  at  his  image,  dumbfounded.

           Keating’s  knees  go  weak.   No  denying  it  is  him.   But  how?  
           Paisley  turns  to  the  officers.

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Get  them  out  of  here.

           Off  Keating’s  panicked  look,  as  he  stares  at  the  photo...

           ...and  we  PUSH  IN  on  the  photo,  of  Keating’s  face  under  the 
           ski  mask...  clear  as  day...  and  then...

                                                     MATCH  CUT  TO:
           EXT.  JUNKYARD  -  WATERFRONT  -  MORNING

           The  clear  plastic  mask...

           Which  Ray  painted  to  exactly  resemble  Tommy  Keating’s  face.  

           And  that’s  what  Ray  was  wearing  for  the  security  camera  under 
           the  ski  mask...

           Ray  holds  up  the  mask.   Joseph,  Will  and  Carl  toss  their 
           black  clothes  into  a  steel  barrel  with  a  fire  going  inside.  

                                 RAY
                        So  long  Tommy... 

           Ray  tosses  the  mask  into  the  fire  and  they  all  watch 
           Keating’s  face  burn.  

           EXT./INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  DAY

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  knock  on  Ray’s  door.  

                                 DET.  PAISLEY
                        Ray,  open  up,  we  just  want  to  talk.  

           No  answer.   Paisley  looks  in  the  window,  the  place  is  empty.

           INT.  CUTTER  HOME  -  DAY
        A202
                                                                   A202

           Paisley  and  Dougherty  force  the  front  door  in.   Ray  and  his 
           family  are  gone.

           Paisley  wanders  into  the  kitchen  and  there’s  an  ENVELOPE  with 
           her  name  on  it  propped  up  on  the  table.  

           She  opens  the  envelope  and  inside  are  two  tickets  to  “The 
           Lion  King”.  

           Off  Paisley’s  smile...

           EXT.  TRICIA’S  HOUSE  (WILL’S  EX-GIRLFRIEND)  -  DAY

           Ray  sits  outside  in  a  rental  with  Joseph.   His  broken  finger 
           is  in  a  splint,  and  their  suitcases  are  in  the  back  seat.

                                 JOSEPH
                        It’s  been  over  an  hour.   What’s 
                        taking  him  so  long?   When  I  was  his 
                        age...  two  minutes  tops.

                                 RAY
                        That’s  not  something  to  be  proud  of.

           Ray  adjusts  his  seat,  looks  out  the  window,  then  at  Joseph. 
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        Look,  Pop...  I  want  to  thank  you  for 
                        takin’  care  of  Will  when  I  was  away.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Forget  it. 

                                 RAY
                        No,  I  mean  it.   You  really  came 
                        through.   That’s  my  biggest  regret, 
                        not  being  there  for  him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I  know.

           The  front  door  opens  and  Will  appears  with  Tricia.   She’s 
           crying  and  kissing  Will,  not  wanting  to  let  him  go.   She 
           obviously  knows  he’s  sick.

           Will  gives  her  a  good-bye  hug.   Then  he  heads  for  the  car.

           EXT.  TRICIA’S  HOUSE  -  RENTAL  CAR  -  DAY

           Will  slides  into  the  back  seat,  still  waving  at  Tricia.      
           He  has  a  smile  on  his  face  from  ear  to  ear.  

           Ray  starts  the  car  and  drives  off.   Tricia’s  still  waving 
           from  her  porch.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Well?   How’d  it  go?

                                 RAY
                        Pop,  that’s  none  of  our  business.

           Ray  glances  into  the  rear-view  mirror  at  Will  questioningly.  

           Will  grins  back  at  him,  giving  Ray  his  answer. 

           INT.  LOGAN  AIRPORT  -  DEPARTURE  GATE  -  EVENING

           Ray,  Will,  and  Joseph  step  up  to  the  TICKET  AGENT,  a  stern 
           woman  in  her  50’s.   Ray  hands  her  the  FAKE  PASSPORTS.

           Will  hides  his  nervousness  as  she  examines  them.   Ray  catches 
           Will  biting  his  lip  and  he  puts  his  arm  around  his  son.

           A  long,  tense  beat...  then  the  Ticket  Agent  hands  Ray  back 
           the  passports  and  waves  them  through.

                                 TICKET  AGENT
                        Have  a  nice  flight.

           A  smile  forms  on  Will’s  face  as  they  step  into  the  jetway.  
           Ray  leans  down  and  whispers  in  his  ear...
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        You  did  it.

           Will  puts  his  arm  around  his  dad  as  they  step  onto  the  plane.

           INT.  SHAMROCK’S  RESTAURANT  -  NIGHT

           A  Delivery  Man  has  Carl  sign  for  a  PACKAGE.   Carl  tears  it 
           open  and  inside  is  CASH.   Bricks  of  newly  printed  $100’s.  

                                                     DISSOLVE  TO:

           EXT.  TROPICAL  BEACH  -  DAY

           Waves  crashing  on  pink  sand!

           Ray  and  Will  lie  on  hammocks  in  the  shade  sipping  Mai-Tai’s 
           with  not  a  care  in  the  world.   Joseph’s  having  a  blast 
           splashing  around  in  the  blue  water  with  a  beer  in  his  hand.

                                 RAY
                        I  don’t  think  I’ve  ever  seen  him  this 
                        happy  before.

           Will  laughs  at  his  grandfather,  who  gets  knocked  off  his  feet 
           by  a  monster  wave.   He  turns  to  his  Dad.

                                 WILL
                        If  you  had  one  wish  what  would  it  be?

           A  beat,  then...

                                 RAY
                        I  wish  I  could  trade  places  with  you.

           Will  smiles,  he’s  touched  by  the  gesture.

                                 WILL
                        Dad,  I  wouldn’t  change  a  thing.   I 
                        met  my  mom,  pulled  a  job  with  you  and 
                        grandpa  and  slept  with  the  only  woman 
                        I  ever  loved...  I  feel  like  I  walked 
                        on  the  moon.  

           Ray,  choked  up,  shares  a  smile  with  his  son.   He  then  looks 
           away  before  losing  it.  

           They  sit  there  in  silence  a  long  beat... 

           ...until  Joseph  suddenly  yells  up  to  them  from  the  water.

                                 JOSEPH
                        C’mon  in  you  two  pansies,  the  water’s 
                        not  that  cold!
           CONTINUED:

                                 RAY
                        We’re  fine  right  here.

           Ray  takes  a  sip  of  his  drink.

                                 RAY
                        You  believe  him?   So  where  do  you 
                        want  to  go  next?   How  ‘bout  Fiji?   Or 
                        maybe  Greece?

           There’s  no  response  from  Will.

                                 RAY
                        That  a  no?

           Ray  turns  to  see  Will  sleeping  in  the  hammock.   Ray  stares  at 
           him,  he’s  not  moving.  

           Joseph  runs  up  from  the  water.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m  gonna  make  a  beer  run.   You  want 
                        to  go  with  me  Will?

           Joseph  walks  over  and  tries  to  shake  Will  awake.

                                 RAY
                        Pop.   Don’t. 

           From  Ray’s  tone  Joseph  stops.   He  just  stands  there,  staring 
           at  Will,  not  sure  what  to  do.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’ll  go  get  someone.

                                 RAY
                        Wait.   Just  sit  here  a  minute  Pop.

           A  beat,  then  Joseph  pulls  up  a  beach  chair  and  sits  between 
           Ray and Will.            

           HOLD  ON  the  three  of  them  a  moment...  as  the  crashing  waves 
           fill  in  their  silence,  and  then  we...

                                                        FADE  OUT:
