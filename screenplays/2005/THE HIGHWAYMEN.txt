           We hear the sound of an approaching V-8 ENGINE, then TILT 
           DOWN from a cloudy sky to a 1934 FORD... speeding past us. 

           EXT. A DUSTY ROAD -- DAYBREAK

           As the hot-waxed Ford roars along a fallen fence, past the 
           forlorn shacks and migrant work camps, POOR FACES watching 
           the sedan gun by, tailing dust. 

           TITLE CARD:

                                 TEXAS -- 1934

           EXT. EASTHAM PRISON FARM -- DAY

           As the ‘34 Ford cruises past the SIGN announcing the prison, 
           continues through the canebrakes. It now slows to a crawl. 

           The GLARE off the front windscreen prevents us from seeing 
           more than the silhouette of someone in a FEDORA behind the 
           wheel; a small figure in a beret riding shotgun.

           CUT TO: CHAINED FEET CLANKING ALONG

           In a trot line as PRISONERS emerge from the mist. They 
           stumble along in two squads, escorted by ARMED GUARDS.  
           Beyond them, SIX MOUNTED GUARDS survey from horseback.

           Convict RAY HAMILTON stops his march so his leg irons can be 
           removed for work detail. He stares into the thick creek fog.  

           Now he drifts over into the second squad, moves up beside a 
           big, raw-boned boy with a pitted face and scar down the back 
           of his head -- HENRY METHVIN. 

           Ray and Henry join inmates at the woodpile, start stacking. 
           Ray furtively crouches near a culvert and reaches in. He 
           removes a black tire tube wrapped around something. Opens it 
           to reveal three army issue .45’s.

           INT. ‘34 FORD -- DAY

           As a LEATHER GLOVED PAIR OF HANDS load a Browning Automatic 
           Machine gun, slam a modified clip in.

                                 CLYDE (O.S.)
                        Ready, Sugar?

           Beside him, TINY HANDS IN WHITE GLOVES set aside a copy of 
           “True Detective” to reveal her own machine gun...  
                                     jlh   5/28/08                      2.

           EXT. EASTHAM PRISON FARM 

           A mounted High Rider keeps vigil. GUARD CROWSON,24 years old 
           the “long-arm”, rifle resting on his shoulder. 

                                 INMATE
                        How are my Reds doing, Joe?

                                 CROWSON
                        St. Louis won again. Dizzy Dean 
                        struck ‘em all out. 

                                 INMATE
                        They in first place, St. Louis?

                                 CROWSON
                        Yeah. Brooklyn moving up.

           As the inmate is shoved along in the trot line, Crowson 
           watches him go.

           EXT. ‘34 FORD -- DAWN

           Driver’s door opens: an expensive dress shoe steps down onto 
           the wet dirt, leaves a small print. He’s a little man.

                                 BONNIE (O.S.)
                        Two Mississippi...

           EXT. EASTHAM PRISON FARM -- DAY

           Guard Crowson hears a disturbance in the trot line.

                                 GUARD BOZEMAN (O.S.)
                        Crowson! Squad One! Bad count!

           Crowson turns his horse to see--

                                 GUARD BOZEMAN
                        Hamilton jumped squad.

           BOZEMAN is a hard-faced foot guard with a shotgun turned on 
           Ray Hamilton and Henry Methvin who are bunched tight with a 
           third convict now, JOE PALMER.

                                 GUARD BOZEMAN
                        Keep your gun on them. Come here 
                        Raymond...
                                     jlh   5/28/08                      3.

                                 CROWSON
                        I’ll escort him back to squad.

                                 GUARD BOZEMAN
                        Try that again, Ray, you get some 
                        chain, Son. And a day in the box. 
                        Hear?

           Ray nods, untucks his white denim, reaches for something in 
           his pants. Joe Palmer does the same, turns and pulls out the 
           Colt .45. He shoves it up into young Crowson’s midsection.

                                 PALMER
                        Drop them rifles! 

           Guard Bozeman swings his shotgun around, but finds Ray with a 
           .45 of his own, sticking into his temple. Bozeman and Crowson 
           both drop their weapons into the mud.

           INT. ‘34 FORD -- SAME

           As the woman’s hands cock the machine gun...

                                 BONNIE (O.S.)
                        Three Mississippi...

           EXT. EASTHAM PRISON FARM -- SAME

           PALMER, itchy and anxious, his .45 pushing into Crowson’s 
           belly, stares up at the young guard in saddle.  

                                 CROWSON
                        Joe, please--

           INT. ‘34 FORD -- SAME

           As the woman puts the gun to the open window...

                                 BONNIE (O.S.)
                        Four--

           EXT. EASTHAM PRISON FARM -- SAME

           BOOM! -- Palmer fires.

           BOOM! Ray fires into Guard Bozeman.  

           DOWN BENEATH THE FERRY ROAD BRIDGE -- NEAR FORD V-8

           The BROWNING MACHINE GUN is hefted upward...

                                 BONNIE (O.S.)
                        Now, Baby...
                                     jlh   5/28/08                      4.

           THE MACHINE GUN EXPLODES IN A VIOLENT FUSILLADE, cuts through 
           the fog, makes the EARS RING.

           EXT. UP IN THE PRISON FIELDS

           Palmer, Hamilton and Henry Methvin are running toward the 
           SOUND OF A CAR HORN in the fog. Someone is leaning on the 
           horn.

           MOUNTED GUARDS with Squad Two start for the scene, rifles 
           aimed, at a gallop. They BEGIN TO FIRE.

           Through the fog, we make out the silhouette of the car down 
           below, a small figure hanging out the window holding a 
           MACHINE GUN... 

           FIRING, cutting into the mounted Guards. A horse lets out a 
           scream as it buckles in the mud. Branches blown from the 
           trees rain down onto the guards.

           EXT. ON THE FERRY ROAD -- MOMENTS LATER

           As the three escapees jump into the car... two climbing in 
           back, one sitting in the turtle trunk, his .45 held ready.  

           FROM THE PASSENGER WINDOW

           The white-gloved hands hold a large machine gun, squeezing 
           the trigger as we now--

           CUT TO: FLASH BULBS POPPING 

           On the front steps of THE GOVERNOR’S MANSION as REPORTERS 
           converge on MA FERGUSEN. Wearing a long raincoat, the first 
           woman governor makes her way through them, undaunted. Her 
           hair is curled at one side, but short and man-like.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        Care to comment on the escape, 
                        Governor?

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        Mornin’, boys.

           The Reporters clear a path for the governor, but they crowd 
           her just the same as she walks with purpose toward the grand 
           front doors. 

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Ma, no one’s ever broken out of 
                        your prison. Bonnie and Clyde break 
                        in. Are they that unstoppable?

                                 REPORTER #3
                        They’ve been on the loose for two 
                        years now, Ma-- 

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                              (her famous line)
                        Never say die, boys. Say damn, but 
                        never say die.  Now if you move 
                        aside and let me--

                                 REPORTER #2
                        Some folks are saying that Parker 
                        and Barrow are heroes. Like they 
                        say about Dillinger. They’re 
                        striking back at the banks and big 
                        business, the legal system. Calling 
                        them Robin Hoods. Are they Robin 
                        Hoods, Ma?

           Ma Fergusen stops in her tracks on the top step and spins to 
           gaze down over the throng of reporters and their box cameras.

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        Did Robin Hood ever shoot a gas 
                        station attendant point-blank in 
                        the head for four dollars and a 
                        full tank?

           Cameras pop and flash, Reporters scribble. 

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        We will capture Clyde Barrow and 
                        his paramour. Write that down and 
                        underline it twice.

           A FINAL FLASH and we go to--

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION -- PARLOR -- DAY

           A long table is hemmed by TEN STATE OFFICIALS in plain suits.

           A COPY OF THE AUSTIN AMERICAN is slapped down at the head of 
           the table. Ma Fergusen hands her rain coat to an AIDE as she 
           looks at the assembled faces, pushes the paper across the 
           table.

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        If today was a fish...I’d throw the 
                        sonuvabitch back, hear?
                              (then)
                        How’d it happen, Warden?

           LEE SIMMONS, the 50ish Head of Texas Prisons sits halfway 
           down the long table, files and a coffee in front of him. 
           Simmons looks more like an overworked accountant than the 
           image of a Texas prison warden.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Clyde did a nickel at Eastham, he 
                        knew the system. Planted guns. Ran 
                        it like a military operation. 

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                              (to an Official)

                        --same as we had six months ago

                        You’re right. They did. Wounded 
                        several of my Guards.  Killed one 
                        of ‘em, Joe Crowson, was 24.  He 
                        died in my arms apologizing for 
                        letting me down. 
                              (after a beat)
                        I’d like a say in how we take care 
                        of this.  I think I deserve that.

           Silence in the room.  Ma considers, then...

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        Fine, Lee.  Let’s hear it.

           The pressure now rolls down the table toward Lee Simmons. He 
           sits in the silence, feeling the eyes on him. Mostly the 
           young men of Ma’s administration.

                        This is Texas.  Was a time when 
                        we’d put a pair of mankillers on 
                        the trail and let them do their 
                        job.

                        Was a time and that time’s passed.

                        This is 1934, Lee. Gangsters. V-8

           A pause, the silence broken by --

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        Well, sure. And why don’t we just  
                        go dig up Wyatt Earp, too? 

           Laughter rounds the table as Lee reddens.

                        Governor?

           Now Ma’s pissed. She walks around the table toward Lee as 
           she talks...

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        Damn right I am!  They took orders 
                        from no one and left me to answer 
                        for the blood!
                                     jlh   5/28/08                      8.

           Lee holds up the newspaper, shows her the front page.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Seems as though you’re answerin’
                        for it again.

           Checkmate. The room goes silent once again.  The Governor 
           turns, looks out the window...

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        Well,... where is he?

           EXT. COLORADO RIVER - DAY  

           From behind we see A MAN squatting by the edge of the river.  
           Completely still.  He throws a pebble in the water, watches 
           the ripples.  And again.  Probably in the middle of nowhere.  
           A hundred miles from anything.

           REVERSE

           As The Man stares at the water, lost in the simplicity of it.  
           He tosses another pebble.  Then SOUNDS creep in and he lifts 
           the brim of his hat.  We see his face, his eyes as they fix 
           on --

           HIS POV

           Across the river - the bustling downtown of Austin.

           THE MAN

           Takes it in without emotion.  More sounds - HONKING.  He 
           looks to his left to see --

           CONGRESS AVE. BRIDGE

           Packed with 1934 rush hour traffic - not bad by today’s 
           standards but --

           THE MAN

           -- by his eyes we can tell, an anathema to him.  And then his 
           eyes close for a moment of solitude.  His name’s FRANK HAMER.

           EXT. 1007 RIVERSIDE DRIVE -- AUSTIN -- DAY

           Quiet. A nice home off a dirt road, old truck in the drive. A 
           nice neighborhood.  

           A long ‘34 Pontiac pulls in. LUTHER, a black prison Trusty is 
           at the wheel.  He turns off the engine, looks at the house.
                                     jlh   5/28/08                      9.

                                 LUTHER
                        This sure don’t look like no famous 
                        gunfighter’s house.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Most gunfighters end up living in a 
                        pine box.  

           Luther steps out and opens the back door for Lee Simmons.  As 
           they walk across the lawn.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Hamer married well and has done 
                        just fine in private security for 
                        the oil companies.

                                 LUTHER
                        Doesn’t sound like he needs the 
                        job, sir.

                                 SIMMONS
                        No, Luther, I suppose he doesn’t.

           Simmons knocks on the door. Gets no answer.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        Maybe he’s around back--

           Something attacks from the side of the house. It charges, 
           grunting and slobbering. It’s a Javelina. An enormous one.  

                                 LUTHER
                        What in the good holy hell?!

           Luther jumps to the far end of the porch.  Simmons shields 
           himself with the screen door. We hear a WHISTLE and the pig 
           stops. Simmons and his driver turn to where...

           Frank stands. He takes in the two men cowering. 

                                 SIMMONS
                        Hello, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Lee.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        Been a long time.

           Frank pats his leg and the pig falls in beside him.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      10.

                                 SIMMONS
                        One heck of a watch dog you have 
                        there, Cap.

           Frank looks down at the pig a moment.  

                                 FRANK
                        A gift. Widow in Alpine.  Too tough 
                        to eat and he wouldn’t run off.  
                        Gladys hates him, but he’s my 
                        friend, not hers.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Speaking of... how’s Gault?

                                 FRANK
                        Speaking of what?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Friends.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t know.  No idea where he is.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Lubbock.  Manny’s in Lubbock.

           Frank takes this in.  After a beat...

                                 FRANK
                        What brings you, Lee?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Just came from a meeting. Over at 
                        the Governor’s mansion.
                              (off Frank’s look)
                        You may’ve heard, we had a jail 
                        break in Huntsville.

                                 FRANK
                        Ma Fergusen pardons a hundred 
                        convicts a month. They could’ve 
                        just signed her a check, saved 
                        themselves a lot of trouble.

                                 SIMMONS
                        It was the Barrow Gang done it. 
                        Bonnie and Clyde.

           Lee waits for a reaction to this notorious name, but Frank 
           just stares.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      11.

                                 SIMMONS
                        No one can get the net over him. 
                        Not even Hoover. Near a thousand 
                        men in the field right now.

                                 FRANK
                        He must be good.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Good enough to get the drop on 
                        seven peace officers so far. 

           Frank looks over at Lee now.  

                                 FRANK
                        What can I do for you?

                                 SIMMONS
                        I need you to take them off the 
                        road, Frank.   

           Frank looks at him. He can’t be serious. He smiles, walks to 
           the porch.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t mention that idea inside the 
                        Governor’s mansion.  Not unless you 
                        like to be laughed at.

                                 SIMMONS
                        I did.  And they did.  But she’ll 
                        back me on this one.  

                                 FRANK
                        She gonna bring back the Rangers?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Never.

                                 FRANK
                        In what capacity then?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Highway patrol.

                                 FRANK
                              (chuckles)
                        Highwayman?  What’s that pay these 
                        days, hundred fifty a month?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Hundred and thirty.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Don’t matter what badge you carry, 
                        Frank. I just need you to put ‘em 
                        out of business.  
                              (off Frank’s look)
                        I thought maybe you and Manny...

           Frank changes the subject:

                                 FRANK
                        He’s killed seven law? You know 
                        you’re gonna have to put this man 
                        down.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        The governor has given you full 
                        authority to do whatever’s 
                        necessary. Her words.

                                 FRANK
                        Words a someone, never killed 
                        anyone themself.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        Frank--

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry, Lee. But I made a 
                        promise.

                                 SIMMONS
                        What promise? To who?

           We hear THE SOUND OF AN ENGINE and Simmons follows Frank’s 
           gaze, looks off as... 

           A waxed, black Ford V-8 pulls into the drive, sounds the DUAL 
           HORNS in fun. GLADYS HAMER, gets out in an ankle-length sun 
           dress, straw hat and sunglasses. 

                                 GLADYS
                        Lee Simmons.  Live in the same town 
                        and never see you.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Hello, Gladys.  

           She gives him a light hug, then pulls out two bags of 
           groceries.  Frank takes them from her, walks into the house.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Feeding an army?

                                 GLADYS
                        Ladies Auxiliary.  Look at my new 
                        Henry Ford, Lee. 85 horses. Ain’t 
                        she fun?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Yes, ma’am. She’s somethin’.  

                                 GLADYS
                        What brings you out?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Just come, say hello.  

           Gladys eyes his nervous tension. Her eyes go to Frank, now 
           back on the porch.

                                 FRANK
                        The lady governor’s offerin’ me a 
                        hundred-thirty a month, Gladys.  

                                 GLADYS
                        To do what?

                                 FRANK
                        Hunt down Bonnie and Clyde. 

           And now all the light in Gladys dissipates.  She turns her 
           look back on Simmons.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        I best get back to my office.

                                 GLADYS
                        I think you best, Lee.

           Lee tips his brim to the lady and leaves. Gladys looks at her 
           husband on the porch. 

                                 FRANK
                        Something you wanna say?

                                 GLADYS
                        I’m gonna repaint the kitchen.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s what’s on your mind, huh?

                                 GLADYS
                        M-hm. Yellow, I think.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      14.

           She kisses him, then heads for the house. Frank watches the 
           warden’s car disappear in a cloud of dust, that ENGINE SOUND 
           returns, that ominous twister drone...

           EXT. TEXAS BACKROADS -- NIGHT 

           A black Ford motors through the night. 

           INT. BARROW CAR -- NIGHT 

           Dark. The glow of lit cigarettes in the front seat. In the 
           backseat, three larger figures in the shadows, a veritable 
           armory crammed around them, boxes of ammo, stolen license 
           plates. Clyde looks back, his face hidden in the dark... 

                                 CLYDE’S VOICE
                        We gonna need another car.

           EXT. CROSSROADS -- NIGHT

           As the Barrow car approaches, turns the lights off. Quiet for 
           a moment. A window goes down. A cigarette is lit. 

           Finally ANOTHER CAR approaches from the side direction. Stops 
           at the crossroads. A PICK-UP. 

           INT. BARROW CAR -- SAME

           As the men in back start to get out.

                                 CLYDE’S VOICE
                        Nope.

           They sit back. Watch the truck drive past. Another moment. 
           HEADLIGHTS from the opposite direction now. It stops at the 
           crossroads.  

                                 CLYDE
                        That a Ford?

           EXT. CROSSROADS -- SAME

           The car starts across the crossroads when suddenly the lights 
           come on in the Barrow Car. It pulls right up to the grille of 
           the other car. 

           Two men in front. Blinded by the glare. Hanging from their 
           rearview mirror is a Little Orphan Annie figure.  

                                 DRIVER
                        Hey, what do you think you’re--
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      15.

           He stops as two large men with machine guns get out of the 
           back of the Barrow car and approach.

                                 DRIVER
                        Dear Lord.

           Then as we hear a GUNSHOT, we HEAR CANNED LAUGHTER and...

           CUT TO: A PHILCO RADIO

           As we hear GEORGE BURNS and GRACIE ALLEN entertaining a 
           forlorn nation on the radio inside. 

                                 PHILCO RADIO
                              (George)

                        House -- good to the last drop.
                              (Gracie, shrill)
                        Say, I think I know how Army can 
                        beat Notre Dame in the big game 
                        this weekend, Dear...

           PULL BACK SLOWLY

           To reveal Gladys “watching” the radio as she knits. The rain 
           is coming down hard. 

                                 PHILCO RADIO

                        Keep them away from their Maxwell 
                        House?
                              (Gracie)
                        No. Draft the entire Notre Dame 
                        team before the game--

           CANNED LAUGHTER. And then the radio cuts out with a high 
           frequency tone: a National Alert signal.

                                 PHILCO RADIO

                        weather....  Frank?... 

           EXT. PORCH -- SAME

           Frank sits in a chair, staring out at the rain.   
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      16.

                        companion Bonnie Parker have killed 
                        two more citizens... 

           Just staring.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Gladys, no longer knitting.  Also staring.  Thinking.

                                 PHILCO RADIO (OVER)
                        ...and, shortly after, a county

           INT. HAMER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lights off.  Gladys sleeps but the space beside her is empty.

           INT. HAMER HOME -- ATTIC -- NIGHT

           Lantern light catches dust as a door opens.  Frank enters, 
           walks to the middle of the room, pushes aside a bucket 
           catching water, sets down the lantern and stares at --

           A trunk near the wall. He studies it for a moment then slowly 
           opens it. It creaks with neglect.

           In the trunk are a few pairs of old boots, some saved ledger 
           books, a folded Mexican poncho. Some PHOTOS of Frank in 
           younger days with ANOTHER RANGER -- MANNY GAULT-- both in 
           suits, holding weapons. He sets the photo aside and lifts 
           out...

           Something wrapped in oily rags. He slowly unwraps the rags, 
           stares at -- 

           A .45 Single-action Colt revolver, C-engraved. 

           INT. HAMER BEDROOM - MORNING

           Gladys awakes, sees the empty space next to her.

           EXT. ROAD -- OUTSIDE OF AUSTIN - DAY  

           An old truck moves down the dirt road and comes to a stop 
           near THREE BOYS mending fence - two Anglo, one Mexican.  They 
           look up and see Frank exit the truck, walk over.

                                 FRANK
                        You boys work for Ol’ Salazar?
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      17.

                                 ANGLO BOY
                        Yessir. Mend fence, cut Johnson 
                        grass.  Seen you before.

                                 FRANK
                        He sent me out here to give you 
                        boys a break.

           Frank nods, opens his trunk, pulls out an old leather saddle 
           bag and tosses it down at the Mexican Boy’s feet. It lands 
           with a hollow rattle and a few beer cans and pop bottles roll 
           out. The Boy just looks at them, confused.

           Frank tucks his coat back behind the revolver, stuck in his 
           waistband. 

           The other boys exchange glances.

                                 FRANK
                        Just for the heck of it, how ‘bout 
                        every one I hit, you get a nickel?

           The Mexican Boy stares at Frank for a moment then smiles, 
           revealing some lost teeth. He opens the saddle bag and 
           gathers an armful of cans and bottles.

           Stepping out a dozen yards into the open range, the Boy gets 
           a grip on one of the bottles in his right hand. He looks at 
           Frank for his cue.

           Frank nods.

           The Boy hurls the bottle skyward. Frank watches it gain 
           altitude against the sun...he counts to himself...then draws 
           with confidence and ease. FIRES.

           Misses.

           The Boy shields his eyes against the light. Frank gestures 
           with his pistol then sticks it back in his waistband. He 
           opens and closes his right hand a few times. Maybe he’s just 
           a little stiff.

           The Boy tosses another. Frank quick-draws. FIRES. Misses.

           The three boys exchange glances, awe fading.

           Frank stops, stands there a moment, shakes his head, 
           muttering:

                                 FRANK
                        ...Goddamn old man... 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      18.

           He turns his back to them, takes a deep breath and turns 
           back...

                                 FRANK
                        Alright then.  

           The Boy tosses another bottle and BLAM! Frank shatters it in 
           the sky. Frank takes off the glasses and looks at them, then 
           stares sadly out across the range land for a moment. 

           He looks at the boys, opens his coat and removes a wallet.  
           He locates three dollar bills and offers one down to each 
           Boy.

           The Boys approach tentatively. They get close but do not take 
           the dollars.

                                 FRANK
                        Take it, Boys. It’s for keeping 
                        your mouths shut.

           They all take their money and smile at each other, pleased.

                                 FRANK
                        You best get back to work. 

           Frank picks up his saddle bag and walks back to the truck.

           The Boys confer in a tight clutch and watch the man go. One 
           of them moves out of the clutch and takes a few steps after 
           Frank.

                                 ANGLO BOY
                        Hey, Mister?

           Frank stops, turns him slightly to look back at the kid.

                                 ANGLO BOY
                        Were you really Frank Hamer?

           INT. HAMER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY  

           Frank stands at the window, staring out at --

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           The Austin Ladies Auxiliary is holding a function - 40 women 
           in colorful dresses sip lemonade and chat on the lawn leading 
           down to the river. Gladys mingles, playing the hostess.  Her 
           eyes find Frank in the window.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      19.

           INSIDE THE KITCHEN

           Gladys enters with an empty pitcher.  She goes to fill it 
           with more lemonade.

                                 FRANK
                        Nice turn out.  Where’s Porky?

                                 GLADYS
                        Locked in the spare bedroom.  Don’t 
                        suppose there’s any chance of you 
                        taking him with you?

           He sees her look, holds it.  She pulls the AUSTIN AMERICAN 
           from the top of the refrigerator, hands it over.

                                 GLADYS
                        Don’t pretend you didn’t hide it 
                        from me.

           INSERT -- NEWSPAPER

           A headline and article about the murders in Joplin. 

           FRANK 

           folds the paper, sets it down.

                                 GLADYS
                        Suppose you’ll wanna take my new 
                        Ford.

           He almost smiles.

                                 GLADYS
                        I could tell you that you’re too 
                        old for this. That it’s not your 
                        affair. Or that you haven’t held a 
                        gun in quite a while, but I know 
                        it’s a waste a time, so I won’t.  

                                 FRANK
                        And I appreciate you... not tellin’ 
                        me any a that.  
                              (after a beat)
                        I’m sorry, Gladys.

                                 GLADYS
                        Don’t be. I knew what you were when 
                        I married you.  

           She kisses him, holds him, then releases, grabs the pitcher 
           of lemonade and heads for the door.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      20.

                                 GLADYS
                        I packed sandwiches.  They’re in 
                        the refrigerator.

           She stops at the door, turns to him.  Serious.

                                 GLADYS
                        Come back.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY  

           Frank leans against Gladys's car.  Simmons' car pulls up and 
           Luther and Simmons get out.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Too good to come to my office?

                                 FRANK
                        All the same I’d rather keep this 
                        low key.

           Simmons nods, hands over a stack of files.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        Files.  Your jurisdiction 
                        technically ends at the state line.  

                                 FRANK
                        Technically.

                                 SIMMONS
                        You keep me posted - call from the 
                        road.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll call you when.

           Frank gets in the Ford, sets the files on the seat beside 
           him.  Simmons leans in --

                                 SIMMONS
                        Where to first?  Texarkana? Waco?  
                        Dallas?...

           Frank just smiles and drives away.

           EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY -- DAY

           A FIREBALL OF TEXAS SUN, and emerging from it on the water 
           marks of pavement, a 1934 Ford V-8, waxed and slick. It owns 
           the road.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      21.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- DAY

           Frank at the wheel.  As he drives he glances at a map of 
           Texas.  His finger follows a road and moves west. 

           Frank sets down the map and takes in the view of endless 
           Texas highway, telephone lines, stretching on forever. PAST 
           barbed wire fencing, rusted and neglected. 

           PAST A BILLBOARD: FILLER UP! VACATION TIME IS HERE. MOBIL GAS 
           AND OIL AHEAD.

           PAST A WOODEN WATER TANK -- where someone has painted 
           graffiti way up there. It reads: GO BONNIE AND CLYDE.

           FRANK

           Looks up at this hero worship, somewhat incredulous. Perhaps 
           disturbed by it. 

           And then a FAST 30’s CAR passes, startling him.  He spins the 
           wheel and brakes a bit, sending the manhunt files flying. The 
           passing car is full of young women in trimmed turbans, 
           singing and laughing. They speed far ahead of him.

           Frank looks over at the spilled files - crime scene photos 
           spread everywhere - bloody, horrific.

           EXT. ROAD - WIDE - NIGHT

           Frank’s car is off the road.  The interior light is on.  

           INT. FRANK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Frank munches on a sandwich and analyzes the contents of the 
           file Simmons gave him.  Again, we see the disgusting crime 
           scene photos as well as smiling photos of the Officers killed 
           in the line of duty.

           Frank tosses the rest of the sandwich out the window and 
           turns off the light.

           CUT TO: A DARK ROOM -- MORNING

           As B.M. “MANNY” GAULT, hung over and weary, sits up in his 
           makeshift bed in the living room. Out of breath, sweat runs 
           down his face. He sits up on the edge of the bed and 
           accidently kicks a whisky bottle.  It rolls across the floor.

                                 NATE
                        You all right, Pop-pop?

           Manny looks up to see his 7 year old grandson in the doorway.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      22.

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah. 

                                 NATE
                        Mama says you should get up even if 
                        you don’t have a job.  For 
                        breakfast.

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah...

           INT. KITCHEN -- LATER - MORNING

           Manny’s daughter, JEAN GAULT -- twenties, dressed for work, a 
           J.C. PENNY nametag pinned to her blouse -- hurriedly rinses 
           her cup in the sink while Manny and Nate sit at the table 
           eating. A car HORN honks outside.

                                 JEAN
                        I’ve got to take Dan over to see a 
                        man about some work before I go 
                        myself.  Will you make sure Nate 
                        gets off to school on time?

           Manny nods, chews on a piece of bacon.

                                 MANNY
                        They’re thinking about adding 
                        another bay down at the garage.  
                        Pete said to call him in a few 
                        weeks.

                                 JEAN
                        We’re okay, Daddy.  Really.  

                                 MANNY
                        I’ll pull my weight, thank you.

           The car HORN honks again.

                                 JEAN
                        Coming Dan!

           Jean grabs her handbag, kisses Nate’s head, races out.  Manny 
           and Nate share a look.  Nate wipes up the last of his egg 
           with a piece of toast.  Manny’s plate is pretty much 
           untouched.  He slides it across the table to the boy.

           EXT. GAULT HOMESTEAD --  LATER - DAY

           Pretty desperate - nothing green unless you count weeds 
           growing around the hand-painted “FOR SALE” sign out front.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      23.

           Manny and Nate, carrying a sack lunch and a book or two, walk 
           down to the road.

                                 NATE
                        You fix cars, so you could fix 
                        Daddy’s?

                                 MANNY
                        Could if he’d let me near it.

                                 NATE
                        But you used to be famous, right?

                                 MANNY
                        Where’d you hear that?

                                 NATE
                        Timmy Hess.  He said you shot lots 
                        of folks.

                                 MANNY
                        And what else did Timmy have to 
                        say?

                                 NATE
                        Nuthin. Just that you might go to 
                        hell for it. 

           They’re at the road.  Nate waits for an answer.  Manny waves 
           one arm at him to “get going”.  

           EXT. DOWN THE ROAD - SAME

           From a distance behind we observe Manny standing, watching 
           Nate walk away. 

           WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL

           Frank, sitting in the Ford, eyeing the proceedings.  He 
           sighs, starts the car, U-turns and drives away.

           INT. GUN SHOP -- DAY

           The bell over the door sounds as Frank walks in. The OWNER, 
           in the middle of some paperwork, has his back to him...

                                 OWNER
                        Afternoon. Can I...

           He turns around as Frank moves to the counter, pulls a folded 
           up magazine page from his pocket
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      24.

                                 OWNER
                        ...help you?

           He stares at Frank. Something intimidating... until Frank 
           studies an article from a gun magazine. He then starts 
           pointing at various weaponry... 

                                 FRANK
                        I’d like to have a look at that 
                        Thompson sub-machine gun and the 
                        Colt Monitor machine rifle, one up 
                        top there with the custom grip. The 
                        .32 automatic and the 1917 Smith 
                        over there. The BAR thirty ought 
                        six and that ought 3 Springfield 
                        with the glass... two a those 
                        Winchester 12-gauge pumps and one a 
                        them sawed-off riot guns, the 
                        twenty inch, not the eighteen.  

           The owner lays the guns out on the counter in front of him.  

                                 OWNER
                        Would you be wantin’ the stick or 
                        the drum with the Tommy?

                                 FRANK
                        How many in the stick?

                                 OWNER
                        30 rounds.  

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll take a dozen, and a handful a 
                        them half-moon clips for the Smith.

           Frank hefts the .32, cocks it... 

                                 FRANK
                        Have you got this one in black 
                        stead a nickel? Too damn shiny...

                                 OWNER
                        I believe I do, sir. 

                                 FRANK
                        Then that’ll do it.  

           The Owner looks at him.  

                                 OWNER
                        Which... will do it?
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      25.

                                 FRANK
                        All of ‘em?

                                 OWNER
                        All of ‘em...?

                                 FRANK
                        Yes, sir, along with four cases of 
                        .45 lead and, say, an even hundred 
                        each a the others.

                                 OWNER
                        What all are you goin’ after that 
                        you need so much firepower? If you 
                        don’t mind my askin’...

                                 FRANK
                        No, sir, I don’t mind at all.  

           But he still doesn’t answer. The man stares at Frank as he 
           now takes out his wallet...

           EXT. GUN SHOP -- DAY

           As Frank walks out of the shop, both hands full with the 
           firearms (all now in cases). He crosses the street, and 
           pauses a moment, then continues to...

           ...his car where we see Manny sitting on the running board of 
           the Ford. Frank hesitates, says nothing, opens the trunk of 
           the Ford, sets the weaponry inside. Then shuts it.  

                                 FRANK
                        You spotted me? 

                                 MANNY
                        Between the suit and the car I 
                        thought you were the bank till I 
                        saw how poorly you drove.  

           Frank looks at Manny for the first time in years.

                                 MANNY
                        This about that jack-ass and his 
                        girlfriend?
                              (after a beat)
                        It as bad as the headlines?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah.

           Manny takes this in, nods.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      26.

                                 MANNY
                        So what was it changed your mind, 
                        Pancho?  When you came to the 
                        house?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know, maybe it was seein’ 
                        you move like you’re eighty-five.

                                 MANNY
                        Well, that’s honest. You could’ve 
                        at least asked me, let me decide 
                        for myself. That woulda been the 
                        polite thing to do.

                                 FRANK
                        Like you said, I changed my mind.  
                        Besides what would your daughter 
                        say if you ran off?

                                 MANNY
                        That a weight’s been lifted. 

           Not the answer Frank wanted.

                                 FRANK
                        You know the way it goes... I gotta 
                        live the way they do, Gault. This 
                        case, that means sleepin’ in the 
                        car, drivin’ a thousand miles a 
                        day.

                                 MANNY
                        I don’t sleep much anyway. And when 
                        I do, I most always dream of dead 
                        Mexicans.  

           Manny looks for a reaction to this.  Frank moves on --

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe I’ll go look up Ledbetter--

                                 MANNY
                        He’s dead.  

                                 FRANK
                        Or Cuthbert. 

                                 MANNY
                        He’s dead, too.  So is Alvarez and 
                        if you go any further down the 
                        roster I’m gonna be gravely 
                        offended.  
                                 (MORE)
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      27.

                                 MANNY (cont'd)
                        Dammit, Pancho, I’m above ground 
                        and ready to go.  
                              (after a beat)
                        Unless you think I’m useless.

           The last word hangs in the air.  Frank considers his old 
           partner and friend, then opens the car door.

                                 FRANK
                        Alright... 
                              (opens the car door)
                        but no singin’.

           INT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION -- DAY

           MA FERGUSEN sits back in her chair behind her desk, eyeing 
           JOHN QUINN, one of her new breed lawmen. He wears a canted 
           fedora, suit and tie, spit-shined shoes.

                                 QUINN
                        Hamer and Gault?  The Rangers?  Are 
                        you serious?

           There is some quiet laughter from the phalanx of FIVE 
           FERGUSEN MEN standing behind Quinn, all dressed like him. 
           Quinn turns around and faces them.

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        Dead. Serious.

           The room goes quiet.  

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        I only agreed to it to show we’re 
                        doing all we can.  I raised taxes 
                        to build my new law enforcement 
                        program, Mr. Quinn. The last thing 
                        this administration needs is for 
                        these two to make that program 
                        appear anything less than stellar 
                        during this economic crisis. You 
                        with me?

                                 QUINN
                        We’ll get your gangsters, Ma.

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        You don’t, John, you’ll be on guard 
                        duty at Eastham Prison Farm because 
                        I won’t be able to afford you. Get 
                        Barrow off the damned road. Now.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- DAY

           Manny rides shotgun, singing:

                                 MANNY
                        Gather round kids and listen to my 
                        tale, here’s the story of the Old 
                        Chisholm Trail...

           Frank shakes his head. Manny’s got a voice that would run off 
           stray dogs. Manny, while looking through the file, has a map 
           of the U.S. in his lap and a pencil in his hand.  Frank holds 
           a sheet from the file, reading as he drives...

                                 FRANK
                        Mount Ayr, Iowa... 

                                 MANNY
                        If you ever want me to drive...

                                 FRANK
                        I drive.

                                 MANNY
                        Just saying.

           Manny places dots and draws lines on --

           THE MAP - has three ovals drawn on it.  One marked as 1932 
           spreads as far as Dallas to Minnesota, The second marked 1933 
           from Dallas to Fort Dodge.  Manny is working on the third 
           circle - like a kid’s “connect the dots” puzzle.

                                 MANNY
                        You think they’re the ones who 
                        robbed the National Armory up 
                        there?

                                 FRANK
                        Day before, they stole a car in 
                        Illinois. Shot their way out of a 
                        roadblock.  They’ve been following 
                        the same loops now for three years - 
                        north to Kansas or Iowa, east to 
                        Illinois or Indiana, south to 
                        Arkansas, back to Texas and start 
                        over again.

                                 MANNY
                        Well, we got no jurisdiction north 
                        of the Red River.  Maybe Hoover’ll 
                        take ‘em up there.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      29.

           Frank ignores the comment and ...

                                 FRANK
                        Carthage, Missouri... 

           Manny marks it down, eyes a PHOTO OF BONNIE.  It weighs on 
           him...

           Frank looks at Manny, sees that he’s troubled. Manny just 
           shifts in his seat, looks out the window...

                                 MANNY
                        You know, I don’t remember a saddle 
                        being as hard on a man’s ass as 
                        these car seats are.
                              (after a beat)
                        I ain’t never shot a girl, Pancho.

                                 FRANK
                        If we can take Clyde long range 
                        she’ll surrender.  

                                 MANNY
                        We’re gonna shoot a man without 
                        fair warning?

                                 FRANK
                        Lord knows he does.

                                 MANNY
                        Lord knows that’s what separates us 
                        from him.

           Frank gives Manny a firm look - obviously a sore subject - a 
           hinge point in their relationship, then --

                                 FRANK
                        Clarksdale, Mississippi...

           Manny marks it down, connects the dots.  Frank lowers the 
           sheet.  Manny eyes him...

                                 MANNY
                        Where next?...

                                 FRANK
                        Home.

           EXT. WEST DALLAS -- SUPER: WEST DALLAS - DAY

           Different shots of the West Dallas slum. Moving through it.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      30.

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        West Dallas viaduct. 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- DAY

           Manny looks out the window at the half-rural slum of tent 
           camps, shotgun shacks, junked cars and feral dogs. 

                                 FRANK (V.O.)
                        The Devil’s Porch...

           SLOW MOVING POV: THE WEST DALLAS SLUMS

           Past POOR CHILDREN mingling in the streets, playing 
           stickball. A FEW MOTHERS on porches look right at the 
           stranger’s car as it rolls through the tight-knit hood. The 
           looks are not warm. Any unrecognized car is suspicious.

                                 MANNY
                        And I thought my circumstances were 
                        bad.

           AS FRANK DRIVES SLOWLY, he examines some paperwork on his 
           steering wheel, checks some addresses, matches them. We see 
           the name PARKER and an address at the top of a profile sheet.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s her ma’s house. He grew up 
                        not too far... 

           POV: THE PARKER HOUSE

           A low rent home painted green. Sweeping the porch is a woman 
           in her 60’s. This is EMMA PARKER, Bonnie’s mother. She looks 
           up at the passing car, looks right at Frank Hamer.

           FRANK meets her gaze as he TURNS A CORNER AT SOME BUSHES

           And then it happens:

           TWO FIGURES explode from the bushes aiming rifles.

           Frank slams on the brakes and he and Manny instinctively 
           reach for their guns as --

           Two Children. With sticks like Tommy guns. They yell out “rat-
           a-tat-tat” sounds as they pretend to ambush the vehicle.

           Frank and Manny both quickly recover, share a look.

                                 FRANK
                        Lord--
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      31.

                                 MANNY
                        --Jesus. I almost pulled on them 
                        kids. 

                                 FRANK
                        Really?  I saw ‘em come out--

                                 MANNY
                        Well... I did, too. I just... They 
                        just gave me a spook is all.

           Frank has broken a sweat. Manny looks out the rear window at 
           children in the streets playing Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, 
           the Barrow Gang. Their heroes. 

           EXT. SIDE STREET -- WEST DALLAS -- LATE DAY

           Hamer’s Ford is parked down a less inhabited street, but with 
           a view of the houses through some fallen fence. 

           INT. HAMER’S FORD -- DAY

           Frank and Manny watch the comings and goings on a certain 
           block of ramshackle homes. Each time it gets quiet, Frank 
           returns to his study of materials.

                                 FRANK
                        Says here the two families talked 
                        on the telephone once a day until 
                        about a week ago.

                                 MANNY
                        How the hell they know that?

                                 FRANK
                        Federal wire taps.
                              (off Manny’s blank)
                        G-Men can hook up to the party 
                        lines and record conversation.

                                 MANNY
                        Well I’ll be goddamned.

           Frank goes back to the file but A MOTOR GROWL draws Manny’s 
           gaze to-- 

           A waxed, black Pontiac is coming down the road. Too fancy a 
           car for these parts. The driver appears to be wearing a slick 
           hat.

           Manny observes, intrigued.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      32.

           ON THE STREET, the passenger of the new car tosses something 
           out the window into a vacant lot. The car speeds away.

                                 MANNY
                        Pancho...

           Manny points and they watch as --

           In seconds, a TEEN-AGED KID in knickers and cap walks through 
           the lot, picks up the empty Coca-Cola bottle and starts 
           walking east. There appears to be a note inside the bottle.

                                 MANNY
                        Western Union.

           The kid hustles across the street, tosses the bottle over a 
           fence into the Parker back yard.  The kid keeps moving.

           A few seconds later the bottle flies back over the fence and 
           a SECOND TEEN-AGED KID appears, picks up the bottle and 
           starts down the street.

           Frank and Manny share a look and each exit the Ford.

           EXT. WEST DALLAS SIDE STREETS -- DAY

           The KID is hurrying along with the Cola bottle, whistling, 
           when he senses someone behind him.

           Frank comes into view, following at a casual distance. 

           The Kid barely scouts over his shoulder, sees Frank. Kid 
           turns left...then breaks into a sprint. 

           Frank speeds his steps, pursues.

           DOWN ANOTHER STREET 

           The Kid runs on quick feet with the message in the Cola 
           bottle. Frank comes around the corner, running hard. 
           Determined to catch his prey, he turns on a burst of speed.

           The Kid is headed toward a dead-end wood fence. He doesn’t 
           slow a beat, running and leaping onto the fence and mousing 
           over.

           Frank makes the jump onto the fence, tries to climb...but 
           forget it. Age and old wounds finally bring him back down, 
           breathing hard. Hands on his knees, he sucks wind and marvels 
           over the kid’s speed.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Need a ride, Captain?
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      33.

           Frank looks up to see John Quinn, Ma Fergusen’s detective, 
           standing at the open door of his Hudson. He wears a Chicago 
           Fedora and has the kind of smirk that begs a right-cross. 

           But Frank doesn’t have the wind for that. He gathers his 
           breath and straightens up as Quinn approaches, showing his 
           wallet badge.

           A G-MAN, dressed with as much city flair as Dillinger, gets 
           out of a SECOND CAR and approaches on Quinn’s flank. Behind 
           those men, a mix of G-MEN and FERGUSEN DICKS gather at the 
           vehicles on alert.

                                 QUINN
                        You chasing someone?

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah, Jim Thorpe. Who are you?

                                 QUINN
                        John Quinn, State Detective. This 
                        is Kendale, U.S. Bureau of 
                        Investigation. We heard you were on 
                        special assignment, Sir.

                                 AGENT KENDALE
                        Director Hoover sends his regards. 
                        He also sends a tip by way of his 
                        contacts down south.

           Kendale, a tall young G-Man, hands the old ranger a folded 
           note. And now Manny arrives, just as winded as Frank. They 
           confer privately:

                                 FRANK
                        I thought you had my back? I 
                        would’ve been dead by now.

                                 MANNY
                        You ran one more goddamn block we’d 
                        both be dead.

                                 KENDALE
                        Our information tells us that 
                        Barrow could be hiding down in 
                        Brownsville, along the border.  

                                 QUINN
                        As you know, this is a highly-
                        coordinated operation between five 
                        states and the multi-state 
                        jurisdiction of the Bureau. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      34.

                                 QUINN (cont'd)
                        So we’d like to ask for your help. 
                        Down in Brownsville.  

           The G-man and Dallas detective study Frank’s reaction.

                                 FRANK
                        You ever hunt wild horses, Quinn?

                                 KENDALE
                        Say what?

                                 FRANK
                        They run a big range. But they 
                        always come home. 

           Quinn and Kendale exchange looks.  

                                 KENDALE
                        A thousand man dragnet in full 
                        operation, Sir. Roadblocks, air 
                        surveillance -- don’t think the 
                        Barrow Gang will be coming back to 
                        the neighborhood any time soon.

                                 FRANK
                        Outlaws and mustangs always go 
                        home. 

                                 QUINN
                        Well, maybe you gentlemen should, 
                        too. This isn’t Llano country. 
                              (then)
                        Be a shame either a you got hurt in 
                        retirement. 

                                 MANNY
                        Be a shame anybody got hurt.

           Manny’s eyes are cold. Kendale steps in.

                                 KENDALE
                        What Detective Quinn means is that 
                        the Barrow Gang hit an armory. 
                        They’re armed to kill.

           A RADIO crackles in with a dispatch from one of the federal 
           cars. Agent Kendale goes to the open driver’s door and 
           snatches up his radio. He communicates in a brief exchange.

           Manny has moved in slowly, intrigued.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      35.

                                 KENDALE
                        That’s called a double-band system. 
                        Didn’t have one in your saddlebags, 
                        I imagine.

           Manny studies the radio.

                                 KENDALE
                        It’s essential in a dragnet. If you 
                        don’t have it, you might as well be 
                        in Timbuktu.

                                 MANNY
                        Or down in Brownsville. Following 
                        your bullshit tip.

           Frank walks away, Manny catches up...

                                 MANNY
                        I’ve felt more welcome.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe we oughta make some new 
                        friends.

           INT. DALLAS SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT -- DAY

           Frank and Manny sit at an empty desk, waiting.  Two young 
           Officers, HINTON and ALCORN eye them.  Hinton leans on a soda 
           machine, working a toothpick.  

           SMOOT SCHMID, Dallas Sheriff, enters and offers a hand.

                                 SMOOT
                        Smoot Schmid, gentlemen.  No need 
                        to introduce yourselves but I’d be 
                        honored to shake your hands anyway.

           They shake.

                                 SMOOT
                        That’s Deputy Bob Alcorn there, and 
                        Deputy Ted Hinton holding up the 
                        Coca-Cola machine. 

           Nods between the men.

                                 SMOOT
                              (Smoot sits)
                        Damn.  Hamer and Gault.  You know 
                        how many times I’ve told my 
                        grandson the Candelaria story.

                                 SMOOT (cont'd)
                        All he wants to hear before he goes 
                        to bed.  Every night.

                                 MANNY
                              (wants to know)
                        How’s he sleep?

           Frank cuts to the quick.

                                 FRANK
                        Sheriff, we’re involved in the 
                        manhunt... in a very private way.

                                 SMOOT
                        Not that private.  Word gets 
                        around.   

                                 FRANK
                        Yes it does.  We heard that Barrow 
                        put a price on your head.

                                 SMOOT
                        And I keep my door unlocked in case 
                        the sonuvabitch ever wants to stop 
                        by.

                                 FRANK
                        We’re gonna take him down. But we 
                        need your help.

                                 SMOOT
                        I’d be honored.

                                 MANNY
                        We’re looking for a confidence in 
                        the neighborhood. Someone who knows 
                        Barrow and is willing to talk.

           Smoot nods, stares poker-faced at Manny. 

                                 SMOOT
                        How about a boy who grew up with 
                        them, worked at the United Glass 
                        Company with Clyde? Known Bonnie 
                        since she was a girl? Boy who can 
                        make positive identification on 
                        them at first sight. He’s got the 
                        mental range of a windshield wiper, 
                        but he’s reliable.

                                 MANNY
                        Where do we find him?
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      37.

                                 SMOOT
                        Holding up the Coca-Cola machine.

           Manny looks over at slick Deputy Hinton leaning on the soda 
           machine, toothpick bobbing in his mouth. He winks in the 
           manner of the smooth cat he believes himself to be.

           INT. DALLAS POLICE DEPT. - DAY  

           Frank, Manny and Ted Hinton walk and talk through the main 
           corridor toward the front entrance...

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Tough place to grow up. Clyde’s 
                        family are good folk. Henry and 
                        Cumie fine people. Henry owns the 
                        neighborhood gas station and they 
                        live in the back. Clyde was always 
                        mischief. Me and him used to play 
                        cops and robbers.

                                 MANNY
                        And let me guess. You was the cop.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        All I ever wanted to be. That, or 
                        short stop for the Cleveland 
                        Indians.

                                 FRANK
                        And Bonnie? You know Miss Parker?

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        She grew up on the backside of the 
                        Porch. Cement City. No daddy.

                                 FRANK
                        Must be one hard lady.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        To the contrary, Sir. Little bitty 
                        thing, can’t weigh but ninety 
                        pounds. Smartest girl in school.

           Frank digests this. Not what he and Manny hoped to hear. 

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        She was in all the plays. Won the 
                        spelling bees. Wrote poetry. 
                        Attractive girl. Taffy-colored 
                        hair.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      38.

                                 MANNY
                        Sounds like the short stop was 
                        maybe a little sweet on her? 

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Hell, any boy she ever waited on at 
                        the Courthouse Cafe was sweet on 
                        her. 

                                 FRANK
                        How’d she fall in with an outlaw 
                        like Barrow?

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Bored to tears. Along come Clyde in 
                        a fine car. By the time she found 
                        out the car was stolen she was 
                        already in love. 

                                 MANNY
                        Ain’t that romantic. I met my wife 
                        milking a prize Devon at the 
                        Oklahoma State Fair. I don’t 
                        imagine anyone writing a ballad 
                        about that encounter.

           EXT. DALLAS POLICE DEPT. - DAY  

           The walk and talk continues...

                                 FRANK
                        They ran two of your roadblocks.

           The deputy meets Frank’s gaze.   

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        They busted through roadblocks in 
                        Oklahoma, too. Kansas, New Mexico. 

                                 FRANK
                        You had a clear shot at them. 

           Hinton avoids the issue...  

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        They say Clyde is some kind of Fu-
                        Manchu. Can’t be touched. Time 
                        Magazine called him Superhuman, 
                        y’all see that?

                                 MANNY
                        Maybe you weren’t able to pull on 
                        her, Ted.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      39.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Sir?

           They stop at the parked Hamer Ford.

                                 MANNY
                        Pull the trigger on a nice girl who 
                        used to serve you pecan pie. Maybe 
                        you’re not able to do it.  

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        I won’t have to. I’m stationed 
                        right here in West Dallas. Be a 
                        cold day in Hell before they come 
                        back to Bernal Street.

                                 FRANK
                        They’re on their way.
                              (after a beat)
                        According to the wire taps Mrs. 
                        Parker is cooking red beans and 
                        cabbage on Easter Sunday.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Sir, I don’t understand what you 
                        mean.

                                 MANNY
                        You don’t know what wire taps are?

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Of course I know what wire taps 
                        are. I just don’t understand what 
                        red beans and cabbage have to do 
                        with--

                                 FRANK
                        -- whenever Bonnie’s mama says 
                        she’s got red beans and cabbage on 
                        the stove, the dates match to 
                        sightings or shoot-outs in the 
                        general Dallas area. Red beans and 
                        cabbage. That’s code. Means the 
                        kids are coming.

           The deputy stares at Hamer, intrigued.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        So do I just ride with you boys?

                                 FRANK
                        No. We’ll see you on Easter Sunday.  
                        Meet us at dawn on Eagle Ford Road.

                                 FRANK (cont'd)
                        I’ll need you to make the I.D. on
                        Barrow and Parker.

           Ted nods, a bit troubled and walks away.

                                 FRANK
                        They’re afraid to shoot the girl. 
                        That gives Clyde the one second he 
                        needs to get the drop. 
                              (looks at Ted)
                        And he knows it.

           EXT. TRINITY RIVER ROAD --  DAY

           Down a lonesome dirt road, Hamer’s Ford crawls. 

                                 MANNY (V.O.)
                              (reading)
                        ...You’ve heard the story of Jesse 
                        James, and how he lived and died... 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- SLOW DRIVING -- DAY

           Manny reads the Dallas paper, more GLAMOUR SHOTS OF BONNIE.

                                 MANNY
                        but if you’re still in need of 
                        something to read, here’s the story 
                        of Bonnie...and Clyde.
                              (looks up)
                        Used to be you had to have talent 
                        to get published. Now you just have 
                        to shoot people.

           Frank sees something in his side mirror, pulls off the road 
           and into a clearing.

                                 MANNY
                        Why are we stopping?

           EXT. TRINITY RIVER ROAD CLEARING -- DAY

           Frank gets out, Manny follows, a bit confused.

                                 FRANK
                        They were sighted a month or two 
                        ago camping somewhere out here.

           The two men look around.  Manny kicks the rocks around an old 
           campfire.  Frank’s eyes find --

           A NO TRESPASSING SIGN on a barbed wire fence about fifty feet 
           away. There is a perfect bullet hole through the “O” in NO. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      41.

                                 FRANK
                        Somebody’s a damn good eye.

                                 MANNY
                        Or they walked right up to it.

           Frank jumps as Manny draws his gun and fires six quick shots 
           at the sign.  

           When the smoke clears, there is still just one hole in the 
           center.  After a beat...

                                 MANNY
                        How ‘bout that? I put every damn 
                        shot right through the hole.

           Frank looks at Manny a moment, watches him holster his gun.

                                 FRANK
                        When’s the last time you fired that 
                        thing?

                                 MANNY
                        Damn sun’s in my eyes... 

           Frank shakes his head, walks around to the back of the car.

                                 FRANK
                        Our boy Clyde prefers the Browning 
                        Automatic machine rifle, thirty 
                        caliber. Fires a 20-round volley at 
                        3,000 feet per second. He likes to 
                        use a specially welded clip that 
                        fires fifty-three rounds.

                                 MANNY
                              (indicates Frank’s gun)
                        Well, he ain’t met Old Lucky. 

           Frank opens the trunk.

                                 FRANK
                        Shit. I ain’t that lucky.

           Frank produces the Colt Monitor Machine Rifle with special 
           pistol grip stock. Manny draws back an uneasy step. Hamer 
           hefts it to a shoulder, squints an eye and unloads a 20-round 
           EAR-DEAFENING BARRAGE.

           He shreds the sign. Shreds it into perforated metal. Manny 
           nods, then:
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      42.

                                 MANNY
                        You got one a those for me?

           EXT. PARKER HOUSE -- WEST DALLAS -- NIGHT

           POOR KIDS play out in the street even at this hour. EMMA 
           PARKER comes out on the porch with her broom. She goes 
           through the motions of sweeping, but her eyes search the next 
           street over between homes.

           AT THE STAR SERVICE STATION

           OLD MAN BARROW, Clyde’s aging father, is locking up the 
           pumps. He looks across the way and sees Bonnie’s mother on 
           the porch. He turns a light off. Turns it on again. He does 
           this three times.

           AT THE PARKER HOME

           Emma notes this as she pretends to sweep. She looks up and 
           down the street to make sure she’s not being watched. She 
           goes back inside.

           EXT. TRINITY RIVER CAMPSITE -- NIGHT

           Parked off the road. Frank sits on the hood. Manny takes a 
           leak in the trees, singing “The Cowboy’s Lament,” aka 
           “Streets of Laredo.” 

                                 MANNY
                        Oh, beat the drum slowly and play 
                        the fife lowly...play the death 
                        march as you...play the death march 
                        as you--

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t matter if you can’t shoot. 
                        You can always kill ‘em with your 
                        singing. 

           Manny comes over now.  

                                 MANNY
                        I can’t remember the words to 
                        Laredo, you believe that?

           He sits down on the other side of the hood.   

                                 MANNY
                        Brings back memories, don’t it?  
                              (no response)
                                 (MORE)
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      43.

                                 MANNY (cont'd)
                        What does it say about us, that 
                        we’re out here?  You ever think 
                        about that?

                                 FRANK
                        No, but I’m bettin’ you have.

                                 MANNY
                        Is it the nature of man or just our 
                        nature?  Do we do it ‘cause it’s 
                        right or because it’s what we’re 
                        good at?  And if it’s the latter, 
                        well, like I said, what does that 
                        say about us?

                                 FRANK
                        You gonna get all purple on me, I’m 
                        gonna wanna talk about somethin’ 
                        else.

                                 MANNY
                        We’re gonna kill these two kids, 
                        Pancho... just like we killed all 
                        them others.  

                                 FRANK
                        These two ain’t “kids” and the 
                        others all needed killin’.  

                                 MANNY
                        I suppose.

                                 FRANK
                        I could do without your soul 
                        searching, Gault.  I mean, I don’t 
                        exactly remember begging you to 
                        come alone.

                                 MANNY
                        Just saying.

           Manny looks at Frank, let’s it go.

                                 MANNY
                        What’s it like, to marry money?

                                 FRANK
                        You earn every damn nickel.

           They both chuckle at that one, then... 

                                 MANNY
                        You ever gonna let me drive?
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      44.

                                 FRANK
                        Not a chance in hell.  

           EXT. FARMHOUSE -- GRAPEVINE -- MORNING

           As an OLD FARMER carries a bucket of milk from a barn, stops.  
           He hears LAUGHING OS and looks to the road where a NEW FORD 
           is parked a short distance down the road from his house.  

           Someone tosses A WHISKEY BOTTLE from the window. The Old 
           Farmer watches a moment, listens to the laughing coming from 
           inside the car when from up the road now come TWO HIGHWAY 
           PATROLMEN on motorcycles.   

           The officers stop their motorcycles and walk over to the car.  
           Through the early morning, we faintly hear at this distance:

                                 OFFICER’S VOICE
                        You folks stalled?

           Suddenly the Old Farmer jumps, drops the bucket of milk, as 
           two guns stick out of the car windows and blow the officers 
           off their feet.     

           The front door opens and...

           The Old Farmer drops down out of sight onto his belly in the 
           puddle of milk, and crawls to the fence for a better look... 

           HIS POV -- THROUGH THE BUSHES -- FROM A DISTANCE

           We just see a small girl get out of the car carrying a sawed 
           off shotgun. Two others get out on the other side of the car, 
           but we can’t see them.  

           She walks over to one of the dying officers, stands looking 
           down at him, puts the shotgun to his head. 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- TRINITY RIVER CAMPSITE - MORNING

           Manny, asleep in the backseat, is violently awakened by a 
           TRAIN WHISTLE. He is sweating. He pulls his felt hat off to 
           fix it; his hair is matted with night sweat.

           A gorgeous Texas sun is about to break over the Trinity 
           River. Frank checks his pocket watch. And his gun. 

                                 FRANK
                        Happy Easter.

                                 MANNY
                        Same. I gotta take a piss...
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      45.

                                 FRANK
                        Might be something left after the 
                        forty times you were up all night. 

                                 MANNY
                        Well, there’s a place in Heaven for 
                        Gladys, the way you saw wood. When 
                        did you start that?

                                 FRANK
                        Hurry it up.

           Frank flips the starter switch as Manny gets out.

           EXT. WEST DALLAS -- MORNING

           The Hamer Ford drives to the stakeout spot to shadow the Star 
           Service Station. What Frank sees is hard to rationalize.  He 
           and Manny both get out and stare at --

           POV: the neighborhood is crawling with COPS. Uniformed cops 
           and CITY DETECTIVES and G-MEN. Police cars drive slowly up 
           and down while an AIRPLANE buzzes low overhead.

           The one that really gets him is the robot walking up the 
           sidewalk opposite. Its a G-Man actually, but he is wearing 
           the early armor-plate bullet-proofing which fits over the 
           body to the knees and has a tiny slit to look out through. 
           The robot carries a Thompson subgun. High-tech gear for the 
           time. 

           Frank shakes his head, weary. Manny surveys the chaos.  
           Hinton and Alcorn walk up.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        They didn’t show. 

                                 MANNY
                        Well, ain’t that a surprise, Ted. 
                        You’d think Clyde wouldn’t notice a 
                        little metal man walkin’ through 
                        the old neighborhood. 

           Hinton and Alcorn say nothing. Because they see Quinn coming 
           down the walk, carrying a machine rifle. He approaches 
           Hamer’s window.

                                 QUINN
                        I hear that there’s red beans and 
                        cabbage over at the Parker house. 
                        If you’re hungry, Captain Hamer. 
                        Maybe they rode in on mustangs and 
                        rode back out again.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      46.

           Laughter from the Feds behind Quinn. Hamer ignores it, looks 
           past them at-- 

           THE STAR SERVICE STATION

           Henry Barrow leans on a car at the pumps. The white bearded 
           senior is gathered with NEIGHBORHOOD FOLKS, all watching the 
           law invasion like it’s entertainment. CHILDREN grin and call 
           out to the cops.

           A G-MAN appears on the scene, hurried, Thompson sub in hand. 
           He reports to Quinn, but everyone hears the news.

                                 G-MAN
                        Shooting over near Grapevine... 

           Frank turns away from the service station.  

                                 G-MAN
                        ...there’s a man down.  

           They hurry off, Frank turns to Hinton... 

                                 FRANK
                        Get in, Ted. 

           EXT. GRAPEVINE, TEXAS -- THE DIRT ROAD --  LATER

           A sunny Easter afternoon. HIGHWAY PATROL CARS are parked, 
           lights turning, and a HIGHWAY COP is on his knees shielding 
           himself with the open driver’s door as he vomits.

           Superimpose: GRAPEVINE, TEXAS -- EASTER SUNDAY

           Frank’s car pulls in behind the Sheriff Department roadster 
           and patrol vehicles. When he steps out to see a CROWD OF 
           PATROL COPS, he gets a better understanding of why the cop is 
           puking.

           Showing his wallet badge, Frank steps into the circle around 
           a patrol motorcycle and looks down at the young cop laying 
           dead in the dirt.  

           One hand clutches unspent shotgun shells.  

                                 FRANK
                        Whattaya make a that?

           Manny looks thoughtfully at the cop’s motorcycle.  

           Not far away, the second cop looks like he swallowed a 
           grenade, his body a part of the roadside dirt.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      47.

           Frank walks over to where another clutch of cops stands 
           around THE OLD FARMER.

                                 OLD FARMER
                        ...car been parked there all 
                        mornin’. The two officers pull up 
                        and out come the guns. Then the 
                        doors open and I seen a girl and 
                        two boys, a big one and a smaller 
                        one, come out from the car with 
                        machine guns--

           DOWN THE ROAD A PACE 

           FIVE G-MEN are gathered around Agent Kendale who is on a 
           knee. With gloved hands he has opened a stainless steel kit 
           and is methodically setting up a tire tread test, unfolding 
           and spreading yellow carbon-like paper over which he rolls a 
           small instrument.

           Another G-Man is using a tape ruler while a third bags an 
           empty whiskey pint. BOX CAMERAS FLASH. Manny is looking on, 
           watching the high-tech forensics.

                                 G-MAN
                        Get that to Field Office Two, run a 
                        Bertillon test.

           Kendale looks up from his scientific study and sees Manny 
           standing there, observing.

                                 KENDALE
                        Careful where you step. This is a 
                        restricted crime scene.

                                 MANNY
                        Kiss my ass.

           NEARBY -- HAMER

           Is tracking, reading the dirt and grass. He studies--

           A TINY WOMAN’S SHOE PRINT

           Set into the reddish dirt. HAMER steps his own Oxford shoe 
           beside it and leaves behind a large print. The juxtaposition 
           is almost eerie.

           MANNY

           a few feet away lowers himself to his haunches near some 
           grass and picks up a leaf of bitten lettuce. A white-faced 
           Ted Hinton appears behind them.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      48.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        You were right, they came back. 
                        Came right back to Dallas... 

                                 FRANK
                              (points to tracks)
                        She drags her left leg. She gimped?

                                 DEPUTY ALCORN
                        Family says she took a round when 
                        they ran the last roadblock.

                        She’s got a pet rabbit with her.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Maybe a present. For Bonnie’s mama. 
                        Or Billie Mace. She’s generous like 
                        that.

                                 FRANK
                        She can light up a rainy day, can’t 
                        she, Ted? Little bitty of a thing, 
                        ain’t but ninety pounds. But she 
                        could shoot a patrolman in the 
                        head, point blank, while he was 
                        down. 

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        You can tell that from her tracks?

                                 FRANK
                        See that heel scrape?  He was on 
                        his side.  She turned him over with 
                        her foot so he could see what was 
                        about to happen.

           Ted takes this in, sickened.

                                 MANNY
                        You all right, Son? 

           Young Hinton seems startled by the question. Frank rises to 
           look Hinton in the eye, makes sure this registers with the 
           young deputy. Frank doesn’t seem to have the sympathy for 
           Hinton that Manny might have.

                                 FRANK
                        Those kids you grew up with aren’t 
                        human any more. Remember that at 
                        the next road block.

           Manny pats the young deputy’s shoulder. Deputy Alcorn arrives 
           on the scene now. He ignores Frank and Manny, but hands a 
           report to the shaken Ted.

                                 DEPUTY ALCORN
                        The third gun who fired, we think 
                        its either Joe Palmer or Raymond 
                        Hamilton. The Bureau will run 
                        ballistics. 

                                 FRANK
                        Tracks are too small for Palmer --
                        he’s six-foot and change. 
                              (walking away)
                        Would have to be Raymond who shot 
                        the B.A.R. Clyde used a 10 gauge 
                        scatter gun. The little girl used a 
                        sawn-off 20.

           Agent Kendale looks up from his forensic work as he hears 
           this, the brim of his Bogart Felt almost concealing the fact 
           that he’s impressed.

                                 KENDALE
                              (to Quinn)
                        Get the word out state-wide -- All 
                        Points -- Ray Hamilton might be the 
                        third man.

           NEAR THE HAMER FORD

           Frank and Manny pass by that trembling Old Farmer and hear 
           him repeating his eye witness report:

                                 OLD FARMER
                        She got outa the car and walked up 
                        to the officer on the ground, put 
                        the shotgun to him and... she blew 
                        his head off. Then she laughed. I 
                        heard that little girl laugh...

           EXT. TEXAS PANHANDLE -- WIDE OPEN -- DAY

           Frank Hamer’s ‘34 Ford rumbles over rough dirt road in the 
           middle of nowhere, under a huge Texas sky.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DAY

           Frank stares straight ahead, driving like a man obsessed. But 
           steady and methodically, like a storm chaser.

           POV: the green sign reads OKLAHOMA STATE LINE. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      50.

                        State line. 

           Frank keeps driving.

                                 MANNY
                        Just thought I’d point that out.

                                 FRANK
                        Thank you.

           Frank not only ignores the law, he FLOORS IT. He crosses the 
           line into the state of Oklahoma. Manny looks over his 
           shoulder at the pall of dust behind them. 

                                 MANNY
                        It’s open range now.

                        I’m not sure, Governor.

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        Why not?  Aren’t they working for

                                 SIMMONS
                        They were in Dallas three days ago.  
                        That’s as much as I know.

                                 MA FERGUSON
                        I only agreed to this because you 
                        promised to keep Hamer on a short 
                        leash.  They make a fool of me and 
                        they’ll be hell to pay.  We 
                        understand each other?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Yes ma’am.

           EXT. GAS STATION -- OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY -- DAY

           Frank stands outside his car while a HUGE PUMP JOCKEY fills 
           his tank (cranking a lever back and forth), breaking a sweat. 
           The guy is young, big enough to throw a hog over a fence, 
           with a tattoo of a bull on his massive arm.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      51.

                                 PUMP JOCKEY
                        ...never seen it.

           Frank pays the man, looks into his eyes as he does. 

                                 FRANK
                        Hasn’t been another filling station 
                        for a hundred and sixty miles. You 
                        never saw a gray sedan with yellow 
                        tires, two men and a woman, 
                        northbound?

                                 PUMP JOCKEY
                        If it’s Bonnie and Clyde you’re 
                        looking for, I didn’t see them. And 
                        if I did, all the luck to ‘em. They 
                        only taking from the banks that 
                        take from the poor folk. Like me.

           Frank hesitates, fuming, but finally gets in the car.

           INT. HAMER FORD 

           Frank gets behind the wheel. Manny studies a map. Frank 
           ruminates for a second, then gets back out. Manny looks up.  
           Sees something familiar in Frank’s walk as the old Ranger 
           once more approaches the huge Pump Jockey.

                                 MANNY
                        Oh Lord...

           EXT. GAS STATION 

           Frank walks right up to the Pump Jockey who looks him in the 
           eye, shakes his head.

                                 PUMP JOCKEY
                        Now what? I done told you all I--

           Frank jabs the young man hard and quick in the throat. The 
           big man clutches his neck, choking as he falls back against 
           the car. 

           The Pump Jockey tries to push himself off, come back at Frank 
           when Hamer hits him again, this time a short jab to the jaw 
           which makes the man crumple right in front of him.  

           And now Frank kicks him and pulls his gun.

           INT. HAMER FORD

           Manny sighs, opens the door...
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      52.

           EXT. GAS STATION 

           Manny steps out of the car as Frank shoves Old Lucky up under 
           the Pump Jockey’s chin.  

                                 MANNY
                        Pancho.  

           The Pump Jockey looks at Frank... the eyes are dead.  

                                 FRANK
                        There’s a peace Officer died in a 
                        puddle of himself back in Dallas.
                        He was on his first day at the job. 
                        He didn’t have his shotgun loaded 
                        because he was afraid if he took a 
                        spill on his motorcycle, he might 
                        shoot an innocent person. He was 
                        trying to get the shells out of his 
                        pocket when his head was blown off. 
                        Easter Sunday morning. His 
                        family’ll be on the breadline next 
                        week.

           Frank is spitting mad as he gets close, cocks the pistol... 

                                 FRANK
                        Good luck to ‘em? Is that really 
                        all you have to say, Son?

           Frank finally releases him and the giant pump jockey rolls to 
           his side, quailing. He finally gathers himself.

                                 PUMP JOCKEY
                        Came through yesterday.  They 
                        wanted to know where the nearest 
                        tourist camp was and I told them at 
                        the fork but the road is washed out 
                        so I put them on the bypass at 
                        Stroud and showed them on the state 
                        map -- yellow tires, gray sedan, 
                        woman had a white bunny rabbit.

           Frank collects himself, sticks his revolver in his waistband, 
           then gets back behind the wheel. Manny heads to the passenger 
           side as ANOTHER CAR pulls in, the DRIVER taking in the downed 
           and bloodied Pump Jockey.

                                 MANNY
                              (to the driver)
                        Gas prices these days, get 
                        everybody a little riled.

           He gets in the car. They lay rubber. Out of there.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING OKLAHOMA -- DAY 

           Frank drives at speed, a loaded silence. Finally:

                                 MANNY
                        Tell the truth... I wasn’t there, 
                        would that big boy still be alive?

           Frank doesn’t answer.  

                                 MANNY
                        You get that look... well, I thank 
                        God you never put that look on me.

                        nonsense.

           Some 50 HOMELESS CITIZENS live out of parked cars, trucks, or 
           tents. A few temp homes have been constructed from scrap 
           sheet metal.

           Manny and Frank drive past grouty-faced CHILDREN, DOGS and 
           sullen PARENTS. Many are sharecroppers on the move.

           Mrs. Hamer’s Ford no longer looks waxed. It’s dust-covered 
           and the windshield has cow-caught so many dead grasshoppers, 
           it’s hard to see out of it.

           INT. HAMER FORD

           Frank and Manny scan the weathered faces of migrants. Frank 
           looks at Manny. 

                                 MANNY
                        What?

                                 FRANK
                        You’re the more sociable type.

                        You mean, I’m more fulla shit.

           EXT. TOURIST CAMP -- DAY

           MIGRANTS crowd in around the car, make a study of it.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      54.

                                 MIGRANT WORKER
                        You men hiring?

                                 MANNY
                        Was going to ask you the same. Me 
                        and my partner been on the road for 
                        a long while.

           The Migrants press a little closer, looking at the car, the 
           Texas plate.

                                 MANNY
                        Business went under in Fort Worth. 
                        Foreclosed. Damn banks.

           The migrant worker smiles a bitter grin and nods, walks away. 
           A few Okies remain.

                                 OKIE
                        Even say so in the bible. The banks 
                        is the Devil. The Lender. Own a 
                        man’s soul.

                                 MANNY
                        My daughter and her boyfriend been 
                        moving from camp to camp, looking 
                        for work. They would’ve come 
                        through in a new Ford sedan. Yellow 
                        tires. Wouldn’t have happen to see 
                        them, would ya? Two boys and a red-
                        haired girl. Tiny thing.

           Manny watches the migrants, can see them try not to look at 
           each other.  

                                 OKIE
                        They didn’t come through here.

           Manny digs inside his jacket and pulls out a pouch of Bull 
           Durham. He tosses it to the Hobo. Then he hands over some 
           rolling papers.

                                 MANNY
                        We’ll trade you for some pump 
                        water.

                                 OKIE
                        Much obliged, Mister. Good luck to 
                        you.

           The Folks clear out, all drawn to the tobacco. Manny takes a 
           jug to the pump.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      55.

           A CHILD is there stomping bare feet in the spill-off. She’s a 
           girl of about 5, shirtless and boyish, her curly taffy locks, 
           unwashed.

                                 MANNY
                        I had a little girl like you. She’s 
                        all grown up now. Got a baby of her 
                        own. A boy...

           Manny caps his water jug, smiles at the child. He casually 
           removes a photograph from his jacket and shows it to her.

                                 MANNY
                        You ever see these two people come 
                        around here? Dressed up real nice.

           The girl stares at it, curious. Manny shows her two more, mug 
           shots of both Barrow and Parker. Manny makes certain that 
           he’s alone with the child. He whispers.

                                 MANNY
                        These are bad folks. They hurt 
                        other people. If we don’t find 
                        them, they’re going to hurt more 
                        people. Have you seen them here?

           She has no reaction. Something appears to be wrong with her. 
           Deaf-mute maybe. She sticks her tongue out at Manny and runs 
           away, hopping in the spill-off and mud. Manny watches her go. 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DAY

           Manny gets back in the car.

                                 FRANK
                        Masterful.

                                 MANNY
                        Well, why don’t you just get out 
                        and beat the hell out of everybody?

           MANNY reacts as someone appears at his window, point blank, 
           blocks his view.

           It’s the little mudlark again. She is showing the nice old 
           man a doll. A filthy and broken Little Orphan Annie toy, the 
           kind designed to hang from a rearview mirror. We’ve seen it 
           before in a victim’s car.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        The lady give it to me.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      56.

           Slowly she points toward a muddy road that bends near a 
           river.

           DOWN THE MUDDY ROAD -- ALONG THE RIVER -- MOMENTS LATER

           Frank and Manny walk down the road to the muddy river.

           Frank sees something out of place in the weeds - A discarded 
           Texas license plate. A throaty sound draws his gaze--

           OVERHEAD, AN AIRPLANE

           Circles, a single-engine federal surveillance plane.

           MANNY shields his eyes from the sun and looks up at it. He 
           waves.

                                 MANNY
                        How’s the view from up there, Mr. 
                        Hoover? You high-flyin’ sissy.  

           The sound of CROWS draws Frank’s attention back upriver a 
           ways. A half dozen of the scavengers are picking through 
           something near the water.

           Frank walks to the abandoned camp, squats low to study 
           tracks. He knows the shoes, the gaits. The body weights. The 
           Camel butts with red lipstick...

           He examines a dead campfire, feels the rocks. 

                                 MANNY
                        Still warm?

           Manny kneels twenty feet away.  Frank nods.

                                 MANNY
                        Butts back here, spread out - looks 
                        like Durham.

                                 FRANK
                              (holding up a butt)
                        Clyde smokes Redbird.  Always has 
                        that third man fifty feet from the 
                        car, on watch...
                              (looking up, troubled)
                        But which one is it?

                                 MANNY
                        Three broke out, only one with ‘em 
                        now.  Hamilton maybe, like you 
                        said.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      57.

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe I was wrong.  

           Manny walks over, cups a hand to his ear...

                                 MANNY
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. You 
                        were what? 

                                 FRANK
                              (ignoring him)
                        Hamilton’s a leader. This man is a 
                        scout. A follower. You track a wolf 
                        and you track a dog you know the 
                        difference. Our third man is 
                        Clyde’s watch dog. A follower.

           Manny spots something on the ground, bends for it as Frank 
           picks up the butts, an empty rubbers pack, bags them. He 
           finds a well-worn copy of True Detective and an empty liquor 
           bottle...

                                 FRANK
                        Clyde may not drink but she sure 
                        does.

                                 MANNY
                        The girl’s in serious pain.

           Manny holds up an empty prescription vial, tosses it to 
           Frank.

                                 MANNY
                        Amobarbital. 

           Frank looks at Manny. He knows. Hamer thinks on this for a 
           moment, pockets the vial. 

           He hears a GUN COCK BEHIND HIM. The hard click of a double-
           barrelled shotgun aimed at his back.

           Frank remains frozen on his haunches, but he and Manny slowly 
           turn their heads to see--

           A MIGRANT FARMER holding a shotgun on him. MORE MEN come out 
           from the bushes, armed with sticks and rocks.

                                 MIGRANT FARMER
                        Ya’ll are government sumbitches, 
                        ain’t ya?  

           Frank slowly rises, and as he does, he pulls his jacket back 
           to reveal Old Lucky in his waistband. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      58.

           The way that he’s standing, with his hand in ready to draw 
           position, makes them stop short.

           Manny now does the same, very slowly. 

                                 MANNY
                        Tell me, did they give you money? 
                        Did they give to the poor?

           No response. They’d still like to lynch the lawmen.

                                 MANNY
                        Didn’t think so. 
                              (off the silence)
                        But y’all fed them and hid them, 
                        and let them run another day to 
                        maybe kill another cop. Cause 
                        they’re the good guys, ain’t they? 
                        Robin Hoods, right?

           The shotgunner wants to take a pull. His anger at life reads 
           cold in his gaunt face. Frank stares him down. 

                                 MIGRANT FARMER
                        Oughta kill you both--

                                 MANNY
                        No, what you oughta do is look into 
                        my partner’s eyes a moment, and ask 
                        yourself, does he really look like 
                        the kinda man you wanna shoot at?

           The Migrant with the shotgun looks at Frank, sees something 
           there that makes him shift his feet.

                                 MANNY
                        Now, I was you, I’d lower that 
                        shotgun real slow.

           The shotgunner shifts his gaze nervously to Manny then back 
           at Frank who has not moved an inch, his hand still in draw 
           position.

                                 MANNY
                        And stop starin’ at him, you’ll 
                        only make him anxious. Just set 
                        that gun down, set it right down on 
                        the grass...

           Between Hamer’s stare-down and Manny’s instruction, the 
           Shotgunner breaks a sweat. He slowly lowers the shotgun and 
           places it gingerly in the grass.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      59.

                                 MANNY
                        That’s it.

           The other men don’t like the look of Hamer’s gun hand nor his 
           eyes. This isn’t a city cop or a country constable. 

                                 MIGRANT WORKER
                        Who are you fellas?

           Frank has to think about this question for a moment.

                                 FRANK
                        I suppose we’re the bad guys.

           Frank takes his hand away from his gun and walks past the 
           group toward his car.  Manny winks at the Migrant farmer as 
           he passes.

                                 MANNY
                        All the luck to you folks.

           SAXOPHONE MUSIC over...

           EXT. OKLAHOMA SIDE-ROAD -- NIGHT

           Texas-Oklahoma Panhandle country. Tornado alley. A dark blue 
           Ford sedan is pulled off the road. 

           There are three people in the car, two up front, a bigger one 
           in the backseat. The windshield is opaque with dead 
           grasshoppers and dust, and we can’t see in.

           A SAXOPHONE is being played from behind the wheel. An odd 
           attempt at 30’s jazz. Its ineptitude is haunting.

           EXT. OPEN AIR ROADSIDE MARKET  -- OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY -- DAY

           A hand painted sign advertises sandwiches, beer and smokes.  
           The PROPRIETOR, down on his luck, talks to Frank and Manny. 

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        The boy I seen couldn’t be Clyde. 
                        Clyde’s six feet tall and looks 
                        like Clark Gable they say. The girl 
                        with him, she wasn’t no prize. Tiny 
                        little thing and dirty drunk. And 
                        the fella in the backseat, well, 
                        you’d about swear he’d been whipped 
                        with an ugly stick. And I used to 
                        promote Jacko, the alligator faced 
                        Chinaman.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      60.

                                 MANNY
                        I’m sorry I missed that one.

                                 FRANK
                        When was this?

                                 PROPRIETOR
                        Maybe two, three hours ago--

           Frank is already hurrying behind the wheel.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA SIDE ROAD -- DAY

           A Highway Patrol vehicle bounces down the dirt road. It 
           approaches the stolen Barrow car, parked roadside. 

           The Highway Patrol car does not drive on by, but instead 
           pulls to the side of the road, facing the parked sedan.

           The driver and passenger doors open and two Highway Cops step 
           out. The driver is CHIEF BOYD. The passenger is CONSTABLE CAL 
           CAMPBELL, portly with a waxed white handlebar mustache.

                                 CAL
                        Stuck looks like.

                                 BOYD
                        You got the chains, Cal?

                                 CAL
                        Yeah. Lets see if we can muscle 
                        them out first.

           The two cops start walking toward the Pontiac. 

                                 BOYD
                        You folks need some help?

           A second of dead air. We HEAR CAR DOORS OPEN.

           Constable Campbell draws--

           HEAVY MACHINE GUNFIRE BLASTS Constable Campbell’s chest out. 
           Percy Boyd FIRES HIS GUN, smashes the windshield, but he is 
           hit, too, goes down wounded.

           As he curls on the ground he hears footsteps approaching him. 
           A woman’s strappy red high-heels. Tiny and doll-like. With a 
           slight limp. The wounded cop must be able to scent the fresh 
           red toenail polish, the girl’s feet are so close.

           And now a 20-gauge sawn-off touches his head. He looks up, 
           squints, can’t see her face against the sun.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      61.

                              (Southern Belle-like)
                        Hi there.

                                 BOYD
                        Oh, Lord help me...

           EXT. DIRT ROAD -- DAY

           Frank’s Ford leaves a tail of dust and gravel on a winding 
           ribbon of farm road. 

           Frank stops the car, gets out, looks at the long muddy road 
           ahead to where it offers a northern pass and one that veers 
           east. Manny gets out, stands beside him.  

                                 MANNY
                              (eyeing the two roads)
                        Missouri or Kansas?

           Frank lays out his highway department map, the one that he 
           has drawn concentric circles on.

                                 FRANK
                        Check the file, see if any of the 
                        escapees have family nearby.

           Manny sits in the car, opens the file, spreads out a few 
           pages, notices something.

                                 MANNY
                        You know you got a radio in this 
                        thing?  That’s not factory.  How 
                        much did that set you back?

                                 FRANK
                        You’d have to ask Gladys.  Just an 
                        intrusion on a man’s peace and 
                        quiet.  Not that I’ve had any since 
                        Lubbock.

           Manny starts the car and turns on the radio.  Music BLARES.  
           Frank sighs and keeps looking at the map.

           Manny finds a song he likes, smiles as it ends.

                                 MANNY
                        That’s a goodun.

           The ANNOUNCER interrupts...
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      62.

                                 RADIO
                        Well, the Barrow Gang appears to be 
                        back in the news, Folks...

           Frank looks up.  Manny adjusts the volume.

                                 RADIO
                        Police are not yet releasing 
                        details but have stated that Bonnie 
                        and Clyde may have struck again on 
                        US Highway 71 north of Tulsa.

                                 MANNY
                        How far is that? --

                                 FRANK
                              (checks map)
                        Ten, fifteen miles tops.

           EXT. OKLAHOMA SIDE ROAD -- DAY

           Scene of the crime. Police and Highway Patrol Cars parked 
           roadside. BLOODHOUNDS are BAYING and running on leash with 
           LOCAL DEER HUNTERS who lead a host of COPS into the dead 
           fields.  

           A muddy black Ford comes up the dirt lane, approaches the 
           roadblock. The Hamer car.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- LATE DAY

           Stopped by a shaken HIGHWAY COP, Frank shows his wallet 
           badge.

                                 FRANK
                        What do we have?

                                 COP
                        Officer dead. County constable. 

                                 MANNY
                        Jesus. Another cop... 

                                 COP
                        Police Chief is missing. Sir, this 
                        badge is good in Texas, but--
                              (studying badge)
                        Wait a sec.

           The trembling cop goes over to the gathering of lawmen.

                                 MANNY
                        Uh-oh--
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      63.

                                 FRANK
                        This ain’t good.

           POV: the cop is showing the badge to TWO G-MEN who look out 
           of place in the countryside. They examine the badge, look up 
           at the vehicle, and then start toward it.

                                 FIRST G-MAN
                        How are we today?

                                 FRANK
                        Never good when a peace officer 
                        goes down in the line. We need to 
                        get through, Sir. Now.

           A SECOND G-MAN is at Manny’s window, trying to see into the 
           backseat. He’s holding a Thompson subgun.

                                 FIRST G-MAN
                        Only the Bureau has multi-state 
                        jurisdiction-- 

                                 MANNY
                        --Son, we need to stay the trail--

                                 FIRST G-MAN
                        --So unless you’re government 
                        agents or Oklahoma police officers, 
                        I’m going to have to turn you back, 
                        Men.

                                 FRANK
                        And did that order come from 
                        Director Hoover? Or the Governor of 
                        Texas?

                                 FIRST G-MAN
                        Its the law. Turn this vehicle 
                        around. Now.

           Frank watches the G-Man walk away, take out a cigarette, 
           indicate the Hamer Ford. The men laugh.  

           Frank rubs his eyes, weary. Reverses, watching the G-Men in 
           his side mirror. When he has the ass end of the Ford facing 
           the roadblock...

                                 FRANK
                        How lucky you feeling?

                                 MANNY
                        Like always.  Fifty percent.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      64.

                                 FRANK
                        I got the other fifty.

           Frank floors it and startled COPS and AGENTS scramble out of 
           the way as the ‘34 FORD--

           BUSTS THROUGH THE NOTCH BETWEEN TWO PARKED POLICE CARS

           In reverse -- and then fish tails back around, racing over 
           the rough road, making an escape.

           IN THE ROAD

           The First G-Man claws at the dust for his hat as if he’s 
           powerless without it. When he gets it, he runs to the main 
           phalanx.

                                 FIRST G-MAN
                        Call in that tag on those 
                        cowboys...all points...

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- DAY

           Frank looks in his rearview at the dust as he hits 80.  

                                 MANNY
                        I think we just became public 
                        enemies.

                                 FRANK
                        They need drugs for the girl.  
                        What’s the closest large town north 
                        of here?

                                 MANNY
                        You know what, Pancho? Maybe I 
                        should drive--

                                 FRANK
                        What town?!

           Manny shakes his head, unwrinkles the map on the dash.

           EXT. CITY STREETS -- SUPER: COFFEYVILLE, KANSAS -- DAY

           A small Midwestern town. One of those towns that are still 
           there today and resemble a false front of brick shops and 
           public offices. A DRUG STORE sits on the end of the block.

           INT. CAFE -- ACROSS THE STREET -- SAME

           Manny sits in a booth, finishing a piece of pie, watching the 
           drug store. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      65.

           Manny watches as Frank exits the facilities and slides into 
           the booth, wincing. 

                                 MANNY
                        How many bullets you got in you? 
                        Really?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know, sixteen, I think. 

                                 MANNY
                        You think? You mean, you don’t 
                        know?

           Frank thinks a moment, then nods... 

                                 FRANK
                        Sixteen.  

                                 MANNY
                        I told my grandboy twenty-six. But 
                        I thought it was more like thirteen 
                        to be true. Who were you with when 
                        you took the other three?

                                 FRANK
                        Gonzalvas.

                                 MANNY
                        Figures. That Brownsville?

                                 FRANK
                        Sweetwater.

                                 MANNY
                        Where was I?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t know. In a cantina maybe. 
                        Dancing with whores.

           Manny considers his old friend a moment.  

                                 MANNY
                        You know, a man can’t pass bullets 
                        like he can pass kidney stones or 
                        something. Might be good to have a 
                        doctor look at you some time.

                                 FRANK
                        Might be good to have a doctor look 
                        at you some time.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      66.

                                 MANNY
                        I don’t have any bullets in me.

                                 FRANK
                        Because I was covering you. 

           Manny takes this in, finishes his coffee.

                                 MANNY
                        Clyde was ahead of us on the road. 
                        How long we gonna sit here?  

                                 FRANK
                        You got a better idea?

                                 MANNY
                        Don’t know if it’s better.
                              (off Frank’s look)
                        File says there was one convict 
                        tried to make the escape but was 
                        too late. 

                                 FRANK
                        Wade McNabb, why?

                                 MANNY
                        If he were a free man wouldn’t he 
                        try and meet up with his friends?  
                        Mcnabb’s only in for firearms, he’s 
                        not a killer.  Lee Simmons could 
                        get him furloughed.

                                 FRANK
                              (dismissing the subject)
                        Fergusen wouldn’t go for it.

                                 MANNY
                        Just saying.

                                 FRANK
                        Manny...

           Frank spots something.  Manny turns, looks out at...

           THE STREET 

           Coming down the sidewalk is a tiny red-haired girl, hair 
           stuffed up under a fashionable beret, tight curvy skirt, and 
           high heels. Swivel-hipped, she’s headed right for the Drug 
           Store.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      67.

           FRANK AND MANNY

           Both start to slide out of the booth, then freeze... 

           THEIR POV -- THE DRUGSTORE

           As the girl approaches the Drug Store, TWO MORE GIRLS come 
           out, one with a bag of candy sticks and the other with a 
           magazine. They, too, are wearing the Bonnie look. Giggling 
           and sharing candy, they shimmy down the Avenue in their hip 
           skirts. 

           FRANK sits back, dispirited.

                                 MANNY
                        Bonnie Parker. Seen ten of them 
                        today. 

                                 FRANK
                        It’s the fashion.

           Manny looks at Frank, puts some coins on the table...

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- DAY

           Frank and Manny make their way to the car.  Frank gets in, 
           starts the car. Manny walks toward an alley.

                                 FRANK
                        Where you goin’?

           Manny looks back at him, shrugs.

                                 FRANK
                        Again?  Why didn’t you go in the 
                        cafe?

           EXT. STREET -- SAME

           As Manny walks to an alley, turns up it.  

           INT. ALLEY -- SAME

           Manny steps into the alley, moves behind some trash bins and 
           starts to take a leak. He hears the rumble of an ENGINE and 
           looks to the OTHER END of the alley, sees the snout of a dark 
           blue Ford sedan ease past the opposite mouth.  

           Manny freezes, watches as A FIGURE in a felt hat and long 
           overcoat gets out from the backseat, hurries to a BACK DOOR.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      68.

           The man, a big scar on his neck -- HENRY METHVYN from the 
           opening breakout -- pauses when he sees Manny a moment, but 
           then keeps on moving... dismissing him as no threat.   

           Manny stands there a moment, blinks himself out of it, and 
           slowly moves towards the other end of the alley, towards that 
           dark blue, Ford... 

           MANNY’S POV -- THROUGH THE DUSTY REAR WINDOW

           Behind the wheel, a small man with a fedora worn at a rakish 
           angle; a tiny woman’s head, hair up under a dark beret. We 
           can’t see their faces.

                                 MANNY
                        Lord God... 

           Manny reaches slowly for his weapon inside his coat... 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- SAME

           Frank spots --

           The figure in a long overcoat moving around inside the 
           drugstore, but he can’t see his face from here. Frank leans 
           forward, tries to see up the alley where Manny had gone to...

           EXT. ALLEY -- SAME

           As Manny steps into shadowed doorway along the alley, now 
           watches as the girl in the passenger seat tosses a matchstick 
           out her window.

           Their faces are obscured by the glare off the glass. The 
           driver in the fedora turns to look at the street, speaks to 
           some admirers who are gathering.  

           Manny raises his pistol, takes aim... 

           MANNY’S POV -- BONNIE

           Suddenly slides over to be near the driver. She kisses his 
           cheek, whispers in his ear.

           Manny -- ready to pull. She’s awful close to him. Manny 
           tenses. Agonizes...

           POV: Bonnie turns because PEDESTRIANS are noticing her and 
           reacting. Reacting like she is Claudette Colbert. YOUNG GIRLS 
           are jostling each other, grinning awe-struck.

           INT. HAMER FORD

           As Frank opens the door, slowly gets out of the car...

           EXT. ALLEY -- SAME

           As Manny steadies his shooting hand --  

           SCHOOL KIDS run into view, crowding the car. Manny lowers the 
           gun.  

           Henry Methvyn hurries out the BACK DOOR of the drugstore and 
           gets back in the rear seat, holding a drug store bag, and the 
           vehicle pulls away quickly. 

           PEDESTRIANS tail the car a short distance, smiling in awe and 
           excitement. A YOUNG GIRL picks up a blue handkerchief from 
           the street and OTHER KIDS gang around it, grinning.

           Manny takes off running back up the alley...

           EXT. HAMER FORD -- SAME

           As Manny comes running back to the car... 

                                 MANNY
                        Go!  The alley!

           FRANK gets back in, starts the car, slams the gas. 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- SAME

           As Frank guns it into the alley... 

                                 MANNY
                        They parked in the back. One of ‘em 
                        got out, went into the store-- 
                        wasn’t Ray Hamilton either. Was 
                        Henry Methvin. Third man in the 
                        jailbreak.

                                 FRANK
                        You let him go?!

                                 MANNY
                        I went for Clyde--

                                 FRANK
                        Clyde--

           He glances at Manny, sees that he’s holding his gun... 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      70.

                                 FRANK
                        You had a shot?!

           Manny doesn’t answer. They come to the crowd at the mouth of 
           the alley which has now doubled, block their path. Frank 
           LEANS ON THE HORN. It doesn’t matter.

                                 FRANK
                        Son of a bitch...

           Frank drops into reverse, guns it backward in the alley. A 
           COCA-COLA TRUCK is now blocking the entrance they just drove 
           in from.  

           Hamer has no choice. He FLOORS IT and races right at the 
           CROWD in the streets. He LEANS ON THE HORN making people run 
           from his path, yank children out of the way. But PEOPLE ARE 
           BLOCKING HIM intentionally, fighting him.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- DAY

           Frank stares into the harsh light on the highway. He spots 
           the car 300 yards ahead, a blue heat mark on the hard top.

                                 FRANK
                        Why didn’t you take him?!

                                 MANNY
                              (quietly)
                        Too many people.

           EXT. TEXAS HIGHWAY -- DAY

           The Barrow car races along, gaining speed while the Hamer car 
           pursues.

           Both have powerful V-8 engines, bullet-proof metal (as Fords 
           were at the time). Barrow slams the brake and jags sideways 
           off the highway...onto a gravel road.

           Hamer tries for an angle and cuts the wheel, leaving the 
           highway and plowing the grille of his wife’s Ford through 
           alfalfa fields. 

           THE BARROW CAR

           Gains speed, the front grille ventilators flipping open like 
           metal fins once he hits 80. Hamer’s car comes up from behind, 
           has the angle and now--

           FRANK HAS HIS COLT MONITOR UP 

           And ready as he bears down. But--
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      71.

           THE BARROW CAR

           Pulls a dangerous “sling shot” and guns back for the highway. 

           THE HAMER CAR

           Does the same, fish-tailing, lost for a moment in road dust. 
           Manny holds on.

           INT. HAMER CAR -- DAY

           Frank downshifts, GRINDS GEARS and this two second error 
           allows Barrow to create some separation.  

           The SOUND OF A TRAIN WHISTLE over the roar of the V-8. 

           A FREIGHT TRAIN is highballing from an eastward direction and 
           is going to cross the highway in seven seconds. No crossing 
           gate ahead, but there is a post with a BELL and that thing is 
           CLANKING a steady tempo.

           Frank sees the train. He sees that Barrow is about to play 
           the old game of chicken. He gets the speed clock up to 83 
           m.p.h. gets his left hand out the window, aiming Old Lucky.

           Manny looks at his gun, takes a breath, then hangs out the 
           passenger window with it, trying to line up. But--

           BUCKSHOT EXPLODES THE WINDSHIELD, Manny drops. Might be hit.

                                 FRANK
                        MANNY!

           Frank grabs for his partner. Manny rolls over, stunned, 
           shakes off glass. He takes inventory of his thin body. He is 
           almost amazed that he’s not carrying shrapnel. So is Hamer.

                                 MANNY
                        I’m alright--

           EXT. TRAIN CROSSING -- TEXAS HIGHWAY -- DAY

           The Barrow car races toward the tracks. The train is getting 
           closer... 

           The Hamer car is right beside the Barrow car. Both cars race 
           straight at the tracks. Frank has his sidearm out the window 
           just as they hit the crossing...

           The Barrow car smacks sideways into the Hamer car, knocking 
           it aside so that while the Barrow car makes it across...
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      72.

           The Hamer car is no longer lined up with the crossing and 
           HITS THE RAILS, the car’s front wheels bouncing over the 
           iron. 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DAY

           As Manny and Frank jerk to a stop. Manny turns, watches the 
           train bearing down on them...

                                 MANNY
                        Hey, Pancho?

           Frank turns, sees the train, puts the car in reverse... 

           EXT. RAIL CROSSING -- TEXAS HIGHWAY -- DAY

           As Frank spins the back wheels trying to get the front wheels 
           back up and over the rails... he goes forward and back but 
           the front tires won’t go over... He tries again.. 

           We hear the train’s AIR BRAKES SCREECHING as the Ford finally 
           bounces back over the rail but not before...

           THE TRAIN KNOCKS THE FRONT BUMPER OFF THE CAR, spinning the 
           Ford momentarily onto two wheels before it drops back down. 

           The train starts to slow as Manny and Frank get out of the 
           car, breathing hard, watching stupidly as the train passes 
           carrying the bumper down the tracks.  

           Manny looks at the battered car. 

                                 MANNY
                        Gladys still got that shotgun you 
                        bought her last Christmas?

           EXT. WEST DALLAS -- DAYS LATER - DAY

           The Devil’s Back Porch on a warm day. Shotgun shacks and run-
           down homes. KIDS play marbles in the street.

                                 CAR RADIO
                        ...with full knowledge of the

                        to pay immediately the sum of One

           Frank’s beat up Ford pulls into this side road, slowly. He 
           pulls over at his spot where he gets a good view of the 
           Parker home and the Filling station.  He and Manny look as 
           rough as the Ford.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      73.

                                 CAR RADIO
                        ...yes One Thousand Dollars to

                        those daring love birds, Bonnie and 
                        Clyde, as, and when they appear in 
                        person at either our Dallas, Fort 
                        Worth or San Antonio stores and 
                        find a single flaw in any of our 
                        Certified perfect Diamonds.

           Frank turns off the radio, observes the CHILDREN on the porch 
           of the staked-out home. He starts to chuckle in frustration.

           Manny looks up at the house, takes Frank’s view. 

           THEIR POV: THE PARKER HOUSE

           In the small, dirty front yard Emma Parker stands over a 
           gathering of children. She is holding a white rabbit. The 
           kids all crowd in to pet it.

                                 FRANK
                        They got through a thousand man 
                        dragnet, delivered a bunny to mama.

                                 MANNY
                        What now?
                              (off Frank’s look)
                        I just had the one idea.

           AT THE SERVICE STATION

           Henry Barrow finishes filling someone’s car, takes their 
           money and walks back into his garage.

           FRANK    

           Bites his lip, gets out of the car.

           EXT. STAR SERVICE STATION -- WEST DALLAS -- DAY

           Frank crosses the street and walks right up to the station.

           Frank pauses at the newspaper rack in front of the small 
           garage and picks up The Star.

           Front Page headline: CLYDE SENDS LETTER TO HENRY FORD: “SIR, 
           YOU MAKE A DANDY CAR.”

           Frank reacts...then digs a coin from his pants pocket.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      74.

           INT. STAR SERVICE STATION GARAGE -- DAY

           Frank goes to a greasy counter to pay. No sign of life. Just 
           a Philco radio playing quiet music. He drops the coin on the 
           counter.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW (O.S.)
                        Thank you, Sir.

           Frank turns to see the old man tinkering with car parts. 

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        Seen you around. They tell me 
                        you’re with the highway department.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        But I know what you really are. 

           Frank looks at him.  

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        I know a killer when I see one.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sure you would, Mr. Barrow.

           Old Barrow cleans his hands with a rag, looks at Frank with 
           weary eyes.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        Look, Mister, I know that ya’ll are 
                        gonna have to kill my boy. It ain’t 
                        your fault. He’s gone past the 
                        point a redemption. But I just want 
                        you to know something... 

           Henry has crossed to the soda cooler and, from the wall above 
           he removes a small sepia photograph, creased and yellowed. He 
           hands it to Frank.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        He wasn’t born that way. He wasn’t 
                        born no dark soul.   

           INSERT PHOTO: Clyde at 12, jug-eared and grinning. Freckles.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        He was my little Huck Finn. It’s 
                        what me and Cumie called him.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      75.

           Frank looks up from the photo to see the aged green eyes of 
           Henry Barrow. 

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        Loved bicycles. But what he really 
                        wanted to be was a musician. Sure, 
                        he liked to dress fine and get the 
                        girls, but he wasn’t a bad boy. I 
                        had high hopes.  

           Old Barrow opens the soda cooler and gets some ice. It’s warm 
           and he needs some for the back of his neck.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        One turn on the trail can change a 
                        young man’s life. He stole a 
                        chicken. Stole a doggoned chicken. 
                        The Law took him for a bad seed 
                        from that day and dogged that boy. 

           Frank nods, considers the picture a moment, then returns it 
           to Mr. Barrow...

                                 FRANK
                        Maybe so, but something inside made 
                        him steal that chicken in the first 
                        place.  

           Mr. Barrow looks at Frank now.  

                                 FRANK
                        People don’t always know who they 
                        really are until it’s too late.  
                              (then)
                        All I ever wanted to be was a 
                        preacher.

           Frank turns and meets the old man’s curious gaze.

                                 FRANK
                        Was saving up for the seminary 
                        school. Working for a sharecropper 
                        down in San Saba. McSwain. Word got 
                        out that I was handy with a pistol 
                        and he offered me two-hundred 
                        dollars to make a kill. Thought he 
                        meant a coyote or pole cat. But it 
                        was his business partner he wanted 
                        dead. 

           Old Man Barrow seems disquieted and engaged at the same time.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      76.

                                 HENRY BARROW
                        What’d you do?

                                 FRANK
                        Well...I preached. 
                              (then)
                        “Thou shall not kill, Mr. McSwain. 
                        Thou shall not kill.” I stepped off 
                        the porch and he pulled a bird gun 
                        and shot me in the head. Shot me in 
                        the back. The legs...

           Henry Barrow stands, listening.

                                 FRANK
                        I was sixteen years-old and he left 
                        me to die in an irrigation ditch. 
                        But I crawled home and my Mama 
                        doctored me for a summer and a 
                        fall. And when it was time to go to 
                        seminary school, I saddle-bagged my 
                        money and rode off. Right to the 
                        general store. Bought me a Colt 
                        revolver and a Winchester. Box of 
                        shells. Rode over to Mr. McSwain’s 
                        and rang the yard bell. He come 
                        out. 

           The rest is hard for Frank. He turns his back to Henry and 
           finds himself looking at that pinned up photo of 12 year-old 
           Clyde. Frank stares at that photo for a time, then finally 
           turns, and now it’s him with sadness in his eyes.

                                 FRANK
                        I shot the sonuvabitch dead on that 
                        same porch.
                              (then)
                        And there went my calling. McSwain 
                        turned out to have been a wanted 
                        killer himself... and I become the 
                        law.  

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        One turn on the trail.

           Frank looks at Old Man Barrow, the sadness gone as he says.  

                                 FRANK
                        Your boy may not’ve been born with 
                        a dark soul, but he’s sure got one 
                        now.  

           The old man says nothing.  
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      77.

                                 FRANK
                        I just hope, that by some grace of 
                        the Lord, he surrenders and lets 
                        the girl live. Maybe the next time 
                        you or Bonnie’s Ma see ‘em, you can 
                        make that suggestion.  

           Frank touches his brim, then turns and starts out of the 
           station. Old Man Barrow takes a step after him, then:

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        He won’t surrender.

           Frank pauses, turns back.

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        He’s gonna get hung anyhow, he’d 
                        rather die on the run. That’s the 
                        way it’s gonna be.

                                 FRANK
                        And until then, how many more folks 
                        he gonna kill?

           Henry Barrow sighs, takes several steps closer, cleaning his 
           hand on the rag. 

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        Mister, you ain’t hearin’ me. I’m 
                        tryin’ to say somethin’ ain’t easy 
                        for me to say.  

           Frank waits. The man takes a breath, then... 

                                 OLD MAN BARROW
                        I’m tryin’ to say that I know
                        there’s only one way this thing is 
                        ever gonna end. So I’m askin’ you
                        to please end it now, damn it. 
                              (tears in his eyes)
                        End it now. For my family.

           And before the old man falls apart, he turns and walks back 
           into the dark of the service station, the Philco radio still 
           playing quietly.

           Frank stands there another moment, then turns and sees...

           MANNY

           Just outside, leaning against the pump. Having heard the 
           whole exchange. Frank walks by him. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      78.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m gonna call Lee Simmons.
                              (walking off)
                        Get him to furlough Wade McNabb.

                                 MANNY
                        What a fine idea.  

           JAZZ MUSIC COMES UP into--

           EXT. UNDERWORLD DANCE HALL (THE BRICK HOUSE) -- NIGHT

           A smoke-filled den, packed to the walls and surging to the 
           JAZZ BAND. Fancy Prince of Wales suits and felt lids, tight 
           long skirts and high heeled sandals. Depression-era kids 
           taking their cues from gangster movies and musicals.

           One of them, a kid barely 20, sits at the bar decked in Glen 
           plaid and a pork pie hat. He’s got girls around him as he 
           drinks bourbon and smokes a Lucky Strike like a guy who 
           hasn’t had the luxury in a while. This is WADE McNABB.

                                 GARBO GIRL
                              (but Texas style)
                        I couldn’t believe it when Billie 
                        Mace said they was lettin’ you out.

                                 MCNABB
                        Sixty days. If I get a job and do 
                        good behavior in that time, could 
                        be full parole. But it ain’t good 
                        behavior I got on my mind tonight, 
                        Sweets.

           The Girls giggle and tease with the painfully skinny and 
           young convict.

                                 GARBO GIRL
                        Is it true you really know Clyde 
                        Barrow?

                                 MCNABB
                        Yeah, and I knew his brother Buck, 
                        too, before they shot him dead.

           The two ex-Texas Rangers make their way through the crowd. 
           They attract some odd looks, but most everyone is drinking 
           and not caring.

           A YOUNG WOMAN looks up from where she poses with a hand on a 
           chair back. She wears a beret, make-up, curvy dress, and 
           strapped heels. She blows a smoke ring as she looks the older 
           men up and down.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      79.

           Manny looks back at her as they wade through the young and 
           modern crowd.

                                 MANNY
                        How are you, darlin’?

           Frank keeps him moving along.  

           AT THE END OF THE BAR

           Wade McNabb sits, smoking, drinking his whiskey.

                                 VOICE
                        Two beers.

           McNabb turns as Frank leans on the bar beside him.  

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t look at me.

           McNabb studies him in the bar mirror.

                                 FRANK
                        Good to be off the farm, Wade?

                                 MCNABB
                        They wouldn’t tell me your name.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t need it.

                                 MCNABB
                        I dig.

           Manny puts his beer bottle down on the bar. Empty. He needed 
           that.

                                 MANNY
                        Where’s the washroom?

           The kid jerks his head toward a hall.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s his favorite room. He’s 
                        doing a survey cross country.

           Manny starts down the hall of the bustling club.

                                 MCNABB
                        What ya’ll need me to do?

           McNabb is trying to light a smoke, but his hand is shaking. 
           Frank lights it for him.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      80.

           INT. MEN’S ROOM -- UNDERWORLD DANCE HALL -- NIGHT

           Manny stands at a toilet, the kind with a long chain flusher. 
           He stoops over a moment. He finally gets control, shakes his 
           head, starts to take a leak... he sees someone in the wall 
           mirror enter.

           A FANCY DAN in a flannel suit with wide lapels, rakish hat. 
           TWO MORE DANS come in behind him, strutting. It is a walk 
           that they have adopted from Edward G. Robinson the same way 
           kids today try to emulate the attitude of a hip-hop star.

           While one of the Dans washes his hands in the sink, the other 
           two loiter behind Manny, exchanging smirks with their friend.

                                 FANCY DAN
                        Say...you bringing the cattle to 
                        market, Dad?

           The young men chuckle at this and it encourages the Dan at 
           the sink as he dries his hands. Manny maintains his 
           compromised position at the urinal.

           INT. UNDERWORLD DANCE HALL -- AT THE BAR

           Frank sips his beer as he watches McNabb in the mirror.

                                 MCNABB
                        I swear, Big Man. They plannin’ to 
                        skin out for Mexico. That’s the 
                        word. What do ya know, Joe?

                                 FRANK
                        Son, s’pose you cut the junior 
                        gangster act and get serious. 

           Frank grabs the boy’s wrist and holds onto it as Wade tries 
           to pull away, but can’t.  

                                 FRANK
                        Otherwise, there’s nothin’ you can 
                        do for me, I’ll have Lee Simmons 
                        give you a ride back to the farm.

           INT. UNDERWORLD DANCE HALL -- MEN’S ROOM

           Manny is still at the urinal. Takes some work.

                                 FANCY DAN
                        Let me tell you somethin’, Mister. 
                        You come to the wrong place to dog 
                        Wade Boy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      81.

                                 FANCY DAN (cont'd)
                        Wade Boy runs with Clyde, and 
                        around here, Clyde is king. You 
                        dig?

           In the mirror, Manny can see one of the Dans latch the chain 
           lock on the door. The Fancy Dan from the sink now flicks open 
           a switch blade and holds it at Manny’s back.

                                 FANCY DAN
                        You just stay where you are, Old 
                        Wheat. Need to have a look at your 
                        badge--

           Manny turns from the john with his hands still down at his 
           belongings. But he has in his grip a .45 Colt Peacemaker and 
           he brings it upward with such force that he breaks the jaw of 
           the Fancy Dan before grabbing a handful of his flannel lapel 
           and driving him headfirst into the toilet.

           The other two Dans make sudden moves, but the old Ranger has 
           the .45 up on them.

                                 MANNY
                        It’s a real mess, you get it point-
                        blank, but I’m happy to do it, son.   

           They consider the pistol. Take a step back.  

                                 MANNY
                        A lotta nerve you got tryin’ to rob 
                        a fella while he’s havin’ himself a 
                        pleasant relief.

           The Fancy Dan is trying to get his face out of the toilet, 
           but we can now see that Manny has a boot placed squarely on 
           him and he’s pushing him down in there.

                                 MANNY
                        Get yourselfs in that stall, go on.

           Manny waves his gun toward the stall and the two make no 
           effort to resist. They enter the stall, scared. 

                                 MANNY
                        You stay in there until I come back 
                        and tell you different. I want you 
                        to think about your manners.

           As for the Fancy Dan head first in the bowl, Manny puts all 
           of his weight on him and drives his face into the brackish 
           water. He heels the guy down into the toilet, pulls the chain 
           and flushes.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      82.

                                 MANNY
                        Clyde might be king. But I’m a 
                        Texas Ranger...you little shit.

           Manny sticks his heater in his waistband, walks out.

           INT. UNDERWORLD DANCE HALL -- NIGHT

           McNabb looks around the bar, then leans close to Frank.  

                                 MCNABB
                        Me’n Clyde, we’re like brothers, 
                        y’know? I looked out for him at 
                        Eastham. He said he’d do the same, 
                        I got out. 

                                 FRANK
                        Just tell me when’s he comin’ and 
                        where?

                                 MCNABB
                        His sister-in-law Blanche fixes 
                        Bonnie’s hair.

                                 FRANK
                        When?

                                 MCNABB
                        Dinner time.  Tomorrow.  Might look 
                        like two girls. Clyde sometimes 
                        wears a lady’s wig. 

           McNabb shows his neglected teeth in an amused smile.

                        He done got ya’ll chasing your own 
                        tails, don’t he?

                                 FRANK
                        Son, if you’re being truthful you 
                        finish out your term in a nice, 
                        civilized federal pen.

           McNabb draws on his smoke, nods slightly to the mirror.

                                 FRANK
                        But you do wrong by me, you’ll be 
                        back on the farm, breakin’ rocks, 
                        and gettin’ your teeth stove in.  

           Frank leaves a coin on the bar. Manny sidles up, and the two 
           start for the door.

                                 FRANK
                        What took you so long?

                                 MANNY
                        There’s a fella in the toilet.

           EXT. WEST DALLAS -- DAY

           Frank leans on a fence, looking through cracks into the 
           backyard of an impoverished house. We hear AN ENGINE and he 
           looks up as A CAR drives by two streets over. But then keeps 
           going.

           INT. HAMER FORD

           Where Manny watches the Parker house. He watches A WOMAN walk 
           up to the house carrying a make-up case. Manny looks at the 
           file in his lap, then up at the woman as she’s greeted by 
           Bonnie’s mother... 

                                 MANNY
                        Hello, Blanche...

           He hears LAUGHTER and looks to where a group of kids are 
           playing in the dirt with the celebrity white rabbit.  

                                 MANNY
                        Half a mind to shoot that damned 
                        bunny.

           The SOUND OF A MOTOR draws his gaze back to--

           EXT. VACANT LOT -- WEST DALLAS -- DAY

           A CAR motors by, slows for a moment, then speeds away. An 
           empty Cola bottle is thrown out into a dooryard.

           And here he comes. That Jim Thorpe speedster in cap and 
           knickers. He hurries into the lot, grabs the bottle, and 
           struts quickly east.

           Manny gets out of the car and the Kid spots him. 

                                 KID
                        Hey, Granddad! Want to race?

           The Kid grins, wrinkling his freckled nose, and he breaks 
           into a sprint.

           DOWN THE SIDEWALK HE RUNS
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      84.

           Looking over his shoulder, and then -- a foot comes out from 
           nowhere and trips him at the ankle. The kid goes flying, the 
           bottle shatters on the walk.

           Frank walks over calmly and fishes the folded note from 
           shards of glass. The Kid looks up at him from the ground, 
           scared.

                                 MANNY
                        Didn’t your mama ever teach you to 
                        tie your shoes?

           Frank scans the note, sighs, hands it to Manny. 

                                 MANNY
                        “Headed for greener pastures.  See 
                        you next time around.”

                                 FRANK
                        Sonofabitch. McNabb.

           EXT. MCNABB’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 

           Its raining. Hamer’s Ford comes down the rutted dirt road, 
           bucking puddles and pot holes.

           They park and get out.  Manny checks the address.

                                 MANNY
                        This is it.

           Up the steps they go. Door is locked. 

                                 FRANK
                        McNabb!  Open the damn door!

           Frank kicks it in.

           INT. MCNABB’S HOUSE -- NIGHT 

           The two ex-Rangers enter the small home and see the crimson 
           wall paint right away, McNabb sprawled over a tipped chair in 
           the corner.

           Frank sees an empty whiskey bottle on a table, three glasses.  
           He picks up a glass, looks at the lipstick on the rim.

           Frank looks at the floor, lowers himself onto his haunches. 
           There is a baseball bat on the floor, and beside it a muddy 
           shoe print. 

                                 FRANK
                        Goddamned animals.

           He turns but Manny’s no longer in the house. 

           EXT. PORCH -- SAME

           Manny stands alone with his thoughts until Frank steps out.   

                                 MANNY
                        Did I get that boy killed?

                                 FRANK
                        No.

                                 MANNY
                        He’d have been out in nine months 
                        on his own.  That fella didn’t need 
                        to die. 

                                 FRANK
                        That fella made his own choices. 

           Manny watches Frank head for the car, then follows.

                                 MANNY
                        See, Frank, that’s the difference 
                        right there between you and me.  
                        You could always hide what you done 
                        behind some notion of Right and 
                        Wrong. Me, I never particularly 
                        liked the weight of decidin’ who 
                        gets to live and who doesn’t. 

           Frank stops, wheels on Manny.

                                 FRANK
                        Counting McNabb they’ve killed 
                        thirteen and people call them 
                        heroes, idolize ‘em and it has to 
                        stop!  It’s never easy and it’s 
                        never pretty and there’s always 
                        blood at the end of the road and 
                        you know that same as me!  

                                 MANNY
                        I seen a lot a blood, but it ain’t 
                        theirs. Or ours.

           They stand there in the rain considering each other.

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus, Manny, why in the hell did 
                        you come?

           Manny watches Frank get into the car.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      86.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- NIGHT

           Manny gets in after.  They’re both soaked. Finally...

                                 MANNY
                        I had to come.
                              (after a beat)
                        Though I don’t exactly know why 
                        that is.

           Frank considers this, nods.

                                 FRANK
                        We do what we do so they can sleep, 
                        Manny.  Everybody else.

           Frank considers his old friend and partner a moment, then 
           starts the car.

           INT. LEE SIMMONS OFFICE - DAY  

           Lee, on the phone.

                                 SIMMONS
                        It’s my name on that furlough, 
                        Frank.  It’s gonna look like we set 
                        McNabb up to be killed.  When Ma 
                        finds out she won’t be happy.  And 
                        I’m not sure I can protect 
                        myself... or you.  Come back to 
                        Austin and let’s see if we can sort 
                        this out.

           INT. DALLAS POLICE DEPT. - SAME - DAY  

           Frank, on a pay phone...

                                 FRANK
                        Yeah. 

           He hangs up, walks over to a bench where Manny sits with the 
           file.  They both look like shit.

                                 MANNY
                        Lemme guess, Lee’s giving us a 
                        raise.

           Frank smiles.

                                 FRANK
                        If you’re ready to go home I’ll 
                        drive you.

                        Take me to greener pastures.

           Manny reaches in his coat, holds up the note.

                                 MANNY
                        I’ll just buy a bottle and wait 
                        there for Clyde to show up. 

           Frank sits, ponders.

                                 FRANK
                        Does that mean anything, you think?
                              (off Manny’s look)
                        Is he headed for a state he hasn’t 
                        hit yet?

                                 MANNY
                        Could be.  Or maybe it’s just an 
                        old saying.

                                 FRANK
                        What states have warrants for him?

           Manny goes to the file.

                                 FRANK
                        Better still, what states don’t?

                                 MANNY
                        New Mexico.... Colorado...

                        Outlaws always go home.  Maybe 
                        we’ve just been looking at the 
                        wrong home.  Methvin, where’s he 
                        from?

           Manny finds the page, reads.

           Frank and Manny hustle out, files in hand.  Hinton approaches 
           opposite them.

                        Stay by the phone, Ted.

           They leave him standing, watching their exit.

           EXT. LOUISIANA BACK ROAD -- DAY

           A swamp mist so thick we could be in a rain forest. Spanish 
           moss hangs from cypress trees. Out of this humid fog, the 
           Hamer Ford appears, bug-coated and filthy. Cruising slowly.

           TITLE CARD:

           The Ford rolls past a Depression-era camp. OYSTER FARMERS, 
           HOBOS, and just PLAIN FOLK forced to live in tents and 
           resourceful shelters made from canvas and corrugated metal.

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING --  DAY

           Frank hasn’t slept in a while. But he maintains the wheel 
           while Manny, equally haggard, checks an address from the

                        Which one is he?

           Frank is careful not to go too slowly past the property.

                                 MANNY
                        Looks like him there.

           As Ivy turns the truck off the road, heads down a rutted

                        If they’re in there we’ll take them 
                        in the morning, before they wake 
                        up.

           INT. HAMER FORD - DAWN

           Manny tries to sleep, Frank’s on watch.  He taps Manny’s arm.  

                                 FRANK
                        It’s time.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      90.

           Their eyes go to --

           EXT. OLD MAN METHVYN’S HOUSE - DAWN

           Ivy Methvyn exits the door, gets in his truck and drives away 
           from the house. 

           A moment later Frank and Manny emerge from beyond the trees. 

           Frank gives Manny a nod.  Manny heads around back while Frank 
           makes his way to the front porch.  Frank peers through a 
           window, nothing, goes to the door, locked.  He jimmies it and 
           slowly opens the door.

           INT. HOUSE -- SAME

           Frank looks around - no one. He moves quietly through the 
           kitchen, also empty.

           INT. REAR OF THE HOUSE - SAME

           Manny slowly opens the door, looks around, gun in hand.  He 
           passes an empty bathroom, peers around a corner into a small 
           bedroom and sees an unmade bed.  Ivy’s dirty work clothes are 
           strewn about.

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Frank enters and sees Manny at the opposite end.  They share 
           a look - need to check upstairs.  They slowly, carefully pick 
           their way up the creaky stairs.

           UPSTAIRS LANDING

           A nice sitting table with chairs and a love seat.  A cut 
           flower sits in a bud vase.  Manny touches it, shares a look 
           with Frank - a woman’s touch. 

           Frank checks the bathroom - empty, but again, a woman’s been 
           here.  Lipstick, perfume, nail files.

           Frank and Manny move toward the bedroom door and try to 
           listen.  Nothing.  Frank slowly turns the knob - unlocked. 
           They share a look, take a breath and rush inside to find --

           INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - DAY  

           No one there.  Neat. The bed is made. 

           Frank moves to the closet, opens it up to reveal a rack of 
           clothes.  Frank pulls out a dress, holds it up. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      91.

                                 FRANK
                        They’re playin’ house.

           Frank reaches for a gangster suit, eyes it, tosses it on the 
           bed.  Manny sets the clothes side by side, as if Bonnie and 
           Clyde are lying before them.

                                 MANNY
                        She’s a bitty thing.

                                 FRANK
                        So’s he.

           They stand there considering the clothes a moment, then...

           Manny sees A HAIRBRUSH beside the bed, picks it up, sees some 
           of Bonnie’s hair in it, feels himself folding up, sits down 
           on the bed. 

                                 FRANK
                        Gault.

           Manny turns to him. 

                                 FRANK
                        You all right?

                                 MANNY
                        Yeah.

           EXT. ROAD -- HAMER FORD -- SAME

           Frank and Manny walk back to their car.

                                 MANNY
                        We can’t take ‘em without the local 
                        sheriff. 

                                 FRANK
                        What if he’s on the hand? A corrupt 
                        sheriff down this way ain’t exactly 
                        remarkable.

                                 MANNY
                        One way to find out.

           INT. BIENVILLE PARISH SHERIFF’S OFFICE -- DAY

           AN ALLIGATOR HEAD, jaws open and rows of sharp teeth.

           Manny Gault touches it where it sits on the desk of SHERIFF 
           HENDERSON JORDAN, a tall man in shirt and tie and white hat.  
           Jordan is clearly proud of the trophy head.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      92.

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                              (Cajun)
                        Alligata. My boy take him on a 
                        hunt, only eleven year old.

                                 MANNY
                        Hunt doves myself.

           Standing in the corner is Deputy PRENTIS OAKLEY, young, dark 
           and taciturn, watching the old man with suspicion.

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        So, where you see Clyde? On the 
                        north highway?

                                 MANNY
                        Seen him several places in your 
                        Parish, Sheriff Jordan. Down near 
                        the fishing camps.

           Jordan makes a note of this. Oakley just stares at Manny.

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        How you know it him?

                                 MANNY
                        My name’s Flavius Cole. I am the 
                        Barrow family parson.

           It gets real quiet in the small room. No one flinches. 
           Manny’s face holds a convincing and immutable gloom.

                                 MANNY
                        Nobody knows I’m here. You never 
                        saw me. The family is grateful to 
                        you because...the kids, they’re 
                        good kids, just got in over their 
                        heads. Word is there might be some 
                        heat on them down here. Now I know 
                        you never saw them, and never heard 
                        they was in your parish, and we’d 
                        like to keep it that way... 

           Manny reaches inside his jacket and removes an envelope. He 
           sets it on the desk near the alligator head.

                                 MANNY
                        Clyde has tried to show his 
                        appreciation to you, but the family 
                        would like to show theirs. Call it 
                        a contribution to the parish 
                        church. And I won’t take any more 
                        of your time.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      93.

           Manny rises, tips his brim to each man...then stops to take 
           one last look at that alligator head.

                                 MANNY
                        Your boy use a shotgun on that 
                        gator or...

           The next thing Manny knows is his chin is being pushed toward 
           the desk top and his arm is twisted behind him. Deputy Oakley 
           has him there, and now Sheriff Jordan has picked up a gator
           gaff, a nasty three-pronged hook, and he holds it ready.

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        He use a gaff, like ‘dis. 

           Deputy Oakley pulls Manny up.  Jordan gets right in his face.

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        Listen to me, Papere: I see these 
                        dogs in Bienville, I shoot them 
                        dead. You take your bribe and go 
                        home, or I shoot you ass, too. We 
                        are not crooks down here.

                                 MANNY
                        Then you’re the man we’re looking 
                        for.

           Manny opens his hand so that they can now see his BADGE.

           EXT. PARISH TENT CAMP -- DAY

           A BLACK MIGRANT WORKER walks through the camp. He approaches 
           Ivy Methvin, sitting in the heat, drinking something muddy 
           and strong. 

                                 MIGRANT WORKER
                        Hey, Ivy. Some men up there lookin’ 
                        for somebody to cut wood. 

           The Migrant points his chin indifferently toward the upper 
           camp.

                                 MIGRANT WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Told them you got your own truck. 
                        Say they’ll pay fair.

           Ivy looks that way, spits. He pulls his rubber boots on.

                                 MIGRANT WORKER (CONT’D)
                        You need more hands, me and my boy 
                        needs the work.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      94.

           EXT. RINGGOLD ROAD -- BIENVILLE PARISH, LA -- DAY

           Old Man Methvin drives his huge rattle-trap of a Model A 
           logging truck behind Hamer’s V-8 Ford. The car leads him down 
           a long gravel highway bordered on both sides by pine thicket. 
           Way out in the middle of nowhere.

           Finally, the Ford pulls over.

           INT. OLD MAN METHVIN’S TRUCK -- DAY

           The Old Man pulls over behind the car. At the same time, he 
           sees a police vehicle pulling in behind him.

           EXT. RINGGOLD ROAD -- DAY

           Old Man Methvin steps down from the truck, suspicious. Frank 
           and Manny get out of the Ford and approach him, casually.

           From the Police Vehicle, Sheriff Jordan and Deputy Oakley 
           step out.  

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        What in hell is this? 

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        I’m Sheriff Jordan. This is my 
                        deputy, Mr. Oakley.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                              (to Frank)
                        Who are you fellas?

                                 FRANK
                        Doesn’t concern you.

           Jordan and Oakley appear to be as on edge as Methvin.

                                 FRANK
                        All you need to know is that Bonnie 
                        and Clyde are going down hard, Mr. 
                        Methvin. If not by the gun, then by 
                        the chair. Your boy Henry is going 
                        with them.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        My boy didn’t kill no one.

                                 MANNY
                        Killed a highway patrolman near 
                        Grapevine, Texas. Have a witness, 
                        ballistics, the whole book.

                                 MANNY (cont'd)
                              (throws in)
                        Wire taps. 

           Old Man Methvin dips some snuff. Tucks it in his cheek. 

                                 FRANK
                        We know sooner or later they’ll be 
                        coming to see you. We’re going to 
                        give your son a chance to live.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        How? 

                                 FRANK
                        He’s going to have to put them on 
                        the spot. He does...we’ll put him 
                        on the ground, instead of in it.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        You mean let him go.

                                 FRANK
                        Next time Barrow and his girl come 
                        lay low, you get your boy alone and 
                        you tell him that when they get 
                        back on the road, he gets separated 
                        first chance he gets. They’ll come 
                        right back looking for him. 

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        And you’ll be waitin’.

           Frank lets Methvin answer that himself. The old man spits 
           snuff in the dirt. 

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        Clyde won’t be taken alive.

                                 MANNY
                        Neither will your boy, Sir. If he 
                        doesn’t take his one chance now. 

           Old Man Methvin thinks for a moment, then...

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        I like my house.

                                 FRANK
                        S’cuse me?

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        Clyde bought me that house. I don’t 
                        want y’all to shoot it up. There’s 
                        a place, Clyde gets his mail. 
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      96.

                                 MANNY
                        His mail?

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        Messages’n such.  Checks it often. 
                        I’ll tell you where it is, once my 
                        boy’s clear. And y’all can kill ‘em 
                        there.

           EXT. INN MOTEL -- SHREVEPORT, LOUISIANA -- NIGHT

           The drone of blowflies and cicadas outside a two dollar a 
           night flea-bagger. Frank’s battered Ford is parked before a 
           lit room. 

           Sitting alone on the porch is Frank. He has shaved and 
           cleaned up, wears his black suit and hat. He sits in a cane-
           bottomed rocker, smoking a rolled Durham, tense.  

           INT. INN MOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

           Smoke-filled. Five men sit around a table, playing poker in 
           taut silence.

           Manny, Sheriff Jordan, Deputy Oakley, and our two friends 
           from Dallas, Alcorn and Hinton. All of the men are wearing 
           business suits tonight (Hinton and Alcorn wear their sleek 
           30’s windbreakers over dress shirts and ties).

                                 DEPUTY OAKLEY
                        Look like we outnumbered by Texans, 
                        Henderson.

                                 MANNY
                        These Dallas boys the only ones who 
                        can make a positive identification. 

           Deputy Hinton looks down at his hand. He’s nervous. Manny 
           sees this.  

                                 DEPUTY ALCORN
                        Old Ivy said that their car is 
                        loaded with fire power. Machine 
                        guns, hand grenades, thousand round 
                        of shells. Said its like an armory 
                        on four wheels. 

                                 MANNY
                        Guess we’ll find out.

                                 SHERIFF
                        Gonna have us a hunt.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      97.

                                 DEPUTY OAKLEY
                        Gonna skin us some deer.

           They all laugh a nervous laugh, except for Ted. 

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Dang if I don’t have an Arkansas 
                        straight...

           Ted Hinton folds his hand.  

                                 SHERIFF JORDAN
                        Maybe we should put six bills in 
                        the pot, Homme, make it more 
                        interestin’.

                                 MANNY 
                        Cap don’t allow for no money in a 
                        game, nor drinking on Sundays.

                                 DEPUTY OAKLEY
                        Can’t be much fun.

                                 MANNY
                        There is a place for me in Heaven, 
                        I tell you that. 

           Manny shuffles and deals. 

                                 DEPUTY ALCORN
                        Where is he? 

                                 MANNY
                        Likes to be alone sometimes.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Sheriff Smoot said you and Hamer 
                        killed more’n fifty men between 
                        you.

           The others look at the old man. It’s hard to believe. 

                                 MANNY
                        Killed a lot more’n that. Killed 
                        more’n fifty in one evenin’.

           They stare at him. Manny sits there a moment, fiddles with 
           the cards.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        I didn’t mean to pry.
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      98.

                                 MANNY
                        It’s all right, Ted. I was young, 
                        younger’n you. South Texas, place 
                        called Candelaria, Ranger Company 
                        C. We had about sixty bandits 
                        pinned down in a dry wash. Bandits 
                        I say...
                              (shakes his head)
                        These fellas burned half a dozen 
                        ranches, some of the folks still 
                        inside. They’d killed a few dozen, 
                        raped just about as many.  

           Manny starts to lay the cards out...

                                 MANNY
                        Anyway, every time we rode in to 
                        take ‘em, we’d yell manos arribas, 
                        You know, hands up. But they’d fire 
                        on us and we’d lose a man. Went on 
                        like this for days. So they send 
                        down young Captain Hamer... my 
                        friend, Pancho. 

           Manny looks out the door at Frank sitting out there. 

                                 MANNY
                        Cap says “what all is going on down 
                        here?” and we say, “Well, every 
                        time we call out manos arribas like 
                        Ranger Law tells us to, these 
                        bandits open up on us.” Cap says 
                        “Well, we’re going down in there at 
                        nightfall... and this time don’t no-
                        damn-body yell manos arribas.” Just 
                        shoot ‘em. 

           The other men listen quietly, the sheriff smiling. 

                                 MANNY
                        That night them bandits were 
                        celebrating. Drunk, half of them 
                        asleep by the fire. We went in. 
                        Some of the boys refused to go. 
                        Refused to just start shooting men. 
                              (then)
                        But I went with Frank. He gave me 
                        the nod and we let ‘em have it. We 
                        shot that arroyo to hell before 
                        most of them fellas even woke up. I 
                        was jittery. A mule come out from 
                        behind a cactus and I shot the man 
                        half a dozen times. 
                                 (MORE)
                                    jlh   5/28/08                      99.

                                 MANNY (cont'd)
                              (looks at them all)
                        Turned out to be a thirteen-year-
                        old boy trying to run away.  I can 
                        still see his face.

           And now everybody’s eyes drop to the table. 

                                 MANNY
                        Whole thing was over in ten 
                        minutes. We counted fifty-four 
                        dead. And when we were done 
                        counting, Cap sat on a rock, 
                        holstered his gun and says, “manos
                        arribas, you sons a bitches.” 

           Manny looks at the men around the table, holds on Ted. 

                                 MANNY
                        We came back, the Governor gave us 
                        all medals. 

           EXT. MOTEL -- FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT

           Frank sits in the antique rocker, creaking slowly. He checks 
           his pocket watch, snaps it shut.

           Headlights slant across the porch now as a Model A truck 
           pulls in, crunching gravel. Old Man Methvin gets out. In his 
           rubber swamp boots and filthy clothes, he walks up the porch 
           steps, looks at the silent Frank Hamer.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN
                        My boy got free.  

           Hamer stops rocking.

           EXT. RINGGOLD ROAD -- BIENVILLE PARISH, LA -- SUNRISE

           The only road in and out of this swampy forest of southern 
           pine and big oaks. Smothering humidity.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN (V.O.)
                        Clyde’s post office is on Old 
                        Ringgold road.

           BEHIND A ROADSIDE BLIND

           constructed from vines and brush, the heavily-armed officers 
           wait. From left to right: Alcorn and Hinton, Sheriff Jordan, 
           Deputy Oakley, Manny Gault, and Frank Hamer in the 
           southernmost position.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      100.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN (V.O.)
                        There’s a rise in the road, so 
                        Bonnie can see who’s comin’... 

           Hinton smacks an insect off his leg. Mosquitoes and chiggers 
           eat at the men in suits as they wait in tense ambush.

                                 OLD MAN METHVIN (V.O.)
                        Clyde pulls up right there, walks 
                        to a stump where folks leave him 
                        messages.  

           EXT. MOTEL -- FRONT PORCH -- NIGHT

           Frank thinks a moment, then...

                                 FRANK
                        You gonna have to be there, too.

           EXT. RINGGOLD ROAD -- SUNRISE

           Old Man Methvin’s truck is parked facing northeast. A tire 
           has been removed and set in the road. The old man himself 
           waits there as decoy, crow bar in hand.

           Frank sticks a piece of paper in the stump then casts his 
           eyes up the road toward the hill.

           ACROSS THE ROAD

           Sheriff Jordan and Oakley chop brush, making a blind while 
           Alcorn and Hinton carry armloads of weapons to the hiding 
           spot.   

                                 MANNY
                        Ted....

           Manny waves Ted over for a private chat.

                                 MANNY
                        Ted, we need you to identify these 
                        two, but nobody said nuthin’ about 
                        you pulling a trigger.  Which means 
                        you don’t have to.
                              (off Ted’s look)
                        ‘Cause once you do....

           Ted takes this in, considering, then...

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        I’ll be alright.

           Manny nods, sees Frank approaching from across the road.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      101.

                                 FRANK
                        Whey they get here y’all stay in 
                        the blind.  I’ll present myself.  
                        You fire on my command.

                                 MANNY
                        We stay in the blind?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s an order, Gault.

                                 MANNY
                        And you walk out there?

                                 FRANK
                        They get their fair warning.  

           Manny takes this in, nods.  Not like Candelaria.

           EXT. BLIND - LATER - DAY 

           Deerflies fill the silence, incessant buzzing about the men’s 
           hats. They’ve been out here a while, lined up in a row behind 
           the bushes.  

           Frank looks over at Manny who wipes sweat from his brow, but 
           seems calm.  

                                 FRANK
                        Manny.

           Manny turns to him. 

                                 FRANK
                        For the record... you only move 
                        like you’re seventy-five.
                              (off Manny’s smile)
                        The reason I passed by your house 
                        was because I wanted to spare you 
                        this.
                              (after a beat)
                        That said, I’m real glad you’re 
                        here.

                                 MANNY
                        Me, too, Pancho.  Me, too.

           Frank’s expression changes.

                                 FRANK
                              (quiet)
                        They’re coming.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      102.

           No one can hear anything, they look down the road - nothing.  
           But when they see Manny prepare his machine rifle they do the 
           same. 

           The sound rises distant. What at first sounds like a deer fly 
           downshifts into the distinctive hum of an engine revving to 
           high speed. Like a twister coming out of the swamps.

                                 MANNY
                        Ford V-8. 

           Frank slips the safety on his Colt to the “fire” position. 

           ON THE ROAD

           Old Man Methvin stands by his supposedly disabled truck, 
           looking up the road. The sound of an approaching engine hums 
           at 85 horsepower, a powerful V-8 at high speed. 

           Old Man Methvin looks up toward the blind where Frank waits, 
           calm and patient. 

                                 FRANK
                        Ted.

           At the far right of the blind, Deputy Hinton lifts field 
           glasses to his eyes and makes a study of the distance as the 
           still unseen auto gets within a thousand yards, and then 
           becomes visible at a crest in the road.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        It’s him. It’s Clyde. 
                              (then)
                        Bonnie’s beside him. In red.

           FRANK’S POV -- THROUGH VINES AND COVER:

           A Cordoba Gray 1934 Ford Model 730 Deluxe...slowing its 
           approach and entering into the opposite lane to pull 
           alongside Old Man Methvin’s logging truck. It idles.

                                 CLYDE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Ivy. Where’s--

           The Old Man freezes.  His eyes widen toward--

           FRANK COMING OUT OF THE BLIND

           into the middle of the gravel road, Colt Monitor raised in 
           position. Only several yards from the gangster car, he can
           see them through the windshield. 

           For the first time Frank sees them point-blank:
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      103.

           CLYDE BARROW, Fedora canted low. Greasy hair, jug-eared. Bad 
           teeth.

           23 year-old BONNIE PARKER in red dress and stylish red hat, 
           eating a sandwich. Her eyes are painted heavy in Maybelline
           and her reddish brow over-plucked, giving her the garish 
           pallor of a vampire waif dressed like a silent screen star. 
           Her nails are painted. She, too, has cleaned up, prettied 
           herself for this day. She turns her head and looks right at 
           Frank Hamer.

           BONNIE PARKER’S POV: A man, almost mythic in preacher black, 
           rifle in hand. Hat brim low.

                                 FRANK
                              (actual words)
                        Stick ‘em up!

           TIME SLOWS and most sound drops. Just a hushed wind in the 
           cane brakes. 

           FRANK’S SILENT POV: 

           Clyde looks right at him. IN SLOW MOTION, two seconds seem an 
           infinite nightmare. Bonnie lets go of her sandwich...it 
           falls...

           CLYDE’S SILENT POV: 

           Frank Hamer staring back at him, then meeting Bonnie’s eyes.

           Bonnie almost smiles then, then produces a .20 Gauge sawed-
           off like a magic trick, it almost seems to come from under 
           her dress as... 

           FRANK watches her, his finger on the trigger.  His eye blinks 
           and  --

           MANNY  

           Charges out of the blind, defying orders, and --

           RESUME SPEED

           FIRES --

           CLYDE raises his machine gun and --

           FRANK blasts away.

           GUNSHOTS -- IMPLODE the windshield just as Bonnie “screams 
           like a panther.” Clyde’s head snaps back as his Chicago 
           Fedora is blown off his head.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      104.

           Somehow, through it all, Clyde keeps driving in low gear. 
           Right at Frank.

           FROM THE BLIND - Oakley, Jordan, Alcorn, and Ted Hinton all 
           OPEN FIRE, steel-jacketed bullets punching through the 
           immaculate gray Ford. ONE ROAR OF SOUND.

           IN THE ROAD -- FRANK UNLOADS HIS 20 ROUND CLIP into the 
           oncoming car, but it drives on, unsteadily, tires digging 
           into gravel. Perhaps it is true: they are simply unstoppable.

           MANNY empties his clip, drops the weapon, raises another, 
           fires again, again --

           FROM THE BLIND -- Ted Hinton has emptied his Browning machine 
           gun and now he stares, awed. Even hopeful maybe.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Gettin’ away...they gettin’ away...

           Frank FIRES another round, but it is obvious now that the car 
           has no direction; Clyde’s foot must have released the clutch 
           when shot. The Ford rolls to a stop in a ditch, stalls. 

           Frank starts toward the punctured vehicle, lowering his heavy 
           rifle and now unholstering Old Lucky. He walks steadily over 
           broken glass toward the motionless car.  Manny right behind 
           him.

           The other lawmen spill down into the road, ears ringing.

           Frank keeps walking, right up to the vehicle. But all is 
           still as death. 

           And then -- from the passenger seat -- Bonnie’s head lurches 
           forward suddenly. Manny FIRES into the window. Two shots, 
           three, four -- emptying his pistol into the car. 

           He stands there, spent, realizes Frank is staring at him.  

           The other lawmen surround the destroyed vehicle, cautiously. 
           As they move in, it is clear that the young killers are dead. 

           Frank lets a breath escape as his gun hand lowers. Manny 
           looks at the destroyed car.

                                 MANNY
                        Manos arribas.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      105.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- ARCADIA, LOUISIANA -- DAY

           The population of Bienville Parish has tripled to 6,000 
           PEOPLE as they crowd the street in morbid awe and fascination 
           to see a closed chapter in American history. 

           A tow truck pulls the bullet-riddled Ford through the crowd, 
           followed by a procession of police cars and citizen’s 
           vehicles.

           IN FRONT OF CONGER’S FURNITURE STORE

           The tow truck comes to rest and the CROWD SURGES at the death 
           car as FLASHBULBS pop in percussive frenzy.

           SCHOOL CHILDREN climb onto the running boards to gawk in at 
           Bonnie Parker’s body. A WOMAN in a summer dress and pretty 
           straw hat fights her way in to see. Her hands reach into the 
           death car and try to daub at Bonnie and Clyde’s blood with a 
           handkerchief. Someone snags the gas cap.

           A MAN is trying to cut off Clyde’s trigger finger, but when 
           COPS thwart the effort, he tries to slice off one of the 
           corpse’s ears. Someone grabs his smashed sunglasses.

           The THRONG intensifies as POLICE try to control them. 

           Ted Hinton, shaken, watches with Alcorn, shakes his head.

                                 DEPUTY HINTON
                        Look at that.  We made ‘em more 
                        famous than ever.

           CONGERS STORE WINDOW

           We see REFLECTIONS of the mob frenzy and then see Manny and 
           Frank standing behind the window, watching.

           INSIDE THE STORE

           Frank and Manny look out at the sick display, their faces 
           revealing exactly how revolting this is to them.  We stay on 
           them for an extended beat, then Frank’s eyes find the ground.

           A LOCAL REPORTER walks over.

                                 LOCAL REPORTER
                        Mr. Hamer, there’s a fella on the 
                        phone from the Associated Press in 
                        New York.  Says he’ll give you a 
                        thousand dollars for a phone 
                        interview.
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      106.

           Frank and Manny share a look, then slowly rise to leave.

                                 LOCAL REPORTER
                        Mr. Hamer?...

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- ARCADIA, LOUISIANA -- DAY

           Hinton, Oakley and Alcorn all pose for pictures as Frank and 
           Manny exit the store and walk away from the crowd, unnoticed.  
           We stay with them until they are alone, the mob scene 
           continuing behind them.

           EXT. GOVERNOR’S MANSION -- DAY

           REPORTERS with box cameras flashing. A CROWD presses at the 
           grand steps. All are cramming in on a conflicted Ma Fergusen 
           who has to speak above the CROWD NOISE.

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        I knew Hamer and Gault would get 
                        the job done. 

           Just behind her is Agent Quinn, looking exhausted, but well-
           dressed in a Cagney coat and fedora.

                                 MA FERGUSEN
                        That’s why I chose ‘em. Bottom 
                        line.

           EXT. MAIN STREET -- ARCADIA, LOUISIANA -- DAY

           Frank and Manny drive out of town as we now...

           DISSOLVE TO: THE BARROW CAR

           Folks crowded around the Ford, jumping and jockeying for 
           position. Everyone trying to get a peek at the two dead 
           bandits. 

                                 RADIO (V.O.)
                        The Nation has been freed from the 
                        worst killing rampage in its 
                        history... 

           INT. HAMER FORD -- DRIVING -- LATE DAY

           Frank and Manny sit there, tired, unable to speak.  

                                 CAR RADIO (V.O.)
                        Retribution has been served and J. 
                        Edgar Hoover has issued a formal--
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      107.

           Manny shuts it off. The two just ride in silence. Frank pulls 
           the car to the side of the road.  Manny gives him a puzzled 
           look.

           EXT. HAMER FORD -- ROAD HOME -- LATE DAY

           The Ford sits on the shoulder.  Frank and Manny get out of 
           the car and exchange places.  Manny gets behind the wheel and 
           a moment later the car lays rubber down the road, finally 
           disappearing into the dusty horizon.  

           EXT. MANNY’S HOMESTEAD -- DAY

           As the Hamer Ford turns down the drive, stops at the “For 
           Sale” sign. Manny gets out of the driver’s seat. Frank sleeps 
           soundly in the passenger seat.  

           Manny opens the trunk, takes out his bag. Frank, now awake, 
           steps out.

                                 MANNY
                        You wanna come in, say hello?

                                 FRANK
                        No, I’ve got a long drive, but... 
                        thank you.

           Frank offers a hand, Manny takes it, looks him in the eye.

                                 FRANK
                        Just saying.

           Manny looks at the house as now his daughter and son-in-law 
           come out along with a few neighbors. 

           His Grandson, Nate runs up and hugs him around the waist.  As 
           Manny and Nate walk toward the house, the boy takes his hand.  
           Manny takes a few more steps, then stops, turns to --

                                 MANNY
                        Frank...

           Frank, now behind the wheel, looking back.

           The two men exchange brief but knowing nods before Frank then 
           backs the car out of the drive. Manny stands there a moment, 
           watching him go, then finally walks with Nate and greets the 
           rest of the family. 

           EXT. HAMER HOME -- DAY

           Frank pulls up to the house, remains in the battered car a 
           moment. No one’s about. 
                                   jlh   5/28/08                      108.

           He finally gets out, slowly walks to the house. He looks back 
           at the car, covered with dirt, dents everywhere, and takes a 
           deep breath before going into the house. 

           INT. HAMER HOME -- SAME

           Frank sets his bag down.  

                                 FRANK
                        Gladys?

           No answer. He moves through the house to the kitchen in the 
           rear.

           THE KITCHEN

           He walks in, looks at the radio, now silent.  Walks to the 
           window and smiles, staring out at --

           IN THE BACK YARD

           Gladys stands near the water’s edge, back to us, Frank’s 
           javelina Porky rubbing against her leg.  She reaches down 
           with one hand and scruffs his head lovingly.

           FRANK

           Watches for a moment more, then smiles and --

           THROUGH THE WINDOW

           Frank walks through the back yard, down to Gladys.  Just as 
           she turns --

                                                           FADE TO BLACK.
