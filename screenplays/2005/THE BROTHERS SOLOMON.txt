           OVER CREDITS: Hot water pours out of a shower head. A razor 
           is dragged across a cheek. Teeth are flossed. A band-aid is 
           applied to a scab. A shirt is buttoned. A shoe is tied.  

           CU -- A note tacked to a wall: “Patricia 8:00, 2984 Patterson 
           Lane.”  A hand grabs it. Pan over to a framed photo of two 
           young boys hanging on the wall.

                        I’m leaving.  

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Good luck on your date! 

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                        Good luck on your date! I love you!

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        I love you too!

           EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

           An average looking man, DEAN, 27, stands at the front door 
           with flowers. He takes a deep breath and nervously knocks on 
           the door. PATRICIA, 27, pretty, answers it.  

                                 PATRICIA
                        Hi. Dean?

                                 DEAN
                        Hi. Nice to meet you.  

           They awkwardly shake hands.  He hands her the flowers.  

                                 PATRICIA
                        Oh, how sweet. Come in.

           INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

           Dean waits nervously in the foyer. Patricia enters with her 
           father, DONALD, 65.

                                 PATRICIA
                        Dean, I’d like you to meet my Dad.

           Donald extends his hand to Dean.

           Slo-mo:  Dean’s head arches in toward Donald’s.

           Shot of Donald, frozen in his tracks.
           CU slo-mo:  Dean’s head, eyes closed, continuing to move 
           toward Donald.

           Shot of Donald, frozen.

           Slo-mo shot of Dean’s head as it inches closer.

           Shot of Patricia, jaw dropped.

           CU -- Donald’s face, still frozen. Dean’s face moves into 
           frame and delivers a soft peck on the Donald’s lips. As Dean 
           pulls back, a tiny strand of saliva unites their mouths. They 
           stand in silence for a while.

                                 DEAN
                        Nice to meet you sir.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           A beautiful FEMALE SHOPPER stands at the cash register as a 
           CHECKER rings up the last of her groceries.

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        Can I write a check?

                                 CHECKER
                        That won’t be necessary ma’am.

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        What do you mean?

                                 CHECKER
                        They’ve already been taken care of.

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        Taken care of? By who?

           The checker motions to JOHN SOLOMON -- 29, average looking, 
           Dean’s brother. John leans coolly against a Doritos display.

           CU -- John’s face with a sultry smile. He gives an ultra-cool-
           guy nod to the shopper.

           ART CARD:  John Solomon 

           John slowly saunters over to the counter.

                                 JOHN
                        I watched you at work in here and I 
                        must say I’m more than impressed.
                           (extending his hand)
                        John.
                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        Thank you, but I can’t accept this.

                                 JOHN
                        Can’t accept what? Your own 
                        groceries? These are yours. I don’t 
                        own them. The only thing I own 
                        right now is the good fortune of 
                        coming in contact with such an 
                        obviously well rounded and fun 
                        person. Can I walk you to your car?

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        No. Thank you.

                                 JOHN
                        Can I get that phone number?

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t mean to be rude but I just 
                        bought your frigging groceries.

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        I don’t care what you did. You 
                        cannot have my phone number.

                                 JOHN
                        You know what? Request withdrawn. 
                        Will you give me your address so I 
                        can meet you at your house?

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        Look, if you don’t leave me alone, 
                        I’m gonna call security and have 
                        them kick you out of here.

                                 JOHN
                        That’ll be pretty hard to do 
                        because I’m a taxpayer and 
                        therefore I can stand wherever I 
                        want. Taxpayers have a right to 
                        stand wherever they want.

                                 FEMALE SHOPPER
                        Security!

                                 JOHN
                        I’m telling you you’re making a big 
                        deal out of nothing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN(cont'd)
                        They’ll come over, ask me if I’m a 
                        taxpayer, I’ll say yes, end of 
                        story.

           INT. GROCERY STORE SECURITY STATION -- NIGHT 

           There is a door marked “Vons Security Headquarters.” A tiny 
           square window looks into the small, spare room. Through the 
           window, we see John sitting there, detained.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 

           John sits on the couch watching TV. Their 2-bedroom place is 
           large but full of unrealized potential. Dean enters.

                                 JOHN
                        How was your date?

                                 DEAN
                        Not so great.

                                 JOHN
                        Oooooh, come here.

           John opens his arms in a hug invitation. Dean accepts.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Wanna talk about it?

                                 DEAN
                        Well, everything seemed to be going 
                        great. And then when I went in for 
                        the kiss, he got very stand-offish. 
                        Very cold.  

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, I’m sorry.  

                                 DEAN
                        Do you think I did something wrong?

                                 JOHN
                        Wrong? By expressing the greatest 
                        respect you could show a woman’s 
                        father? No, that could never be 
                        wrong. Hey, what’s up with you?

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t know. It’s just I look 
                        around at people our age and 
                        everyone’s all successful and 
                        married and having kids and... 
                        when’s it our turn?
                                 JOHN 
                        Dean, our time will come. 

                                 DEAN 
                        Yeah, I guess. So did you go to the 
                        store?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, spent like two hundred bucks.

                                 DEAN
                        And? Get any numbers? 

                                 JOHN
                        No, but I did get thrown in store 
                        jail.

                                 DEAN
                        What?  

                                 JOHN
                        Apparently in the store’s eyes, I 
                        was “bothering” the customers.

                                 DEAN
                        Did they know you’re current on 
                        your taxes?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, they knew. 

                                 DEAN
                        And they still locked you up? Well, 
                        I’m sorry.  

                                 JOHN
                        There’s nothing to be sorry about.  
                        I did the best job I could of being 
                        me today. And that’s all I can do.

                                 DEAN
                        I love learning from you.

                                 JOHN
                        I love teaching you.  

           Dean goes to the answering machine and presses play.

                                 JOHN
                        I thought you paid that.

                                 DEAN
                        I did.

                        Ah, open your mind.

                                 JOHN
                        I can’t. It’s too busy computing 
                        what the goddamn time is!

                        some bad news. Devastating news 
                        actually. I’m uh...

                                 JOHN
                        Oh my God.

           Dean and John rush out of the apartment.  

           EXT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT COMPLEX -- NIGHT

           The brothers race from the parking garage in their ‘93 Supra.

           INT. VIDEO STORE -- NIGHT

           Dean and John rush to the rental line. A VIDEO STORE CLERK is 
           busy with a CUSTOMER and there’s a FEMALE CUSTOMER in front 
           of them in line. They shift impatiently as they wait.

                                 JOHN
                           (exasperated)
                        Excuse me, ma’am. We just found out 
                        our father is dealing with some 
                        heavy medical issues -- possibly 
                        dying --so we need to dispute this 
                        late charge as quickly as possible. 
                        Would you mind?

                        Go ahead.

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Thank you./Thanks.

           They switch places and shift impatiently. When the clerk is 
           finally available, they rush to the counter.

                                 DEAN
                        Hi, we just got a call about some 
                        late charges for “Ulee’s Gold” but 
                        we paid the charges already.

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        Okay, what’s your last name?

                                 JOHN
                        Look, we don’t have time for this.  
                        Our father is... Solomon. SOLOMON!

           As they shift impatiently, the clerk clicks at a keyboard.

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        Computer shows you’re all paid up.
                                 JOHN
                        Okay, thank you, thanks.

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        ...in fact, says here you actually 
                        have a credit for one movie.

           John and Dean look to one another, intrigued.

           EXT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT

           The brothers squeal into a parking place and race inside.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

           ED SOLOMON -- 60s -- lies in bed, comatose. Dean and John 
           hover over him as they listen to DR. WONG.

                                 DR. WONG
                        He seemed to be doing fine and then 
                        like ten minutes ago he lapsed into 
                        the coma. 

           Dean and John look to each other, guilty.

                                 DR. WONG (cont’d) 
                        Not even ten minutes -- more like 
                        seven. Or even six.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, we got here as soon as we 
                        could.

           Dean hides a copy of “Oxford Blues” behind his back.

                                 DEAN 
                        How long does he have?

                                 DR. WONG 
                        Normally, a man in his condition, 
                        three to six months. But you just 
                        never know.

                                 JOHN
                        Man. How was he coping with it?

                                 DR. WONG
                        Like most, he was lamenting some of 
                        the things he never got a chance to 
                        see and do in his lifetime.  

                                 DEAN
                        Like what?
                                 DR. WONG
                        Climbing Mt. Everest. Taking flying 
                        lessons. Other things.

                                 JOHN
                        What things?

                                 DR. WONG
                        Oh, some things he wanted to do to 
                        the nursing staff that I’m not 
                        comfortable getting into.  

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        Dad!/We’re so sorry.

                                 DR. WONG
                        It’s okay, they’re very attractive.  
                        Well, one of them. Anyway the thing 
                        your father kept coming back to --
                        his biggest regret by far -- was 
                        that neither of you ever made him a 
                        grandchild. 

                                 JOHN 
                        We’re a little behind on that one.

                                 DEAN
                        Was he mad at us?

                                 DR. WONG
                        More disappointed than mad.

                                 JOHN 
                        Well, that’s not a huge surprise. 
                        We’ve always been disappointments. 
                        See our Dad’s always had this weird 
                        obsession with accomplishments and 
                        following through on tasks and it 
                        never really rubbed off on us. So 
                        in his eyes, we’re kind of losers.

                                 DR. WONG
                        He mentioned that.

                                 DEAN
                        He did?

                                 DR. WONG 
                        Yeah, but in a nice way. Like, uh, 
                        I forget how he put it exactly. You 
                        know, if you’d been here even just 
                        like five minutes earlier, you 
                        could’ve heard it with your own...
                                 JOHN 
                        Yes, we’re aware of the timeline. 
                        Thank you.

                                 DOCTOR WONG
                        I’ll give you some time alone.

           Dr. Wong leaves. John and Dean go to their father’s bedside.

                                 DEAN
                        Hi Dad. How you feeling? You’re 
                        lookin’ good. If I didn’t already 
                        know you were in a coma, I’d think 
                        you were just a healthy guy in a 
                        sound sleep. Don’t you think, John?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, sure.

           John kisses his father and then walks to the window.

                                 DEAN 
                        Too bad there aren’t like coma 
                        pageants. Right, John? John?

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry, I’m just thinking about what 
                        Dr. Wong said.

                                 DEAN
                        John, Dad would have wanted us to 
                        dispute that charge. Right Dad?

                                 JOHN
                        Not that. The grandchild thing.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, it’s too bad.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not too bad. It’s great.

                                 DEAN 
                        Dad’s gonna dirt nap with a huge 
                        regret and you think it’s great?

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t you see? We know his dying 
                        wish and we have a shot to make it 
                        come true while he’s still alive.
                                 DEAN
                        But he only has like six months 
                        left.

                                 JOHN
                        No, Dr. Wong said that you never 
                        know. And if we give Dad something 
                        to live for, who knows how long 
                        he’ll last? Look, we have a chance 
                        here to accomplish something 
                        important for once. A chance to 
                        finally prove to Dad -- hell, prove 
                        to ourselves -- that we’re not just 
                        a couple of losers. And all we have 
                        to do is make him a baby.

                                 DEAN 
                        That’s it, we just make him a baby?

                                 JOHN
                        Make him a baby. Piece of cake.

                                 DEAN 
                        Can I play devil’s advocate here 
                        for a sec? Basically my entire 
                        adult life has been an attempt to 
                        have sex and over that span, I’ve 
                        been successful twice. Twice! And 
                        one I had to pay for. And the other 
                        technically I didn’t pay for, but 
                        it definitely involved a transfer 
                        of goods. Whatever. All I’m saying 
                        is I don’t think we can do this.

                                 JOHN
                        And I know that we can. This is 
                        different.

                                 DEAN
                        Why?

                                 JOHN
                        Because before, we were entering 
                        women for ourselves. This time, 
                        we’re entering them for Dad. Hands 
                        in!

           John puts his hand out. Won over, Dean puts his hand on it. 
           John grabs Dad’s hand and puts it on top, but it immediately 
           slides off. John grabs it again and holds it there.  

                                 JOHN (cont’d) (CONT’D)
                        Make a baby for Dad on 3. 1 2 3...
                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Make a baby for Dad!

           They throw their hands up. Dad’s hand falls to the bed.

                                 JOHN/DEAN (cont’d)
                        Let’s go./Let’s do it!

           John and Dean race out.

           MUSIC IN: “ST. ELMO’S FIRE” BY JOHN PARR

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Quick shots of John and Dean going through their pre-date 
           rituals. John shaving. Dean brushing his teeth. John trimming 
           nose hairs. Dean shampooing his hair. John rinsing off in the 
           shower. Dean finally ready to rinse, he moves toward the 
           shower head to reveal he’s in the same shower as John -- he 
           nudges in and they split the water stream. John combing his 
           hair. Dean buttoning his shirt. John looking in the mirror. 
           He’s ready. Dean looking in the mirror. He’s ready.

           “ST. ELMO’S FIRE” OUT.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John walks out. Dean is sitting on the couch.

                                 DEAN
                        You look great. She’s gonna love 
                        you.

                                 JOHN
                        You don’t look so bad yourself. Why 
                        are you all spiffed up anyway?

                                 DEAN
                        Because we’re doing this thing 
                        together. So when you’re on a date, 
                        even though I’m not there 
                        physically, I’m on that date too. 
                        And I want to look presentable.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s a great mindset.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, feel free to borrow it.

                                 JOHN
                        I might just take you up on that. 
                        Okay, wish me luck.
                                 DEAN
                        I would, but from where I’m 
                        sitting, looks like you won’t need 
                        luck. You go bring us back a baby.

                                 JOHN
                           (cocky smile)
                        I’ll do my best.

           INT. DINER -- NIGHT

           John sits across from MICHELE -- 20s, pretty face. There’s an 
           awkward silence. John smiles at her. Michele forces a smile 
           back. John smiles again. Michele looks at her watch.

                                 JOHN 
                        So do you like TV?

                                 MICHELE
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                           (sexy)
                        Hm. Against the grain. Jah-jah 
                        likes that.

                                 MICHELE
                        Who’s Jah-jah?

                                 JOHN
                        Me. John.
                           (very long awkward beat)
                        You got a little something right... 

           John reaches across and softly picks something off her lip.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        ... here. Got it.

           John brings his finger back and sensually licks it.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Mm. Little piece of chicken.

           He smiles seductively. Another awkward silence.  

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        You’ve got a nice face.

                                 MICHELE
                        Thanks.
                                 JOHN
                        Makes up for that bod.

                                 MICHELE
                        What?

                                 JOHN
                        No no no no. I’m just saying...your 
                        face...makes...up for...your body.
                           (long awkward beat)
                        You wouldn’t happen to be ovulating 
                        right now, would you?

                                 MICHELE
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m about to make it my business.

           John gets down on one knee and produces a ring.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Michele, make me the happiest man 
                        in the world and marry me.  

                                 MICHELE
                        Are you joking?

                                 JOHN
                        I know, isn’t it great?

                                 MICHELE
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        Then make me the happiest man in 
                        the world and let me put a baby 
                        inside of you.

           Michele throws her napkin down and stomps out.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Yeah, good idea. Take some time and 
                        let it sink in. I love you.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Dean watches TV as John comes back from his date.

                                 DEAN
                        So how’d it go?
                                 JOHN
                        Not great. But not horrible. It was 
                        a good learning experience. 

                                 DEAN 
                           (fake nonchalance)
                        So any advice I can use on my...
                           (genuine excitement)
                        ...date tomorrow night?

                                 JOHN
                        No way! You frigging tiger. How’d 
                        you meet her?

                                 DEAN 
                        Cold call.

                                 JOHN
                        Cold call? 

                                 DEAN
                        Just dialed until I found a taker.  
                        But she sounds real hot. Real hot.

                                 JOHN
                        She has to be! Nicely done broham.  
                        And yes, I do have some advice --
                        skip the marriage proposal and go 
                        straight to the baby.    

                                 DEAN
                        You sure?

                                 JOHN 
                        Positive. To women, proposing 
                        marriage is like proposing to jail 
                        them. They want freedom. And what 
                        says freedom better than bringing a 
                        child into the world with a 
                        stranger? It’s every woman’s dream!  
                        A no-strings-attached paradise.

                                 DEAN 
                        How the hell do you know women so 
                        well? You’re like a human 
                        Cosmopolitan magazine.  

                                 JOHN
                        Thank you. Any word from Dr. Wong?

                                 DEAN
                        No, he hasn’t called back yet.
                                 JOHN 
                        I don’t know. I just don’t have a 
                        good feeling about that hospital.  

                                 DEAN
                        I know. Dad deserves better than 
                        that crappy little shithole.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, what if we use some money from 
                        Mom’s fund to move him out of that 
                        shithole?

                                 DEAN
                        Do we have enough left in there?

                                 JOHN
                        I bet so. I mean, we’re not talking 
                        about the Ritz, just a nice, clean 
                        place a little closer to us where 
                        we know he’d be cared for properly. 

                                 DEAN 
                        Like where?

                                 JOHN
                        Look, don’t you worry about a 
                        thing. I’ll deal with it tomorrow.   

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Dean opens the door to find a DELIVERY GUY. A patch on his 
           uniform says: “Med-Equip - the Hi-Tech Home Care Specialists”

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        Yeah, delivery for John Solomon.

                                 DEAN
                        He’s not here right now.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        I’m gonna need you to sign here.

           Dean signs his name on the clipboard.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY (cont’d)
                        Okay, bring it on in.

           Med-Equip WORKERS start lugging in various medical machines.  

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Pan the room to see all kinds of medical equipment.
                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        And this is a dialysis machine.  
                        You know, for the kidney.

                                 DEAN
                        Mm hm.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        And defibrillator paddles in case 
                        the EKG shows a flatline. 

                                 DEAN
                        Mm hm.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        You’ve seen guys use ‘em on TV.
                           (demonstrating on Dean)
                        Just rub ‘em together, press ‘em 
                        against the guy’s chest and whammo -
                        - the heart should get going again.

                                 DEAN
                        Mm hm.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        There’s more stuff to know for 
                        that. You should probably take a 
                        class.

                                 DEAN
                        M’kay.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        And here are some coagulants, some 
                        anticoagulants, couple bedpans. 
                        And, of course, one Mr. Ed Solomon.

           Reveal a MED-EQUIP MOVER rolling comatose Dad in on a gurney. 

                                 DEAN
                        M’kay.

                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        And here’s a ventilator, oxy tank, 
                        couple intubation trays -- your 
                        nurse can hook those up if you need 
                        ‘em. You do have a nurse, right?

                                 DEAN 
                           (dazed)
                        M’kay.

           Dean stands there overwhelmed as the Med-Equip guy goes on.
                                 MED-EQUIP GUY
                        Hm... okay. Well, over here you got 
                        your sterile needles, pulse 
                        oximeter, blood pressure cuff... 

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT LOBBY -- DAY

           John runs to catch the elevator as the doors are closing. 
           He’s carrying a Barnes and Noble bag and a big mylar balloon 
           that says: “Welcome Home Dad.”

                                 JOHN
                        Hold the elevator please.  

           The door opens. John enters to find the most beautiful woman 
           he’s ever seen. He smiles and then reaches for the “12” 
           button but sees it’s already lit.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Oh, are you visiting someone on 12?

                                 WOMAN
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        Just gonna check it out, stroll it?

                                 WOMAN
                        No, I live there.

                                 JOHN
                        You do not. You absolutely do not.  
                        Where on 12?

                                 WOMAN
                        12G.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m 12H. That’s great! You’re right 
                        across the hall from me. And here 
                        we are meeting on the elevator. 
                        That’s really something.  

                                 WOMAN
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        Ever like to go have drinks to 
                        unwind after a long day?

                                 WOMAN
                        No.
                                 JOHN
                        Nor do I.

           They stand in silence until the door opens and they exit.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           As they walk to their doors which are only about three feet 
           apart, John notices a cacophony of mechanical beeps and 
           chirps coming from his apartment. As he opens the door, the 
           beeps pour into the hallway. It’s like the Star Trek bridge.  

                                 JOHN 
                        There usually are a lot less 
                        beeping noises coming from my 
                        apartment.

           The woman nods politely and goes inside.  

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John enters to see his dad surrounded by blinking machinery.  
           Dean is in the kitchen pouring a can of soup into a bowl.

                                 JOHN
                        He’s here!

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah. Thanks for telling me.

                                 JOHN
                        I thought it would be a nice 
                        surprise. God, why do I even try?

                                 DEAN
                        It is a nice surprise. But I have 
                        some medical and fiscal concerns.

                                 JOHN
                        What? What could be better than 
                        having Dad right here in the bosom 
                        of his family?

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, I dunno, maybe having him at a 
                        place with a trained medical staff?

                                 JOHN
                        You think so inside the box. Dad’ll 
                        get so much more attention and care 
                        here than at some medical shithole.
                                 DEAN
                        You think?

                                 JOHN
                        I more than think. I really think. 
                        This is state of the art equipment. 
                        Yes it came out of the factory with 
                        a few kinks. But in the world of 
                        medical machinery, kinks equal 
                        savings. 

                                 DEAN 
                        But don’t kinks also equal machines 
                        that don’t work?

                                 JOHN
                        Why are you so negative? Look, 
                        they’ve all been repaired so 
                        they’re good as new... for the most 
                        part. And they’re all still under 
                        warranty... for the most part. I 
                        also got tons of medical books 
                        highly recommended by Dr. Wang.

                                 DEAN 
                        You mean, Dr. Wong.

                                 JOHN
                        No, Dr. Wang, this dentist I met at 
                        Barnes and Noble. He really knows 
                        his shit.

                                 DEAN
                        Okay, medically, you got me. I’m on 
                        board. Hit me fiscally.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, fiscally. So I had a little 
                        talk with Mr. Hefflin today...

                                 DEAN
                        Our accountant, yes, go on.

                                 JOHN
                        And he said that financially we can 
                        handle it. Although it’ll deplete 
                        our trust fund to the extent that 
                        at some point in the future, we may 
                        be looking at getting some jobs.

           Dean stares at John. They ponder this for a beat.
                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Buck up, cowboy. We’ll cross that 
                        bridge when we get to it.
                           (changing the subject)
                        Oh God, I have something so 
                        exciting to tell you about.
                           (motioning to their Dad)
                        Wait, is there any way to turn him 
                        down or anything?  

                                 DEAN 
                        I tried earlier, but there doesn’t 
                        seem to be any volume switch on 
                        him. At least that I can find.

                                 JOHN
                        Did they leave any instruction 
                        manuals or anything?

                                 DEAN
                        I looked in there, but there was 
                        nothing having to do with volume.  
                        It was mainly like emergency crap.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, it’s very distracting. Anyway 
                        I just met the most beautiful woman 
                        I’ve ever seen and you won’t 
                        believe where she lives. 12G!

                                 DEAN
                        12G? No way!  

                                 JOHN
                        You gotta see her. She’s amazing. 
                        Tall, buxom, infectious spirit...

           Dean places the soup bowl in the microwave and hits the power 
           button. Suddenly the lights go out. The machines whir to a 
           stop. 

                                 DEAN 
                        Oh crap! You go hit the circuit 
                        breaker. I’ll revive Dad.

           Complete darkness. We hear movement. Soon thereafter, the 
           lights turn on and the machines come to life. Dean hits his 
           Dad with the defibrillator paddles until he gets a heartbeat.  

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        I got him back.
                                 JOHN
                        Nice job. I guess we were using too 
                        much power. Maybe we should turn 
                        off some lights.

           Dean and John go around the room turning off lights.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        We should be fine now.

           John switches on the TV.  Dean returns to the kitchen.

                                 DEAN
                        Think it’s safe to use the microwa--

           Again the lights go out and the machines whir to a stop.  

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        My bad. I got the circuit breaker!

           Again, we hear movement in the dark until the power comes 
           back on. This time, John revives Dad with the paddles.  

                                 JOHN
                        We’re gonna have to do something 
                        about this. I mean, at some point, 
                        we’re gonna be in a situation where 
                        it’s imperative to heat up soup and 
                        watch TV at the same time.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah. Okay, I gotta get ready for 
                        my date. Oh hey, any luck today? 

                                 JOHN
                        No. But I think my luck might have 
                        just changed in that elevator.

                                 DEAN
                        12G? Are you gonna ask her out?

                                 JOHN
                        You worry about you, I’ll worry 
                        about me. Now let’s go get this guy 
                        a baby!

           INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

           Dean sits at a candlelit table.

                                 DEAN
                        I gotta be honest, I’m really 
                        feeling a connection here Erica. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEAN(cont'd)
                        I mean, you’re beautiful. 
                        Impeccable dresser. Great 
                        personality. Nice hair. Fat. Great 
                        smile. Smell good.

           Reveal ERICA, 20s, quite large. She’s not sure how to feel.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Have you ever heard of the phrase 
                        “more cushion for the pushin’?” 

                                 ERICA
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 DEAN
                        Because you’ve got it lady. Here, 
                        lift up your napkin for a sec.

           Erica reluctantly lifts her napkin to expose her lap area.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Yep, you’ve got it. There it is. 
                        What do you say we get the hell out 
                        of here and I go put a baby in you?  

                                 ERICA
                        Well...

                                 DEAN 
                        No strings attached.

                                 ERICA
                        Oh, okay.

                                 DEAN
                        HIV status?

                                 ERICA
                        Negative.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           An romantic picnic dinner is spread out between 12G and 12H.  
           John lights a candle, grabs a rose and knocks on 12G.

                                 12G WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Be right there.

           As John waits for her to answer the door, another guy walks 
           up to the door and knocks on it. John looks over to the guy.
                                 JOHN
                        Hi.

           The guy nods hello. The door opens. The woman sees the guy.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Ken! Hi.
                           (to John, less excited)
                        Hi. Can I help you?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, just thought I’d invite you 
                        to a little romantic hallway 
                        dinner. This is for you.

           He hands her the rose. She’s weirded out.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Well, we have dinner reservations.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh. Okay. Well, I do this all the 
                        time. So... the next one.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Yeah. Okay, we should go.

           The woman and Ken walk to the elevator and wait for it to 
           arrive. There’s an uncomfortable silence.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry, do you mind if I start?  
                        I am so hungry.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Go ahead.

                                 JOHN
                        Thank you.

           John sits down Indian-style and unfolds his napkin.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        So where are you guys going?

                                 KEN
                        Madame Wu’s.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, by the car wash, right?

           John nonchalantly pops open a bottle of champagne. 
                                 KEN
                        Yeah.

           John pours a glass of champagne and raises it for a toast.

                                 JOHN 
                        Well, have a great time.

           John takes a sip as they smile fakely. The elevator still 
           hasn’t come. Another sip. Still no elevator. John lifts the 
           bottle and reads the label.  Finally the elevator comes.  

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Good night.

           They fake smile. The elevator closes. John takes another sip.

           EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

           Dean and Erica walk down the street.

                                 ERICA
                        You have no idea how long I’ve been 
                        wanting to have a baby like this. I 
                        mean, this is a dream-come-true -- 
                        a no-strings-attached situation in 
                        which I can carry a baby to term, 
                        have it and then give it to a pair 
                        of wonderful people. Awesome. Oh, 
                        I’m gonna deliver this baby to you 
                        on a silver platter. One hundred 
                        percent sterling silv--

           Suddenly, Erica is FLATTENED BY A PASSING BUS.

                                 DEAN
                        Nooooooooooooooooooo! 

           EXT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

           John and Dean dangle their legs in the rooftop spa.  

                                 JOHN
                        She got hit by a bus? Poor girl.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, the bus took a pretty serious 
                        hit too. I mean, she was a large 
                        girl. Comfortably in the 200’s.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh my God, that’s horrible.
                                 DEAN
                        Not really. She carried it well.  
                        It was evenly distributed over... 

                                 JOHN
                        No, I’m talking about her dying.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah... it was awful. So then we 
                        went together to the hospital where 
                        they confirmed it and then to the 
                        morgue and that’s where I’d say the 
                        date “officially” ended. That was 
                        like our doorstep moment. And no, 
                        there was no good night kiss. So 
                        how was your night? I saw the 
                        makings of a very romantic dinner.

                                 JOHN 
                        Unfortunately I dined solo. But I’m 
                        not giving up just yet. There’s a 
                        lot more fight in this old bulldog.

                                 DEAN
                        That’s the spirit. God, this thing 
                        is gonna be harder than we thought.

                                 JOHN
                        Unfortunately, you might be right. 
                        Maybe it’s time we broaden the 
                        search to include less conventional 
                        methods of having a baby.

                                 DEAN
                        Like anal?  

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I was thinking more along the 
                        lines of adoption.

                                 DEAN
                        Isn’t adoption kind of cheating?

                                 JOHN
                        Have you seen Dad lately? He 
                        doesn’t look so good.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        We just gotta step it up. And that 
                        means exploring every possibility. 
                                 DEAN 
                        So I guess anal’s still in the mix.

                                 JOHN
                        Whatever it takes.

           INT. ADOPTION AGENCY -- DAY

           Dean and John sit in a couple of chairs. A representative of 
           the adoption agency, JIM TREACHER, sits behind the desk.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        Adoption is a huge committment.  

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, we’re ready.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        So are you married or just a long-
                        term couple?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh we’re not gay. We’re brothers.
                           (to Dean)
                        I told you not to wear that blouse.

                                 DEAN
                        It’s not a blouse, it’s a shirt.

                                 JOHN
                        It gives off a blousy impression.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        And who will have custody?

                                 JOHN
                        We’re gonna tag team it.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        I’m afraid that’s not an option. 
                        Unless you’re married, only one of 
                        you can have legal custody.

                                 JOHN
                        I guess that would be Dean then. 
                           (immediately to Dean)
                        Burn.

                                 DEAN
                        Wait, can we have a moment?

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        Sure.
           Dean leads John to the corner of the room. They whisper so 
           loudly that Treacher can hear every word.

                                 DEAN
                        Well thanks a lot.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re welcome.

                                 DEAN
                        I was being facetious. I do not 
                        want this responsibility. You’d be 
                        so much better at this than me.

                                 JOHN
                        What? I’m gonna be a horrible 
                        father. Much worse than you. Come 
                        on, what are you so nervous about?

                                 DEAN
                        What happens if the kid just sucks?

                                 JOHN
                        We return it.

                                 DEAN
                        Really?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes. Don’t worry, it’s not gonna be 
                        a lot of responsibility. He has to 
                        say that to cover his ass.

                                 DEAN
                        If that’s the case, then why don’t 
                        you just do it?

                                 JOHN
                        I have bad credit.

                                 DEAN
                        So?

                                 JOHN
                        So that’s one of the main criteria 
                        for adoption.

                                 DEAN
                        Bullshit.

                                 JOHN
                        Ask him.
                                 DEAN
                        Fine I will.

           Dean walks over to Treacher.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Two questions. One: what is your 
                        return policy? And two: will bad 
                        credit fuck our chances to adopt?

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        There is no return policy. And your 
                        financial situation is of paramount 
                        importance.

           Dean nods politely and returns to John. 

                                 JOHN
                        Ha! Told you so.

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t care. I’m not gonna do it.

                                 JOHN
                        Then I guess we have a stalemate. 
                        Looks like we’ll 1 2 3 NOT IT!

                                 DEAN
                        NOT IT. Damn!

           The brothers return to their seats.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                           (forced enthusiasm)
                        So I will be adopting the child. 
                        And I am very excited about it. 
                        It’s been my lifelong dream to be 
                        an adoptive parent.

                                 JOHN
                        You got any pictures of the kids?

           John sees a picture of a baby boy on Jim Treacher’s desk.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Oo, how ‘bout that one, Dean?

                                 DEAN
                        Ew, no. He’s got like Bell’s Palsy 
                        or something.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        That’s my son.
                                 DEAN 
                        Oh, I’m so sorry. Bell’s Palsy is 
                        the clinical name, right?

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        He’s not handicapped.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s right, it’s handi-capable.

                                 JIM TREACHER
                        No, he’s...

                                 DEAN
                        Disabled?

           EXT. ADOPTION AGENCY -- DAY

           A SECURITY GUARD throws John and Dean out of the building.

           INT. MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION -- DAY

           HAL MARSH, 57, sits at a desk, a Make-A-Wish sign behind him.

                                 HAL 
                        I’m afraid I can’t help you. See, 
                        we don’t run a prostitution ring.  
                        We can’t procure women for sex. 

                                 JOHN
                        This has nothing to do with 
                        procuring a woman for sex. This is 
                        about procuring a woman for sex 
                        which would produce a baby.

                                 HAL
                        The fact that sex is involved in 
                        any kind of way is a problem.

                                 DEAN
                        You know, you should change your 
                        name to the Make-A-Wish-and-if-it’s-
                        not-too-much-trouble-for-us-we’ll-

                        go-against-company-policy-or-cause-
                        us-to-do-any-work Foundation.  

                                 HAL
                        There’s nothing I can do for you.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, this isn’t for us. This is for 
                        our... dying father.
           John removes a picture from his pants pocket and holds it up.

                                 HAL
                        Your father is Kirk Douglas?

           John flips the pic over. Reveal that it is Kirk Douglas.  

                                 JOHN
                        Uh... no.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, that’s mine. Sorry, I borrowed 
                        your pants.

           EXT. MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION -- DAY

           Dean and John are escorted out by ANOTHER SECURITY GUARD.

           INT. BIG BROTHERS OF AMERICA CORPORATE OFFICE -- DAY

           John and Dean sit next to a “Big Brothers of America” sign.

                                 JOHN
                        So let me tell you what we’re 
                        looking for in a little brother. 
                        From most desired to least desired. 
                        Number one: a white of any variety.  
                        Two: an albino black or albino 
                        latino. Three: a lightskinned black 
                        or latino. Four: regular latino. 
                        Five: dark skinned latino. Six: 
                        regular black. Seven: dark skinned 
                        black. Actually a dark skinned 
                        black is not gonna work for us in 
                        any way. I notice you’re not 
                        writing any of this down...  

           Reveal an older black man, DONALD, sitting across from them.  

                                 DONALD
                        I think I’ll be able to remember.

                                 DEAN
                        Okay, well, when in doubt, 
                        remember, the lighter, the better.

                                 JOHN
                        And the younger, the better.  
                        Preferably a baby. You don’t 
                        harvest fetuses, do you?

           Donald gets up from his chair and walks out of the room.
                                 DEAN 
                        I think this is going very very 
                        very very very very very...

           EXT. BIG BROTHERS OF AMERICA -- MOMENTS LATER

           The brothers are again escorted out by a SECURITY GUARD.

                                 DEAN
                        That’s odd. I thought that was 
                        going very very very very very...

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           The brothers arrive at their door to find a package for Dean.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John watches TV. Dean enters in a full-body sequin suit.

                                 JOHN
                        Wow, you look like the real deal.  

                                 DEAN
                        Thank you.

                                 JOHN
                        Wasn’t a compliment. So why’d you 
                        get that thing anyway?

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t know. I saw it on Craig’s 
                        List and I thought what the hell?

                                 JOHN 
                        Craig’s List? What’s Craig’s List?

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, it’s great! It’s this website 
                        that has like everything: jobs, 
                        pets, cars, ice dancing suits. I 
                        mean, you can find anything there.

                                 JOHN
                        Anything?

           Dean and John look at each other. Their eyes widen.

           INT. JOHN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

           John sits at the computer. Dean stands behind him.
                                 JOHN
                        You’re the Craig’s List guy. What 
                        should we put?

                                 DEAN
                        Two brothers looking to have baby--

           John types it in and waits for more. He looks to Dean.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        --thank you.

                                 JOHN 
                        Hm, kind of bare bones, but if you 
                        like it, I can get behind it.  
                           (typing it in)
                        Thank you. And send.

                                 DEAN
                        So what do we do now?

                                 JOHN 
                        Now we just sit here and wait.

           They wait for a few beats looking at each other, nodding.

                                 DEAN
                        Is right now an appropriate time 
                        for internet porn?  

                                 JOHN
                        It’s certainly not an inappropriate 
                        time for...

           Suddenly, the power goes out.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        MOTHERFU--

           EXT. GENERATOR STORE -- DAY

           John lugs a generator out of the store.

           INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR -- DAY

           John lugs the generator into the elevator to find the woman 
           from 12G.

                                 JOHN 
                        We gotta stop meeting like this.  
                        People are starting to talk.
                           (smarmy laugh)
                        I’m just kidding.
           The woman hits the “door open” button.  The door opens.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        I, uh... forgot my mail.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, I’ll hold the elevator for you.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Please don’t.

           The door closes. John looks down at the button panel.

           CU -- the “door open” button

           CU -- John’s eyes. They narrow seductively.

           John leans down, puts his nose up to the button and takes a 
           deep whiff.  He’s in ecstacy.  

                                 JOHN
                        Mmmmmm.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John lugs the generator inside.  

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                        John, is that you! Hurry! Get in 
                        here! Craig’s List came through!

           INT. DEAN’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

           John runs in to find Dean at the computer. 

                                 JOHN
                        We got a response?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, her name is Janine and she 
                        totally wants to do it. I mean, 
                        there’s one little catch.

                                 JOHN
                        I knew it. What’s the catch?

                                 DEAN
                        She wants ten thousand dollars.

                                 JOHN
                        Ten thousand dollars?  
                                 DEAN
                        There’s a huge demand for babies 
                        right now.  It’s a seller’s market.  

                                 JOHN
                        Okay. But why buy the cow when you 
                        can get the milk for free?... 
                        across the hall.  

                                 DEAN
                        No way!

                                 JOHN
                        Yes way! There’s something there. I 
                        don’t know if it’s love or just a 
                        really deep spiritual connection, 
                        but if you give me a little time...

                                 DEAN
                        A little time? Dad needs this now.

                                 JOHN
                        You’re right. Okay, let’s call her. 
                        But I may try a little negotiation.  

           John grabs the phone and dials. 

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Hello, Janine?... Hi, it’s John and 
                        Dean from Craig’s List... No, the 
                        baby. (to Dean) She bought a grill 
                        on there too. (into phone) So we’re 
                        very excited to have a baby with 
                        you... Well, we were thinking 
                        somewhere more in the twenty dollar 
                        range... Won’t budge off ten thou? 
                        What if I were to offer you eleven 
                        thou?... Ha, I knew it!... No no, 
                        we do not have a deal at eleven 
                        thou. I was merely making the point 
                        that you would budge from ten thou. 
                        So your case is shot... You’re 
                        holding firm at eleven now?  Then I 
                        counter with twenty-five dollars... 
                        Forty dollars... Fifty... Deal. 
                        Twelve thousand dollars it is... 
                        Okay great... bye.

           John hangs up the phone.

                                 DEAN
                        Twelve thousand dollars?
                                 JOHN
                        She brought her A-game. But who 
                        cares? Don’t you see what this 
                        means?

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        We’re gonna have a baby!

           John and Dean jump up and down in celebration.

                                 JOHN
                        She wants to meet us tonight so
                        we better get someone to watch Dad.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, I have just the guy.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Dean shows the video store clerk around the apartment.

                                 DEAN
                        And this is a dialysis machine. You 
                        know, for the kidney. 

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        M’kay.

                                 DEAN
                        And this is the... oh, I forget the 
                        name. The main thing is just make 
                        sure everything’s making noise at 
                        all times. If stuff’s not making 
                        noise, we got problems. Oh, and if 
                        you want to watch TV or something--

           Dean powers up the generator and shouts over it’s noisy buzz.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        -- JUST THROW ON THE GENERATOR AND 
                        YOU’LL HAVE PLENTY OF POWER.

                                 JOHN
                        CRAP, DEAN! WE’RE SUPER LATE! COME 
                        ON!

           Dean and John race out.  

           EXT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           The Supra squeals out of the garage and speeds away.
           INT. VIDEO STORE -- NIGHT

           John and Dean race inside.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, you check comedy and drama, 
                        I’ll hit action and foreign.  

           They split off and head for their respective assignments.  

           EXT. JANINE’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Dean and John race to Janine’s door. They collect themselves.  
           John raises his hand to knock on the door.

                                 JOHN
                        All right, here goes nothing. 

                                 DEAN
                        You certainly sunk your talons into 
                        the knocking duties pretty quickly.

                                 JOHN
                        What? You want to knock?

                                 DEAN 
                        Yeah, I do.

                                 JOHN
                        Looks like we have a stalemate 
                        then. And I think the only fair 
                        SHOTGUN! Looks like I’m knocking.

                                 DEAN
                        Shotgun is for cars!

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, so now you’re a shotgun expert?

                                 DEAN
                        I’m not claiming to be a shotgun 
                        expert. I’ve just never heard of 
                        using shotgun in a non-vehicular 
                        situation.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, so since you’ve never heard of 
                        it, it can’t exist? Tell me, have 
                        you ever heard of Anwar Sadat?

                                 DEAN
                        No.
                                 JOHN
                        Oh, so I guess he didn’t exist. I 
                        guess Egypt didn’t have anyone 
                        ruling them from 1970 to 1981. 

                                 DEAN
                        Do not use Egyptian history as a 
                        weapon! It belittles me and...

                                 JOHN
                        I’m knocking!

                                 JANINE
                        Door’s open.

           Dean and John turn to see JANINE -- attractive, late 20s.

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        Oh, okay./Thank you. 

           The brothers enter the apartment.

           INT. JANINE’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           Dean, John and Janine sit on the couch in silence. They smile 
           at each other.

                                 JOHN
                        Let me just start by saying how 
                        thrilled we are to be...

                                 JANINE
                        You got the money?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, sure. Here you go.

           John hands her the check. More silence. Then John stands up.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Okay, so I guess I’ll go first.

                                 DEAN
                        Wait, I want to go first.

                                 JOHN 
                        Look, relax. We’re both gonna get 
                        multiple shots here.

                                 JANINE
                        Uh, can I interrupt?
                                 JOHN
                        Oh sure, Janine. I’m so SHOTGUN!

                                 DEAN
                        Damn it!

                                 JANINE
                        What do you mean by multiple shots?

                                 JOHN
                        Well, egg fertilization is a 
                        quantity game. So our plan is to 
                        literally blanket your ovarian 
                        walls with sperm.

                                 DEAN
                        We’ll each make love to you until 
                        one of our seed sticks.

                                 JOHN
                        Not at the same time, of course.  
                        Taking turns.

                                 JANINE
                        Uh, guys?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, John then me then John then 
                        me then John then me...

                                 JANINE
                        Guys.

                                 JOHN
                        I literally cannot wait to feel 
                        myself inside of you.

                                 JANINE 
                        GUYS!

           Dean and John immediately shut up and look to her.

                                 JANINE (cont’d)
                        Okay, the only thing you’re gonna 
                        feel yourself inside of is a cold 
                        dixie cup.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, that certainly doesn’t make 
                        your vagina sound very appealing.
                                 JANINE
                        I’m not talking about my vagina, 
                        I’m talking about artificial 
                        insemination.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, I see. So a scientist gets to 
                        do all the fun stuff and we get 
                        stuck with the frigging bill. Hm, 
                        that sounds fair.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, Janine. We’re paying a lot of 
                        money here. Don’t we at least get a 
                        little something out of it?

                                 JANINE
                        Uh, yeah, you get a baby out of it.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s a good point.

                                 DEAN
                        I, uh... okay, okay. Yeah.

                                 JANINE
                        So I made an appointment at the 
                        sperm bank for tomorrow at 3:00.

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Awesome!/Good times.

           Suddenly, there’s a loud knock on the door.  

                                 DEEP ANGRY VOICE (O.S.)
                        Janine, what the hell’s going on in 
                        there? I heard guys.

                                 JOHN 
                        Who’s that?

                                 JANINE
                        It’s my ex-boyfriend, James.  
                           (calling out)
                        James, I’m busy with friends.

                                 JOHN
                           (calling out)
                        Hi James, I’m John.

                                 DEAN
                           (calling out)
                        And I’m Dean. Nice to meet you.
                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        Nice to meet you. What the hell are 
                        you assholes doing in there?

                                 JOHN
                        Uh, we were just, uh... working out 
                        the details of a plan in which 
                        Janine is gonna have our baby. 

                                 DEAN
                        Uh, yeah. We’re all very excited.

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        I’m excited just hearing about it.  
                        Hey, maybe sometime the three of us 
                        could get together and I’ll beat 
                        the living shit out of you guys.

                                 JANINE
                        James, what are you doing here? 
                        This is none of your business. 

                                 JAMES (O.S.)
                        I was walking the neighborhood, saw 
                        some lights on. Come on, let me in 
                        baby. We need to talk. Please!

                                 JANINE
                        Fine.

           Janine goes to the door.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, wait, can we vote on this?

                                 DEAN
                        I vote no.

                                 JOHN
                        No here too. Hm, the no’s have it.

           John grabs a fireplace poker for protection. Dean grabs a 
           magazine and rolls it into a hard cone. Janine opens the door 
           to reveal JAMES -- large, black, early 50s.  He’s wearing a 
           janitor jumpsuit and has clearly been crying.

                                 JANINE 
                        James, have you been crying? Poor 
                        thing. Let me get you some tissue.

           Janine exits, leaving the three men alone.  
                                 JAMES
                        So which one of you assholes is 
                        having a baby with my girl?

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        I am./I am.

           Dean and John look at each other and laugh.

                                 JOHN
                        Funny you should ask because we 
                        were just having a somewhat heated 
                        discussion about that.  

                                 DEAN
                        Heated is a bit of an 
                        understatement. More like World War 

           The brothers laugh again. James glares them into silence. 

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        So you’re a janitor?

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, so since I’m a black man, I 
                        must be a janitor? Goddamn racist 
                        stereotypers.

                                 DEAN
                        No, it’s just... you’re wearing a 
                        janitor outfit.

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, so a black man can’t walk into 
                        a thrift store and buy a janitor 
                        outfit that he finds comfortable?

                                 DEAN
                        No, he can. Especially a black man.

           Uncomfortable silence.

                                 JOHN
                        So what do you do?

                                 JAMES
                        I’m a janitor.

           Janine enters with some tissue and gives them to James.

                                 JAMES (cont’d)
                        Janine, why are you doing this?
                                 JANINE
                        I need the money, these guys need a 
                        baby. It’s as simple as that.  

                                 JAMES
                        Baby, you’re breaking my heart. 
                        Please don’t do this.  

           James breaks down sobbing. Janine cradles him in her arms. 

                                 JANINE
                        Oh James.  

                                 DEAN
                           (to John)
                        We should give them some space.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, good call.
                           (to James and Janine)
                        We’re gonna leave. You two deserve 
                        privacy. And we’ve got a big day 
                        ahead of us at the sperm bank.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, we’re gonna need all our 
                        energy for that trip to the...

                                 JAMES
                        Don’t you say sperm bank!

                                 DEAN
                        ...fluid... depository.

                                 JANINE
                        James, I think you should leave 
                        too. I need some time to think.

                                 JAMES
                        Fine, but please think about what 
                        you’re doing. For me. For us.

                                 DEAN
                        James, can we drop you off 
                        somewhere on our way home?

                                 JAMES
                        Oh, just because I’m a black man, I 
                        automatically don’t have a car?

                                 DEAN
                        No. It’s just that you said... 
                        Nothing. Sorry. Goodnight Janine.
           Dean and John head sheepishly for the door.

                                 JAMES
                        Hey assholes, I’ll take that ride.

           INT. CAR -- NIGHT

           John drives, Dean sits shotgun, James is in back, crying. The 
           brothers use nods as code for selected taboo phrases.

                                 DEAN
                        The more I think about our trip to 
                        the... (slow hinting nod) ...the 
                        more excited I get. I mean, I am so 
                        excited for... (slow nod) ...to 
                        have our... (nod)

                                 JOHN
                        Dean, I need you to promise me 
                        there’ll be no hanky panky tonight.  
                        We’re gonna need every drop of... 
                        (nod) ...we can muster for 
                        tomorrow’s trip to the... (nod)

                                 JAMES
                        If you guys don’t shut the hell up, 
                        I’m gonna beat the everliving... 
                        (nod) ...out of your goddamn... 
                        (nod). That’s my place right there.

                                 DEAN
                        That’s your house? It’s beautiful.

                                 JAMES
                        That surprises you, huh? I should 
                        live in the ghetto, right?

                                 JOHN
                        I think what Dean’s saying is that 
                        he’s surprised you have such a nice 
                        house because you’re a janitor. 

                                 DEAN
                        Bingo.

                                 JAMES
                        But you wouldn’t be as surprised if 
                        I was a white janitor.

                                 DEAN
                        Not as surp...

           John slams on the brakes hard.
                                 JOHN
                        Ah, I think I just nailed a cat.
                           (looking out window)
                        Yep, nailed it. Well James, great 
                        to meet you.

                                 DEAN
                        Certainly was.

           James takes one last angry look at them and exits the car.

                                 JOHN
                        Anyone wanna help clean up some 
                        deceased cat?

                                 DEAN
                        I thought you’d never ask.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           Dean and John walk out of the elevator. John’s sleeves are 
           rolled up and his hands are covered in cat blood.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll be in in a second. I got a 
                        little business to attend to.

           John nods his head in the direction of 12G.

                                 DEAN
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 JOHN
                        Ask if she wants to go in the spa.

                                 DEAN
                        The spa? You do know what hot spa 
                        water does to your sperm count?

                                 JOHN
                        Fine, so I’ll ask her if she wants 
                        to go near the spa.  

                                 DEAN
                        There you go. Good luck!

           As Dean enters the apartment, we hear the usual beeps plus 
           the generator and blaring TV. John takes a deep breath and 
           knocks on 12G.

                                 12G WOMAN (O.S.)
                        Just a minute.
           John notices that his bloody hands have left red splotches on 
           the door. He wipes the door with his sleeve, but this creates 
           more of a mess. As he works hard to clean the stain, another 
           hand enters frame and knocks on the door. John looks over to 
           see another guy, BRAD.

                                 JOHN
                        Hi.

           Brad nods. John furiously wipes some more. The door opens.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Brad!
                           (seeing John, unenthused)
                        What can I do for you?

                                 JOHN
                        Sorry, got a little cat blood on 
                        your door -- would you like to go 
                        near the spa with me?

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Brad and I already have plans. 

                                 JOHN
                        What happened to Ken?

                                 12G WOMAN
                           (embarrassed)
                        Come in, Brad.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, good...
                           (door closes in face)
                        ...night.  

           John turns to his door and then turns back and knocks again 
           at 12G. In the process, he creates another little bloody 
           area. He starts rubbing at that as the door opens.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Yeah?

                                 JOHN
                        I just realized that I’ve never 
                        gotten your name.

                                 12G WOMAN
                        Tara.

                                 JOHN
                        John. Nice to officially meet you.
           John extends his hand but remembering the blood, extends his 
           elbow. Tara shuts the door. John is ecstatic.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John enters to find Dean showing the video store clerk how to 
           give a shot. The TV is on and the generator is buzzing.

                                 DEAN 
                        NOW LOCATE A GOOD VEIN AND JUST 
                        THROW IT IN THERE. 

           The video store clerk focuses intensely and moves his needle 
           toward the arm when just as he’s about to plunge it in...

                                 JOHN
                        HEY GUYS!

           ... he looks up, veering off course, stabbing Dad’s arm.

                                 DEAN
                        WHOA WHOA WHOA, GOTTA KEEP YOUR EYE 
                        ON IT. NOW GO AGAIN.
                           (to John)
                        HOW’D IT GO WITH 12G?

                                 JOHN
                        WHO? 12G? I DON’T KNOW ANYONE BY 
                        THAT NAME.

                                 DEAN
                        DON’T BE COY WITH ME.

                                 JOHN
                        OH, YOU MEAN, TARA?

                                 DEAN
                        YOU GOT HER NAME? THAT’S HUGE! SO 
                        YOU GUYS GOING NEAR THE SPA?

                                 JOHN
                        SHE’S HAVING DINNER WITH SOME DUDE.  

                                 DEAN
                        WELL, AT LEAST YOU GOT HER NAME.  

                                 JOHN
                        YEAH, ONE STEP AT A TIME.
                           (to clerk)
                        POTENTIAL GIRLFRIEND STUFF.
                           (then, to both)
                        HEY, EITHER OF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA 
                        HOW TO REMOVE CAT BLOOD STAINS?
                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        YEAH. BAKING SODA. IT’LL REMOVE THE 
                        SHIT OUT OF THAT THING.

                                 JOHN
                        BAKING SODA ON TOUGH STAINS? I 
                        NEVER KNEW THAT.

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        YEAH, MOST PEOPLE DON’T. SEE, THE 
                        BAKING SODA PEOPLE LIKE TO FLY 
                        UNDER THE RADAR. BUT IT’S SO 
                        AMAZING. IT’S GOT SO MANY USES -- 
                        BAKING OBVIOUSLY, ODOR EATING, 
                        TOOTH CLEANING, BLOOD REMOVING, 
                        ETCETERA. BUT FOR ONCE, HERE’S A 
                        PRODUCT THAT DOESN’T HAVE TO BRAG 
                        ABOUT IT’S USEFULNESS. THEY HAVE 
                        THE CONFIDENCE TO SAY, “HEY, HERE 
                        WE ARE, BAKING SODA. DO WE CLAIM TO 
                        DO OTHER STUFF? SURE... IF YOU ASK 
                        US. BUT ARE WE GONNA SHOVE IT IN 
                        YOUR FACE? NO, WE’RE NOT.”

                                 JOHN
                        THINK IT WOULD WORK ON A DOOR?

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        OH YEAH. WELL, I BETTER GO. MIND IF 
                        I TAKE THE NEEDLE HOME TO PRACTICE?

                                 JOHN/DEAN 
                        NO PROBLEM./TAKE A BUNCH.

           The clerk leaves. John and Dean go to their father’s bedside.

                                 DEAN
                        SHOULD WE TELL DAD THE GOOD NEWS?

                                 JOHN
                        NOT YET. I MEAN, HOW MANY TIMES 
                        HAVE WE TOLD HIM ABOUT ONE OF OUR 
                        LITTLE PLANS AND THEN HAD TO COME 
                        BACK AND TELL HIM WE BLEW IT.

                                 DEAN
                        BUT WE’RE GONNA COME THROUGH ON 
                        THIS ONE.

                                 JOHN
                        YEAH, WE ARE. BUT STILL, WE SHOULD 
                        WAIT. I JUST DON’T WANNA JINX IT.
                                 DEAN 
                        MAN, HE’S GONNA BE SO EXCITED.

           John nods. They gaze reflectively at their Dad for a while.

                                 JOHN 
                        OKAY, OFF TO BED. AND REMEMBER, 
                        HANDS ABOVE THE COVERS!

                                 DEAN
                        GOT IT.

           INT. FERTILIZATION CLINIC -- DAY

           A female CLINIC WORKER stands behind a counter.

                                 CLINIC WORKER
                        And when you’re done, leave the 
                        cups in the room and an attendant 
                        will be by to collect them.

           Dean and John inspect their cups. They seem pretty large.

                                 DEAN
                        We’re not expected to fill the 
                        whole thing, right?

                                 CLINIC WORKER
                        No, just do whatever you can do.

                                 DEAN
                        Good. I had kind of a big morning.

                                 JOHN
                        Dean! I thought we agreed to hold 
                        off until this afternoon.

                                 DEAN
                        I’m sorry. I found myself in a 
                        scenario in which sexy literature 
                        was present and I was weak.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, I hope for your sake that 
                        you’re multi-orgasmic.

                                 DEAN
                        I am. I swear. I am like the semen 
                        equivalent of the Energizer bunny.  
                        I mean, I can have so many...  

                                 JANINE
                        We get it.
                                 DEAN
                        Okay... okay.

           INT. FERTILIZATION CLINIC HALLWAY -- DAY 

           ***This entire scene takes place from the POV of the magazine 
           rack*** 

           The clinic worker leads the brothers by two doors in the 
           background.

                                 CLINIC WORKER
                        These are your rooms. 
                           (motioning to camera)
                        And over there is our selection of 
                        magazines. I’ll leave you two alone 
                        to make your decision.

           She exits. The brothers approach camera and inspect the 
           magazines on the rack. 

                                 JOHN
                        So what do we got? Looks like a 
                        breast theme there... and looks 
                        like kind of a general focus on the 
                        vagina in that one.

                                 DEAN
                        But there’s vaginal stuff in the 
                        breast one, right?

                                 JOHN
                        Sure, there’s a lot of crossover. 
                        Don’t worry, none of these are 
                        gonna give short shrift to the 
                        vagina. So where were we?

                                 DEAN
                        Uh, Jugg Junkies.

                                 JOHN
                        So breast, vaginal, teen vaginal, 
                        housewife anal, seniors vaginal...
                           (far right of rack)
                        Hm. Manhole magazine.

           John and Dean look at each other and laugh.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        You go ahead and take first pick.

                                 DEAN
                        Thanks, I’m gonna go with this one.
           Dean grabs the Manhole magazine.

                                 JOHN
                        Dean going with Manhole.

                                 DEAN
                        Gotcha! JK. I know that you 
                        probably want that one.

           Dean puts Manhole back and grabs another magazine.

                                 JOHN
                        Manhole is back in play. And as 
                        tempted as I am to take it, I’m 
                        gonna go with... this one.

           John grabs a magazine from the left side of the rack.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        All right, bomb’s away.

           Still from the POV of the magazine rack:  

           The brothers go to their respective rooms in the background 
           and shut their doors. Twenty seconds later, one of the doors 
           opens just a crack.  Dean pokes his head out and slowly opens 
           the door. He quietly tiptoes back to the magazine rack, grabs 
           the copy of Manhole and tiptoe-runs back to his room. Ten 
           seconds later, the other door opens a crack. John pokes his 
           head out, then slowly tiptoes to the magazine rack only to 
           find that Manhole is gone.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                           (whispering)
                        Shit!

           John slinks back to his room.

           INT. FERTILIZATION CLINIC LOBBY -- DAY

           Dean and Janine read magazines.  John enters.

                                 JANINE
                        Finally!  What took you so long?  
                        Dean was done like a half hour ago.

                                 JOHN
                        A half hour?

                                 DEAN 
                        I guess I was in the zone.  
                                 JOHN
                        You’re so much more efficient than 
                        I am.

                                 DEAN
                        That’s not true. You’re incredibly 
                        efficient.

                                 JOHN
                        I appreciate that.

                                 DEAN
                        I appreciate you.

           Janine shakes her head.

           INT. DR. SPENCER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           CHYRON: 3 Days Later

           Dean and John sit reading magazines.  Dr. Spencer enters.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Well, we finished the procedure.  
                        Janine is fine. And in about a 
                        week, we’ll know if it worked.

                                 JOHN
                        So whose sperm was used?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        We went in with your specimen, 
                        John...

                                 JOHN
                           (to Dean, super cocky)
                        Oh really.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        ...but unfortunately there was no 
                        motility in your sperm.

                                 JOHN
                        I’m sterile?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Basically.

                                 DEAN
                        Burn.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        So we went with Dean’s sperm.
                                 DEAN
                        Ha ha!

                                 JOHN
                        We’ll see who’s laughing when they 
                        spend zero dollars at the condom 
                        store.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh so I guess herpes and gonorrhea 
                        and AIDS aren’t a problem for you?  

                                 JOHN
                        Ah, suck it.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S CAR / EXT. JANINE’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Dean and John drive Janine home.

                                 JOHN  
                        No smoking, no caffeine, no intake 
                        of alcohol, no huffing glue, no 
                        sushi, no roller coasters, no 
                        springboard diving, no contact 
                        sports, no scary movies, no hanging 
                        around gas stations for too long...

                                 JANINE
                        What are you, the surgeon general?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m the guy who owns the baby that 
                        might be inside you and I’m just 
                        trying to protect my investment.

                                 JANINE
                        If I didn’t need this money so bad, 
                        I’d...

                                 JOHN
                        You’d what? 

                                 JANINE
                        Nothing.

                                 JOHN
                        So just be careful and know that at 
                        any time, we could be watching you.

                                 JANINE
                           (sarcastic)
                        Wow, you’re gonna be a great Dad.
                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I am.

           They pull up to Janine’s apartment to find James leaning 
           against a parked car with a bouquet of flowers.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh crap, is that James?

                                 JANINE
                        Relax, he’s not here for you. We’re 
                        trying to work things out.

                                 JOHN
                        You are?

                                 JANINE
                        Don’t worry, it won’t have any 
                        effect on your investment.

                                 JOHN
                        Promise?

                                 JANINE
                        Promise. God.

           Janine gets out of the car and walks to James who hands her 
           the flowers and gives her a hug. Dean and John drive away.

                                 DEAN
                        Don’t you think you were a little 
                        hard on her?

                                 JOHN
                        We don’t have the luxury of being 
                        soft right now. The stakes are too 
                        high. By the way, you said hard-on.

                                 DEAN
                        Good catch.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           CU -- Hallway carpet. We hear the sounds of abrasive 
           scrubbing and heavy breathing as we pan across a box of 
           baking soda and a bag of brillo pads and land on John’s feet.  
           Various sizes of paint scraps rain down on top of his shoes. 
           John takes a step back to admire his work.

                                 JOHN
                        Hm.
           Reveal that the door is a tattered mess. The blood stains are 
           gone, but so is forty percent of the door paint.

           EXT. JANINE’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John and Dean knock on Janine’s door. James opens it.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey, James. Where’s Janine?

                                 JAMES
                        She’s at Lake Go Fuck Yourself. You 
                        should grab your swim trunks and go 
                        check it out.

           James starts to shut the door. Just then, Janine walks out 
           from her bedroom.

                                 JANINE
                        Oh, hey guys.

                                 JAMES
                        Well, lookee there. Guess she’s 
                        back from the lake. You still might 
                        want to check it out.

                                 JANINE
                        I’ll call you after the 
                        appointment, honey.

           Janine gives James a hug and steps outside with the brothers. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Janine, can I say something before 
                        we leave? Look, I just want to 
                        apologize. I know I was a little 
                        hard on...

           CU -- Dean’s face. He smiles.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        ...you the other day. We’re just a 
                        little wound up. This is a big deal 
                        for us. It’s our first baby.

                                 JANINE
                        Well, it’s my first baby too. 

                                 JOHN
                        You’re right. I’m sorry. 
                                 JANINE
                        Look, I’m sorry too. I’m sure 
                        you’re gonna be a great father.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, you told me that already.

                                 JANINE
                        Yeah, but I was... never mind.

                                 JOHN
                        Anyway, I got you a little token of 
                        our appreciation.

                                 JANINE 
                        Oh, you didn’t have to do that.

           John hands her a little wrapped present. She opens it to 
           reveal a laminated list of his pregnancy do’s and don’ts:  No 
           Smoking, No Caffeine, No Alcohol, No Glue Huffing, etc.

                                 JOHN
                        It’s a laminated list of pregnancy 
                        do’s and don’ts. Do you like it?

                                 JANINE
                           (unexcited)
                        Yeah. Thanks.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, shall we?

           John, Dean and Janine leave for their appointment.

           INT. DR. SPENCER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           John, Dean and Janine wait patiently. Finally, Dr. Spencer 
           walks in with a folder and sits at his desk.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Well, I got your results and it 
                        looks like...

           EXT. HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS

           From outside of Dr. Spencer’s ground floor office, we see a 
           chair fly through the window. Glass flies everywhere.

                                 DEAN (O.S.)
                        Aaaaaaaaaah!
           INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

           The brothers walk to their door.

                                 DEAN 
                        I guess you just never know how 
                        you’re gonna react in that 
                        situation. I just got so excited.  
                        I mean, we’re gonna be Dads!

           The brothers get to their door and hear no noise from inside.

                                 JOHN 
                        Wait, why the hell is it so quiet?

           Their eyes widen.  They burst into the apartment.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

           They run in. 

                                 JOHN
                        You get the circuit breaker!

           Dean heads for the circuit breaker. John grabs the paddles 
           and gives a jolt to their father. He then notices something 
           strange: the EKG still functioning at a much lower volume.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Hey, I think this thing’s still on.
                           (inspecting machines)
                        Wait, looks like they’re all on, 
                        but they’re not making any noise.  

                                 DEAN
                        What the hell?

           SFX:  toilet flush.

           John’s bedroom door opens and out walks Tara.

                                 TARA
                        Oh, hey.

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                           (stunned)
                        Hi./Hey.

                                 TARA
                        Your friend had to go back to the 
                        video store so he asked me to watch 
                        your Dad. I hope you don’t mind, I 
                        turned down the machines.
                                 DEAN
                        They have volume switches?

                                 TARA
                        Inside the back-plates.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh.

           SFX:  Microwave beeps.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Oh crap, is the generator on?  The 
                        microwave shorts out the...

                                 TARA 
                        It’s fine. I rerouted the 
                        electricity.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh.

                                 TARA
                        Sorry, I kind of helped myself to 
                        some of your chili.

                                 JOHN
                           (super-serious)
                        Tara... our chili... is your chili.  
                        I mean that.

                                 TARA
                        Uh, thanks. Look, I hope you don’t 
                        take this the wrong way because I 
                        actually think it’s kind of sweet 
                        that you’re doing this. But do you 
                        guys know anything about vascular 
                        pumps or EKG’s or any of the 
                        equipment in here?

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        Oh much, much./Yes much, very much.

                                 TARA 
                        Hm, okay. Well, let me know if you 
                        ever need me to watch him again. 
                        I’m actually in a nursing program 
                        so it’s good practice.

                                 JOHN
                        We might just take you up on that.  
                        I mean that.
                                 TARA
                        Is it okay if I take the chili with 
                        me and bring back the bowl later?

                                 DEAN
                        Ah, just keep the bowl.

                                 JOHN
                        No, that bowl is ours. And you will 
                        bring it back. Understood?  

                                 TARA
                        Uh... okay. Bye.

           Tara grabs the bowl from the microwave and leaves.

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                           (whispering)
                        Ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod ohmygod!/
                        Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!

                                 DEAN
                        So what was with your bowl thing?

                                 JOHN
                        Why take away a reason for her to 
                        come over to our apartment? If she 
                        falls in love with this place, it’s 
                        only a matter of time before she 
                        falls in love with...
                           (motions to his face)
                        ...this place. And...
                           (motions to his heart)
                        ...this place.  

                                 DEAN
                        Brilliant. Of course she should 
                        return the chili bowl. 

                                 JOHN
                        So what do you say? Wanna tell Dad 
                        the good news?

           Dean nods excitedly. They go to their father’s bedside.

                                 DEAN 
                        Dad, we have some incredible news. 
                        You sitting down? Just kidding. 
                        Dad, you’ve always given us 
                        everything we ever wanted and in 
                        return, we’ve given you only 
                        disappointment and failure. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEAN(cont'd)
                        That is, until today. Dad, you’re 
                        gonna be a grandfather! 

           CU -- Dad’s emotionless comatose face.

                                 JOHN
                        So if you can just hang on for nine 
                        more months, we promise to make you 
                        as proud of us as we’ve always been 
                        of you. Hands in.

           With some assistance for Dad, they all put their hands in.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Baby on 3. 1 2 3...

           INT. BAR -- NIGHT

           Dean, John and Janine break from their own “hands in.”

                                 JOHN/DEAN/JANINE
                        ...BABY!

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, Janine, I wish you had seen his 
                        face. It was priceless.

                                 JANINE
                        It must be pretty hard to watch him 
                        go through this.  

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, it’s tough. We’re not used to 
                        seeing him so helpless. He was much 
                        more in control before the coma.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, he was a bona fide control 
                        freak. After our Mom died, he kept 
                        a pretty tight leash on us. But 
                        it’s understandable. We were all he 
                        had left. So we were home-schooled 
                        and kept out of sports and stuff. 
                        But it was a really healthy 
                        experience for both of us.

                                 DEAN 
                        Yeah, I mean, without that 
                        upbringing, we wouldn’t be who we 
                        are today.

                                 JANINE
                           (that explains it!)
                        Yeah.
                                 JOHN
                        Hey, anybody wanna dart it up?

                                 JANINE
                        You guys go ahead. I have to go to 
                        the ladies room.

           Janine heads to the bathroom. The guys head to the dartboard.

                                                  CUT TO:

           Janine comes out of the restroom to see the table empty. She 
           then sees something that makes her eyes widen. Reveal Dean 
           standing in profile, his head against a dartboard. John 
           flings a dart that lands about four inches from Dean’s nose.

                                 JOHN 
                        You owe me five dollars!

           Dean uses his fingers to measure the space between the dart 
           and his nose.

                                 DEAN
                        What? That’s not two inches! That’s 
                        like four!

                                 JANINE
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 JOHN
                        Nothing. Waiting for you.

                                 JANINE
                        Really? It looked to me like you 
                        were throwing darts at Dean’s face.

                                 JOHN
                        No no. I was specifically trying to 
                        miss Dean’s face. If I’d hit Dean’s 
                        face, I would owe him five dollars.

                                 DEAN
                        You still owe me five dollars. That 
                        was not within two inches of my 
                        nose.

                                 JOHN
                        That was definitely within...

                                 JANINE
                        Wait, hold on. You guys don’t see 
                        anything wrong with this?
           Dean and John look at each other and shrug.

                                 JANINE (cont’d)
                        Hey, in nine months you’re gonna be 
                        responsible for a little human. And 
                        it’s up to you to set an example.       

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Fine, no darts./Jeez louise.

                                 JANINE
                        You don’t get it. It’s not the 
                        darts, it’s everything. Look, I 
                        know how badly you want this, but 
                        wanting it badly isn’t enough. I 
                        mean, do you guys even know the 
                        first thing about raising a child? 
                        Have you ever read any books or 
                        done any research?

                                 JOHN
                        No. But I mean, did the cavemen 
                        read any books?  

                                 DEAN
                        He’s got a point.

                                 JANINE
                        The infant mortality rate back then 
                        was like eighty percent.

                                 DEAN
                        That’s pretty good.

                                 JANINE
                        That means eighty percent died.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh. I went the other way with it.  

                                 JANINE
                        This isn’t a joke.

                                 DEAN
                        I’m not joking. I seriously went 
                        the other way with it.

                                 JANINE
                        If you guys wanna succeed, you have 
                        to stop making decisions, say, a 
                        head trauma patient would make, and 
                        start making decisions a parent 
                        would make.  
                                 JOHN 
                        We’ll take that into consideration.

                                 JANINE
                        That’s not good enough.

                                 DEAN
                        We’ll heavily consider it.

                                 JANINE 
                        You know what? This baby is inside 
                        of me. And that means I have some 
                        say in this. And if I don’t feel 
                        like you guys can handle it, I 
                        swear to God, you’ll never lay eyes 
                        on this child. Got it?  

           John and Dean nod, freaked out. Janine leaves. They stare at 
           the floor. Slowly, a look of determination comes across their 
           faces. They look at each other -- they’re on the same page. 
           John sticks his hand out. Dean puts his on top.

                                 JOHN
                        Become kick-ass Dads on 3. 1 2 3... 

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        BECOME KICK-ASS DADS!

           Art Card: Month 1

           EXT. PARK -- DAY

           John and Dean check out children playing at a playground.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, I just want to hug them all to 
                        death. I just wanna squeeze the 
                        life out of them.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, you’re gonna have to control 
                        that.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, okay.

           A ball rolls toward them. A little girl, JENNY, chases it.

                                 JOHN 
                        Hello young lady, wanna go get some 
                        ice cream?
                                 JENNY 
                        Yeah!

                                 JOHN
                        Great. Let’s go!

           The three of them start for the car. JENNY’S MOM runs up.

                                 JENNY’S MOM
                        Excuse me, what are you doing?

                                 DEAN
                        Getting ice cream. Wanna join?

                                 JENNY’S MOM
                        No. And my daughter doesn’t want to 
                        join either.

                                 DEAN
                        Actually she does want to join.

                                 JENNY
                        Mommy, I want ice cream!

                                 JOHN
                           (to mother)
                        Are we done here?

                                 JENNY’S MOM
                        Jenny, come with Mommy.

           Jenny’s Mom leads her away.

                                 JENNY 
                           (pouting)
                        I want ice cream!

                                 DEAN
                           (calling after her)
                        Jenny, if you change your mind, 
                        we’ll be in that car over there.

           They turn to a little boy.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey Sport, ice cream?

           The little boy’s mother sweeps in and carries him away.

           EXT. CAR -- DAY

           John and Dean watch the kids on the playground.
                                 JOHN
                        Can you believe the tits on that 
                        one?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, he needs to lose a few 
                        pounds. Did you know childhood 
                        obesity is the number one...

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        Gentlemen?

           They look over to find a COP at their driver side window.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh hello officer.

                                 COP
                        We’ve had a few complaints. Can I 
                        ask what you’re doing here today?

                                 JOHN
                        We’re trying to coax that little 
                        girl into our car, but her Mom’s 
                        being a real pain in the ass. So 
                        we’re just waiting for an opening.

           INT. POLICE STATION -- DAY

           FLASH:  Freeze frame on a mug shot of Dean.

           FLASH:  Freeze frame on a mug shot of John.

           CU -- a hand staples the mug shots to a report, drops it in a 
           file, and places the file in a cabinet.  The cabinet door 
           closes to reveal it’s marked: SEX OFFENDER WATCH LIST.

                                                  CUT TO:

           Janine waits as John and Dean are led out by a COP.  

                                 JOHN
                        And what is your badge number? 

           John looks at the cop’s badge and writes the number down.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        248726. Great, see you in court. Or 
                        should I say sue you in court. And 
                        please give that message to...

                        Janine, thanks for picking us up. 
                        We called the guy at the video 
                        store, but he’s on a double shift. 

                                 JANINE
                        Glad you took what I said to heart.  

                                 JOHN
                        We did! We took it very to heart!

                                 DEAN
                        Extremely to heart!

                                 JANINE
                        Okay, but you guys can’t just 
                        practice on someone else’s kid. 

                                 JOHN
                        How’re we supposed to prepare then? 
                        We need vital, hands-on parenting 
                        practice and we need it now!

                                 DEAN
                        We’ve only got nine months left on 
                        this thing! 

                                 JANINE
                        I don’t know. Get a doll or 
                        something.

           Dean and John look to each other -- not a bad idea.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John holds a baby doll.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, close your eyes.  No peeking.

           Dean shuts his eyes. John takes the doll into his room and 
           soon reappears without the doll. He takes out a stopwatch.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Okay, ready, set...Oh my God, Dean, 
                        where’s the baby? GO GO GO GO GO!

           John starts the stopwatch. Dean furiously searches the room -- 
           under the couch, behind curtains, around Dad’s machines.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Fifteen seconds!
           Dean searches the kitchen -- cabinets, fridge, oven.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Thirty seconds!

           Dean searches John’s bedroom -- closet, laundry hamper, bed.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Forty-five seconds!  Come on GO GO!

           Dean searches the bathroom -- tub, sink, toilet. He lifts the 
           toilet reservoir tank to find Frannie submerged in water.

                                 DEAN
                        How’d you get in here, lil’ rascal? 

           Dean cradles the dripping doll lovingly in his arms.

                                 JOHN
                        Fifty-four seconds.  

                                 DEAN
                        Nice!

                                 JOHN
                        No, I think it died.

                                 DEAN
                        Crap. 

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John and Dean, holding tools, admire something offscreen. 

                                 JOHN
                        Now that’s what I call a crib.

           Reveal the crib: basically a small coffin-like box with a few 
           airholes drilled into the sides and a heavy wooden lid.

                                 DEAN
                        It’s beautiful. But does it work?

                                 JOHN
                        I don’t know, wanna try it out?

                                                  CUT TO:

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Earthquake!
           John and Dean throw a seemingly endless barrage of glass 
           items at the crib: empty bottles, glass figurines, ashtrays, 
           vases, etc. They cap it off with a bowling ball. Once out of 
           items, they remove the lid to find the doll safely inside.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh, baby survived it’s first 
                        natural disaster! 

           Dean notices something in the crib: a shard of glass.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Well, back to the drawing board.

                                 JOHN
                        Not completely back to the drawing 
                        board. I think we’ll be fine if we 
                        just seal up a few of the airholes.

                                 DEAN
                        Damn, you’re good.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John enters to find Tara tending to Dad.  He watches her 
           longingly as she empties Dad’s bedpan.

                                 JOHN
                        Hey Tara, what are you up to?

                                 TARA
                        Just changing your Dad’s bedpan.

                                 JOHN 
                        Good deal... you hungry at all?

                                 TARA
                        Starving.

                                 JOHN
                        Wanna go get some food?

                                 TARA 
                        No.  

                                 JOHN
                        You and your flirtatious no’s. 
                        Here, let me get that for you.

           John reaches for the bedpan and his hand brushes against 
           hers.  The touch is magical... for him. Tara hurries out. 
           When she’s safely gone, John locks the door, lifts the bedpan 
           to his nose and takes a big whiff.
                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                           (in heaven, breathy)
                        Tara...
                           (whiff, expression sours)
                        ...and Dad.

           INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL -- DAY

           Dean catches the doll and cradles it lovingly. He looks up to 
           John who stands on the floor above.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, good catch but more neck 
                        support this time. And let it know 
                        that what it did was wrong. Teach. 
                        We’re teachers. Again.

           Dean cradles the doll and runs it up the stairs.

                                 DEAN
                           (to doll)
                        No. Bad. Bad. No falling.

           He hands it to John and runs back down to his position below.

                                 JOHN 
                        Hey, what time is it?

           As Dean checks his watch, the doll whizzes by him in a blur.  
           Dean is oblivious.

                                 DEAN
                        14:38.  Oh sorry, I mean 2:38 pm.

           Dean looks up to see John, disappointed. Dean looks down and 
           sees the doll sprawled out eleven floors below.  

                                 JOHN
                        It’s not always gonna tell us when 
                        it’s gonna jump. Think about that 
                        on the retrieve. Hop to.

                                 DEAN
                        There you go again making me a 
                        better person.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, there you go again being open 
                        to improvement. You’re gonna be a 
                        great Dad.
                                 DEAN
                        You are too. I love you.

                                 JOHN
                        I love you too.

           Dean starts down the stairs.

           EXT. APARTMENT -- DAY

           Several quick cuts of John dropping the doll from the roof.  
           All of Dean’s attempts to catch it are unsuccessful.

           INT. JANINE’S APARTMENT/JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Intercut between Janine and John as they talk on the phone

                                 JOHN
                        Hi Janine, we’re in the process of 
                        installing some baby doors and we 
                        were wondering if you had any sense 
                        of the eventual size of the baby.

                                 JANINE
                        Baby doors?

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, well technically they’re dog 
                        doors. But we have three different 
                        size choices: Dachshund, Spaniel 
                        and Shepherd. What do you think?

                                 JANINE
                        I don’t think you want the baby to 
                        have open access to the hallway.

                                 JOHN
                        No, this would be on the back door 
                        which leads to the fire escape -- 
                        you know, just in case there’s a 
                        fire and we’re not around.

                                 JANINE
                        I’d say go with no doors and keep 
                        the baby with you at all times.

                                 JOHN 
                        Okay. Say hi to James for us.

                                 JANINE
                        James, hi from John and Dean.

           Behind Janine, James makes a “jerking off” gesture.
                                 JANINE (cont’d)

                                 JOHN
                        Call you tomorrow.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John holds the doll. There’s a diaper on it.

                                 JOHN
                        Uh-oh looks like someone’s diaper’s 
                        full. Dean, wanna do the honors?

                                 DEAN
                           (bummed)
                        Okay. I knew we’d have to cover 
                        this at some point.

           Dean lays the football down, unwraps the diaper and grimaces 
           as he inspects the contents. He then looks up excitedly.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Oh my God. It crapped out like five 
                        dollars in quarters! What the hell?

                                 JOHN
                        I thought it would be a good idea 
                        to condition our brains to view the 
                        diaper changing process as a 
                        positive experience.

                                 DEAN
                        Brilliant.

                        That’s not all.

           Dean sifts through the popcorn to make a horrific discovery.  

                                 DEAN
                        Aah!

           Dean jumps and the diaper goes flying.

           CU -- a dead bird on the carpet with popcorn all around it.

                                 DEAN  (cont’d)
                        What the hell? I was just starting 
                        to get comfortable with it.

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, I noticed.

                                 DEAN
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s important to be comfortable, 
                        but not too comfortable.

                                 DEAN
                           (offended)
                        Oh, so I’m too comfortable now?

                        Look Dean, this is not a game! 
                        We’re gonna see some shit the likes

           John gets in carrying the doll in a Baby Bjorn to find Tara.

                        Sorry, I have to be very quiet 
                        right now. It’s sleeping. Hi.

           Tara rolls her eyes. They ride on in silence.

           Dean has his eyes closed.

                        Okay, react to the situation!

           Dean opens his eyes to find the doll holding an axe. In 
           addition, it’s surrounded by knives, scissors, etc. 

                                 DEAN

           Dean opens his eyes. The doll holds a sign that reads: “I’m 
           hungry. Feed me from this stainless steel bottle.”

                        Oh, poor little thing. Are you 
                        hungry? Well, then let’s feed you.

           Dean grabs the bottle and starts feeding the doll.

                        Hey Dean, have you seen any

                        Hm. Because I was just using some 
                        to clean the driveway and I had 
                        some extra so I put it...

                        my God, you’re feeding the baby 
                        sulfuric acid. React! React! 

                                 DEAN
                        Bad baby! No!

           Dean grabs a cup of water and pours it over the doll’s face.

                                 JOHN
                        Water won’t help! It’s an acid! You

                        all the time.

                        Look, the goal of parenting is not 
                        to get as little sulfuric acid on 
                        the baby’s face as possible. It’s

                        Oh, we made that. It’s a crib. And 
                        right above it is our glass 
                        figurine collection.

                        Don’t worry, the crib has a roof.

           He holds up the roof. A few nails poke through the underside.

           Janine is lying on the floor surrounded by four boomboxes, 
           each playing a different classical tune.

                                 JANINE
                        So why are we doing this again?
                                 JOHN
                        In one of our books, it says that 
                        playing classical music to the womb 
                        helps with the baby’s cognitive 
                        what-not. 

                                 DEAN 
                        And obviously, four times the 
                        classical music, four times the 
                        cognitive what-not.

                                 JANINE 
                        You’ve been doing research, huh?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah. Every night we read 
                        different pregnancy books. Well, I 
                        read them to Dean. He gets a little 
                        freaked out by some of those 
                        pictures. And I’m kinda into them.  

                                 DEAN
                        Kinda way into them. 

           Janine sees a soiled diaper on the table. She picks it up.

                                 JANINE
                        Doing some diaper training, I see.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, that’s Snickers.

                                 JANINE
                        It doesn’t smell like Snickers.

                                 DEAN
                        No. Snickers is the name of our 
                        neighbor’s dog.

           Janine, disgusted, drops the diaper and looks at the crib.

                                 JANINE 
                        You moved the glass collection?

                                 JOHN
                        Yep. Right over there.

           same shoddy shelves. There’s a safety net above his head.

                        And that’s not all. We’ve been 
                        researching safety ratings on baby 
                        toys, interviewing lactation

                        Yeah, not a lot of hope. Like a 
                        small window of hope. Very small. 
                        And it’s closing a little bit every 
                        second. Oh, it just closed. Sorry, 
                        I guess there’s no hope for you.

           They move over to the doctor’s desk and take seats.

                                 DEAN
                        Now should we be concerned at all 
                        that we only saw one eye?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        No. I’m sure the other eye’s fine.

                                 DEAN
                        How sure? 100 percent?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        I suppose anything’s possible...

                                 DEAN
                        So there’s at least a small chance 
                        that we’re dealing with a cyclops?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Well, a cyclops is a mythical 
                        creature. So no.

                                 DEAN

                        Tara, great news: the ultrasound 
                        went great so we’re gonna go to a 
                        celebration movie. And here’s more 
                        great news: Janine’s offered to 
                        watch Dad so you can come with us!

                                 TARA
                        No thanks. I have a book I want to 
                        finish.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, then I’ll stay here with you 
                        and help you finish your book.

                                 TARA
                        No, please, go see the movie.

                                 JOHN
                        You sure? I’ll hold your hand on 
                        the way to, and during the movie?

                                 TARA
                        No, you... just go.

                                 JOHN
                        Okay, Janine, looks like you’re 
                        back in. Shall we?

                                 JANINE
                        Uh, I have to use the restroom. 
                        I’ll meet you down in the car.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh okay. Goodbye Tara.

           Tara forces a smile. John exits.

                                 JANINE 
                        You know, it would really mean a 
                        lot to him if you went to the 
                        movie. I can stay here for you.

                                 TARA
                        Uh, no thanks.

                                 JANINE
                        Look, I know you probably think 
                        they’re just a couple of losers.

                                 JANINE(cont'd)
                        I mean, I thought so too at first. 
                        But once you get to know them, 
                        they’re really pretty good guys. 
                        And sure they do some weird stuff 
                        sometimes. Actually, all the time.  
                        But their hearts are in the right 
                        place. So what do you say?

                                 TARA
                        You know, you’re right.

                                 JANINE
                        You’ll go to the movie?

                                 TARA
                        No, I think they’re just a couple 
                        of losers.

                                 JANINE
                        Oh... okay. Enjoy your book.

           CU -- the baby monitor. It’s still on.

           INT. SUPRA -- NIGHT

           Dean sits there, eyes wide. He turns the monitor off.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           John, Dean, Janine and James stand at Dad’s bedside. 

                                 JOHN 
                        Dad, this is James -- the man we 
                        keep telling you about. You know, 
                        the one that we kind of had trouble 
                        getting to know at first but that 
                        we now feel very deep feelings of 
                        affection for and are starting to 
                        feel like those feelings are 
                        reciprocated? You know, that guy?

           James gives them a look.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Your visit is a wonderful surprise 
                        to him, James.

                                 DEAN
                        I have a little surprise too. As 
                        you know, the past months have been 
                        very emotional and I’ve been filled 
                        with an abnormal amount of song. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEAN(cont'd)
                        So I got out the old guitar and 
                        well, this is for you, Dad. It’s 
                        called “Cradle of Joy.”

           John looks excitedly at Janine and James. A song! Dean grabs 
           a guitar and strums a long acoustic intro.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                           (singing)
                        Craaaaaaaadle of joy/Cradle of 
                        joooooooooooy/Cradle.

           Dean strums a long guitar outro and it’s over.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, uh, that was... nice. 

                                 DEAN
                        I haven’t finished it yet. 

                                 JANINE
                        Well, it sure is headed in a 
                        fruitful direction. Don’t you 
                        think, James?

                                 JAMES 
                        Hell yeah. There is definitely a 
                        fruit involved in that song.

                                 DEAN
                        Thank you. Since you liked that one 
                        so much I actually have a few more. 
                        Bear with me, these are a little 
                        less developed. This first one’s 
                        called “Caring Hands of Love.”

           Dean starts a very long acoustic intro. Pan across John very 
           excited, Janine feigning interest and James hating life.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Dean lifts a shirt from a huge shirt pile and sews a strip of 
           velcro onto it with a sewing machine. John walks out of his 
           room with his shirt hanging open and his pants unbuttoned.

                                 DEAN
                        Good morning.

                                 JOHN
                        So what can you tell me about this?

           John tries to button his shirt but can’t -- no buttons.
                                 DEAN 
                        Yeah, all of our buttons are in a 
                        padlocked container in the closet.  
                        Don’t worry, you’ll have access.  
                        I’m getting a key made for you.

                                 JOHN
                        And why are our buttons in lock-up?

                                 DEAN
                        John, stray buttons are just as 
                        dangerous as a loaded gun. But 
                        instead of firing bullets, they 
                        fire choking hazard.

                                 JOHN
                        And our shoelaces?

                                 DEAN
                        Where do I start? Hanging hazard.  
                        Autoerotic asphyxiation risk -- 
                        unlikely with an infant, but better 
                        safe than sorry. And Velcro 
                        eliminates that risk.

                                 JOHN 
                        Smart. That’s thinking like a Dad.  

           Dean notices something on John’s chest.  

                                 DEAN
                        What is that?

           John opens his shirt to reveal a large flowery “Tara” tattoo.  

                                 JOHN
                        Got this a couple months ago. It’s 
                        one of those temporary ones. It 
                        comes off after a few laser 
                        sessions.

                                 DEAN
                        John, about Tara...

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, things are going so great with 
                        us. Can you believe how much time 
                        she’s been spending over here?

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, but most of the time, you’re 
                        not even here.
                                 JOHN
                        But my stuff is. Look, it’s a real 
                        old fashioned courtship. I don’t 
                        expect you to understand.

                                 DEAN
                        I need to tell you something.

                                 JOHN
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        Oh... nothing. Wanna help me finish 
                        baby-proofing the house?

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s do it.

           MUSIC IN: “ST. ELMO’S FIRE”  BY JOHN PARR

           Quick shots of John and Dean putting combination locks on 
           doors, cabinets, drawers, trash compactor, fridge, laundry 
           hamper, toilet seat, closets, etc. When they’re done, they 
           stand in the center of the room -- everywhere you look, there 
           is a combination lock -- they nod approvingly to one another.

           INT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Dean’s eyes are closed. He hums.  

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        Dean, where’s the baby? GO!

           Dean opens his eyes. He gets up and walks straight into 
           John’s room, opens the hamper, removes a towel, lifts the 
           baby and cradles it. John stops the stopwatch and looks up as 
           if he’s seen a ghost.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)

           Quick cuts of John dropping the doll from the roof. Dean 
           catches it -- each time in increasingly spectacular fashion. 
           Dean looks up to John and nods coolly. John nods coolly back.  
           They’re ready.

           Janine holds Dad’s hand to her belly.

                                 JANINE
                        Did you feel that?
                           (to her belly)
                        Come on, do it again for Grandpa.

                                 DEAN/JOHN
                        Surprise!

           Dean and John give Janine a wrapped present.

                                 JANINE 
                        Oh, you didn’t have to do this.

           Janine unwraps it to find a framed picture of the ultrasound.

                                 JANINE (cont’d)
                        Thank you. That’s very sweet.

                                 JOHN
                        No, thank you. To do what you’ve 
                        done for us is just amazing. I 
                        mean, we’re already so attached to 
                        this baby. And here you’ve had it 
                        inside of you for eight months. I 
                        can’t imagine how attached you must 
                        be at this point. This thing is a 
                        part of you. And the fact that in 
                        like two weeks, it’s gonna come out 
                        of you and immediately be placed in 
                        our arms for the rest of it’s life 
                        almost doesn’t seem fair. I can see 
                        now why so many surrogates want to 
                        keep the babies after going through 
                        this process. Anyway thanks.

                                 DEAN
                        And I just want to add that you’re 
                        very brave. Because you could, and 
                        this would be unlikely, but you 
                        could stop creating eggs or 
                        something. And knowing there’s even 
                        a chance that this could be your 
                        only child and you’re giving it to 
                        us? Well, it takes a very strong, 
                        very special person to give that 
                        gift. A framed picture of the thing 
                        you’re giving up is the least we 
                        could do. Thanks.
                                 JANINE
                           (hopeful)
                        Well, I’m happy to come by if you 
                        ever need any help or anything.

                                 JOHN
                           (not getting it)
                        That’s a generous offer but you’ve 
                        done more than enough. We’ll take 
                        it from here. Group hug?

           The three of them hug. Janine looks devastated. As soon as 
           she’s out of sight, her mind starts to race. 

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           Dean walks out of his room, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.  
           He goes to a cabinet, dials in the numbers to the combination 
           lock, opens the cabinet and grabs a bowl. He then moves a few 
           cabinets over and goes through the same process with another 
           lock. Once opened, he grabs a cereal box. Then he goes to the 
           lock on the utensils drawer, opens it and gets a spoon. Then 
           he goes to the fridge, dials the combo, but it won’t open.

                                 DEAN
                        John, what’s the combination to the 
                        fridge?

                                 JOHN (O.S.)
                        34 left, 12 right, 18 left.

           Dean dials the combo, opens the lock, removes the chain 
           looped around the handles, finally gets the door open and 
           grabs some milk. He then brings all the items to the table 
           and fixes a bowl of cereal. As he’s doing this, he sees a 
           note shoved under the front door. He unfolds it to find 
           Janine’s check inside -- the word “VOID” is written on it.

                                 DEAN 
                        John?  You better come out here!  

           John enters. Dean hands him the check and the note. 

                                 JOHN
                        Dear John and Dean, I guess I 
                        should start by saying what great 
                        fathers I think you’re gonna be. I 
                        never thought I’d say that and mean 
                        it. But after months of seeing your 
                        hard work and dedication, I 
                        realized just how badly you want 
                        it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN(cont'd)
                        Unfortunately, last night, you made 
                        me realize just how badly I want it 
                        too. It kills me to write this, but 
                        I’ve decided to keep the baby. I 
                        hope one day you’ll forgive me. 
                        Janine... Oh my God.

           Dean and John look to one another and then race for the door.

                        Wait a minute.  Hold up.

           “ST. ELMO’S FIRE”  OUT.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        We should probably get Tara to 
                        watch Dad.

                                 JOHN
                        Good call.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           The brothers pound on 12G. Tara opens the door in a bathrobe.

                                 JOHN 
                        Well hello there. Showering, huh?

                                 TARA
                        Uh, yeah.

                                 JOHN
                        Awesome. How was it?

                                 TARA
                        Fine.

                                 JOHN
                        Awesome.

           Dean gives John a look.

                                 DEAN
                        Tara, could you watch our Dad for a 
                        while? Janine took off.

                                 TARA
                        Oh sure, I’ll go right over.
                                 JOHN
                        Looks like someone just earned 
                        herself a coupon for a “thank you 
                        massage.” Wanna redeem it tonight?

                                 TARA
                        No.

                                 JOHN
                        Wanna nail down another night?

                                 DEAN
                        John, come on!

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go!

           MUSIC IN:  “ST. ELMO’S FIRE” BY JOHN PARR

           John and Dean sprint down the hall.

           EXT. STREET -- DAY

           The Supra races down the street.

           EXT. JANINE’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           The brothers race to Janine’s door and knock. No answer. They 
           look in the window. Everything’s gone. They run off.

           EXT. JAMES’ HOUSE -- DAY

           The Supra pulls up and the brothers run to the house. Again, 
           everything’s gone. They get back in the car and drive away.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           The brothers enter, depressed. 

                                 DEAN
                        So what do we do now?

           SFX: toilet flush

           Tara walks out of the bathroom.

                                 TARA
                        Hey. Did you find her?

                                 JOHN
                        No. But that is so thoughtful of 
                        you to ask. Isn’t it, Dean?
                                 DEAN
                        Sure.

                                 JOHN
                        So very thoughtful. You know, if 
                        that thoughtful attitude you just 
                        displayed was the attitude of the 
                        world, there’d be no war. 

                                 TARA
                        Okay. Well I gotta go.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, you have yourself a fantastic 
                        whatever-you’re-doing and a great 
                        whatever-you’re-doing-after-that.

           Tara nods and leaves.

                                 DEAN 
                        How can you be so nonchalant about 
                        this?

                                 JOHN
                        Because I know this is gonna work 
                        out. And I know that if it doesn’t, 
                        we still have other options.

                                 DEAN 
                        We have dick!

                                 JOHN
                        No, we do not have dick. We have 
                        Tara! Well, I have Tara.  

                                 DEAN
                        Tara?

                                 JOHN
                        That’s right. It’s about time I 
                        took this thing with Tara to the 
                        next level.

                                 DEAN
                        John...

                                 JOHN 
                        Maybe we could adopt or I could go 
                        back to the fertility clinic and... 

                                 DEAN 
                        John, stop.
                                 JOHN
                        Miracles are happening every day in 
                        the field of fertility and all Tara 
                        and I need to do is train my sperm 
                        to...

                                 DEAN 
                        She’s not into you, John. Can’t you 
                        see that?  

                                 JOHN
                        You are so jealous of what we have.

                                 DEAN 
                        Jealous of what you have? I already 
                        have what you have: no 
                        relationship.  

                                 JOHN
                           (condescending)
                        I have a tattoo of her name on my 
                        chest -- oh, I think there’s a 
                        relationship.

                                 DEAN
                        She thinks you’re a loser John!

                                 JOHN 
                        Oh really? And how did you come up 
                        with your expert analysis? From 
                        your combined total of five hours 
                        of relationship experience?

                                 DEAN 
                        Because I heard her say it! 

                                 JOHN
                           (a long beat)
                        What?

                                 DEAN
                        I overheard Tara talking to Janine.  
                        She thinks you’re a loser. She 
                        thinks we’re both losers. And you 
                        know what, maybe she’s right.  
                        Maybe they’re all right. We’re both 
                        friggin’ losers. And that’s the way 
                        it’s always been and that’s the way 
                        it’s always gonna be.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah, I’ve always been such a 
                        loser. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN(cont'd)
                        What a huge loser I was when I was 
                        voted our school’s goddamn 
                        homecoming king!

                                 DEAN
                        We were homeschooled!

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, you’re just upset because I 
                        beat you!

                                 DEAN
                        You tied me!

                                 JOHN
                        And I won the tiebreaker!

                                 DEAN
                        Under protest! That’s the first 
                        time I’d ever touched a Rubix Cube! 

                                 JOHN
                        The point is, I won.

                                 DEAN
                        Fine. You won. You’re less of a 
                        loser than me. But you’re still a 
                        loser!

                                 JOHN 
                        Well, if I’m such a loser, maybe 
                        you’d be better off without me.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, maybe I would.

                                 JOHN
                        Good. I could find her faster on my 
                        own anyway.

                                 DEAN
                        I certainly wouldn’t want to slow 
                        you down.

                                 JOHN 
                        Then maybe I should get the hell 
                        out of here.

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, maybe you should.

                                 JOHN
                        Have a nice life.
           John storms out.

           EXT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           The Supra pulls out of the garage and onto the street.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Dean watches brokenhearted as the Supra drives off.  

           INT. SUPRA -- NIGHT

           John drives in anger. He punches at the steering wheel.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

           Dean grabs a bottle of tequila from the cabinet and downs it.

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- NIGHT

           The Supra pulls over and skids to a halt. John gets out, 
           opens his wallet, takes out a picture of Dean, looks at it 
           forlornly and then tears it to pieces.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

           Quick cuts of Dean grabbing all of John’s earthly belongings:  
           clothes, posters, trophies, skis, high school diploma. 

           Dean putting glass items from their glass collection into a 
           bag. The unstable shelving collapses and hundreds of glass 
           items fall into the safety net above their father’s head.

                                 DEAN
                        Goddamn you, John! Are you trying 
                        to kill him?

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- NIGHT

           CU -- The torn pieces of Dean’s picture. A stream of urine 
           blasts it away. Widen to see John pissing on the picture.

           EXT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT COURTYARD -- NIGHT

           Dean pours lighter fluid on John’s stuff and lights it on 
           fire. As it burns, Dean guzzles tequila.

           INT. SUPRA -- NIGHT

           John screams angrily at the night.
           EXT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT COURTYARD-- NIGHT

           CU -- Dean’s eyes: the fire burning in their reflection.

           Dean staggers around and then stumbles to the ground and 
           drunkenly watches the blaze.

           INT. SUPRA -- MORNING

           John wakes up and squints at the sunlight. He fires up the 
           Supra and gets back on the road.

           EXT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT COURTYARD-- MORNING

           Dean wakes up to find an old woman picking through John’s 
           burnt belongings.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        I assume you’re giving this shirt 
                        away. It’s partially burnt. I wanna 
                        use the fabric to make a purse.

           Dean nods. She picks up a burnt picture of Dean and John.

                                 OLD WOMAN (cont’d)
                        Who’s this? Your brother?

                                 DEAN
                           (melodramatic)
                        I don’t have a brother.

           Dean gets up and stumbles toward his apartment.

           INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY

           John -- mussed hair, five o’clock shadow -- talks to a NURSE.

                                 NURSE
                        Sorry sir, nobody’s checked in 
                        under the names Janine or Rice. 

                                 JOHN
                        Damn it!

                                 NURSE
                        You checked Queensburg Hospital?

                                 JOHN
                        Queensburg, Mount Freeman, Olympia, 
                        I’ve checked everywhere. Look, can 
                        you get me a list of addresses for 
                        all the women who have come in here 
                        in the past few days?
                                 NURSE
                        That’s confidential information.

                                 JOHN 
                        Oh, I see. Then... 1 2 3 SHOTGUN!  
                        Looks like you’re getting that 
                        list.

                                 NURSE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JOHN
                        I called shotgun. 

                                 NURSE
                        Sir, I’m very busy here. If you 
                        could just step aside. Thank you.

           John walks away dejectedly.

           INT. DR. SPENCER’S OFFICE -- DAY

           Dr. Spencer consults with a husband and wife.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Sorry. I’m afraid you’re looking at 
                        a little Down’s Syndrome action.

           The wife tears up. The husband picks up a chair and throws it 
           through the window in frustration. Dean pops his head in.

                                 DEAN 
                        Sorry to barge in. You haven’t seen 
                        Janine around, have you?

           Dr. Spencer shakes his head.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Damn.
                           (noticing broken window, 
                            to husband and wife)
                        Congratulations.

           Dean ducks out. The husband consoles his wife.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

           Dean walks down the hallway, stops, sticks his hand out and 
           places his other hand on top of it.

                                 DEAN 
                        Keep focussed and don’t worry about 
                        the dead end on 3. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DEAN(cont'd)
                        1 2 3 keep focussed and don’t worry 
                        about the dead end!

           Dean throws his hands in the air.  

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        It’s not the same.

           Dean walks by and pauses when he sees the entrance to the 
           hospital’s baby nursery.

           INT. HOSPITAL BABY NURSERY -- DAY

           John stands with his face pressed against the window. The 
           babies are so cute, he can’t help but smile. 

                                 DEAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        John?

                                 JOHN
                           (immediately)
                        Dean?

           He turns to see an OLDER GENTLEMAN coming to visit a NEW DAD. 
           The older gentleman’s voice is eerily similar to Dean’s.

                                 NEW DAD
                        Dad!  

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        Congratulations!

           John watches the men hug. A single tear rolls down his cheek.  

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

           Dean walks out the exit of the hospital. A moment later, John 
           walks out of the baby nursery and out the same exit -- 
           neither is aware of the other.

           EXT. PARK -- DAY

           Dean wails uncontrollably. After a while, his sobs start to 
           taper off. After a final plaintive sigh, he looks to the sky.

                                 DEAN
                        Please God, what am I supposed to 
                        do? Just give me a sign!

           Nothing happens. Dean lets out a few more sobs and then looks 
           to his left.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Hi.
           Reveal a slightly freaked out couple on the bench. They nod 
           politely. Dean gets up and dejectedly walks away.

           EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER -- DAY

           CU -- the torn up picture of Dean, painstakingly taped back 
           together. Widen to reveal John admiring it with tears in his 
           eyes. John looks over the railing at the scattered garbage 
           below when his eyes stop on something: an old doll head.

                                 JOHN
                           (whispering to himself)
                        Dean.

           John jumps into the Supra and peels out.

           EXT. SIDEWALK -- DAY

           Dean mopes along when he suddenly comes upon a dead bird 
           surrounded by popcorn.  

                                 DEAN 
                           (whispering to himself)
                        John.

           Dean shakes his head and heads for home.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT

           Dean enters and goes to his Dad. As he stands over him, he 
           notices a weird sound -- a running shower. 

           INT. BATHROOM

           Dean walks into the bathroom.

                                 DEAN 
                        That’s strange, my shower’s 
                        running. It’s strange because I 
                        live alone.

           Reveal John on the other side of the shower curtain. He shuts 
           his eyes and smiles.  He can’t believe it’s really happening.  

           Intercut between John in the shower and Dean outside it.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Can I ask what you’re doing here?
                                 JOHN
                        I saw a sign out front that said 
                        “room for rent: wanted, one bull-
                        headed brother who sometimes sticks 
                        his foot in his mouth.”

                                 DEAN 
                        Well, sorry to say, someone already 
                        came in here who fits that bill. 

                                 JOHN
                        Who’s that?

                                 DEAN
                        You’re talking to him.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s too bad. Think there might 
                        be enough room for me to crash here 
                        until I find another place?

                                 DEAN
                        I don’t know. How long we talking?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh, the rest of my life.

                                 DEAN
                        How much you willing to pay?

                                 JOHN
                        All the money in the world. Come 
                        here you.

           John gets out of the shower and gives Dean a big hug.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Oh my God, I missed you so much. 

                                 DEAN
                        I missed you too! 
                           (beat, still hugging)
                        Hey, could I get you to throw on a 
                        towel or something?

                                 JOHN
                        Oh yeah, sure.

           John puts on a towel.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        How’s this?
                                 DEAN
                        Great. Thank you.

           They hug again.

                                 JOHN 
                        Oh, I will never ever let you out 
                        of my sight again. 

                                 DEAN
                        I burned all your shit.

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll buy more shit.

                                 DEAN 
                        You know, you’re pretty amazing. 

                                 JOHN
                        I’m amazing? Take a look in the 
                        mirror. There’s not a man on this 
                        earth I’d rather have a baby with.  

                                 DEAN
                        Yeah, well, maybe one day.

                                 JOHN
                        No... maybe now.

                                 DEAN
                        What do you mean?

                                 JOHN
                        Our baby is out there and we still 
                        have a chance to get it. Now are we 
                        just gonna sit here or are we gonna 
                        do something about it?

                                 DEAN 
                        We’re gonna do something about it!

                                 JOHN
                        Hands in. Quickly towel off, get 
                        dressed and come up with a plan to 
                        find Janine on 3. 1 2 3... 

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Quickly towel off, get dressed and 
                        come up with a plan to find Janine!

           They throw their hands in the air.

           MUSIC IN:  “ST. ELMO’S FIRE” BY JOHN PARR
           They run out of the room and into their respective bedrooms. 
           Quick shots of the following: John toweling off. Dean 
           toweling off his fully clothed body. John throwing on a pair 
           of pants. Dean removing his pants and then putting them back 
           on. They run out of their respective rooms at exactly the 
           same time and then head for the door.

                                 JOHN 
                        Wait a minute. Hold up.

                        We need to get Tara to watch Dad.

                                 DEAN
                        Oh yeah. Look, I’ll do it.

                                 JOHN
                        No. This is something I have to do. 

                                 DEAN
                        Are you sure?

                                 JOHN 
                        Yeah. I’m sure.

           INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY -- DAY

           Dean walks down the hall. John waits until Dean’s in the 
           elevator and then knocks on Tara’s door -- she answers it.

                                 JOHN
                        Tara, can you watch our Dad for us?

                                 TARA
                        Yeah, I guess.

                                 JOHN
                        Great, thanks!

           John turns to go.

                                 TARA
                        Wait, that’s it?

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah. Why?

                                 TARA
                        You’re not gonna ask me to dinner 
                        or anything?
           John thinks for a long beat.

                                 JOHN
                        Well, dinner does sound good... but 
                        no. Oh, and also, I’m over you. 
                        Burn! Facial! Suck it!  
                           (immediately considerate)
                        Thanks for watching Dad!

           John races down the hall triumphantly.

           EXT. DEAN AND JOHN’S APARTMENT -- DAY

           John runs out to find Dean waiting for him by the Supra. Dean 
           looks to John. John gives him an assured nod -- he’s fine.

                                 DEAN
                        I’m proud of you.

                                 JOHN 
                        That pride is my lifeblood.
                           (beat)
                        So let’s gameplan.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, between the two of us, we’ve 
                        already searched like every place 
                        she would logically be. 

                                 JOHN
                        She could be anywhere. God, I just 
                        wish there was some way we could 
                        communicate with her and say 
                        exactly what we wanted to say in a 
                        way in which she wouldn’t feel 
                        threatened.

                                 DEAN
                        Fortune cookies?

                                 JOHN
                        Interesting idea, but...

                                 DEAN
                        Flyers?

                                 JOHN
                        You’re on the right track. But I 
                        don’t think we’ve hit it yet. 
           Suddenly, in the background, a plane flies through the sky 
           towing a banner: “Eat At Luigi’s -- Fine Italian Cuisine”

           Dean and John look at each other.

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Oh my God!/Let’s go!

           EXT. LUIGI’S -- DAY

           Dean and John walk out rubbing their bellies.

                                 DEAN
                        What a great and delicious idea!

                                 JOHN
                        Well, your engine can’t run at 
                        optimum capability if there’s no 
                        gas in the tank. 
                           (then)
                        So where were we? There must be 
                        some way to relay our message to 
                        her. But how?

           Another plane flies in the background towing a banner: “Your 
           Ad Here.” They look up to the plane and then to each other.

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Oh my god!/I got it!

                                 JOHN 
                        It was right in front of our faces 
                        the whole time! 

                                 DEAN
                        Yep! I got there a fraction of a 
                        second after you. It’s so obvious.

                                 JOHN
                        Let’s go!

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell does an apple orchard 
                        have to do with anything?

                                 DEAN
                        Wait, what were you thinking?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ll explain on the way. Let’s go!

           INT. ADVERTISING OFFICE - DAY

           The brothers stand at a counter with an AD GUY. Behind him is 
           a picture of a plane towing a banner: “Your Ad Here”

                                 JOHN
                        So how many people will be able to 
                        see this thing?

                                 AD GUY
                        If we run it over a crowded beach 
                        on a nice day -- fifty, sixty thou.

                                 JOHN
                        Great! So how much is this gonna 
                        run us?

                                 AD GUY
                        Fifty per letter.

                                 JOHN
                        Cents?

                        Jesus Christ. That’s pretty steep. 
                        Can we afford to do this?

                                 JOHN
                        Can we afford not to? Hands in.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           The brothers stand on the beach and look to the sky. It’s a 
           beautiful day. The beach is crowded.  

                                 DEAN
                        Oh my God, I think I see it.

                                 JOHN
                        Cross your fingers.

           EXT. SKY -- DAY

           A plane flies through the frame trailing a banner. We stay on 
           this shot as one continuous banner flies across the screen.  
           The message reads:

           (BOLD INDICATES RED LETTERS, NON-BOLD IS GREEN LETTERS)

           HI. MY NAME IS JOHN. AND I AM HIS BROTHER, DEAN. HI. WE HAVE 
           A LITTLE SITUATION ON OUR HANDS AND BOY COULD WE USE YOUR 
           HELP. I MEAN, THIS IS A HUGE PICKLE. HOW CAN YOU HELP? WELL, 
           SIT BACK AND RELAX, WE’RE ABOUT TO TELL YOU. YOU CAN START BY 
           GRABBING A PEN AND PAPER TO WRITE DOWN SOME INFORMATION. 
           WE’LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO GRAB THAT PEN AND PAPER. (about 
           two sentences worth of blank space on the banner and then the 
           message continues) OKAY, GREAT, NOW YOU HAVE YOUR PEN AND 
           PAPER AND ARE READY FOR THE INFORMATION PHASE. WE’RE SORRY IF 
           WE DIDN’T GIVE YOU ENOUGH TIME TO GET THE NECESSARY WRITING 
           IMPLEMENTS, BUT WE ARE UNDER SERIOUS SPACE CONSTRAINTS WITH 
           THIS SKY BANNER. WE ARE LOOKING FOR A WOMAN NAMED JANINE 
           RICE. SHE IS FIVE FOOT SIX, BROWN HAIR, AND BROWN EYES. OH, 
           THAT REALLY NARROWS IT DOWN. FINE DEAN, THEN HOW WOULD YOU 
           DESCRIBE HER? WELL, SHE JUST LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL PRETTY 
           AMERICAN WOMAN. OH, THAT’S MUCH BETTER. EXCUSE ME, I WASN’T 
           FINISHED. SHE’S LIKE -- GOD, IT’S SO HARD TO DESCRIBE PEOPLE. 
           I GUESS SHE’S LIKE A ROCKY-ERA TALIA SHIRE...

           INT. PARK -- DAY

           Janine sits by a pond writing in her journal. We see the sky 
           banner in the reflection of the pond but Janine is oblivious 
           to it. She pauses for a beat and then continues writing.

           MORE SKY BANNER:

           ...ANYWAY, JANINE IS EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS PREGNANT WITH 
           OUR BABY. WELL, FINE, DEAN’S. I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH SPERM 
           MOTILITY -- A SUBJECT DEAN LIKES TO RUB IN MY FACE. OKAY, LET 
           ME GET IN HERE FOR A SECOND. YOU MAKE ONE LITTLE JOKE ABOUT A 
           GUY’S INFERTILITY AND SUDDENLY YOU DESERVE TO BE LABELED A 
           JERK ON A SKY BANNER THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SEEN BY 50,000 
           PEOPLE? THAT’S BULLSHI--

           A woman covers her young son’s eyes.

           EXT. SKY -- DAY

           The banner continues.

           --T. DEAN, NONE OF THAT MATTERS RIGHT NOW. WHAT MATTERS MOST 
           IS FOR JANINE TO SEE THIS MESSAGE. ESPECIALLY THIS NEXT PART. 
           SO FOR THOSE OF YOU READING THIS, WE NEED TO ASK YOU FOR JUST 
           ONE MORE FAVOR. JUST IN CASE JANINE HAS HER BACK TURNED OR 
           SOMETHING AND CAN’T SEE THE SIGN, IT WOULD REALLY BE A BIG 
           HELP IF WE COULD GET YOU TO YELL OUT “JANINE, LOOK IN THE 
           SKY!”...

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

           John and Dean watch the sky banner. 

                                 GUY ON THE BEACH
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           They locate the yeller: some GUY ON THE BEACH who’s reading 
           the sky banner. Then from a different direction, they hear:

                                 WOMAN ON THE BEACH
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           They locate the second yeller: some WOMAN ON THE BEACH 
           reading the banner. They scan the beach and make a discovery 
           that blows them away: every man, woman and child on the beach 
           is looking skyward. Soon, from all around them:

                                 BEACH-GOERS
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           Dean and John look to each other. Maybe it’s working.

           EXT. GAS STATION -- DAY

           The Video Store Clerk looks in the sky as he gasses his car.

                                 VIDEO STORE CLERK
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           Dr. Wong looks in the sky.

           EXT. SIDEWALK -- DAY

           An ASIAN MAN looks into the sky.

                                 DR. WANG
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           Another subtitle: You know, the dentist who suggested all the 
           medical books 

           Another subtitle: He really knows his shit

           EXT. PARK -- DAY

           Janine sits writing in her journal. There’s nobody else 
           around. Complete silence, until:

                                 MAN’S VOICE
                           (very faintly)
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           Janine looks around. Did someone say her name? She must have 
           been mistaken. She goes back to her writing. Then again:

                                 MAN’S VOICE (cont’d)
                           (a little louder)
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           She looks around again, sees nobody and continues writing

                                 MAN’S VOICE (cont’d)
                           (pretty loud)
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           Janine turns to see a man rounding the corner on a bike. As 
           he rides along, he continues his chant.

                                 BIKER
                        Janine, look in the sky!

           A confused Janine watches as the biker rides away. She puts 
           her journal down, stands and looks to the sky.

                                 JANINE
                        Oh my God.

           MORE SKY BANNER:

           JANINE, HOPEFULLY YOU’RE READING THIS RIGHT NOW. THERE’S SO 
           MUCH WE NEED TO TELL YOU. WE’D NEVER WANT TO COME BETWEEN YOU 
           AND THE BABY. SO WE WANT YOU TO KEEP THE BABY. 
           BUT WE WANT YOU TO KEEP US TOO. MAYBE IF WE HAD TOLD YOU THAT 
           IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU’D NEVER HAVE LEFT. HOPEFULLY WE’RE

           Dean points to the sky.

           EXT. SKY -- DAY

           Another plane flies across towing another banner which reads:

           EXT. BEACH -- DAY

                                  JOHN
                        Well, it’s out of our hands now.  
                        We should get home.

           INT. JOHN AND DEAN’S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

           John and Dean hurry to the answering machine. It’s blinking.  
           They share a look -- this could be it -- John presses play.

                        about the sky banner. 

           Dean and John engage in a high five celebration.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (cont’d)
                        I want to propose to my girlfriend 
                        and I need the phone number of the 
                        banner place. I’m at 555-1824. 
                        (beep)
           This kills the celebration. Dean and John stand there, numb.

           SFX: toilet flush

                                 JOHN 
                           (calling out)
                        Hi Tara, we’re back.
                           (to Dean)
                        She loves that bathroom.

           Dean and John go to their father. Behind them, we see the 
           bathroom door open. It’s Janine. The guys are oblivious.

                                 DEAN
                        Well, we did our best. 

                                 JOHN
                        Yep. And Dad knows that. We have 
                        nothing to be ashamed of. Hands in.

           Dean puts his hand over John’s.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Let’s see, what should we do on 
                        this one? I gotta be honest, I’m 
                        kind of stumped. I thought 
                        something would come to me. Hm.

                                 JANINE
                        How about Janine’s behind us on 3? 

                                 JOHN/DEAN
                        Oh my God./Janine!

                                 JANINE
                        Sorry, I used your bathroom. But I 
                        didn’t think you’d mind. After all, 
                        I’m peeing for four now. That is, 
                        if the offer still stands.

                                 JOHN
                        Oh my God, do you mean it?

           Janine nods. They all come together for a hug. 

                                 DEAN
                        Hey, I have a little something I’ve 
                        been saving for a special occasion. 
                        And this seems like the perfect 
                        time to crack it open because it 
                        doesn’t get more special than this. 
           Dean goes to a kitchen cabinet and opens it to reveal some 
           bottles of champagne. He starts fishing around the bottles.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                        Let’s see, where is it? I know it’s 
                        in here somewhere. 

           John leans down near Janine’s belly.

                                 JOHN
                        Hi there little one! How are you? 
                        We’ve missed you so much.

                                 DEAN (O.C.)
                        Oh, here it is.

           SFX: INSANELY LOUD AIRHORN!

           Reveal Dean holding an airhorn. Janine bolts upright.

           CU -- Janine’s legs and feet. Water splashes down.

                                 JANINE 
                        Oh my God, my water broke!

                                 DEAN
                        Awesome! We’re having a baby!

           Dean lets out a few more celebratory airhorn blasts. 

           SFX: AIRHORN!

                                 JOHN
                        Dean, put the damn airhorn down. We 
                        got a baby to birth. Let’s go!

                                 DEAN
                        Wait, what about Dad? How are we 
                        gonna get him to the hospital?

                                 JOHN
                        We’ll brainstorm on the way. Right 
                        now, Janine is our first priority!

           INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- DAY

           The brothers help Janine into the lobby. They’re met by 
           James.

                                 JAMES
                        Let me help you, baby.

           Dean stops at the front desk manned by a NURSE.

                                 DEAN
                        Can I borrow your phone please?

           The nurse hands Dean the phone. He calmly dials.

                                 DEAN (cont’d)
                           (frantic)
                        911? My father’s dying. Please go

                           (calmly, to nurse)
                        Thank you.

           He hangs up the phone and leaves.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

           Janine lies down with her legs in the stirrups as John and 
           James stand by her side. Dr. Spencer tends to her.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Her cervix is fully dilated. We 
                        can’t hold off much longer.

                                 JOHN
                        Please just wait one more minute. 
                        Come on, Janine, do not push. Pull. 
                        Come on pull for me. Hold your 
                        breath. Suck it in. Come on, let’s 
                        hold our breaths together. 

           Janine tries to hold her breath. John tries too. Finally Dean 
           enters with two ORDERLIES who wheel his Dad in on a gurney.

                                 DEAN
                        We got here as soon as we could.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Okay, let’s get this thing going!
                                 JOHN
                        Wait. Can we position our father so 
                        he can view the birth?

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Janine?

                                 JANINE
                        That’s fine. Hurry.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Okay, let’s move him around.

           POV -- between Janine’s legs. The orderlies position their 
           father so he’s got the best seat in the house.

           Dr. Spencer lifts the sheet covering Janine’s spread legs.

           CU -- father’s face. There is a very subtle change in his 
           expression. He’s clearly into it in a comatose way.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Okay, let’s do this thing.

           MUSIC IN: “ST. ELMO’S FIRE” BY JOHN PARR

           Intercut between the following: John, Dean and James coaching 
           Janine to breathe. Dr. Spencer manning the vagina. Janine 
           straining and grimacing. Dad “watching.” 

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        He’s crowning. Push Janine!

                                 JAMES/JOHN/DEAN
                        Come on baby!/You can do it!/Push!

           Janine grunts, grimaces and pushes hard.

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        The heads out.  Hm, interesting.  

           The doctor looks to them quizzically, then goes back to work. 

                                 DR. SPENCER (cont’d)
                        Okay, one more big push, Janine.  

                                 JAMES/JOHN/DEAN
                        Come on, one more!/Push!/Breathe!

           Janine gives one final push.

                                 JANINE
                        Aaaaargh!
                                 DR. SPENCER
                        There you go. You did it!  

           Janine collapses in glorious exhaustion.  John and Dean hug. 
           They turn to James who gives in and hugs them too. 

                                 DR. SPENCER (cont’d)
                        Congratulations! It’s a boy!

                                 JOHN/DEAN/JANINE/JAMES
                        A boy!/Wooooo!/Oh my God!/Shee-it! 

           James, John and Dean crowd around Janine. A nurse wraps the 
           baby in a towel and brings it to her. They all see the baby 
           and share looks.

                                 JAMES
                        Now that’s a beautiful baby.

                                 JOHN
                        Can I bring him to Dad for a 
                        second?

           Janine hands him to John who confidently but carefully picks 
           him up and brings him to his father’s gurney.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Dad, we’d like to introduce you to 
                        your grandson.

           Reveal that the baby is extremely black.  They place the baby 
           on their father’s chest and wrap his arms around the baby so 
           that he’s holding the baby.  

           CU -- father’s face. Nothing.

                                 DEAN
                        Dad, he’s got your eyes.

           Dean and John look at each other and smile.  They’ve done it.  

                                 DR. SPENCER
                        Let’s get a picture of the happy 
                        family.

           John grabs the baby.  Dean and James move Dad’s gurney by 
           Janine and they all squeeze together for a photo.

                                 DR. SPENCER (cont’d)
                        Okay, one two three!

           Freeze frame on the photo of the happy group.

           The photo morphs into a Christmas Card with the message:

           EXT. STRIP MALL -- DAY

           Amid a row of yogurt shops, shoe stores, and mini-marts is a 
           store with a sign which reads:  Solomon Family Baby Proofing.

           INT. SOLOMON FAMILY BABY PROOFING 

           John leads a man with a grocery bag to the door.

                                 JOHN
                        Thanks very much for your business.  
                        Have a good day.

           John turns the sign from OPEN to CLOSED.

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Congratulations! Another successful 
                        day in the business world, Dean.

           Dean enters with now one year old, JAMES IV, in a baby bjorn.

                                 DEAN
                        Fantastic! Can you believe it?  Our 
                        one year anniversary of being in 
                        the baby-proofing business -- who 
                        knew it would be so fulfilling, 
                        mentally challenging and 
                        financially lucrative. Yep, our 
                        lives have really turned around for 
                        the better. We live with Janine and 
                        James in a surprisingly non-
                        dysfunctional family, our son James 
                        Worthington the fourth ranked in 
                        the 97th percentile for cognitive 
                        whatnot, our financial status 
                        improves daily, and our love for 
                        each other has never been stronger.  
                        If not for the passing of Dad, this 
                        would have been the best year ever.

                                 JOHN
                        Yep. Looks like we’re gonna be just 
                        fine.

                                 DEAN
                        I got you a little present.
           Dean reaches behind his back and pulls out a “Manhole” 
           magazine. John smiles.

                                 JOHN 
                        Oh my God! You did not have to do 
                        that! Thank you!

                                 DEAN
                        Twelve more coming.

                                 JOHN
                        You got me a subscription? Is this 
                        a present for me or for you?

           They laugh. John gives Dean a lighthearted noogie. As they 
           walk into the back room, arms around each other:

                                 JOHN (cont’d)
                        Oh God, I love you.

                                 DEAN
                        I love you too.

                                 JOHN
                        Not as much as I love you.

                                 DEAN
                        I’d be willing to bet you on that.

                                 JOHN
                        Dean, I love you more. Let it go.

                                 DEAN
                        But can I...

                                 JOHN
                        No. One more word and I’m gonna 
                        come beat the hell out of you.

                                 DEAN
                           (long beat, then quickly)
                        I love you.

                                 JOHN
                        Son of a bitch! You asked for it!

           John runs after Dean.

           THE END
