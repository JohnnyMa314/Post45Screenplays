           INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - -  DAY 
           LAURA LADD ( 3 0 s )   - -  strong, smart, naturally beautiful - -  
                     sits on a couch across from an unseen THERAPIST. 

                                                LAURA 
                        I know what he does is important. 
                        Incredibly  important.  But I just 
                        don't see how he has time for any 
                        relationship, not with his job. 
                                                THERAPIST (0. S . ) 
                                Maxx, you've heard Laura.  You've 
                        heard her frustration.  How does 
                        that make you feel? 

           REVEAL SUPERHERO MAXX POWERS sitting on the couch, looking 
                     super-uncomfortable. He's ruggedly handsome and wears a 
                     red, white, and blue skin-tight costume. 

                                                MAXX

           Maxx fidgets uncomfortably. 

                                                MAXX  (CONT'D) 
                        No, I'm more a man of action. 

                                                LAURA 
                        Maxx doesn't "do" feelings.  His 
                                 whole family's like this - -  
                                 completely shut down emotionally.

                                                MAXX 
                                 Here we go . . .   this is where we 
                                 blame it on my childhood, right 
                                 Doc? 

                                                THERAPIST 
                                 We're not here to blame anyone. 
                                 But it might be useful for me to 
                                 know more about your upbringing. 

                                                MAXX 
                                       (matter of  fact) 
                                 There's not much to tell.  I was 
                                 abandoned by my  biological parents 
                                 and experimented on by my adoptive 
                                father, who also experimented on 
                                 my brother.  But that one went 
                                 horribly awry and now he's my arch- 
                                 enemy intent on killing me and 
                                destroying the world.
